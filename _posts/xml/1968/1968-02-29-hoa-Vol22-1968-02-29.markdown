<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your leave I should like to make the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As you are aware, Sir, the inauguration of the State President-elect will take place in the Groote Kerk, Cape Town, on 10th April, 1968, at 10 a.m. I am now in a position to announce further details in regard to the arrangements for the inauguration.</block>

<p>Guests attending the inauguration service by invitation, will start taking their appointed seats in the Groote Kerk at 8.45 a.m. From that time until approximately five minutes before the inauguration service will commence, there will be organ music alternated with the Stellenbosch University Choir and the Free State Youth Choir.</p>

<p>Escorted by a mounted police guard the State President-elect will leave from the entrance to his official residence in the Avenue for the Groote Kerk. As soon as the procession enters Adderley Street, it will be joined by an armoured car squadron from Wale Street, The arrival of the State President-elect at the Groote Kerk will be heralded by a fanfare. The State President-elect and his retinue will be met at the church door and escorted to their seats by Dr. J. S. Gericke. Dr. P. S. Z. Coetzee and Professor W. D. Maxwell, the three ministers of religion who will, at his request, officiate at the inauguration service. In terms of the provisions of the Constitution the Chief Justice, Dr. the Hon. L. G. Steyn, will conduct the inauguration ceremony. After the inauguration ceremony the guests will be afforded the opportunity of taking their appointed seats on the Grand Parade. Leaving the Groote Kerk the presidential procession, escorted by a mounted police guard, an armoured car squadron, and a flight of helicopters overhead, will move down Adderley Street to the fountain in the Heerengracht, back along Adderley Street as far as the Darling Street intersection, and then to the Grand Parade. The entire route will be lined with troops.</p>

<p>At the Grand Parade the procession will follow a route which will be marked down the length of the Parade and be lined with spectators on both sides. That will afford everybody, White and non-White, the opportunity of seeing the presidential procession from close by.</p>

<p>The dignitaries will be provided with seats on a dais to be erected on the Castle side of the Grand Parade. Seats will be reserved for Members of the House of Assembly, Senators, Provincial Councillors, heads of Departments and all persons whose names appear on the Table of Precedence. The State President and his retinue are expected to arrive in front of the dais on the Grand Parade at approximately 11.15 a.m., where they will be met and escorted to their seats on the dais by the hon. the Prime Minister and Mrs. Vorster.</p>

<p>The moment the State President appears on the dais, he will be saluted by a fly-past of approximately 80 aircraft. Immediately after that the hon. the Prime Minister will request the State President to deliver his message to the nation. The Defence Force, the Navy, the Air Force and the Police and their bands will take a spectacular part in the proceedings. Ample provision will be made for both Whites and non-Whites on the Grand Parade.</p>

<p>Approximately 6,500 scholars and members of youth organizations of all population groups are expected to be present and special seats will be available for the youth. Special provision is being made for the participation of non-Whites, and the band of the Coloured Corps will start playing on the Grand Parade at 8 a.m.</p>

<p>The proceedings in the church and on the Grand Parade as well as the presidential procession from the church to the Grand Parade will be covered fully by the South African Broadcasting Corporation. The Government gave serious consideration to declaring this day to be a Public holiday. Unfortunately such a step would cause the country too much disruption in the economic and industrial spheres, particularly is view of the fact that the inauguration will take place shortly after Van Riebeeck Day and just before the Easter weekend. Consequently it has been decided not to declare the day of the inauguration a public holiday.</p>

<p>There are already indications that people will be attendine the proceedings in large numbers, If on the day in question the working public have to go to their places of work in Cape Town as usual, tremendous traffic problems may be caused by the additional flow of people coming to town to see the inauguration. The <span class="col_1329-1330" refersTo="page_0687"/>Government has decided that all Government offices in Cape Town and its immediate environs will be closed in the morning.</p>

<p>An earnest appeal is now being made to businessmen and all other undertakings in the Cape Peninsula to close their businesses, if at all possible, until 12.30 p.m. on that day. Such a gesture on the part of the private sector would be highly appreciated and would greatly facilitate the arrangements for the proceedings. It would also afford the workers in the Peninsula the opportunity of seeing the presidential procession and hearing the message of the second State President of the Republic.</p>

<p>A further appeal is being made to all persons who occupy or own premises situate along the route to be followed, to decorate their buildings and so to do their share in adding lustre to the inauguration ceremony and making the day a memorable one.</p>

<p>Upon the conclusion of the proceedings on the Grand Parade, the State President, preceded by the mounted policeguard and followed by the armoured car squadron, will return to the original point of departure along Darling Street, Adderley Street, and Government Avenue.</p>

<p>Immediately after his arrival at his official residence, Westbrooke, at approximately 12.30 p.m., the State President will meet the members of the Cabinet. At 4 p.m. the State President will receive diplomatic representatives at his official residence, Westbrooke. At 8 p.m. a banquet in honour of the State President will be given by the Provincial Administration of the Cape in the Parow Town Hall.</p>

<p>On the following day, 11th April, at times still to be fixed, the State President will meet the leaders of the various non-Whites population groups in the Lady Anne Barnard Hall in the Castle.</p>

<p>I should like to convey the Government&#x2019;s gratitude to the Cape Town City Council for the cordial co-operation we have already been receiving from them.</p>

<p>Further details in regard to the arrangements will from time to time be announced through the medium of the Press and the radio by the organizing committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. J. Driessen, Secretary for Public Works.</p>

<p>Inquiries may be addressed to the organizer, Mr. M. du Preez, telephone 45-4559 or room 1409, Plein Park Building.</p>

<heading>REPORT OF COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO IMPROPER POLITICAL INTERFERENCE AND POLITICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE VARIOUS POPULATION GROUPS</heading>

<summary>(Debate resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we adjourned yesterday, I stated that a large number of people representing different organizations were against the Bill on Improper Political Interference. Bodies like the Christian Institute, the Institute of Race Relations, Tucsa and several churches are all convinced that if this Bill, or something similar, becomes law, it will hamper their organizations and they are therefore totally opposed to the Bill.</p>

<p>It was just over two years ago that <i>Die Burger</i> advocated in a leading article that the Nationalist Party should now propagate their policy among the Coloured people. The article, dated 21st May, 1965, and translated by the <i>Cape Times,</i> read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now is the time to devise a plan of campaign to spread the Nationalist policy for racial peace and co-operation amongst the people without whose support it will sink in a morass of hostility. The enemies of separate development are working hard and systematically to propagate their message, but in the provincial council elections there was not even a friend of the policy in the field. What if it had been defeated, which would possibly have happened in the prevailing atmosphere&#x003F; What right, if difficult idea, has ever gained ground at the outset&#x003F; One thing we know: Separate development will not gain ground amongst the Coloureds and Indians without a bitterly hard struggle on all levels, but above all, in the field amongst the people concerned.</block>

<p><i>Die Burger,</i> the political organ of the Nationalist Party, did not then think, and that was after the provincial council elections, that it was wrong to take part in elections for Coloured people, but strongly advocated it. In fact, on many occasions Nationalists stood as independents in elections for Coloured representatives. We all know the results. What the results would have been if they stood as Nationalists instead of under the cloak of independents, we can well imagine. The fact that the commission reported that the Bill in its present form should not be proceeded with, and the fact that it could not produce an alternative Bill, is surely proof that they saw the impossibility of implementing any measure to stop the so-called improper interference of one political party in the affairs of another.</p>

<p>I now wish to say something on political representation. The hon. the Prime Minister made the extraordinary statement yesterday that now for the first time, the Coloured people are getting political rights, this by way of the Coloured Representative Council. They got these rights in terms of the 1964 Act but the <span class="col_1331-1332" refersTo="page_0688"/>Government delayed its implementation up to now. At most they will be equal to provincial council voting rights. They will never have more power than a provincial council has. The real meaning of full political rights is to enable them to have representation in this House, a say in the central Parliament. The rights were diminished in the 1950&#x2019;s when the Coloureds were removed from the common roll and now they are to be abolished altogether. In the Cape and Natal they still vote for representatives in this House. The point has been made that the number of registered voters is small. The Prime Minister stated that approximately 700,000 Coloureds in the Cape could be registered. I do not think that this figure is correct. That figure may reflect the total number of males over 21 years of age but they do not all qualify. However, the fact that those who could qualify are not registered, is immaterial. We must remember too that this Government made it very difficult for a Coloured man to register at all. The point is that the ability to elect members to the central Parliament is of the utmost importance. They are not getting something better in exchange. They are getting a provincial council status which, as I have already pointed out, they virtually got in terms of the 1964 Act. When that Act was passed, it was stated definitely by the late Prime Minister that their representation in this House would not be abolished.</p>

<p>In other words, the late Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, definitely intended the Coloureds to have the Coloured Representative Council as provided for in the 1964 Act, as well as representation in this House. I have no doubt whatever that it was not Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s intention that such representation should be abolished, certainly not at this stage. This Act is breaking faith with the Coloured people. The statement that they are getting something better in return, will not wash with them. They want and must have both.</p>

<p>I now wish to refer to the report. On the question of the political representation of Coloureds and Indians, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has already informed the House that a great volume of evidence in favour of representation in the central Parliament was received. Approximately 27 people were in favour of such representation as against nine who were against it. The responsible Coloured and Indian parties and other bodies want this representation. Of the nine who did not think that this representation served a useful purpose, only one Coloured organization, the District Six Association, was such a body. But even this body qualified its statement by saying that if these representatives were to report back regularly, they would be happy to retain them. The Rev. Engelbrecht was one of those who stated that they did not attach much value to the representation in this House, but on page 273 he states:</p>

<block name="quote">Wel, daar is sekere aangeleenthede met betrekking tot die Kleurlinge wat die blanke Parlement nog sal moet behartig en daarom sal die Kleurling nog daar deur Blankes verteenwoordig moet word. Ek dink hier aan sake soos verdediging, justisie en finansies.</block>

<p>Professor S. P. Olivier from Natal holds the views held by Sabra, but even he states that the time will come when the white man will have to give some sort of political rights to the Coloureds and Indians. We have dealt with the views of Dr. I. D. du Plessis at length. Mr. Dollie was referred to by the hon. member for maimesbury as an outstanding personality in the Coloured community and as one who does not want representation in the central Parliament. But what does he want&#x003F; He wants a Coloured Parliament with equal rights to those of the present-day sovereign Parliament. On page 330 we have Mr. Dollie&#x2019;s reply to a question by Mr. Bloomberg:</p>

<block name="quote">Let us now leave the territorial aspect. Can you imagine the Coloured people at any time having a parliament with rights equal to the present-day sovereign Parliament&#x003F;&#x2014;I think it will come.</block>

<p>As regards Sabra, I have no comment to make; I think they are idealists.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Speaker, the evidence against representation is of very little value. On the other hand, the evidence in favour of representation for Coloureds in the central Parliament is overwhelming. The Labour Party states that Coloured people are being driven further and further from the Whites. The Group Areas Act has brought bitterness, particularly because of its one-sided application. I am sure that if this Government proceeds with its plan to remove the Coloured representatives from this House, the bitterness will be very much increased.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Outeniqua gave evidence and I think he knows the Coloured people as well as anybody else. He knows his constituents and he knows their views. He says with absolute conviction that there will be shock, consternation and frustration, and the harm done to the confidence of the Coloured people will be irreparable, even if the Coloured Council is built up.</p>

<p>The Federal Party, represented by Messrs. T. Schwartz from the Cape Province, J. Poley from the Transvaal, P. Sanders from the Orange Free State, and others representing the greater part of the Republic, were firm in their opinion that the Coloured people should be represented in Parliament. I do not think it is necessary to quote what they said in particular. A good bit of that has already been done. But the fact nobody can dispute, is that they want representation in the central Parliament.</p>

<p>The witnesses who represented the Conservative Party were equally convinced that representation in this Parliament was necessary. Mr. Fortuin also stated, like Mr. T. Schwartz, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If I have to fight an election and tell my voters that there will be no representation of the Coloured people in this Parliament I will be rejected.</block>

<p><span class="col_1333-1334" refersTo="page_0689"/>He goes on to state that he sees on the basis of a common roll the building up of a very important Coloured body, namely the Coloured Representative Council. Despite this important Council, he still insists on representation. He says that he will fight the next election as a Nationalist.</p>

<p>Then there are both Ds. D. P. Botha and J. A. J. Steenkamp, who have spent many years of their lives&#x2014;one something like 44 years&#x2014;amongst the Coloured people, and who I am sure know them very well. They are not men who are against the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy. They both state that the Coloureds must retain their representation in Parliament. Ds. D. P. Botha says that if it is abolished, it would be a terrific shock. There is overwhelming evidence from the Coloureds and the Whites, and from the Whites who know the Coloureds very well, that representation in this Parliament must be maintained. The abolition will do our relations irreparable harm. Abolition will mean breaking faith with the Coloured people. I must again remind the House of the assurance that was given by the former Prime Minister in 1962, and we shall quote it again later on, and again by the Minister of Coloured Affairs, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;What I said, was that when we have that Parliament (referring to the Coloured Parliament) in my view the white representatives will still be here.&#x201D;</block>

<p>It was not their intention that the Coloured Parliament should replace the Whites. The then Minister of Coloured Affairs gave a similar assurance and left no doubt in the minds of hon. members, the public and the coloured people that representation in this House will not be abolished.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the words of the late General Hertzog, when referring to the Nationalist Party after their change of policy and their decision to put the Coloureds on a separate roll, when he said: &#x201C;Wat &#x2019;n skande! Wat &#x2019;n gruwelike verbreking van jou erewoord!&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00c9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>The wise King Solomon said that there were a few things that were incomprehensible and inexplicable to him. One of those was the way a snake passed over a stone. I think that if King Solomon could have looked to-day at the course the United Party has taken in the field of Coloured politics, he would have shaken his head and remained silent. The hon. member for Gardens referred in his speech to the removal of the Coloureds from the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll by the National Party early in the fifties, and said that the National Party had diminished the political rights of the Coloureds in that way. Is the hon. member for Gardens also prepared to say that with its somersault policy at its recent congress held at Bloemfontein the United Party is also diminishing the rights of the Coloureds&#x003F; The hon. member says that by taking that step the National Party was diminishing the political rights of the Coloureds. Since then the hon. member and his party have, as regards the political rights of the Coloureds, been following a winding political course which nobody can understand. But now, after 15 years, they accept the principle of separate development. Yet to-day the hon. member is once again levelling the accusations he levelled as far back as 15 years ago.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens was a member of the commission whose report is under discussion at the moment, and he was chairman of the commission that was appointed by his leader. On 9th October last year the hon. member wrote a letter to the chairman of the former commission in which he solemnly stated that he identified himself wholeheartedly with the findings of the minority report and that, if he had not been precluded from being present by reason of illness, he would also have signed that minority report. Please note. The hon. member made this statement on 9th October, i.e. on the eve of the United Party congress. And the hon. member knew that at that congress a committee of inquiry, of which he was the chairman, would submit a report in which it would be recommended that the Coloureds should be kept on a separate voters&#x2019; roll. Mr. Speaker, where would one find another hon. member who is as great a political opportunist as is the hon. member for Gardens&#x003F; This would even make a statue blush. King Solomon would have been rendered speechless if he could have observed to-day the manoeuvring of the United Party and of the hon. member for Gardens.</p>

<p>The point at issue here, is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s announcement that he has accepted the recommendations of the majority report<i>&#x2014;inter alia,</i> that the political representation of the Coloureds in this House should be abolished. A further point at issue here, is the Government&#x2019;s decision to expand the Coloured Persons Representative Council by investing it with greater powers and status. Another point at issue here, is that the Prime Minister has stated frankly that a suitable link between the Coloured Council and this Parliament would be created as soon as the new Coloured Council has been established and consulted.</p>

<p>The first question that may be asked now, is why do we not retain the present set-up&#x003F; From 1956&#x2014;when the Coloureds were placed on a separate voters&#x2019; roll&#x2014;to 1966, was for the Coloureds a period of political calm. Then the United Party set the example again, through the hon. member for Karoo, by once again poking their noses into the political affairs of the Coloureds. The example set by he hon. member for Karoo was followed by the Progressive Party. But in those ten years of calm a great deal was achieved for the Coloureds under the present set-up. Mention has already been made of the extensive work that has been done by the Department of Coloured Affairs, particularly under the socioeconomic upliftment plan for the Coloureds. A great deal of appreciation has been expressed for this work that has been done by the Department, a department that was disparaged <span class="col_1335-1336" refersTo="page_0690"/> by the United Party at the time of its inception. They did not want to have anything to do with it and subsequently they slandered it and stirred up suspicion against it amongst the Coloureds&#x2014;in fact, they did everything possible to prevent the Department from being able to do its work properly. All the positive steps that were taken by this Government, were fought by the United Party&#x2014;amongst other things the take-over of Coloured Education. There is evidence that in this period a national pride has come into being amongst the Coloureds and that a great deal has been done to arouse amongst them a sense of nationhood. But at the same time it is being admitted generally that all these positive and constructive things could only have been undertaken in the climate that was created when the Coloureds were taken out of the political struggle of the Whites. The fact that during the period 1953 to 1956 the National Party did not take any notice of the fuss that was made by the Opposition and its hangerson outside, but continued to do what it considered to be in the interests of the Coloureds, created the right climate. The step taken by the Government to place the Coloureds on a separate voters&#x2019; roll, a step history has already proved to be the right one, created this climate which has made these positive steps possible. Virtually everybody who appeared before the commission, admitted that the period 1956 to 1966 had been the most fruitful period in the history of the Coloureds, because during this period more was done for them than was done in any other period of their existence.</p>

<p>Another point the commission had to take into account, was that if it were decided to retain the political representation of the Coloureds, as it exists in this Parliament at present, we would not be able to prevent people from insisting that the number of representatives should be increased. In fact, everybody admitted that if it were accepted that the Coloureds should have a political point of growth here, the number of representatives would in fact have had to be increased gradually. The possible number of Coloured voters in the Cape to-day is between 160,000 and 200,000. As a result of the economic development in the country, development which stands the Coloureds in good stead, and as a result of the upliftment programme for the Coloureds on the part of the State and with the education facilities that are being placed at their disposal, this voters&#x2019; potential is growing every day. It was pointed out in evidence that the Separate Representation of Voters Act and the speeches of Nationalist leaders of that time made allowances for the fact that the number of Coloured representatives here would have to be increased in the course of time.</p>

<p>Another fact of which we had to take note was, that it became very apparent from the evidence that if the political representation of the Coloureds in this Parliament were to be continued, we would not have found any moral justification for limiting it to the small, select group we have to-day. At some stage or other the franchise would have had to be extended to Coloured women, and sooner or later&#x2014;I say that it would have had to happen sooner&#x2014;political rights would have had to be granted to the Coloureds in the northern provinces. This is an obvious fact, and the United Party admits it in their policy. In their proposed policy they grant political rights to the Coloureds in the northern provinces, and they are most certainly making allowances for it. This is the principal reason why the United Party is now abandoning the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and introducing separate representation. Just imagine what would happen if one had a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll in the Transvaal and in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal and Free State United Party supporters would then have to go to the polls along with the Coloureds. That would be the end of the United Party.</p>

<p>In the first place we must take into account the fact that the logical outcome of the Coloureds being represented in this Parliament by Whites, would be that at some stage or other in the future we would have to allow the Coloureds to be represented here by their own people. This is a logical fact; we cannot escape it. We as Nationalists are saying to the United Party that the eight white representatives they want to bring in here for representing the Bantu, will not always remain white, nor will they always remain eight in number. One simply cannot get away from that. In spite of all the assurances the United Party wants to put in writing, we say that we do not believe that the number will remain eight and that they will always be white. As Nationalists and Dawie wrote in <i>Die Burger</i> in 1960: if one retained the white representatives of the Coloureds here and if one granted the Coloureds a point of growth for political rights in this white parliament, then the outcome would be that the number of representatives would not be four only and that they would be represented here by their own people. The commission had to face those facts, and in addition to that the evidence showed very clearly that it would be attempting the impossible to combat political interference by the Whites in Coloured politics with any degree of success if the candidates of the Coloured people continued to be white persons. On the other hand we were given the alternative solution that one could possibly establish an electoral college to prevent the interference by the Progressive Party and the United Party which is taking place at the moment. The proposal was that one had to prevent this interference by making the Coloured Persons Representative Council an electoral college for nominating their representatives in this Parliament. That alternative proposal fell flat for the simple reason that it would rather increase political interference than reduce it. The political parties will do everything in their power to have those members elected whom they consider to be the right persons, to nominate the right persons to this Parliament, and subsequent to that the Coloured representatives will be subject to <span class="col_1337-1338" refersTo="page_0691"/>improper pressure, which we simply cannot allow.</p>

<p>Sir, what was the commission to do then&#x003F; I should like to lay some emphasis on the evidence that was given before the Commission by non-Whites and by non-White political parties. I did not, as the hon. member for Gardens did, sit down and count the number of witnesses. Some of them are not worth counting. Some of them are standing outside&#x2014; at the upper end of Adderley Street&#x2014;with a poster, and the Coloureds are Laughing at them. They were sitting around like political vultures &#x2014;people such as the Black Sash&#x2014;waiting to see whether there was anything to scavenge. I say that the Coloureds are laughing at them. It is not worth the trouble to count them. I want to read out here the evidence of Coloureds themselves; I want them to speak Their evidence is valuable in this sense that if it is at all possible to-day to talk about a representative Coloured opinion, then it is to be found, to the extent it exists at present, within the commission. There were representatives of all three political parties that appeared before the commission. There were representatives of all three of these political parties whom it was worth listening to. What were their views on the various possibilities that exist&#x003F; Let us take first the old set-up before 1956, the period of the common voters&#x2019; roll. I can state quite frankly that with very few exceptions the Coloureds did not have a good word for that period. It was generally said by the Coloureds that that was the most frustrating, the most ineffective and the most useless period in the history of the existence of the Coloureds. The vote of a Coloured person was all that mattered at that time. His vote was used as a football for their own purposes by white political opportunists, and the stirring up of suspicion, the incitement and the corruption that went along with it, landed these poor people in a bottomless morass, and in all other spheres they were sorely neglected as far as their development was concerned. Moreover, in that period the race relations between Whites and non-Whites were upset in a ruthless way because the Coloureds were forced into a position of having to act as a political arbiter between white man and white man. I just want to refer to the evidence in this regard. In the first place, I shall refer to the memorandum of the Federal Party on page 59. I want to concede, as the hon. member for Malmesbury did, that under cross-examination people sometimes say things they have not thought out well, but the following is a quotation from this memorandum&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons sien in die beleid van afsonderlike ontwikkeling &#x2019;n teenstelling met die ou koloniale beleid waar &#x2019;n volk of &#x2019;n volksgroep ekonomies so verkneg word dat daar geen geleentheid bestaan of kan ontwikkel vir daardie volksgroep om self verder te ontwikkel nie. Ons, as hul leiers, begin insien dat die integrasiebeleid van die verlede nog altyd in die hande van opportuniste gespeel het.</block>

<p>I also want to refer to the Labour Party, one of the few parties that was in favour of the retention of Coloured representatives here in this House. I want to refer to what Dr. Van der Ross said on page 121 of the report. Arising from a question that had been put to him, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Aan die ander kant is dit ook waar dat maar baie min notisie van ons geneem is in die algemene gang van die praktiese politiek.</block>

<p>I also want to refer to what the Rev. J. A. J. Steenkamp, the moderator of the D.R. Mission Church, said on page 127. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Voor 1956 het ons die posisie gehad waar die Kleurlinge misbruik is, die kleurlingstem misbruik is deur blanke politieke partye. Hulle self getuig dat hulle onder die ou bedding niks meer gekry het as wat hulle vandag kry nie. Nadat die verkiesing plaasgevind het, dan staan alies stil tot die volgende verkiesing en dan vry ons maar weer na die Kleurling se stem.</block>

<p>If this evidence is not sufficient, then I should like to read from a statement issued by the Federal Peoples&#x2019; Party shortly after its inception. It deals with their programme of principles. They say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the first place, the period before 1910 forms the history of the origin of the Coloured people, its composition, its grouping and its self-development, without any plans for the future. This is the background period.</block>

<p>This is merely the introduction; what I want to read out, is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The second period, 1910 to 1948, is the period in which a section of the Coloureds of the country were granted the right to vote on a common voters&#x2019; roll. Although this is being called a &#x201C;right&#x201D;, this was probably one of the greatest injustices that was done to us, because it only helped us from the frying pan into the fire.</block>

<p>Then they go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our votes ensured that the Whites represented us in Parliament, but those Whites always came under the caucus of the white parties that were governing and could not look after our interests, but had to do what the party leadership asked of them.</block>

<p>Then it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this period, too, a sharp division set in amongst the Coloureds, because those who could vote were bribed into recording their votes in accordance with the <b>demands set</b> by the briber. A false hope and a future was held out to us which the then Government under General Smuts could never have put into practice.</block>

<p><span class="col_1339-1340" refersTo="page_0692"/>But there is more to come. I am reading on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At one stage the Coloured population group felt that it was the refuse dump of the other races. It had no identity, and in terms of Government policy to-day the Coloureds have now obtained an identity and a God-given birthright.</block>

<p>I should like the Opposition to give consideration to that. What was the attitude adopted by the various Coloured political parties in respect of the present set-up we now have here, and in respect of which it is now being pleaded that we should retain it here&#x003F; It can be seen from the evidence that everybody admits that as a transition period this system has served its purpose. It created that calm, that climate, in which it was possible for the Coloured population to prosper for ten years, but in that same period it was also very clear that the Coloureds had lost their interest in this political representation, obviously because this political representation had very little significance for them, and they guided their interests into other directions. Evidence of this is the fact that between May, 1953, and August, 1963&#x2014; in ten years&#x2019; time&#x2014;the number of registered voters decreased from 47,849 to 9,839&#x2014;by 38,000 in ten years&#x2019; time. But further proof to this effect is the evidence given by the Rev. Steenkamp on page 125. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is my ondervinding dat die Kleurlinge, met uitsondering van &#x2019;n paar groepies, na 1956 in &#x2019;n baie groot mate politiek-passief geword het en dat sy belangstelling tot groot hoogte l&#x00EA; op maatskaplike, ekonomiese, onderwysen kulturele terreine.</block>

<p>In the third place the general evidence before us was that these white representatives who had been sitting here since 1956, were of very little or no significance to the Coloureds. Without giving any offence to these representatives, I want to say the evidence before us signified that the Coloureds merely accepted them here as a necessary evil. It was openly admitted that these people did not mean anything to them. It is not necessary for me to go into this aspect; it has already been done by other hon. members and I think that it is being accepted generally.</p>

<p>What was the attitude adopted by the Coloureds in respect of the abolition of this representation&#x003F; Now I want to tell the United Party, which says here that the overwhelming concensus of opinion was that these people should remain here. The people who matter, the most important three groups before us, were the three Coloured parties. Two of those three parties stated frankly in their evidence before us that the fact that they advocated the retention of the white representatives in this House, was merely a question of practical politics. They argued that a kind of sentiment attached itself to this representation, and they told us that if any of them were to use the abolition of this representation here as a plank in their platform and to accept it as part of their policy, then a tremendous political campaign would be waged against them on this issue, and that was why they did not advocate its abolition openly. But they tell the commission, &#x201C;You may do so at any time; you may abolish them if you want to, but, please, do not say that we asked you to do so&#x201D;. That was the attitude adopted by two of the three political parties. You can find it in what Mr. Fortuin said on page 139, and in what Mr. Petersen said on page 144. You will find it in the evidence given by the Federal Party and also in the memorandum submitted by the Federal Party, on page 60&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Na die verkiesing van die lede van die Kleurlingnarlement sal daardie liggaam moet besluit of hulle sal wil vra vir die wysiging van die verteenwoordiging in die blanke Parlement. Ons herhaal net dat die huidige verteenwoordiging nie vir ons tot nut is nie en aan geen verwagtings voldoen nie.</block>

<p>They say that as far as they are concerned, once the Coloured Persons Representative Council has been elected, that Council will decide what is to become of these people here, but in the meantime they can only emphasize the fact that these people do not have any significance for them. This is also the tenor of the evidence given by the other political party, the Conservative Party. They say: Let there be a transition period for approximately five or ten years; they are of no significance to us, but then we may decide later to abolish them.</p>

<p>Now I should like to say this. What did the commission therefore have as an alternative&#x003F; The commission had only one alternative before it, namely that white representatives in this House be removed and that a political instrument be placed in the hands of the Coloured population, an instrument by means of which they may realize themselves in the field of politics, something which is worth while to them, a council through which this Government will also be able to give them much more than it is normally able to give them when they have representation in this House. That is why the commission recommended that the representatives here be abolished and that another link between Parliament and the new council be sought. By removing the white representatives of the Coloureds from this Parliament, we shall also have further developed the National Party&#x2019;s policy in respect of political apartheid. This is a logical step, a pattern of development which has been in progress in this country since 1910. namely to remove the non-Whites&#x2019; representation in this Parliament and to guide it into other directions. This is the pattern which has been continued under this Government and which has gathered momentum under this Government.</p>

<p>I have no more time left, but what I want to state here very positively is that it is <span class="col_1341-1342" refersTo="page_0693"/>absolutely essential that there should be political separation if we want to carry through separate development for the Coloureds in all the other spheres. This was also admitted by a witness such as the Rev. D. Botha&#x2014;who was opposed to the abolition of these representatives&#x2014;namely that if one wanted separate development in this country to succeed amongst the Coloureds, then one would have to set political separation as a pre-requisite. That is why it is a logical step to abolish the present representation in this House. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have had a discussion here yesterday and to-day during which, in the main, the members of the commission who signed the majority report tried to justify their course of action and recommendations, recommendations which are not borne out by the facts placed before the commission, and which to my certain knowledge are not borne out by public opinion, either White, Coloured, or any other group in this country. This afternoon I wish to deal with what the alternative to the present system will be, namely what the commission recommends should take the place of the four representatives in this House.</p>

<p>Reference has been made here to the shortcomings of the Coloured representatives, of whom I happen to be one, but I ask: Who put us in this position&#x003F; The gentlemen on the other side. It is that side&#x2019;s own proposition; it is their own scheme. When the hon. gentlemen on that side put their own men into the field at election time, they were hammered into the ground. Indeed, I think some of them lost their deposits. The biggest crime I committed in our political world is that I beat a man who was really a Nat although disguised as an Independent. However, we found out who he was and, what is far more important, the Coloured people found out who he was. Had that man won the election there would have been none of the nonsense we have been having these last few years, because that was the big throw of the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>We have heard a lot of talk here about interference, proper and improper, but I can assure hon. members that when I fought that election I dealt with Nationalist Party canvassers and organizers. I myself had to enter Nationalist Party offices to collect ballot papers which Coloured people felt should have come to me. Of course, that is all in order; that is not improper. What is more, those organizers hung on to the ballot papers and made it as difficult as possible for me to get hold of them. So, hon. members on that side must not talk here from that lofty perch of the ivory tower of innocence in the political world, because it is not true.</p>

<p>Much has been made of the attitude of the chairman of the Council for Coloured Affairs. One significant fact is he did not give evidence as the chairman of a Government body but as the leader of a very small and ineffective Coloured political party which, on his own admission, says it cannot win an election if it agreed to the abolition of the four Coloured representatives in this House. Why did he not speak as the chairman of the Council for Coloured Affairs&#x003F; There is a reason, and a very good reason.</p>

<p>As recently as last year a motion was introduced in that council by one of the inexperienced members urging the council to resolve that the four representatives here should be done away with. To the eternal credit of the chairman&#x2014;and I give him that credit in full measure&#x2014;he said that as a council it could never support the motion. There was a furious debate. My information goes further and is to the effect that during the tea interval talks took place amongst the members. Of course, white officials attend these meetings. Afterwards the motion was withdrawn.</p>

<p>I can assure hon. members that the Council for Coloured Affairs, from the chairman to the most lowly member, acknowledge and say quite frankly that the points of view expressed in this Parliament by the men who sit here on my left, are identical with the views they express in the council, but the Government takes no notice of them. This is the sort of thing they say, and this is a Government body with nominees, not elected people. The Government dare not face an election among the Coloured people on their policy. To the present day there is a vacancy arising from the resignation of a man from Richmond who resigned years ago. For the same reason they dare not attempt to fill the seat of the late Mr. Charles Barnett&#x2014;God rest his soul. So, let us not speak of interference, because the Government is interfering in the Coloured political world every day of the week.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>That is right, all in good time. Let me deal with my memorandum which has been such a thorn in the side of the hon. the Prime Minister. He has had four &#x201C;go&#x2019;s&#x201D; at me in this House over that memorandum.</p>

<p>Let me say here and now: That memorandum was compiled by me. The views expressed therein were mine, and what about it&#x003F; Since when have I, a citizen and taxpayer of this country, not the right to attempt to influence a commission&#x003F; Interjections. Never mind what we have to say. Interjections. I will come to you. A commission is appointed which the Coloured people think is really going to get to grips with this problem of their political rights. I, as one of their representatives, travel a lot among the Coloured people. Hon. members on the opposite side are wrong when they say we see our people seldom. Indeed, I almost live in my constituency. Those people support the views in my memorandum, and what about it&#x003F; Now I come to the point which hon. members opposite are worried about and about which the <span class="col_1343-1344" refersTo="page_0694"/>Prime Minister has been at great pains to point a finger at the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The views expressed in my memorandum were submitted to the party delegates, the same as all good points of view raised in the United Party. We are not a bunch of stooges. Our policy is not dictated by <i>Die Burger,</i> or <i>Dagbreek,</i> or <i>Die Beeld.</i> A congress took place at Bloemfontein at which I had my say, like everybody else. That congress consisted of nearly 600 men and women from all walks of life, from all occupations and professions in the country, and we had a magnificent discussion on this subject. I say that that is what the commission should have done. The upshot of that discussion was the policy enunciated by my Leader which, let me tell that side of the House, I support fully. Hon. members opposite, who always talk about what other people should do, have been swinging like a flag in the wind over the Coloured people for many years.</p>

<p>The Council for Coloured Affairs has been a failure. The hon. the Prime Minister said that I belittled it. That is of course not true. The people who belittle the Council are the Coloured people themselves because they do not know what goes on inside it. It is a secret society. An hon. member said that the Coloured representatives in this House have never been to the meetings of this council. How is one to know when the meetings are taking place, if you do not receive a notice. In all the years that I have been in this House, I have never received a notice telling me when the council will meet. We do not receive such notices because the hon. the Prime Minister does not want us to know when the meetings take place. He does not want me to know what the Coloured people are saying.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>It is a strange thing that I even get a notice from the Secretary of this House telling me that Parliament is going to sit. The hon. the Prime Minister says that the Coloured people are going to get this legislative council. In 1964 I forecasted exactly what has in fact happened in connection with the representative council which received a great fanfare of trumpets. Nothing has been done in this regard. There are no voters&#x2019; rolls. The whole matter is as dead as the dodo. I forecast that this council is going to be just as dead because the hon. the Prime Minister ripped the insides out of this council yesterday when he said that the Government retains taxing powers. The council will have no right to levy any taxes. What body can do anything unless it has the right to raise money&#x003F;</p>

<p>That brings me to the point made by the hon. member for Parow. What is the ultimate end of this council&#x003F; This is the question we must answer. Where is the promised land for the Coloured people&#x003F; Where is the land of milk and honey and the manna falling from heaven&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that the Coloured people do not believe that that is going to happen. Any knowledgeable person who looks at the recommendations of this commission will see that there are only two things offered to these people. I shall, however, deal with the five rights mentioned by the hon. the Prime Minister in his address at the opening of the council last year. He said that they would control finance. In other words, he would give them some money to spend. They would control local authorities, education, social welfare and pensions and Coloured settlements. Let us deal with these in order.</p>

<p>The first item concerns finance. If this council is to be run properly it must have money. A big show is made in this report of the R46 million the Government is going to give the council. That money is already being spent, mostly by Coloured persons in the service of the Department of Coloured Affairs. Let us therefore be sensible. In regard to local authorities, I recall when the then Minister of Coloured Affairs, the present Minister of Defence, dragooned the Administrators in Pretoria into introducing legislation to set up separate local authorities. The attitude was: If you do not do it, we will. The Provincial Administration of the Cape appointed a commission under Senator Jasper Rossouw who was then chairman of the Provincial Council. He made a detailed study of the possibility of creating separate local authorities. He found that it could not be done. He said that it was impossible and that the Government should forget about it. The first of the five planks which the Prime Minister held up to these people in the Council of Coloured Affairs therefore went by the board. Let us now consider the question of education. The Coloured people can only ask for one thing. They want the same pay as that received by white teachers, the same hostels as those of white children, concessions for transport and a better arrangement in regard to books, as well as many other things. Let us now assume that this council resolves to do those things, so bringing them up to the level of the white man. Assume also, that in regard to social welfare and pensions they ask for the same pensions as white persons and that rural pensions must be on the same level as those of white persons. Let us consider what must be the result. If the council agrees to these requests, it will need double the money the Government has voted so far. Will the Government then merely vote the extra money&#x003F; Let us assume that the Government does grant the extra money. Why should we put up the machinery for 60 people of which 20 are going to be interfering in the affairs of the Coloured Council, when that is exactly what the Coloured representatives in Parliament have been asking for for years. Education therefore falls by the way as well as social welfare and pensions, because it depends on money.</p>

<p>I shall not deal with farm settlements now because it is a relatively minor matter. We <span class="col_1345-1346" refersTo="page_0695"/>have heard of the great future for the Coloured people. At one time it was suggested that the Coloured people should have a homeland in Namaqualand. But then somebody discovered diamonds in that area. There is a mine in that area and it is being worked by Whites. This is being done in the homeland of the Coloureds. When the Coloured people were talking about getting a fishing harbour in their homeland, somebody found that most of our crayfish are caught on that coast. The quotas there did not go in quite the right way. In both of these cases therefore the Coloured people got the short end of the stick. There is no homeland for them. There is no future or prosperity of any kind for them other than administering education and social welfare and pensions by means of this sum of R46 million.</p>

<p>I think that whatever the Government would do with this council, it must admit that it is no substitute for representation in Parliament. If we want to teach these people to work democratically, this is the place in which they must be taught. You do not learn democracy on a small committee which works cap in hand and which has half of its members appointed. I want to go further. The Government has been misleading this country in regard to the Coloured people for 20 years. Its own newspapers say so quite plainly and clearly. The real reason why the Government does not want to do anything about the Coloured man, is that if he develops to his maximum potential, he will have a parliament equal to this in every respect&#x2014;or will he not&#x003F; That is the question I want the hon. the Prime Minister or some other hon. member to answer. We have heard from the Prime Minister and other hon. members that the sky is the limit for the development of the Coloured people. Now we want to know where the sky is. The Minister of Defence told me in writing, when I asked him, that no future development for the Coloured people in the Defence Force is envisaged. Nothing further is envisaged than the little detachment at Eerste River. The Minister of Mines told me that there is no reason why there should be any training facilities for Coloured people in the field of mining. If the Coloured Council, which this Government wants to thrust upon these unfortunate and unhappy people, decided that the Minister of Transport did not run his Railways properly, would they be allowed to build themselves another railway alongside his&#x003F; It is ridiculous. Are they going to be able to run a separate department of agriculture&#x003F; [Interjections.] The Minister of Sport cannot even find 5 cents for any Coloured undertaking or sporting body. I asked him that. Do you know what he said to me, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; &#x201C;Oh the department did not apply.&#x201D;</p>

It is quite easy. He can just by a stroke of the pen put an end to it. But he will not do me any harm and he will not do himself any good. That is the point.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat arrogated to himself the role of a patriarch of the nation to prescribe to the Prime Minister of this country how he should conduct himself. Consequently I think it is high time the hon. member took a look at himself and at the reflection of what he is in the political life of South Africa. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to descend to the level of personalities, but let me say this: He made attacks here, apart from the attack on the Prime Minister, attacks which we scornfully reject; as well as attacks on people he is supposed to defend and to represent. These attacks were prejudicial to this Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council which has been gladly accepted by all the witnesses. He said something about the &#x201C;sky&#x201D; being the &#x201C;limit&#x201D;. He put it this way: &#x201C;The sky is the limit&#x201D;. Sir, I want to give you the assurance that the limit we are setting is not the &#x201C;merging of all groups into a Common Roll&#x201D;. It is the heavenly arch he has set for himself. But I shall return to the hon. member again in a moment. I just want to tell him in the meantime that he was really complimenting himself this afternoon when he began by visualizing himself as the &#x201C;thorn in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s side&#x201D;. Just imagine, Sir! The thorn in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s side! He is not even a burr.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>Now I just want to refer very briefly to the activities of the commission, and I wish to start by saying the following about its chairman. As hon. members on that side have testified, I too want to testify that, in spite of the most acute difference of opinion between us as commission members, the activities of the commission and its proceedings were characterized throughout by the greatest degree of courtesy and good breeding. In spite of the difference of opinion this Commission comported itself in the best parliamentary tradition. That image which the commission presented throughout, is to the highest degree attributable to the exceptionally capable leadership of its chairman.</p>

<p>I come now to the commission&#x2019;s report. If we were to analyse this report, we would find that it emphasized nine important matters. The first is what the hon. member for Karoo denies, i.e. the enthusiasm with which the Coloured population are looking forward to the establishment and expansion of this Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. There was not a single witness who underestimated the value of this Council&#x2014;and the witnesses were the official representatives of large groups of Coloureds. On the contrary. There was the greatest appreciation for the rehabilitation work which was being done, the achievements, the socio-economic development, and so on. To tell the truth, this report and the evidence contained therein is a glowing tribute to the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Council and the Department. Secondly, the evidence given before this commission confirmed that the Coloureds were discovering an identity and a group consciousness of their own. The hon. member for Karoo has just said: Why did we not view the Coloureds as part of the larger framework of the South African population&#x003F; Sir, I am not calling the report to witness now; I am now calling to witness the hon. member for Yeoville, who in the newspaper article which the hon. the Prime Minister also quoted, told us the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They see themselves more than ever before as a separate group or community which is removed from other communities&#x2014;also from the Whites.</block>

<p>The third point which one finds striking when you go through the report, is the practical realism of the Coloured population in respect of the task which lies ahead. The witnesses who appeared before us, expressed opinions in regard to what the ultimate objective could be, because they were asked to do so, but their interests and their evidence dealt with the immediate task which lay ahead, not what would happen in a 100 or 50 years&#x2019; time, but the immediate socio-economic development of the Coloureds and their immediate requirements. We asked one of the witnesses, Dr. Du Plessis, how he saw our task. After Dr. Du Plessis had discussed this entire matter of the future (on page 327). the question was put to him whether the following was an accurate summary of his view (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In other words, the most immediate task before this commission, and for the Government of the country, is to find, in the foreseeable future, a solution along the lines of separateness, abolition of representation in the White Parliament in order to develop as rapidly as possible in this way the developing possibilities and potential of the separate councils. Is that how you see the development&#x003F;</block>

<p>Dr. Du Plessis&#x2019;s reply to that was &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Fourthly we see very clearly from this report that our only choice lies between two things, either separate political development or political <span class="col_1349-1350" refersTo="page_0697"/> integration. There is no other alternative, and this the witnesses also stated to us. These are the two alternatives. Political integration is unacceptable to the Whites; for the Coloureds and the Indians it is unfair, a handicap to their development and discriminatory in practice, and it must lead to inevitable frustration.</p>

<p>Fifthly, this report revealed that the principal cause of political interference was the presence in this House of Assembly of white representatives, and the alternative, as the witnesses put it to us, was that Coloureds should represent Coloureds in this House. The alternative therefore is political integration, political integration which the Whites do not want and which the Coloureds do not desire.</p>

<p>Sixthly, it is very clear to us from the evidence that the retention of white representatives here, or the introduction of Coloured representatives for the Coloureds in the white parliament, alongside the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council which is a developing body, implies in essence an untenable, indefensible political dualism, a dualism which rests on a politically weak foundation, which is politically explosive and which will have hampering and frustrating effect on the socio-political development of the Coloured.</p>

<p>In the seventh place there was sufficient evidence before the commission to indicate that something would have to be done to eliminate the harmful interference on the part of one population group in the political affairs of another population group, particularly on a party-political level.</p>

<p>In the eighth place the evidence before the commission gave us clear proof of the United Party&#x2019;s reckless political game. The hon. the Prime Minister has already referred to that, and I shall presently quote further evidence in this connection.</p>

<p>In the ninth place this report and the discussion which followed upon this as well as reports in the Press, taught us that the Opposition have, after two decades of struggle, accepted the principle of separate Voters&#x2019; Rolls and that it is now presenting this political dish to the voting public. It is an apartheid-political dish, but it is very strongly flavoured with Institute of Race Relations salt and it is being served with a Progressive Party sauce.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to come to the question of improper interference. The minority Report stated that there was overwhelming evidence that this entire matter was covered by the Electoral Act. But surely the Report does not tally with the facts. It does not tally with the facts at all. Twenty-eight individual bodies appeared before the commission to give evidence. Of them nine were either church bodies or representatives of white political parties&#x2014; the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party&#x2014;or they were trade unions or workers&#x2019; organizations, or Indian representatives. The nonpolitical bodies were concerned with one question only and that was to what extent the legislation would be prejudicial to them in their activities, ecclesiastical or otherwise. Of the 19 remaining bodies which were concerned directly or indirectly with the Coloureds and their politics, no less than 14 admitted that there had been interference and requested that something would have to be done to prohibit interference, particularly on a party-political level. They admitted that there were practical problems but they also emphasized that there were malpractices. On page 123 of the report I put it to the Leader of the South African Labour party that the aim of his party in its constitution was described as follows: To consolidate the position of the Coloured people in South Africa. I then went on to ask him (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But suppose the political organization of another population group and their financial means are employed to influence the elections for the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council in a certain direction, would it not mean that the aim of your party, namely to consolidate the position of the Coloureds, was being undermined&#x003F;</block>

<p>His reply was (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I concede that this is possible. When you talk of finances you have a real point. But if you ask me whether it could handicap the consolidation of the position of the Coloureds, then I must honestly say &#x2018;yes&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sir, in order not to waste any time I am merely going to refer to the following evidence in this connection which was submitted to the commission: The South African Labour Party, page 123; the Rev. Mr. J. A. J. Steenkamp, page <b>21</b> and 129; the Conservative Party, pages 11 and 141; the &#x201C;Federale Kleurlingvolksparty&#x201D;, pages 150 and 158; the Rev. Mr. T. P. Botha, pages 34, 163, 167; the District Six Association, pages 45 and 172; J. P. Johnson, pages 10 and 181; Judge Van Wyk de Vries, page 225; Sabra, pages 62 to 65; the Rev. Engelbrecht, page 275; Prof. S. P. Olivier, page 279; Dr. I. D. du Plessis, page 327; Mr. S. Dollie, pages 50 and 329; and Mr. Holland M.P., pages 352 and 353.</p>

<p>The central principle of the Bill referred to us was to investigate the entire matter of unauthorized or harmful interference, particularly on a political level, and how it should be eliminated. Sir, after all this evidence which I have mentioned here, which confirmed throughout that something would have to be done, how dare the minority group tell us that there was insufficient evidence&#x003F; How dare they tell us that they cannot see how it was practicable&#x003F; When we accepted the principle, with a vote on the commission, as the Minister indicated, that we <span class="col_1351-1352" refersTo="page_0698"/>should in fact do something, and subsequently wanted to hold a consultation in regard to the matter, they refused to participate in that consultation. It is clearly indicated in the minutes. After we adopted the resolution that something would have to be done, the hon. members were gone. Hon. members will find this recorded on page 31 of the minutes.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. W. B. HAVEMANN</person>:</from>

<p>The fact that something would have to be done, was what gave rise to the appointment of the commission. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us that great irregularities were taking place. The hon. member for Peninsula waxed lyrical in regard to these irregularities as he explained them to us in this House. On page 163 of the report the hon. member for Peninsula put a question to a witness, but he was not actually putting a question; he was putting an opinion to the witness which he wanted confirmed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I take it you do agree that it is politically and morally wrong for a political party to try and get for itself a forum in Parliament on the backs of the Coloured people&#x003F;</block>

<p>Reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think there is anything more vicious.</block>

<p>His next question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If it is possible in a practical way to legislate against something of that nature, do you agree that we should attempt drawing up and introducing such legislation&#x003F; Yes, if it is practically possible.</block>

<p>Sir, they did not even try to draw up something practical; they offered no solution whatsoever. Sir, if the electoral laws of the country are adequate and cover these circumstances, then I want to point out that surely the electoral laws were necessary; surely they have been in existence for many years; surely the Opposition was well acquainted with them&#x2014; the hon. member for Peninsula was well acquainted with them. How was it that they suddenly came to discover that the electoral laws were good enough to save the position&#x003F; Why did they come to this House and hold long tirades in regard to the impossible things the Progressive Party were getting up to&#x003F; Why did they not give them a drubbing under the electoral laws&#x003F; No, all of a sudden the electoral laws were wonderful and quite adequate. I wonder whether this changed attitude could possibly bear any relation to the new policy of the United Party, which then thought: If we were perhaps to support the practical suggestions of the members of the commission who signed the majority report, it could perhaps hamper us in the implementation of a new political integration policy, whereas it would now be possible for us to practise politics amongst the Coloureds.</p>

<p>But, Sir, that is not the worst. We have two reports before this House, a minority report on representation, and a majority report. The majority report comes forward positively and sincerely with what it believes; it makes concrete proposals, based on the belief of those on this side of the House in the principle of separate freedom and separate development. But what does one find in the minority report&#x003F; It is vague, pious and non-committal. All that they say in regard to this representation is that it ought to be retained &#x201C;in some defined form&#x201D;, but nowhere is the &#x201C;form&#x201D; defined. That is the last word on the matter. All the minority group placed on record was a question mark on the political record of South Africa, a question mark after the sitting of the commission: Can any one help us find a policy&#x003F; That was the stage they had then arrived at. Of the hon. members who spoke about onus and said: &#x201C;Those who wish to change the position must justify it.&#x201D; I want to ask them to justify the onus resting on them.</p>

<p>We had the following course of events, to which the hon. the Prime Minister referred yesterday: A first motion, emanating from the members of the United Party, for the retention of the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and the return of the Coloureds to it. This was negatived. Within 15 minutes there was another motion, that of the hon. member for Peninsula, and this they supported lock, stock and barrel. Sir, they were so precipitate that we did not even have a chance to move a motion. Then I experienced on this commission the greatest political about-face which we have ever had in South Africa, all within the scope of one hour. The U.N. were no match for these people when they accepted this second motion with its separate voters&#x2019; rolls. Why was this motion which they then voted for, not followed up in their report&#x003F; There was no mention of separate voters&#x2019; rolls in that minority report. I wonder, at that moment when it happened, how Advocate Strauss would have felt if we think of his words in the Joint Sitting (14th June, 1954, col. 579)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe, with the deepest conviction, apart from the question of the moral issue, we believe on the merits of the case that the Common Roll is vital in the interests of South Africa, that it is vital in the interests of all South Africans, and that it is vital in the interests of maintaining Western civilization in South Africa. Let there be no doubt about that.</block>

<p>He was speaking on behalf of all those hon. members on the opposite side, and he was placing it on record for generations to come. He quoted General Smuts and said that General Smuts had said (col. 584) (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You are going to drive all the non-Whites into one camp. We are afraid of those <span class="col_1353-1354" refersTo="page_0699"/>things. In the past we have kept the population together. Let it remain that way.</block>

<p>This is as the hon. member for Karoo wants it. Then Mr. Strauss went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You cannot keep the population together if you put them on a separate roll. It is also a matter for the conscience of the nation. Keep that conscience clean; keep it clear.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He (General Smuts) was perfectly clear and explicit about the Coloured vote, that it was not only a matter for the conscience of the people but that it was a question of the true and abiding interests of South Africa, and if that interest was taken into account their only policy was to keep the Coloureds on the Common Roll &#x2026; and not to follow the path of the Government.</block>

<p>But we continue. In the minority report they did not mention these two motions at all, but what was the position&#x003F; We find in the Press, from the pen of the hon. member for Yeoville, that for all of two years they have been engaged on a commission of inquiry of their own, together with the Coloured leaders. The hon. member for Yeoville consulted with them, and they made two demands. The one was for equal rights. That we could not give them. They then put an alternative and this was accepted. At the stage when this vote was being taken, on 29th August, this commission had been sitting for a long time. To tell the truth, the chairman of that commission was also a member of this commission. But then they still did not know where they wanted to go. Then they still came forward with conflicting policies. What muddled thinking! I want to add this. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated in the Press&#x2014;I am quoting from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 5th November, 1967&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir De Villiers said the party was waiting for the Report of the Parliamentary Commission on the Improper Interference Bill. Sir De Villiers said the report would indicate Government thinking on non-white representation.</block>

<p>He was quite certain that this commission would give an indication of Government thinking. But did he not also think that his people would give an indication of &#x201C;Opposition thinking&#x201D;&#x003F; And what did we get from them&#x003F; A report which states precisely nothing. If we consider the behaviour of the Opposition, we find the most damning picture of chaotic thinking. They have been engaged on this investigation for two years; yet a caucus member submits a memorandum to our commission which differs from this new policy. On the eve of the congress, the night or two before, the hon. member for Karoo came to light with great banner headlines in the Press and made an appeal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">U.P. man&#x2019;s plea for non-white M.P.s. Mr. Graham Eden, M.P., the only Coloured representative who is a member of the United Party caucus, said that we should accept the principle that all non-white groups should be represented by their own people on a separate roll in Parliament.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is why I believe that Coloureds and Indians should be represented by their own people in Parliament, and that the same principle should apply to the Bantu at a later stage.</block>

<p>This is what he did on the eve of the congress.</p>

<p>After my hon. leader in this House raised this same matter last year and asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether he agreed with the statements and opinions of the hon. member for Karoo, the leaders of the United Party could no longer deny that there was anything of this nature. They must surely have asked him what his intention was. But on the eve of the congress he was given banner headlines and he made an appeal to his congress to make a point of thinking along these lines. Why did he do that&#x003F; Did he not do that because he had permission to do so&#x003F;</p>

<p>We now come to this account of the circumstances, i.e. first, the voting on the commission for the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll with qualifications for franchise, and then a second motion, namely separate voters&#x2019; rolls without any qualification; and after that a report without mention of either Common Voters&#x2019; Rolls or a separate voters&#x2019; roll or qualifications. After that we had a Bloemfontein congress with separate voters&#x2019; rolls, and qualifications which remain undefined. But we now find two kinds of Coloured citizens, those who vote for the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council, with no qualifications, and those who vote for representation in this House, with qualifications which remain undefined. Nobody knows who they are. In other words, the United Party is now creating two kinds of voters within the Coloured group. It is now creating, with its policy, if it should ever happen that it came into power, discrimination and frustration, and it is creating an impossible situation which is illustrated for us very revealingly in the evidence on page 139. There Mr. Fortuin states these very significant words (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I can foresee that if, for example, four Coloureds are to have a seat in Parliament, a ridiculous situation is going to be created. The Coloureds will be thrown into confusion as a result, because they will not know what group are speaking on their behalf, <span class="col_1355-1356" refersTo="page_0700"/>that is whether it is those in the House of Assembly or whether it is those in the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. Apart from that those representatives in the White Parliament will come along and state that they are sitting together with the Whites, whereas the other are &#x201C;Hottentots&#x201D; who are sitting alone.</block>

<p>Do you see, Sir, where this policy is heading&#x003F; To sow that kind of dissension in the ranks of the Coloureds. Now, after I have sketched the situation, we find ourselves in the midst of this &#x201C;confusion worse confounded&#x201D; and we hear one very clear voice, one man speaking with &#x201C;clarity&#x201D;. The hon. member for Karoo has been sharply attacked here, but I want to take up the cudgels on his behalf. I think he deserves great credit, because he, at least, stated in plain terms what he thought. Now I just wondered, with reference to this Press report on the eve of the congress, whether he did not perhaps have a function to fulfil&#x003F; Was it not perhaps a feeler which was being put out to see how the wind would blow on the congress&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down rode into Parliament on the backs of the voters of Odendaalsrus, and he has given us an interesting analysis of the Commission of which he was a member. I must say that this is the first analysis we have heard in this House, because the Commission itself in its majority report did not give any such analysis. [Interjections.] The hon. member talked about the minority report giving very little by way of analysis and recommendations, but I have the same comment to make about the majority report. One does not expect a commission report of this kind to contain the analytical recommendations that one finds in a judicial commission such as the Fagan Commission, and one would not expect the statistical information that one would find in a commission such as the Van Eck Commission or the Industrial Legislation Commission, but one would have expected something more than just a glib statement which the majority report contains. I cannot say that I was really surprised at this. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated, when he asked for a debate in this House on this Commission, that he had been disappointed at what had emanated from the Commission. I cannot say that I was disappointed. I was not even surprised, because I knew perfectly well that nothing could come out of that Commission. I knew that the Government members were going into that Commission with preconceived ideas and that no matter what evidence was presented before them, they were going to emerge from the Commission with exactly the same ideas. So it comes as no surprise to me to find what has in fact emanated from this Commission.</p>

<p>What have we had from the Commission in fact&#x003F; We have had the glib statement, firstly, that the Coloureds as a whole are not interested in politics and that they have not yet attained political maturity. We have heard that the Commission found evidence that the Coloureds were subject to political exploitation and to improper interference. We were told, and again this is just a flat statement&#x2014;there is nothing at all to back this up&#x2014;that in order to introduce a more effective type of political representation for the Coloureds they would have to lose the representation they already have in this House and that they would be compensated for the loss of that representation by a Coloured Legislative Council. We were also told that a Bill would have to be introduced in order to control this interference across the colour line in politics, and no doubt this Bill, when it does emerge, will not be called the Improper Interference Bill, because that has gone by the board, but it will probably be called the Protection of Politically Immature Coloured Persons Bill.</p>

<p>Now let me deal with these four findings. First of all, the Deputy Minister of Police, the Chairman of the Commission, expressed surprise that so few representatives of Coloured organizations appeared to give evidence before the Commission, and he was surprised to find that so little interest was displayed by the Coloured people in this Commission. The reason for this did not seem clear to the Deputy Minister, but of course the real reason is that the Government has quite deliberately inhibited, as far as it possibly can, any political organizations amongst non-Whites. I might say also it has deliberately destroyed politically aware people in this country who are non-Whites, and therefore the evidence that was presented to the Commission must be read against the background of the years of Government interference with the political activities of the non-white people. What is this background&#x003F; First and foremost it is one of intimidation, visits by the security branch to any Coloured person who has the impertinence to take an interest in political affairs. I say it is a background of threats.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>My party submitted an excellent memorandum and, in fact, also appeared before the commission but the interesting thing is that no questions were put to its representative; no examination whatever took place and that despite the accusations inside and outside the House about the way in which my party is supposed to have behaved. I have referred to a background of intimidation and of visits by the security branch. In addition, we have had bannings, magisterial warnings, massive administrative action through the Group Areas Act, through the appointment of <span class="col_1357-1358" refersTo="page_0701"/>teachers and through job reservation. This is a background of utter futility for the Coloured people, a background of frustration. This frustration was immeasurably increased when the Government came to this House with legislation to prohibit so-called &#x201C;improper interference&#x201D;. By doing that they made it absolutely clear that no matter what the Coloured people wanted, no matter what the voters wanted, they were not going to be allowed to elect representatives of their own choice. So, their background is one of immeasurable frustration. This is why so few Coloureds came to the commission to give evidence and this is why they are showing so little interest in what is going on. The Coloureds are not politically immature&#x2014;they are politically emasculated and they have been emasculated deliberately by the Government. That is the truth of the matter. When one compares the amount of interest that the Coloureds have shown in this commission with the amount of interest they showed when the commission on separate representation sat in the early 50&#x2019;s, it is all too evident what has happened to the Coloured people over the last <b>20</b> years&#x2014;they have had the guts knocked out of them. The political guts has been knocked out of the Coloured people. That is why they took so little interest in this commission.</p>

<p>As regard this so-called &#x201C;improper interference&#x201D;, let us for a moment examine this flimsy pretext under which the Government now wants to strip the Coloured people of their rights. I have read through the report of the commission very carefully. But the only evidence I could find to &#x201C;support&#x201D; all this talk about so-called &#x201C;improper interference&#x201D; came from a witness named Brink. He was cross-examined by the hon. member for Peninsula, who is a very skilful lawyer. [Interjections.] The hon. member need not thank me for it. In a moment I am going to say other things for which he will not thank me. The hon. member put a series of leading questions to that witness&#x2014;a very unreliable witness I might add; I can give chapter and verse to this House of his unreliability. But the hon. member put a series of leading questions to the witness, questions which literally put words into the witness&#x2019; mouth. So, we end up with a lot of unsubstantiated insinuations and allegations which would never have been made outside the protection of the commission. There was another attempt at getting evidence but this was mainly aimed at the United Party. This was done by the hon. member for Outeniqua, who is at the present moment not in this House. He took advantage of the commission&#x2019;s sessions to take a good old swipe at the United Party for the way in which they had treated him when he had been a party organizer and was seeking nomination. At the same time he took a few swipes at the Progressive Party as well, but only by means of insinuations&#x2014;no evidence whatsoever which would stand up to an examination in a proper court of law. I might tell the hon. member for Peninsula that he and his witness would have both been slung out of any reputable court of law had the proceedings been conducted in that manner, and he knows it.</p>

<p>No, we did not. Any way, to continue with this, the real truth is there is not a shred of evidence about any of this improper interference. It came down in the end to some registrations which were improperly witnessed by commissioners of oaths. This man was not one of our employees; he was a State employee, as a matter of fact. But leaving that to one side, there was absolutely no evidence except about some of these registrations. Incidentally the people concerned were put back on the roll. It was not as if they were not entitled to be enrolled. The commissioner had not witnessed their applications in the correct way. It was not anything approaching the improper procedures that go on at white elections, believe me. This had nothing to do with the election as such; this was registration procedure. I have never heard anybody suggest that white people should be disfranchised because there had been irregularities at elections. I have never heard that suggested by the hon. the Minister of Sport even, and he has made some extraordinary suggestions in this House, believe me. If the Government really wanted to do something about these registrations, what it should have done, of course, was to make the procedure more easy for the Coloured people. That is what it should have done. It should not have made is so difficult for Coloured people to get on the roll, as it has done. It should have put its own offices at the disposal, in fact, of the Coloured people to enable them to be registered.</p>

<p>But the fact of the matter is, of course, is that the Government is not concerned about irregularities, not remotely; it is not concerned at all. What it is concerned about, what it had been concerned about all along, is the prospect of having four more Progressive <span class="col_1359-1360" refersTo="page_0702"/>M.P.s. That is really what has been worrying it. I could say this is a compliment to myself, but I do not, however, because I know the real background to this. The real background is that the Government cannot bear to have exposed the simple stark fact that, whatever they say about the Coloured people being so grateful for everything that has been done for them, about the Coloured people feeling so strongly about the magnificent work of the Coloured Council, whatever they say about that, they know perfectly well that, given the option, given the ordinary, democratic choice, the Coloured people would not opt for separate amenities, for separate representation, for separate freedoms&#x2014;they would opt against apartheid. They would back the people who promise them a fair deal; the people who promise them, and would give them if they had the power, equal opportunities for their children, compulsory education, vocational training; the people who would do away with group areas, and things like that. Those are the things that concern the Coloured people, not these separate freedoms that we hear so much about. And the Government knows perfectly well that, given the chance to exercise their political rights, that is the way in which the Coloured people would exercise those rights. By the way, they do not necessarily desire &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, which, incidentally, one of the somewhat ignorant men of the commission asserted to be the policy of the Progressive Party. It was the hon. member for Kimberley (South).</p>

<p>In fact that is what this whole commission is about, nothing else. The Government was trying to find a way, a tortuous way, but nevertheless a way, in which it could prevent the Coloured people from showing quite clearly and conclusively that they unequivocally reject the whole oppressive concept of separate development, of apartheid. As I say, the Government can say what it likes, it knows the ballot boxes would prove the contrary. The ballot boxes would prove the Coloureds are not accepting apartheid, and the ballot boxes would show that the acceptance, such as it is, is under duress, and that is a very different thing indeed from voluntary acceptance. The ballot boxes would show there is despair and resignation in this acceptance, and that there is no joy or hope in the acceptance of separate representation.</p>

<p>I say that all the guff we have heard and all the guff we have read about irregularities is just a smokescreen&#x2014;and I might say a completely transparent smokescreen at that. It is a smokescreen for the most blatant, cynical, unprincipled act of political expediency, and that is the only way that I can describe what is going to be the legislative follow-ups of this commission&#x2019;s report.</p>

<p>In 1950 the Government began its campaign to take the Coloureds off the Common Roll, and they did it then because the Coloured people were voting for the United Party. That is the only reason why they did it. Now, in the 1960&#x2019;s, the Government is now taking separate representation in Parliament away from the Coloured people for one simple reason only&#x2014;because the Coloured people were beginning to vote for the Progressive Party. That is all. The whole thing is as simple as that. That is what it was all about in the fifties and this is what it is all about in the sixties. It is because when the Government finds the Coloured people are voting into Parliament people they do not like, the Government simply and quietly removes the right of franchise from those people.</p>

<p>We hear from the Government, from members of the commission, and especially from the hon. the Prime Minister yesterday, that the Coloureds are going to be given something much better than they ever had. This is the third contention of the commission. Something much better, they say. Yes, the hon. member nods his head. It is a pity the Coloureds have not been given the option through the ballot box to decide if that is what they want. They have not been given a referendum to decide if that is what they want. No, Sir, not at all&#x2014; the white man always knows what is best for the Coloured man, especially if it is to the white man&#x2019;s benefit. It is said they are going to be given something better than anything they have ever had before. This brings me to the incredible statement I heard from the Prime Minister yesterday. He had the effrontery to stand up in this House yesterday to make the extraordinary statement that the Coloureds as a whole never ever had any political rights in the Republic and that they were now going to enjoy those rights for the first time.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, I will tell you if you will only be patient. This is really a barefaced piece of effrontery and I reckon the Prime Minister should get an Oscar for this, or at least the State President&#x2019;s prize. Let us give him the State President&#x2019;s prize for this. Let us examine his statement.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that the Coloured people as a whole did not have voting rights outside the Cape Province and Natal, and that only males had the vote. That is absolutely true. But the implication of what the Prime Minister said was that what they had was of no use to them anyway&#x2014;it was absolutely useless, and this is just not true. Because if it were true that the Coloured vote was meaningless, will somebody tell me why we had the constitutional crisis of the fifties&#x003F; Will somebody tell me why the Government made every effort to get the Coloured people off the Common Roll with these meaningless rights that they had&#x003F; Why did the Government try to pass a High Court of Parliament Act&#x003F; Why was it necessary to have a packed Senate&#x003F; Why did <span class="col_1361-1362" refersTo="page_0703"/>we have such a huge upheaval throughout the country for these &#x201C;meaningless votes&#x201D; that the Coloureds enjoyed&#x003F; Why did we have all that&#x003F; I will tell hon. members. It is because by 1948 the Coloured vote, limited though it was, was beginning to affect the elections in the Cape Province, and there were at least 20 seats where the number of Coloureds on the Voters Roll was more than the majority of the party that won. I take the Paarl election of 1948 just as an example. There were hundreds of Coloureds on the Common Roll there and the seat was won by 348 votes. That is why the Coloureds had to come off the Common Roll, and that is why the hon. the Minister of Defence, then a party organizer, went speeding up and down the country on his broomstick, or bicycle, if you like&#x2014;if he were a female, I would say broomstick, but he is a male, so I will refer to his bicycle&#x2014;he went up and down the country, this organizer, making racial trouble, preaching racial hatred, hostility, wherever he went, in every constituency in the Cape, saying, &#x201C;The Coloureds must come off the Roll because the Coloured vote is the determining factor in so many of the Cape seats&#x201D;. So for the Prime Minister to say this vote is meaningless is nonsense; it is absolute nonsense.</p>

<p>I might say, that apart from this aspect, other Governments in the past have been aware of the importance of the Coloured vote, not only this Nationalist Party Government, such as when they put the white women on the Roll and left Coloured women off the Roll, and when they removed registration qualifications for Whites, but did not remove them for non-Whites. All this was done for one reason, namely to reduce the influence of the Coloured vote. That is all. It was too influential. I might say the essence of having a vote is not to have universal franchise for a meaningless body but to have a vote which is going to have an influence on the power structure in the political life of the country. That is the reason for the vote, and that is why it was meaningful, even if it was limited, as long as it was on the Common Roll. I must say, even on the separate Roll, it has some meaning, simply because it was some sort of <i>quid pro quo.</i> Removal will therefore be a diminution of rights, but nothing like the diminution it was when the Coloureds came off the Common Roll.</p>

<p>Now I am afraid that I now have to turn my attention to the Opposition. [Interjections.] Now, I have not got much time, unfortunately, but I shall do the best I can &#x2026; [Interjections.] I want to say that it is just this demographic reality which has motivated the United Party&#x2019;s recent change of faith. Unfortunately this is true. It is a result of the demographic picture, the rising number of Coloured voters who could come on to the Roll. And by the way, if there had been proper registration, of course, the Coloured voters in the old days when they were on the Common Roll, would have affected many, many more seats in the Cape Province, which is why registration was made so difficult.</p>

<p>This is quite clear and this fact has emerged from the findings of the Connan Commission which advised the United Party not to adhere to its promise to put the Coloured voters back on the Common Roll. And it was not only the male voters who were actually on the Common Roll when they were taken off, as the hon. Leader of the Opposition seems to imply; it was a promise to all the Coloured males in the Cape and Natal who were already on the roll plus all the new voters would have to qualify.</p>

<p>surely no women! I know the hon. member would hate to have women. [Laughter.] He is not so keen on women in Parliament either. We know why that is. He knows that, too. Anyway, if this is no longer so, perhaps it is the hon. member for Wynberg who has changed his mind. But to return to the subject, the whole reason why the United Party has changed its mind about the Coloured franchise, is because an examination by the Connan Commission made it realize that within a foreseeable period, if Coloured voters were put back on the Common Roll in the Cape, no matter what the qualifications, they might very well outnumber the white voters of the Cape, within, as I say, that foreseeable future. This is why they changed their minds. They think that politically this is a terribly dangerous thing to propose. That is why they have changed their minds. Gone are the brave words about 100 year old common franchise. Gone are the strenuous arguments we listened to about the dangers inherent in the bloc vote. Those are gone. Gone are the promises that were made to restore the Coloureds to the Common Roll. The only thing that has not gone, are the 12 M.P.S that were supposed to go. Has everybody forgotten the strong statements made by the hon. member for Constantia, who is not here to-day&#x003F; He said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;I can give my unqualified assurance as Chairman of the Peninsula Council of the United Party that, on the day the United Party seeks to evade its undertaking to the Coloured people of the Cape, or to abrogate its promise repeatedly given, namely that the Coloured people shall not be politically segregated, the United Party will lose 12 M.P.s in the Cape. I know that possibility will never arise.&#x201D;</block>

<p><span class="col_1363-1364" refersTo="page_0704"/>Everything is gone, but the 12 M.P.s have not gone. They are still here. It was not necessary for the hon. member for Odendaalsrus to quote Mr. Strauss. There are much more recent quotations, by the present Leader of the Opposition. In 1960 Sir De Villiers Graaff said that &#x201C;the Coloured people had reached the standard where they should be accepted as a Western people. As a first step they should be restored on the Common Voter&#x2019;s Roll&#x201D;. In 1961 there was a United Party publication, headed &#x201C;The answer: you want it; we have it.&#x201D; I suggest they change that name to &#x201C;Have horse&#x2014; will trade!&#x201D; That United Party promise that Coloureds will be accepted as part of the Western group and that they will be restored on the Common Roll with the right to sit in Parliament if so elected, has been abrogated. Incidentally the right to have Coloured men sitting in Parliament was accepted by the United Party as long ago as 1961. This is not an advance, although it was put forward by the Press as a great advance by the United Party that they had decided that they would allow Coloured men in Parliament on a separate Roll, at the Bloemfontein Conference. Way back in 1961 they accepted the idea that Coloured men on the Common Roll would be allowed to sit in Parliament. I could quote from more recent statements, made in 1965 but it is all irrelevant. It does not matter any more.</p>

<p>It is quite true, as the hon. member for Parow and the hon. Leader of the Opposition said, that none of the Coloureds who did give evidence, were interested in going back to the situation as it was in 1955. Of course not. What the Coloureds want, is not to go back to that sort of Common Roll in the Cape and Natal, and for males only. What they want is what any intelligent political person wants, namely a meaningful vote throughout South Africa. In other words, they want Common Roll representation for all people who qualify, that is all people who can show they have reached certain standards of education or of integration with a modern industrial society, and a vote, of course, on a Common Roll for members of both sexes and throughout the country. Obviously that is what they want. I cannot see why anybody is surprised about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury, pointing to me, yesterday said: &#x201C;She and her party are enemies of apartheid.&#x201D; He is quite right. Of course we are enemies of apartheid. Shall I tell this House something&#x003F; It is my and my Party&#x2019;s democratic right to be enemies of apartheid. There is nothing sacrosanct about apartheid. It is not the will of God. It is simply the political machinations of human beings that have made apartheid and nothing else. If we purport as we do, to be a Western democracy&#x2014;and I have heard the hon. Prime Minister claim this time and again&#x2014;it is my right, providing I behave lawfully and constitutionally, to oppose official Government policy, to oppose apartheid as loudly as I care to do. And I shall continue to do so, and so will my Party, as long as I possibly can, because that is the meaning of democracy. These hon. members are so riddled with their authoritarian ideas that they have not the glimmering of understanding about Parliamentary democracy. They have not any idea that what is meant by democracy, is the right to oppose, to put forward unpopular opinions and to oppose the r&#x00E9;gime of the day. That is what Parliamentary democracy is.</p>

<p>It is our duty, our right to persuade the voters of South Africa that they should sling out this unrealistic oppressive policy of apartheid and that they should substitute something which is more in keeping with the thinking of the Western world. That is our right. [Interjections.] Yes, but then the hon. members must not say that as long as I put forward any ideas within the framework of apartheid, I am all right. But the minute I do not, the suggestion is that one is subversive and unpatriotic and that one is undermining law and order. One becomes an &#x201C;agitator&#x201D; immediately, as if it requires me or anybody else, for that matter, to tell the non-Whites about the disabilities under which they are suffering in South Africa. The vote, I say again, is only a means of exercising power and influence in the course of politics in a country. That is why removing the Coloureds from the Common Roll was a grave diminution of rights. And now the Government is replacing what they have here, where they could at least have had four representatives who might have represented the views they want; not the people who are being kept in office now for double the time they are supposed to be by the Government&#x2019;s edict, but people whom they would have chosen to represent their views. That is why this too is a diminution of the rights of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>I am not going to go into any detail about this legislative assembly which has been proposed by the majority report, because we will have a Bill dealing with it in this House, and I will be able to say everything I want to say about that Bill.</p>

<p>I just want to say that no pious talk about protecting the poor, immature Coloured person from political exploitation, no phoney explanation about bigger and better rights will have mitigated the blow that the Coloured people will suffer when this proposal is translated into legislative action.</p>

<speech by="#carr">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. CARR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I find myself in disagreement with the hon. member for Houghton. I say this for the simple reason that the proper way in which this report must be seen as well as its background and the problems before us requires a proper understanding of our history. That is the proper background against which to consider this report and to take a decision.</p>

<p>In 1853 when the Cape was a British colony, the British Colonial Office issued an instruction that Coloured males and Native males in the Cape must be put on the Voters&#x2019; Roll.</p>

<p><span class="col_1365-1366" refersTo="page_0705"/>This was done without their asking for it themselves. It was an instruction and a condition on which the Cape received representative Government from Britain. Coloured and Native males had to be placed on the Common Roll with the right to elect Members of Parliament. Between that instruction and the position in which we find ourselves to-day politically, there is a straight, unbroken line. Let us consider what happened when we came into being as a nation in 1909. In 1909 there were four colonies, namely, the Cape, Natal, the Transvaal and the Free State. In the Free State and the Transvaal where the white South Africans had their say on their own, only white people were elected to their legislative assemblies. It must be remembered that the placing of the Coloureds on the Common Roll in the Cape was something that was forced on South Africa from outside. South Africa never wanted it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#carr">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. CARR</person>:</from>

<p>I intend to talk about the National Convention now. When South Africa was to be brought into being as a nation we were in the hands of Britain and only the British Government could bring us into being as a nation by passing the South Africa Act. It is true that the Transvaal, the Free State and Natal, the most English part of South Africa, were very unhappy about the Coloured and Native franchise in the Cape. General Botha said that he had very strong views on the matter. But because he wanted to bring about Union, he obviously did not want to clash with the British Government. In a speech in 1909 in Johannesburg, General Smuts said that the majority of white people were against the Coloured and Native franchise. We see, therefore, that two great South African statesmen knew at that time that the majority of white South Africans did not want Coloured and Native participation in the Government of South Arica. General Botha said that the Cape could not be blamed because it was not responsible for the state of affairs. It had been forced upon them by an overseas nation. While Britain for her own reasons wanted the Act of Union passed, a compromise was reached through the offices of Natal whereby the Coloured and the Native franchise would be confined to the Cape only. Only white people could however be returned to Parliament. It is on record that General Botha&#x2014;and I hope that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is listening&#x2014;said that if there had been a different attitude about Coloured and Native Members of Parliament, there would have been no Union. There can be no question but that General Botha expressed the views of South Africa. We must remember that when we are a white minority nation in South Africa, we brought from Europe the industrial skills and the constitutional ability to rule and it was in the hands of white South Africa that South Africa&#x2019;s problems were placed. This was brought about through history. It must be remembered that an overseas nation attempted to tie the hands of white South Africa by writing into the Act of Union in section 35 that the Coloured and Native vote was to be entrenched in the Cape.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. CARR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am satisfied that the entrenchment of the Coloured and Native vote was brought about at the behest of an overseas nation against the wishes of South Africa. We have heard from the other side of the House talk about Coloured rights. During all the years that the Coloureds were on the Common Roll, it is undoubtedly true that they remained backward and illiterate. The vote was no good to them. Admittedly it was very useful to the United Party on many occasions but to the Coloured people it was no use at all. In 1912 the National Party was formed with a view to solving the South African dilemma in the light of our South African experience. After a long struggle the Bantu were in 1936 taken off the Common Roll and given three white representatives in this House. But after the war, in the uncertain, difficult and dangerous post-war world, the voters of white South Africa returned the National Party with a mandate to carry out their policy of separate development as a solution for our problems. White South Africa obviously intends to preserve the white identity. Quite apart from moral and religious considerations, it is quite obvious that we cannot rule and arrange things selfishly. It has been, and will always be, the task of white South African statesmanship to arrange things in such a way that the white minority is safe, but that the Natives, Coloureds and Indians are also happy and contented. If this is not brought about, we will have failed. Just as in 1909 the entrenchment that a foreign nation had put into the Act of Union was a stumbling block, so we found that to carry out our policy of separate development, the entrenchment of Coloured representation in the Act of Union was a stumbling block. I should like to tell the hon. member for Houghton that that is the reason for the constitutional crisis. White South Africa asserted its will to untie the knot with which Britain had tied its hands. That is the explanation. We were fought in our efforts to solve this problem. We were not fought as a political party or as South Africans of another opinion. We were fought as if we were a foreign invading enemy. As the hon. member for Malmesbury said last night, any foreign-orientated person, any communist Solly Sachs, was good enough to be inspanned in the fight against the legitimate Government of South Africa and, instead of argument, we had vilification and blatant hatred of the legitimate, properly elected white South African Government. There is no doubt that much of the trouble we have to-day at the Olympics and all over the world, stems from this hatred of <span class="col_1367-1368" refersTo="page_0706"/>South Africa to which a deposed Opposition gave expression in the world.</p>

<p>A close look at much of the anti-South African propaganda, convinces one that it unmistakably bears the stamp &#x201C;Made in South Africa by the United Party&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Houghton has spoken about Western democracy. It must be realized that the system of democratic government in which we believe and which originated in Western Europe and in Britain, only works when one race is represented in Parliament. It may sound all right overseas but every South African knows that it is no good saying that the Coloured people speak English or Afrikaans and that they belong to the same churches as the Whites. We know that they are different and that they react differently, and they will always react differently when mixed together with Whites politically. Not only do the Coloured people react differently, Asians also react differently. The Asian people in Kenya are not very happy with Bantu rule. We know very well that we must either have political integration or complete political separation, which most white South Africans want. We want a white Parliament. That is the unquestionable desire not only of Afrikaansspeaking South Africans in the National Party, it is the desire of the vast majority of South Africans, right across the language line. It will redound to the credit and honour of the National Party that it was this Government which gave us a purely white South African Parliament. This act will stand as a monument to the present r&#x00E9;gime.</p>

<p>Sir, this change that we are going to bring about is obviously the right thing. It will be to the advantage of everybody. Can anybody deny that since Bantu representation was removed from this House and the Bantu placed on the road to separate development, black/ white relations have improved tremendously&#x003F; The black man has never been as happy as he is to-day. As far as the Coloureds are concerned, we moved first in the direction of separate representation, and because we moved in the direction of separate development, we were able to uplift the Coloureds educationally and to give them a better deal in the economic sphere and as far as housing is concerned. But the Coloured leaders are not developing. The presence of white representatives in this Parliament stultifies Coloured development and, secondly, there is no question that there has been very serious interference. A seat in this House is very valuable to propagate political ideas and the temptation is always there to buy the votes of the Coloureds. I am satisfied that the proposed new legislation will be a tremendous asset to the Coloured people because for the first time they will have a body consisting of a majority of elected members, a body which will be able to give us and the outside world the genuine voice of the Coloured man. Sir, only people who are blind and refuse to see the truth will refuse to recognize this. Here is evidence of our good faith towards the Coloured people. If we wished to suppress him, would we give him this voice, not only in South Africa but in the world&#x003F; Would we give him this chance to develop&#x003F; Sir, I am satisfied that the decision we have taken will be of tremendous advantage to the Coloured man and to the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I must say that the hon. member for Maitland has got his history so cock-eyed that it is not worth while replying very seriously to what he had to say. May I just add that I do not think he is any asset to the constituency of Maitland. At the next election we are going to take his seat back from him.</p>

<p>Sir, without making any unpleasant insinuations with regard to the chairman of this commission, who happens to be a good friend of mine&#x2014;we served together in the Cape Provincial Council for many years&#x2014;I nevertheless ask my first question, and it is this: How seriously did the Government members on this commission apply their minds to the issues contained in the report&#x003F; I go so far as to say that their minds were made up long before they started, and I say that Government policy on this issue had virtually been formulated long before the commission completed its work. One can even go so far as to say, and I do so without hesitation, that the whole exercise might well be described as something of a farce if it were not for the opportunity which this commission undoubtedly gave to various Coloured and white bodies and to individuals to give evidence before it, which evidence has since been published for the public&#x2019;s benefit. That evidence, as has already been stated in this House, was published very much to the detriment of the Government&#x2019;s cause. Sir, why do I say that their policy was decided long before this commission even started its work&#x003F; In the first instance, the hon. the Prime Minister in this House, on the 22nd September, 1966, had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloureds who are represented here in the House of Assembly are not the Coloureds of South Africa. They are the Coloureds of the Cape Province only and only the male Coloureds of the Cape Province and only those who comply with certain qualifications. In other words, those are the only ones we have to deal with here. Those are the only ones represented here. What is the constitutional development as far as the National Party is concerned&#x003F;</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister makes the position quite clear; he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is to move further and further away from Coloured representation in the House of Assembly. I now want to tell the hon. member that that trend will continue and <span class="col_1369-1370" refersTo="page_0707"/>neither he nor I nor anyone among us will stop it. It will find its natural course. Personally I believe that it will find its natural course on the day the Coloureds tell us that they do not want this kind of representation.</block>

<p>Well, that is the last thing they have done. He ended by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe they will tell us that. I say the trend in that direction is irresistible.</block>

<p>Sir, the evidence given by Mr. Schwartz, the leader of the Council for Coloured Affairs, has been quoted in this House quite often in this debate and I do not intend to repeat it but let me remind hon. members of what his deputy leader said on this issue as far back as 1966. Mr. J. P. King, who was one of the members of the deputation that submitted a memorandum and gave oral evidence before the commission, wrote a letter which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> on the 26th September, 1966. This is what he had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is dit nie nou duidelik en konsekwent met aparte ontwikkeling om die vier blankes wat die Kleurlinge in die Parlement verteenwoordig, te vervang deur Kleurlinge nie&#x003F; Waarom nie vyf Kleurlinge daar plaas nie: een vir S.W.A. en een vir elke provinsie&#x003F; Die waarde wat die Kleurlinge aan parlement&#x00EA;re verteenwoordiging heg, is te groot en belangrik om hulle hierdie voorreg te ontneem.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kleurlinge in die Parlement beteken nie inmenging of integrasie nie. Dit is &#x2019;n ontmoeting op die hoogste vlak. Hierdie ontmoeting kan nie vir ewig vermy word nie. Inteendeel, dit is uiters nodig, en nodig nou voordat dit te laat is.</block>

<p>Sir, this was the deputy leader of the Federal Party who was asking as far back as 1966 for direct representation by the Coloured people in this House. I would like to know to what extent the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs anticipated the report of this commission, because I have here a copy of a page or two from <i>Alpha,</i> the journal of the Department of Coloured Affairs, giving an account of a meeting which the hon. the Minister held in Natal with Coloured leaders on 19th August, 1967, while the commission was still sitting. Let me quote what he told this meeting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said the Government had decided to assign to the Representative Council the administration of the major portion of the present functions of the Department of Coloured Affairs. The Council would at the outset &#x2026;</block>

<p>And I want you to listen to this, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Council would at the outset administer approximately R40 million a year and the Government was making an all-out effort to train Coloureds how to run the Council.</block>

<p>How does the hon. the Minister arrive at that figure of R40 million a year when the figure mentioned in the commission&#x2019;s report is R46 million&#x003F; It seems to me to be almost too good a coincidence to be an accident. Then, Sir, there is another point which has not been raised in this debate. You will find in the report of the commission that on the <b>22</b>nd August the hon. member for Peninsula took a point of order. He challenged the chairman on a matter which he considered to be of paramount importance because of a speech which had been made by the hon. the Prime Minister in Durban a day or two before. The hon. member for Peninsula said this&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_1371-1372" refersTo="page_0708"/>Now I should like to draw attention to a report which appeared in <i>The Cape Argus</i> of Thursday, the 17th August, purporting to report a speech made by the Prime Minister in Durban the previous night. For the purpose of the record I should like to read the news item. It is headed &#x201C;Hint that Coloureds&#x2019; M.P.&#x2019;s may go. Natal speech by Vorster.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At that time, Sir, the commission was still sitting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, in a speech in Durban last night, made a statement which appears to confirm that the Government intends to do away with representation for the Coloured people in the House of Assembly.</block>

<p>Sir, this was said when this commission was still busy with its work! The chairman of the commission had the temerity to tell us that their approach was completely objective when they started, but the account in <i>The Argus,</i> quoting the Prime Minister, goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At present four Coloured people&#x2019;s representatives sit in the House of Assembly, but in his address to the Natal Congress of the Nationalist Party in the City Hall, Mr. Vorster said that in addition to meaning separate residential areas, social amenities and recreation for the different racial groups, separate development also meant &#x201C;no mixed representation in Parliament&#x201D;. The Nationalist Party was determined that Whites and Whites only will be represented in Parliament in Cape Town. Mr. Vorster said: &#x201C;The Nationalist Party says that as far as Parliament is concerned, it will consist of White representatives only, while minority groups will get&#x2014;and legislation is being passed making it possible&#x2014;power to deal with those matters which affect them as a race.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The chairman of the commission, when he was faced with this point of order, tried his best to handle what must have been a very difficult position for him, and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; dat daar hoegenaamd geen Regeringsbesluit oor hierdie aangeleentheid geneem is nie en dat die besprekings vanjaar in die Volksraad en nou ook weer in Durban gedoen is in &#x2019;n gees van afwagting van die aanbevelings en verslag van die kommissie.</block>

<p>We challenge the validity of that interpretation of the Chairman of the Commission, because here is another indication of the extent to which this policy was fixed and clear in the mind of the Government long before this commission reported. On 3rd September, when they were still busy, writing under the heading &#x201C;Parliament Purely for Whites&#x201D;, <i>Dagbreek</i> en <i>Sondagnuus</i> carried a report which said that it was not improbable that the final steps to make Parliament representative only of the Whites were at hand. It quoted a statement by Mr. Vorster in South West Africa in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the white parliament at Cape Town there will under National Party policy be white representatives only, and the policy is based on principle.</block>

<p>Now, I would have thought that that was evidence enough to prove that the Government had already decided upon its policy before this Commission was appointed or even started work, and that they were merely playing for time. It is quite clear that in spite of the weight of evidence given against them in this report, they will press on with these plans. Of course, the only startling difference is that the Government&#x2019;s predictions, for example by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Coloured Affairs, that the Coloured people themselves would ask for these changes, have now been discounted once and for all. For the Prime Minister or the Government to suggest that these plans to remove the Coloured Representatives arise from the recommendations of this Commission, I say, is so much rubbish. The first warning we had that this was coming came in 1965 from the then Minister of Coloured Affairs, Mr. P. W. Botha, and as was his way when he held that portfolio, it was in the nature of a threat. We became accustomed to his addressing the House in that manner. It was a threat to the effect that unless everybody fell into line with Nationalist Party principles, the Coloured M.P.s might have to go. I quote what he said in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A measure of confusion exists in respect of the four white representatives of the Coloureds in the House of Assembly, and let me say at once that it was never intended that they should represent the Coloured population as a whole. They are representative of the limited number of voters who would have qualified under the old Common Roll. The Government have always adopted the view that it is bound to the continuation of this compromise taken a number of years ago.</block>

<p>This is the man who to-day repudiates the very promise he made in 1965. Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But I must issue a warning. If this limited representation by Whites is used to an increasing extent by the Opposition and the integrationists to attack the National Party&#x2019;s policy and to present it as being illogical, the time will come when this representation will have to be reviewed.</block>

<p>So it was a political manoeuvre which started a long time ago.</p>

<p>I am in effect to-day accusing the Government of bad faith and of fooling both the Coloured community and the white electorate over this issue as far as this commission&#x2019;s report <span class="col_1373-1374" refersTo="page_0709"/> is concerned. One does not have to think up any elaborate arguments in order to indict the Government and their firm determination to remove these people, which has been apparent for quite a long time. As far as the Coloured people are concerned, it is quite clear that the message to them is: Think Nationalist or else &#x2026; I would say that they have been convicted by their own statements, as I think I have shown this afternoon. In other words, the findings of the commission were neither sincere nor objective assessments, as they should have been, nor are the findings of the Commission in any sense in the interests of the Coloured people. As Dr. Verwoerd has already been quoted as having promised that the Coloured representatives would not be removed from this House, I do not intend dealing with that issue any further, and of course hon. members are only too familiar with what has been quoted here already, namely the letter to the Australian Prime Minister saying that representation of Coloureds in this House by their own people was one of the possible alternatives for the future. In other words, he was looking in exactly the opposite direction from that of our present Prime Minister. Among all the promises that have been given by that side of the House about the Coloured Representatives never being removed, I have a particularly personal and poignant memory about this matter, because in 1959, shortly after Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s New Vision for the Bantu people and the abolition of the Natives&#x2019; representatives from this House, a provincial election was held. The Government asked for a mandate in that election, retrospectively of course, to endorse the Prime Minister&#x2019;s new vision for the Bantu people, the creation of eight Bantustans. During that election, on one occasion I travelled 700 miles for the purpose of questioning the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration at a meeting at Maclear, and I asked him questions, and I have a cutting here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mrs. Taylor asked the Minister whether in view of his constant statements that Parliament would be a purely white Parliament, the Government intended abolishing the Coloured people&#x2019;s representatives, and the Minister replied that they regarded the Coloured people as part of Western civilization; they have no separate areas they can go to, so they will always be represented in Parliament.</block>

<p>Yes, Sir. That was Mr. De Wet Nel, so do not let hon. members opposite talk about our having had an &#x201C;omme-swaai&#x201D;, because we have all the evidence that we need to show the opposite.</p>

<p>Let us go a little further back. In 1929 the late Mr. Strydom as a member of a Select Committee supported a proposal for direct representation of Natives by Natives in the Senate. Dr. Malan later was in favour of extending the Coloured vote to the northern provinces &#x201C;sodat hulle dieselfde politieke regte met die blankes sal deel&#x201D;, and I am quoting from Hansard of 21st February, 1929, col. 242. He was in favour of votes for Coloured women, and he also pleaded that Natives and Indians should be represented by their own people in our Parliament. And not one single Nationalist in those days repudiated either Mr. Strydom or Dr. Malan over those statements. Towards the end of 1960 we know that <i>Die Burger</i> had a long correspondence on the subject, and many Nationalists expressed themselves in favour of representation by Coloureds in this House. But such expressions of opinion were by no means confined to the Cape, because, even after the Prime Minister and the Federale Raad of the Nationalist Party had issued an ultimatum that this was not to be the policy of the Nationalist Government, Willem van Heerden said in an article on 4th December in the paper of which he was then editor&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek kan nie die stelling van die Eerste Minister onderskryf dat politieke volwaardigheid vir die Kleurlingbevolking soos uitgedruk in verteenwoordiging deur hulle eie mense in die Parlement, &#x2019;n eerste stap na integrasie sou wees nie.</block>

<p>And after the ultimatum by the Federale Raad, Mr. Van Heerden went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Om redes wat ek al genoem het, glo ek dat daar in die een of ander stadium wel oorgegaan sal moet word tot verteenwoordiging van Kleurlinge deur hul eie mense.</block>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Odendaalsrus will note this. And, finally. General Hertzog at Smithfield, on November 13th, 1925, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In his case (the Coloured&#x2019;s) there can thus be no question of segregation, economically, industrially and politically. The Coloured man must be incorporated with us.</block>

<p>I want to deal very briefly with the question of how this whole matter of the Coloured franchise arose and why it has become so difficult. I agree with the hon. member for Houghton, who said that the basic motive in 1948 was pure, unadulterated selfishness on the part of the Nationalist Party and their lust for power. They had a majority of four votes in the House in the 1948 election. They wanted to entrench their position, and they started this ong battle just to get the Coloured voters off the Common Roll, because the Coloureds held the balance of votes in anything from 12 to 16 seats in the Cape.</p>

<p>Yes. All the mealy-mouthed talk which we have had over the <span class="col_1375-1376" refersTo="page_0710"/>years, of which we have become absolutely sick, about the Coloured people becoming a political football and that for that reason something must be done, is just so much humbug. The Coloured people never showed any signs of wanting to become a political football until the Nationalist Party threw them into the arena &#x2026; [Interjections.] Sir, why did we fight that battle&#x003F; We fought that constitutional battle and we are fighting this one on a matter of principle, a principle from which we have never deviated, namely that they should have representation in this House. General Smuts stated that principle very clearly&#x2014;I have not time to quote it fully&#x2014;in his Oxford Lectures way back in 1929, when he said that all people, of whatever colour, should have representation in this House.</p>

<p>I just want to make one point before I sit down. Why did we change to a separate roll&#x003F; Let me say that once this Government had introduced the principle of universal franchise, i.e. one man, one vote, into our political life for our non-white people, it was clear to anybody with any capacity for thought at all that the whole constitutional structure in South Africa would have to be re-assessed and revised. In terms of the Transkei Constitution Act, every Xhosa, man or woman, of the age of 21, if they had paid their taxes, is allowed to vote, and this is going to be extended to eight Bantustans. This is a political actuality. For purposes of the Coloured People&#x2019;s Representative Council Act of 1964, the same principle was applied. Men and women of 21 could vote with no further qualifications, and the same will apply to the Indian Council. It should be quite clear that the Government having established this as a political principle, any subsequent administration in South Africa taking over from the present Government before sovereign independence is granted, if it is ever granted, to these eight Bantustans, would be faced with the hard fact that all our non-white people, even in matters of limited jurisdiction, would have experienced what it is to vote on the basis of a universal franchise. Any new administration taking over would be very rash indeed to tamper with that right and suddenly turn to these people and say that now they had to have an educational or some other qualification. That is why our friends in the Progressive Party to-day, with their blueprint for qualifications, are way out on the end of a limb, because the Nationalist Party has entered the arena and has established the principle in South Africa of universal franchise as the basis of voting for our non-white people. [Interjections.] You will not be in power for ever. It became quite clear to us, and I was a member of the United Party&#x2019;s Connan commission, as hon. members know, that on the basis of one man, one vote, which hon. members on the other side have established, representation in this House, in terms of the balance of power, would have to be based on group representation. On that basis only can a balance of power be maintained. As for us on this side, at our national congress in Bloemfontein, the change was one not of principle but of mechanics, and the mechanics were forced upon us by the introduction of this principle of one man, one vote introduced into South Africa by the Nationalist Party in power.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to say that the main reason why the policy of the Government will fail, is because of its vagueness. Because plans for a Coloured council, whatever its limited powers, hold out no hope whatever for any further political development for these people; this is the important point. There can be no hope of them moving on from there, because politically it is a dead end.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>It can only end by being a source of frustration. The council will be hamstrung inevitably because of the limitations placed upon it by virtue of the finances voted for it. I say this is another abuse of the rights of the Coloured people who are taxpayers of this country on a very considerable scale. We ought to be concerned at this period of our history with means of contact and not of separation, and with how to share our rights and responsibilities rather than how to isolate everybody. All the cultural and economic assistance that has been given to the Coloured people by this Government has been largely neutralized by turning them into inferior citizens in this way, because they are now becoming a permanent underprivileged minority.</p>

<p>There are real dangers attached to the steps the Government propose taking. Once the powers-that-be legislate to eliminate all direct contact, and I mean direct contact by representation in this House at the highest level, an element of compulsion and interference of a most unpleasant kind is introduced, such as the questioning of members of the Labour Party amongst the Coloured people by members of our security branch. These are police state methods, there is no doubt about it, and they introduce a retrograde and very unpleasant element into our politics and our affairs.</p>

<p>The basis of Nationalist thinking in these matters appals us in the United Party. I want to say it is crudely the basis of that side&#x2019;s thinking that if one encounters political opposition which one dislikes or fears, one simply legislates that section of the community out of real political existence. This is totalitarianism, and nothing less.</p>

<p>I am proud to be a member of a party, a group of South Africans, who will have nothing whatsoever to do with this change which is being introduced by the Government. Let it go down in history that our party at least would have nothing to do with the removal of the Coloured members from this House, and my prediction is that this Government <span class="col_1377-1378" refersTo="page_0711"/> will live to regret its decision very much indeed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wynberg intimated in her speech that the members of her party were indeed political opportunists. She gave the reason for their having recently changed their policy in respect of the Coloureds, and she said that the reason for their present decision to grant the Coloureds representation on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll instead of on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll was that the National Party was extending the political participation of the non-Whites onto a broader plane. She spoke of a &#x201C;universal franchise&#x201D;. In other words, as long as the political participation of the non-Whites is limited to a small single group, a group such as 33,000 out of the 700,000 Coloureds, then they are prepared to give the Coloureds representation on a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, but as soon as the political participation is extended to an effective participation, then the United Party are no longer in favour of it and then they want to limit them in another way. If that is not political opportunism, then what is it&#x003F;</p>

<p>Another matter which the hon. member touched upon, is this. She said that as soon as the National Party encountered political opposition which they did not like or which they feared, they simply introduced legislation to get rid of the opposition. That is not true. Let me inform the hon. member what the basic principles of the matter under discussion are about. This matter concerns the political participation of various groups in the present political society of the whole of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>Obviously they are not the same as the Bantu. We recognize the difference, and it is precisely because we recognize the difference that we act accordingly. The hon. member for Wynberg also referred to a letter which the late Dr. Verwoerd wrote to Sir Robert Menzies and in which he allegedly suggested that an alternative policy would be to have Coloureds represented in this Parliament by Coloureds. He never indicated in that letter in any way that this was his point of view. He merely discussed and explained his policy and other policies in that letter. It was not his point of view at all that the solution would be to have Coloureds represented in this Parliament by Coloureds. When speaking to an ill-informed person, when speaking to someone abroad, I try to speak to him in terms which will make it possible for him to understand the circumstances. I try to put various points of view so that he may get an idea of the conditions that we have in this country. I am convinced that Dr. Verwoerd only directed the letter to a foreigner in the knowledge that he knew nothing of conditions in this country. He only sketched the general position as regards various points of view which provided possible solutions. It was not Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s point of view at all.</p>

<p>The hon. member also quoted what the late Adv. Strijdom allegedly said in 1929 on the possible representation of Bantu by Bantu in the Senate. One must, however, also bear in mind that those discussions always took place in circumstances that were practical at that time. The National Party principle has always been that we would under no circumstances jeopardize the future of the Whites in South Africa by granting common political representation to the various races. Because the Senate in itself is a body without any authority, a place where debates are held but where no legislation can be stopped, this possibility was suggested as one idea in 1929, when conditions in South Africa were totally different. But it has never been the policy of the National Party to have a common political development of the various population groups of South Africa so that the various political tendencies may be integrated.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to a few ideas expressed by the hon. member for Houghton. Her speech here to-day in fact represents the political opinion of the United Party of yesterday, it is the opinion of the Progressive Party of to-day, and most probably again the opinion of the United Party of to-morrow. After all, it is the position that only since the United Party has become the Opposition, an ever-declining opposition in view of the disposition of the electorate, who are moving more to the right, has this party&#x2014;indeed an opportunist party&#x2014;considered it necessary to move more to the right too in an attempt to catch the votes of dissatisfied persons who may possibly break away from the National Party.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member which National Party congress in Natal approved of the abolition of Coloured representation&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>The National Party congress in Natal, like the congresses of the party in other provinces, only determines the broad policy of the party and not necessarily every detail of such policy. The abolition of Coloured representatives is in this respect a detail of the policy. I shall come to that later. It is by no means a change of policy. The hon. member is apparently not aware of the difference between the method in which policy is applied, and policy or principles as such. I cannot blame any United Party member if he cannot distinguish between the two, because he naturally does not know what method or principles or policy is.</p>

<p>As I have said, the speech to-day by the hon. member for Houghton was merely the United Party policy or standpoint of yesteryear. She did mention a few points which were indeed correct, and which are in fact the reason why this side of the House is doing what it is <span class="col_1379-1380" refersTo="page_0712"/>doing. She claimed that, if the Coloureds were asked to choose, they would &#x201C;opt against apartheid&#x201D;. That is perhaps possible. The Coloureds may perhaps be opposed to apartheid. That is a possibility. But now I want to put the following question. If it is accepted that the Coloureds as a group are opposed to apartheid, while the overwhelming majority of the Whites are in favour of apartheid, what must the solution then be&#x003F; How must the problem then be solved&#x003F; If we have one group opposed to apartheid, a group which has no say in the political society of South Africa, a minority group in the country as a whole but the majority group in a province, while the group which has the political authority in their hands are in favour of apartheid, what must the solution then be&#x003F; Would it be a solution to apply the policy of the United Party, to offer a federal system&#x003F; Does the Progressive Party offer a solution in simply advocating an amalgamation because the Coloureds are opposed to apartheid and the Whites are in favour of it&#x003F; Is it not clear that tension would then develop&#x003F; If one group goes in one direction, and another group in another direction, will tension not be an unavoidable consequence&#x003F; Surely the whole purpose of a government is to reduce tension between the various groups in this country. And the only way to accomplish this, is to eliminate friction. If one group is in favour of the abolition of apartheid, while we as Whites are in favour of apartheid, surely they cannot force its abolition upon us&#x003F; We can then say that we as Whites prefer apartheid, and if the Coloureds want no apartheid, they can abolish it in their own community and say that they want no apartheid. But, Mr. Speaker, I know for certain that the Coloureds as a group are just as much in favour of apartheid where their group is concerned. They are not in favour of integration of the Coloureds and the Bantu, or integration of the Indians and the Coloureds. If they are only in favour of integration of the Whites and the Coloureds, and we as Whites are not in favour of it, then a solution has to be found. The only logical solution is the solution of the National Party, namely separate development. In terms of that each group can fulfil its own needs, its own development, the development of its own essence and future. It is for this reason that the National Party is in favour of the policy of separate development, because clashes will inevitably occur between the various group interests as long as there are such minority or majority groups in any country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Houghton also said that it was her inalienable right to be opposed to apartheid. I grant her that. It is her inalienable right to be opposed to apartheid, to attack it, to say whatever she likes. But the right which I do not grant her, is to incite minority groups, or even other groups, in order to create tension between Whites and other groups. If she is opposed to apartheid, let her be opposed to it within the group of which she is a part.</p>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>The tension has been eliminated by the policy of the National Party. The tension would not have been eliminated if it had not been for the consistent application of the policy of the National Party. I can refer her to any country in the world where there are different groups with different standpoints or policies, or which differ from one another in any way. I refer to India and Pakistan, to Kenya, to the island of Cyprus. I refer to the Catholics of Southern Ireland and the Protestants of Northern Ireland. I refer to the French and Flemish-speaking people of Belgium. Wherever there are people of different standpoints, tension is caused and clashes occur. The only way in which to reduce tension is separate development. I am convinced that this view is not appreciated in South Africa alone; in fact, it is being appreciated and understood more and more in the outside world to-day. Is it not strange that even in the United States the black leaders are already insisting that five of the States of the U.S.A. be given to them and that they will then have racial peace&#x003F; Is it not interesting that this line of thought is also gaining acceptance there&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am in fact grateful that the United Party is asking where our policy is heading. I shall furnish the reply at once. Our policy is heading in the direction of the recognition of diversity, and not in the direction of a merging (not on the highest level and not on the political level either) of the various national identities in this country. Our future direction will rather be towards the recognition of diversity, and if it should mean that in the future we must think of homelands for the Coloureds and the Indians, then we shall work in that direction.

<p>The question that I should like to put to the hon. member, <span class="col_1381-1382" refersTo="page_0713"/>is this: If the Coloureds and the Indians are not to be given their own homelands, what is the moral justification for his policy&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>It is precisely because we see it as the outcome of the moral justification of our policy that we are thinking in this direction. But now I want to put the counter-question: What is the moral justification of the United Party&#x2019;s policy&#x003F; The United Party is speaking of South Africa as a country with a unitary political future. The United Party sees South Africa, with its diversity of nations within our present political boundaries, as one political nation of the future. They now speak of a race federation. A race federation inevitably means that the highest political body, which exercises the highest authority over the entire people, must be a representative federal parliament. If it is a representative parliamentary body, then it means that there must be representation, not by means of surreptitious political deceit, but in a responsible manner which will do justice to the representation of each group: to the Coloureds, the Indians, to the eight main Bantu groups and to the one white group. But their policy now is that they will initially have 166 representatives in Parliament for the Whites, and they will now go so far as to have six Coloureds, or Whites as representatives of the Coloureds, elected. There will be so many for the Indians and so many for the Bantu in this Parliament. They say that they will provide a constitutional safeguard by laying down in the Constitution that there shall be no increase in political rights unless it is decided upon by means of a referendum in which only the Whites will vote. If there are 166 representatives in this Parliament for 3&#x00BD; million Whites, and for nearly two million Coloureds in this country only six representatives, even if they are their own people, where is the moral justification for it&#x003F; If only two representatives are to be granted to the half a million Indians in Natal, where is the moral justification for it&#x003F; If in course of time a demand is made, if pressure is exerted, for greater representation, and only the Whites must decide upon it, what will be the end result of that decision of the Whites&#x003F; Will it not be that, if they refuse it, tension will develop between the Whites and the non-Whites&#x003F; If they refuse it and the non-Whites insist on having a greater say in the central Parliament, the highest body, and if the United Party members should then vote with us against something like that, what moral justification do they have for wanting to move in the direction of one common political state&#x003F; In their policy there is not the slightest semblance of moral justification; there is only political bungling, political eyewash. If they are now apparently moving more to the right, it is only because they are in opposition and because they are bent on trying to catch more votes. When they were in power and in a position to give effect to their policy, they moved more and more to the left. I should like to mention another matter which has already been mentioned twice by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He has already quoted twice from Hansard what Dr. Verwoerd allegedly said about the granting of political rights to the Bantu in the Transkei. He wanted to make out that Dr. Verwoerd said that it was done as a result of pressure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#members">

<from>*HON. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>He did say that, not so&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#volker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that he did say it. But now I should like to sketch the difference between the reaction of this side of the House and that of that side of the House when pressure is exerted. If pressure is exerted, then it is clear that action must be taken as a result of that pressure. Dr. Verwoerd did act, but what direction did his action take&#x003F; The direction which he took was one of political realism and one moving along the separate directions in which the various races are going to develop separately. In other words, Dr. Verwoerd did in fact take into account the pressure, which is not being exerted specifically on South Africa, but the pressure of the political development throughout the world. He took into account that political pressure which developed and he acted realistically. But when that pressure developed, the United Party, through the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition, showed that they were political opportunists and that as soon as pressure is exerted, they move in the other direction to yield to the pressure. They want to move in the direction of joint representation. I do not mind admitting that when pressure is exerted, it is necessary to act in order not to have yourself destroyed by the pressure. But the way in which action is taken is a matter of principle. The National Party acts in accordance with its principles, but the United Party, as a result of its political opportunism, yields to the pressure and moves in the other direction. This is the fundamental difference between the United Party approach and the National Party approach.</p>

<p>I find it interesting to read in this report what the standpoint is of a person who gave evidence and who is a member of the Liberal Party. I read here of the evidence given by Mr. Pat Poovalingam, an Indian from Durban. He is a member of the Liberal Party, but not just an ordinary member. He is also a member of the Executive Committee of the Convocation of the University of Natal, and he occupies other important positions as well. His standpoint was that he actually preferred, as a result of the make-up of his political ideas, that we should all move into the future as one group. That will in fact be the end result of the United Party&#x2019;s policy. But he also says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I find the principle of separate development very attractive as it was propounded by Dr. Verwoerd. However, it is the practical application of that principle which I find suspect. I feel that Dr. Verwoerd had the right vision, but whether that vision is <span class="col_1383-1384" refersTo="page_0714"/>being carried into effect with equal justice for all, remains the question.</block>

<p>Here is a member of the Liberal Party who can quite see the point of the policy of separate development. He agrees that if that policy can be applied in practice, he is prepared to go along with it. But because the person who gave evidence here reads no National Party newspapers and because he only reads the newspapers supporting the standpoint of the opponents of apartheid, and because suspicion is continually being sown against the application of National Party policy, he doubts whether the policy, which he agrees is in fact the ideal solution, will be applied in practice in this way. Let me say here that it is the earnest and sincere intention of the National Party to give genuine effect to that policy in order to allow each population group in South Africa to develop to the full, according to its own initiative and according to its own needs and according to its own resources.</p>

<p>I cannot help it if hon. members have just entered the House in the last few minutes because they heard that interesting statements were being made. I have already answered that point. The fact of the matter is that the National Party is consistently giving effect to the basic principles of conservatism, namely the acceptance of the fact that there are differences between various groups of people in South Africa and that justice must be done as regards the development of the rights of each group. Each group has the right to have a political say in the matter of its own future. It is also our policy to move away from liberalism, the direction in which the United Party is the first step, the Progressive Party the second and the Liberal Party the third. It is our policy to move away from the direction in which the differences must be reduced and eventually obliterated. The National Party gives recognition to the differences which exist between the various language groups in South Africa. The Whites are one nation, although we are English and Afrikaans speaking. It is the standpoint of the National Party that each language group must be fully aware of the group to which it belongs. There must be no attempt to reduce and obliterate the differences, but we are one single nation. We cannot form one nation with the Coloureds, the Indians, the Zulu, the Xhosa, the Sotho, the Tswana and all the other groups. It is for that reason that we are moving, as Europe did, in the direction of recognizing the diversity that exists, just as it is possible to have economic co-operation within the Common Market of Europe, where there is even a free movement of the workers of the various nations for the sake of economic co-operation, but there is no intention of eliminating the political boundaries between the various countries of Europe, which are culturally already at a much higher level of uniformity than we in South Africa can ever achieve.

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have known the hon. member for Umhlatuzana as a philosopher of the Verwoerdianpurist school, but I am sure that if the late Dr. Verwoerd had been here to-day, he would have been amazed at how far the hon. member wants to go. What are we talking about in this debate&#x003F; Are we not talking about the realities of South Africa and the political problem as to how we can give the non-white people a share in government and how, in the second place, we can consult with them best, and yet, at the same time, keep control of the whole situation&#x003F; Is this not really what this debate is all about&#x003F; Here we have an hon. member who comes along and talks about a line of principle. He talks about a direction. All I want to know is in which direction is it, forwards or backwards&#x003F; What is the direction of this grand philosophy that he envisages&#x003F; What is contained in the majority report&#x003F; It is direction backwards, not forward.

<p>One finds that Dawie, the greatest protagonist of the new scheme of things, the greatest excuser as to the change from the old order, tried to nail us to this in the March issue of <i>The New Nation</i> on this matter. The hon. Leader of the Opposition dealt with this matter when he spoke in this debate. We are talking about words. Let us say the word is &#x201C;nasie&#x201D;. What is a &#x201C;nasie&#x201D;&#x003F; Is it not an entity which has completeness, freedom and sovereignty&#x003F; Is not that a &#x201C;nasie&#x201D;&#x003F; If that is a &#x201C;nasie&#x201D;, how do you give these three things to the Coloured people&#x003F; Where do you give it to them&#x003F; How do you give it to them&#x003F; The hon. member will concede, as a member of the purist school, that they should, in order to bring this to fruition, have their own homeland.

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.

Now, where is that homeland going to be&#x003F; How are you going to get them there&#x003F; What is their flag going to be&#x003F; Are they going to have a national anthem, etc.&#x003F; It was all well and good to talk <span class="col_1385-1386" refersTo="page_0715"/>about a Bantustan, or the Transkei. But I feel that one cannot talk about it in this regard. The hon. member is at least honest in his approach to this matter, but the theory of it is impossible of fulfilment. The hon. member went even further. He went so far as to say that the announcement made by the hon. the Prime Minister yesterday was not a change of policy, but a development of that policy. The first step in that development was to take the Coloureds off the Common Roll in 1951, and the second step now is to remove their representation altogether. The 1951 step, of taking them off the Common Roll and putting them on a separate roll, was part of the scheme, was it not&#x003F;</p>

<p>He says it was. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana is not alone in this. The hon. member for Parow, who is not here now, knows about this matter. He also said that it was part of the plan to scrap Coloured representation in Parliament altogether. If this is so it is the most terrible, frightful fraud that has been perpetrated on the voters of South Africa. If the 1951 removal of the Coloureds from the Common Roll to a separate roll was part of the scheme of things, and there has been no change in policy so that this is the logical conclusion of their scheme, then it is quite disgraceful that anyone could have taken them off the roll on the basis upon which that was done.</p>

<p>It was a positive improvement.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Improvement for whom&#x003F; This is the question. Improvement for the Nationalist Party&#x003F; Improvement for a party that has now got itself in a cleft stick&#x003F; A party that cannot explain how it is going to deal with the various race groups&#x003F; The hon. member has given an answer. But I wonder whether the hon. the Minister for Coloured Affairs who is sitting here is prepared to subscribe to the answer that he gave, namely that in order to bring this to fruition there will be a Colouredstan, a homeland where they will be. Let us be realistic about this. Let us examine what we are talking about. What we are talking about is the issue whether in keeping control of the situation, keeping control of South Africa and its developments, we can allow the non-White groups to take part in government firstly, and whether we could also consult with them properly. This is what we are dealing with. And this is exactly where this Government finds it impossible with its present approach to fulfil those two things. And I shall indicate that we on this side of the House have the only formula whereby these two things can in fact be achieved.</p>

<p>What is participation in government&#x003F; It does not mean sitting in this House. We do not participate in government. Participation in government is the oiling of the wheels and the turning of the wheels of administration of the day to day lives of people that are necessary in modern government and in a modern social state. It is the civil service with its executives, executive decisions and the courts. That is participation in government. That is why we the other day supported a Bill which dealt with the Indian Council. Inadequate though it was, it was an interim step in the creation of a communal council. There is no other word for it. It is a council to deal with Indians, with the affairs of the Indian community, wherever they may be. That is what these councils are for. On that aspect as I understand the position, the commission are at one. Everyone wants this council to be set up and they want its powers to be developed, increased and improved. That is in fact the only way you can allow non-white people to participate in government, unless you are prepared to break down all the barriers and make your civil service a multi-racial, competitive organization. That is an impossible situation in South Africa. Now, how do they participate in government&#x003F; And that is why this aspect of it should be supported, namely the creation of a council to deal for example with matters that concern only the Indians. The hon. member who has just sat down must know this, namely that the Indian community is a different community. They are part of our country and part of our province. But they are a different community and they have all sorts of different practices and customs. They have different divorce laws and so on. And these are the matters they should deal with, matters that concern them only. When we have done that we have given them the power, the facility and the machinery to take part in government. And if I may coin a phrase of the hon. member for Yeoville, that is the genius of race federation. That is the kernel of the thought. And that is what this Government has realized and is precisely what they are now taking over. We are glad, but remember where this came from in 1961.</p>

<p>But, that is not the issue upon which we are joined here. We join issue on this report with the decision to remove the Members of Parliament who represent the Coloured people. It is clear that that is the decision the Government is taking. They are going to accept the majority view. But, having set up all these councils about which much has been said&#x2014; the Coloured Council has as yet not even been set up&#x2014;why must the members representing the Coloured people go&#x003F; What is the function of a Member of Parliament representing the Coloured people&#x003F; This is the sovereign Parliament which determines their destiny. It is here in this Parliament that the future of all the race groups will be decided, as well as matters of defence and so on, which are not going to be entrusted to any of these councils. If that is so, we should surely consult them when we make decisions concerning them. Is there anyone in this House who will say that we should not consult them&#x003F; But how do you consult them&#x003F; I wonder whether hon. members <span class="col_1387-1388" refersTo="page_0716"/>have ever asked themselves the question as to what they are doing sitting in this House. Apart from the members of the Executive, members of the Cabinet and Deputy Ministers, what is the function of the other members here&#x003F; It is to represent a point of view, to represent a group of people. The only reason why we have a House of Assembly is that it would be inconvenient for everyone to come to one big place. So everyone here represents a point of view. And we sitting in this House are part of the consultative process ourselves. This is the place where consultation takes place, here in a debate. This is consultation. The elected members come here and form themselves into groups for convenience and they then debate the issues which concern the people they represent. That is consultation.</p>

<p>They may not take much notice but the majority view is formed after hearing debate. Any suggestions that we want to make, any amendments we wish to move to the legislation, we move. And the House considers them and votes on them. Whom do you consult with best&#x003F; Do you consult best on a matter through a Government Department, or do we in this House consult&#x003F; That is the decision. The Government can make any executive decisions it likes. But it has to come back to this House. In this House we make laws&#x2014;the Executive does not make laws. We make the laws here and I am sure that we would like to know, whether we make laws concerning the Indian people, the Coloured people or the Bantu people, what they think about those laws. We would like to be able to debate it with them. And it is no answer to me as a Member of Parliament with my own rights here and with an opinion which should be well informed, to be told that the Government, the Executive, is going to consult with them and that they will tell me what their decision was. That is not the issue. The issue concerns that which we have here. What do we have in Parliament&#x003F; How does Parliament, the sovereign legislature consult&#x003F; And how does it consult except by having a spokesman here in the House with whom you can debate the matter and whose views can be debated and decided by this House&#x003F; Not by the Government. This is a fundamental principle. It is not done by the Government but by this House. And if one of their representatives for example wants to move an amendment to a Bill, then he will move it. And it is for the House to decide whether or not that amendment is acceptable and whether the law should be amended in that regard or not. It is for the House, for us, and not for the Government.

<p>Let me say this to the hon. member too. The only people who can tell us what that race group thinks are the people who were elected by that race group in the same way as we operate. Because they will express in this House the views of the people that they represent. And, if they do not express other views and do not properly represent their views, they will be thrown out at the next election. This is the process, the normal process of representation in any body that there is. That is the whole thing. What the Government has decided to do is to reject for all time in our Parliament, government by debate in the matters that concern all the race groups. That is what is happening. It means that we will never be able to properly debate an issue in this House. We will not have government by debate. It almost boils down to the position that the opportunity to test the opinion of this House is denied to those representatives. The idea is that that should be done through a Government department and whether that is so for every race group in that there should be some sort of liaison also with this Home. But, that is not <span class="col_1389-1390" refersTo="page_0717"/>enough. That is liaison only in those matters entrusted to that council. It does not have a function in a matter such as defence or railways or anything of that sort. It does not have a function there. It is in fact quite impotent to do it that way. I appreciate that there are other views on the subject. The hon. member for Houghton says that the object of the vote is to have an influence in the power structure. Sir, that may be so in a homogeneous society, but I doubt very much whether one could justify it&#x2014;one cannot justify it&#x2014;in a multi-racial society. This point was also taken up by Dawie, the main spokesman of this new turn-around-the-corner, which is now declared to be a follow-through in the same direction.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am quoting from <i>New Nation</i> of March. 1968. not a propaganda journal. This was written by Dawie&#x2014;The findings of the commission have not yet been made known but the two basic lines of thought behind its deliberations appear: Must the Coloured group representation in Parliament be regarded as a growth point for the future or as a remnant of an extinct order&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, it is very nice if you can phrase it this way. I may say that he started off by saying that at its congress at Bloemfontein the United Party had decided to have one country, one nation, one loyalty, an argument which my hon. Leader has dealt with. Sir, this is the next argument with which he justifies this extraordinary turn-around-the-corner&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Should it be regarded as a growth point, then it cannot remain indefinitely at four M.P.s and they cannot indefinitely remain white. The Coloureds are in numbers about half as many as the Whites and their proportion is increasing.</block>

<p>Sir, this is the growth point approach. Surely there is a difference in function, as I have tried to indicate, between participation in government and consultation. This is not a growth point: nothing grows from here. You cannot, by giving to the Coloured people or the Indian people or any of the non-white people, representatives in Parliament, create something whereby they can take part in government, any more than the presence of members of the Opposition here is a growth point for something else, except more members in the House, and that is not the purpose of having them. Let us remind all the Jeremiahs who have spoken in this House that in our history there have always been representatives of non-Whites in this House. In 1936 when the Native Voters were removed from the Common Roll and placed on a separate Roll, there were three representatives for them in this House and they sat here from 1936 until 1959 and their number was never increased by one. Why&#x003F; Not because they did not want greater representation. Obviously and quite simply because this Parliament was not prepared to pass a Bill giving them greater representation. It is as easy as that. Throughout the days of United Party Government and thereafter the Nationalist Party Government, the number remained at three. Was there any talk of a growth point from that&#x003F; They were here for 23 years, but did anyone say that they feared that the presence of the Native representatives here would be a growth point for greater representation&#x003F; Of course not. I think we must differentiate between the functions and in considering this report we must consider why it is that we want the Coloured Council; why it is that we support the expansion of the Coloured Council. It is that the Coloureds may participate fully in government in matters which concern them. And it is, in the second place, that we want representation by them to continue in this House. Speaking for myself, I am very much wiser and very much more able to decide what should be done and what decision I should make as a member of this House by reason of the fact that there are persons who represent the Coloured people, who represent their views, who speak on their behalf and who tell me. here, when a decision has to be made, what those people think.</p>

<p>They may not be in this House at the moment but the fact remains that these representatives were elected by the Coloured people and they will represent their views until such time as another election is held and other views are put forward.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>For more than three centuries the white people and the brown people in this country have been walking the same road. When we speak of the brown people and their future in our political set-up, and if we look back over the years that have passed, many reproaches can probably be made when the two white political parties discuss matters with each other. But because I believe that with the proposed legislation we are on the eve of a completely new dispensation in regard to the brown people in this country, I want to adopt a positive attitude in looking at this debate. But before doing that, I wish to move at this stage&#x2014;</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<p>Whether in the light of the report of the Board of Trade on retail price maintenance his Department intends to take steps to encourage or to discourage the abandonment of retail price maintenance in respect of (a) petrol, (b) motor oils, (c) tyres and accessories and (d) motor car, motor truck and tractor spares.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#wood">

<from>The MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>The relevant report of the Board of Trade and Industries is still under consideration and it is therefore not possible at this stage to give any indication whether steps in accordance with the Board&#x2019;s recommendations will be taken.</p>

<p>I may add that Government control is exercised over the prices of petrol, tyres and accessories. In the case of petrol, price maintenance is not applied by the petrol companies, but prices are fixed for the different areas in terms of a tripartite agreement between <b>my Department, the petrol companies</b> and the Motor Industries Federation. In the case of tyres and accessories, price maintenance is, however, applied by the tyre manufacturers, but the companies have to obtain my Department&#x2019;s prior approval before any increases in prices are introduced.</p>

<p>As far as motor oils, motor car, motor truck and tractor spares are concerned, price maintenance is in many instances applied by the manufacturers of the products, but no control over the prices of these products is exercised by the Government.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>At the conclusion of business yesterday I was pointing out that the white people and the brown people had been walking the same road in this country for more than three centuries. As I was saying, this has been a long road, one extending over three centuries, and we have been covering it in our own particular way. When we analyse this long process of development, there is one outstanding period which may be described as the most unfortunate period, when a small section&#x2014;and please note, Sir, only a small section&#x2014;of our brown people was being used mercilessly in our political arena to act as arbitrator between White and non-White in this country. As a party man who played an active role in our party machine, I recall those days and how United Party women from such select residential areas as Kenilworth, Rondebosch and Pinelands, came to constituencies like Vasco, Parow, Malmesbury, Worcester, Paarl and others on polling day. What did they come to do&#x003F; They came to drive Coloureds to the polls on polling day, once every five years, and to use them there as arbitrator between White and non-White in this country. And that evening, after the closing of the polls, those United Party women returned to their select areas in the Peninsula, and for the next five years they were unconcerned about the weal and woe of the Coloured population. Thereafter those people had to fall back into their poverty and return to their poor residential areas. That was one of the most unfortunate periods in the process of development of our brown people in this country. In those days the brown people were no more than a cynical, futile, power political factor in the political disputes of the white man. Brown community development in its true sense and at its present rate only became possible after a National Government had launched a search for new patterns for the future of our brown minority in this country. Even to-day any person who wants to be fair in his judgment must bear me out that the old, shadowy, ambiguous position of the Coloured on the fringe of our white community is in the process of being exchanged for that of a population group in its own right. Just see how this pattern has taken shape over the past number of years.</p>

<p>Over the past number of years announcements dealing with brown community development in the news columns of our newspapers have come to read like a beautiful and many-sided serial: A new dispensation in education for our Coloureds, colossal plans for house-building and school-building projects, recreation places and facilities, a Coloured Development Corporation, a Coloured Persons&#x2019; Council, and a university, which will have a student body of nearly 600 enrolled students this year already. This is already more than twice the number of students enrolled at the old Victoria College at Stellenbosch in the days when it produced leaders such as Dr. Malan, General Hertzog and General Smuts. What a contrast to the old dispensation which extended over many hundreds of years and during which it was difficult to produce impressive evidence of the positive side of any policy which preceded the policy of separate development. Now we find that we are already far advanced in a forward movement in which work on the future of our brown people is being done at a totally new rate in numerous spheres by numerous bodies and persons. Sir, as a young man in this House I listened with the greatest admiration to the courage, to the spirit of adventure, but also to the confidence which radiated from the Leader of my party, from the contribution made to this debate by our hon. the Prime Minister two days ago. An idealism, far removed from the days when the brown man, as a result of the struggle about his political role, had to be regarded and treated as a threat to the integrity and the standards of our white community, radiated from his vision of the future for the brown man who at present and at this stage shares this country with us.</p>

<p>But I want to proceed. Is it not remarkable that over the past number of years we, the Afrikaner Nationalists, have been the very people, who, in a new spirit, have been in the forefront with new plans, with a new vision, for brown community development in this country&#x003F; Afrikaner Nationalists have devoted their best energies to the practical development of a true, brown civilization, which must be properly manned by leaders of ability, breeding and character. This is the spirit in which and the courage with which we, in pursuance of this report, are once again going to take a further step in respect of a brown dispensation in the future pattern of our country. I think it is fitting at this stage for us to turn our eyes in the direction of the brown man and, while we are creating a new order at this stage, for us to talk very seriously to the brown man in our country and tell him certain things. What should we tell him&#x003F; To-day, on this occasion already, we should tell the brown man this: Here is a further opportunity for you, but remember that in the end a nation has to save itself. Now opportunities for understanding the white man and cooperating with him are being opened to the brown man as never before. Therefore the brown man must come forward and must prove to us that he does in fact deserve the bigger role, the higher status, within the borders of the country we live in. If the brown people prove this, the opoortunities to develop into good and valuable partners in the Western civilization of the white people are virtually unlimited. Here there is an opportunity now for giving new momentum to a <span class="col_1419-1420" refersTo="page_0732"/>national attitude from which the old and often unfounded disbelief in and suspicion against each other can disappear to an increasing extent.</p>

<p>If we study this report and if we give further consideration to the new order and future pattern of South Africa, we may tell one another that there may be other alternatives to those which may flow from this investigation. What are these alternatives&#x003F; I want to mention a few of them without motivating them in detail.</p>

<p>In the creation of new patterns, as I have indicated, there are certain alternatives, and the first alternative is that this strong, white Government of ours, this National Government with its large numbers that has been governing South Africa for the past 20 years, could immediately have done one thing as an alternative. It could have decided that the brown minority in South Africa had to be pushed out to the black majority. But it is axiomatic that this side of the House and this Government will not follow that line of action. Something like that would not be a sound policy for the white man, because it would in point of fact mean suicide for him. To us on this side of the House it is a matter of elementary common sense to lay down the principle that the brown and the white people belong on the same side in the real and great contrasts threatening in Africa. And they belong on the same side not because of an irrevocable anti-black hostility, but because of that equilibrium which is so essential to political peace.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana mentioned a second alternative, i.e. the possibility of the creation of a separate homeland for the Coloureds. Basically it is true that at the present time there is no homeland of their own for the Coloureds in which they can realize their aspirations. That is so and it is as a result of that fact that this idea is being put forward by way of suggestion. Let me say immediately that theoretically such a suggestion does not appear to be impossible at the moment. There was a time in the history of my party when some of our most prominent leaders said that a policy of having separate states in South Africa, of the creation of separate freedoms for the Bantu people, was not practical politics. And yet, as far as this is concerned, we are standing knee-deep in a new dispensation at the present time, so deeply so that even if the United Party were to come into power to-morrow, it would not be able to undo what had been done. I say the idea of a separate homeland for the Coloureds is one which exists in theory. The technological and industrial revolution of our times may make the implementation of such an idea possible. I do not know. There are great and courageous visions in regard to the future of man. To-day physical scientists are doing things and dreaming with new fantasy about the future of man. But at this stage we must still be realistic and do what has to be done. On the face of things it would seem to me as if White and Brown are destined to live alongside each other&#x2014;during our lifetime, during the lifetime of our children and during that of our children&#x2019;s children. Within our borders we shall still have to seek for many years to come for those boundary lines which are necessary for good neighbourliness. I say "good neighbourliness&#x201D;, because none of us, no supporter of the United Party or of the National Party, wants to see the perpetuation of a dichotomous symbiosis in South Africa at present, a condition in which White and Brown will constantly irritate each other. We are looking for a new order. To-day we may tell one another that the time of &#x201C;the bl. &#x2026; boer&#x201D; and &#x201C;the Hottentot&#x201D; are drawing to an end for ever. As far as that is concerned, we are approaching a completely new world.</p>

<p>Then there is the other alternative&#x2014;that of gradual absorption or integration. I do not even want to discuss this alternative. In our South African politics it is as dead, as much of a fossil, at the present time as the United Party is in South African politics.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the proposed legislation, the legislation which will flow from the report of this commission and from this discussion will take us further with our <i>modus vivendi,</i> the way of this party to seek, untiringly and wisely, the ideal formula for coexistence in this beautiful country of ours.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana informed us yesterday that his side was giving serious attention to the creation of a separate &#x201C;homeland&#x201D; for the Coloureds. This has just been confirmed by the hon. member for Moorreesburg. I think I have good news for the hon. members. A few days ago I had an opportunity of talking to some of our most prominent Coloured leaders. The question of a &#x201C;homeland&#x201D; cropped up in the conversation, and the good news I have for the hon. members is that the Coloured leaders do not think that this is such a foolish idea.</p>

<p>The concept &#x201C;homeland&#x201D; does after all mean a place where a population group has its roots. Their approach was that they did in fact have a homeland in the sense in which the Government uses the term. That homeland is Cape Town and the Western Province. And every single one of the Coloured leaders told me that they would not have any objection in the least if the Whites wanted to move out! Therefore, hon. members opposite need not think so seriously about the matter. The only thing they now have to do, is to go forth and convince the Whites of this. And perhaps they can commence this task of convincing the Whites just a short distance away at Bredasdorp and Swellendam. And once we have arrived at this new order, in which the Western Province has been given to the Coloureds, and Natal has been divided between the Zulus and the Indians, the Whites may go and crowd one another out at Putsonderwater. Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and the hon. member for <span class="col_1421-1422" refersTo="page_0733"/>Moorreesburg have simply proved an old truth, i.e. that once one has started thinking in the wrong direction, as the Government is doing in regard to the Coloured question, one lands oneself in one ridiculous situation after the other, with the one position being more unbearable than the other.</p>

<p>Therefore I prefer to come back to a more mature discussion of the matter. Hon. members opposite&#x2014;and these include the hon. member for Moorreesburg&#x2014;tried to create the impression in this debate that a great, new dispensation for the Coloureds was being born from the report of the commission, and that this new dispensation would be so comprehensive that that would justify the abolition of the Coloured representatives in this House. But, Mr. Speaker, we have already had the debate in a new dispensation for the Coloureds, i.e. in 1964. In that year the Government established a new Coloured Persons Representative Council by legislation. The only thing is that the Act has not been applied as yet. But a new dispensation with a new, comprehensive Coloured Persons Council, a dispensation which extends the franchise to all Coloureds, men and women, over the age of 21 years throughout South Africa, a dispensation with legislative power to the Coloured Persons Council on which the Government may decide at any time, and an executive committee, the chairman of which is to be appointed by the State President&#x2014;this new dispensation has already been laid down in legislation, i.e. in the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act of 1964. The only thing the Government is proposing now is to increase the number of members from 46 to 60. Put the debate on the great new dispensation for the Coloureds has already taken place and the announcement has already been made. The new dispensation has been created in its entirety&#x2014;it only has to be carried into effect. Therefore only two things are implicated in the matter to-day: Firstly, whether the Coloured representatives are to be abolished and, secondly, the question of &#x201C;improper interference&#x201D;. Now the strange thing about the position is that when the new Coloured Persons Representative Council was established by legislation in 1964. a council which has legislative power and which extends the franchise to everyone throughout the country, there was no talk of removing the representatives of the Coloureds from Parliament&#x2014;on the contrary. I recall that debate very clearly. It was a fairly lively debate. The reason for that was a certain statement made by me. The liveliness resulted from a statement made by me and recorded in Hansard, Vol. 10, col. 4174. I stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that we on this side of the House are honestly convinced that this Bill&#x2014;referring to the new legislative Coloured Persons Council&#x2014;is not intended to supplement the representation of the Coloureds here (in the House of Assembly), but eventually to replace it.</block>

<p>I then proceeded and said (col. 4175)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If that is not so, then we ask the hon. the Minister&#x2014;that is the present Minister of Defence&#x2014;who is in charge of this Bill to give us his solemn assurance that it is the policy of the Government that the members representing the Coloureds sitting here will be a permanent part of the future which the Government envisages for the Coloureds. If he cannot give that solemn and clear assurance, it will be all the more reason why we cannot support this Bill.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, now the Minister of Defence, replied, &#x201C;I give it now.&#x201D; But then I proceeded, &#x201C;Will the Prime Minister also tell us that he no longer stands by what he said previously&#x003F;&#x201D; The Prime Minister then replied, &#x201C;I have already said it here&#x201D;, meaning that he was no longer standing by what he had said in 1961. These were solemn assurances that the new dispensation, the new Council, would not replace the M.P.s but would supplement them. What is more, every speaker on that side who participated in that debate supported that point of view, namely that there was no intention of abolishing the Coloured representatives. One of them was our esteemed ambassador in Brussels, advocate Fritz Steyn. This is what he said in the same debate (col. 4148)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As regards our own solution, we accept it as a permanent feature of our political system that the Coloureds will enjoy representation in the Central parliament &#x2026; That, therefore, is the first thing we feel the Coloured community should have, namely representation in this House.</block>

<p>I then asked by way of interjection, &#x201C;For always&#x003F;&#x201D; Mr. F. S. Steyn replied: &#x201C;Yes, Mr. Speaker; there has never been any doubt about that &#x2026; The National Party has never doubted that the representation of the Coloureds in this House, on a separate voters&#x2019; roll, was a permanent feature of our constitutional development.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, one asks oneself, &#x201C;What explanation will this representative of ours overseas, over in Brussels, have to think up to justify the self-destruction of this Government undertaking&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister quoted from a speech made by his predecessor in 1961. That was quite correct. But that was not the full story. In April, 1961, the late Dr. Verwoerd made his well-known &#x201C;state within a state&#x201D; speech in Parliament. That was the speech from which the hon. the Prime Minister quoted. Mr. Speaker, as the hon. the Minister of Defence himself subsequently explained with reference to that speech, Dr. Verwoerd was not announcing a policy at that time, but was merely putting forward the idea of a &#x201C;state within a state&#x201D; as a direction to be considered. Dr. Verwoerd said at that time that if the concept of a state within a state with parallel parliaments became a reality then in <span class="col_1423-1424" refersTo="page_0734"/>those circumstances there would &#x201C;not be any need for representation of Coloureds and Whites in a common parliament&#x201D;. The idea of a state within a state was thrashed out fairly extensively at that time. It was discussed in the Press as well as here. Hon. members will admit that it was not at all favourably received. Consequently it remained an unfruitful idea until the previous Prime Minister himself admitted in 1963, and I am quoting his words. &#x201C;There cannot be two parliaments within a single state.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>When addressing the Indian Council in Durban. I am reading from the report of <i>Die Burger</i> of 27th August, 1963. When the idea of a state within a state fell away, there was every indication that the Government under the leadership of the previous Prime Minister, and especially as a result of the feeling which existed within his own Party, had reconciled itself to the idea that the Coloured representatives had to remain. That is why we received such strong assurances that the Coloured representatives would not be removed. They did in fact want to take steps to eliminate &#x201C;interference&#x201D;. That was said. And for the remainder the hon. the Minister&#x2014;now the Minister of Defence&#x2014;made it clear that they would prefer representatives here to be designated, not by popular vote, but by the new Coloured Persons Council. Since 1964 one emphatic assurance after the other has been given. I have here a publication. <i>The Coloured People of South Africa.</i> It was being distributed abroad as recently as 1966. At the beginning there is a message from the Minister of Defence, at that time Minister of Coloured Affairs. On the first page there is a statement in which it is said that a committee of the Cabinet plus a special committee of the National Party of the Cape Province, as well as the Minister of Coloured Affairs, can give the assurance that the idea of abolishing Coloured representation will not be entertained.</p>

<p>That is what Parliament is there for. It is easy for political parties to upbraid one another with having changed their points of view, and we have heard quite a number of reproaches in this regard across the floor. But we must remember that a Government is more than a political party; a government represents the country. It speaks officially on behalf of the country. Therefore it is always a very serious matter when a solemn undertaking, dealing with such a fundamental matter as parliamentary representation, is discarded by a government in its own time like a piece of paper thrown into the wastepaper basket. It is a reflection, not only on the Government, but on the country it represents. The important point, one which we want to emphasize once again, is that the assurance that the Coloured representatives would not be abolished was given in connection with the very new dispensation we are discussing here.</p>

<p>We have before us a report of a commission. Let me say that I have taken the trouble to read through practically the entire report. I have left out small parts, but I have read practically the entire report. I must honestly say that I might just as well have refrained from doing so, because it is time for us to realize that it is unnecessary to appoint a commission in order to determine what the Coloureds, or any other population group, want. In this regard, the Coloureds are no different to the white South African or the white Afrikaner. His aspirations are exactly the same. The Coloured man wants to be nothing less than an ordinary citizen of his country in full and equal measure with the white man.</p>

<p>That is a question of method. In this regard the Coloured is no different to the White. He wants to be a citizen of South Africa in an equal measure with the white man. This is what he wants, and that will always be so. That will never change. He will never be satisfied with any mock parliament or any substitute for full citizenship. Dr. Malan once expressed it very effectively: A nation which does not insist on his rights, is a nation of slaves. To think that the Coloureds will ever be satisfied with anything less than that with which the Afrikaner is satisfied, is something which can only be accepted by people who believe in ghosts. Therefore a commission need not look for very long to find what the Coloureds actually want. Their aspirations are exactly the same as ours. The only thing which we as white rulers have to determine is to what extent we, in the circumstances of South Africa, are able to meet them. It is as simple as that. Nor did we need a commission in order to determine what the Government would eventually do.</p>

<p>In spite of the undertakings giving by the Government in 1964, I have never had any doubt that it would look for all possible and impossible reasons for abolishing the Coloured representatives. The true reason is very simple. If the Coloureds had elected National Party representatives over the years to sit here and to support the policy of the Government, there would have been no problems. Then there would have been no talk of abolishing such representation. On the contrary, then they would have used such representation as the best means of proving to the world that they had the solution for all and that their policy was succeeding and being accepted by all. But what has in fact happened&#x003F; The longer they <span class="col_1425-1426" refersTo="page_0735"/>have been in power and the longer their policy has been implemented&#x2014;and now we are speaking more specifically of the Coloureds but for the greater part this applies to the other population groups as well&#x2014;the more the Coloured has given his support to the political line of thought most removed from that of the Government. This was so in the case of the Bantu, and for that reason the Bantu representatives were abolished. This has become so in the case of the Coloureds, and that is why their representation in this House now has to be abolished as well.</p>

<p>I want to say that it is true that the Coloureds to-day come to realize more and more that they have to make the fullest use of every political and administrative handle which they can get hold of, however imperfect it may be. Whereas before they tended to boycott public bodies founded on apartheid they now utilize every possible channel which exists in order to improve their material position. And I think they would have been foolish if they did not do so. But the mistake the Government is making is to interpret every acceptance of opportunity by the Coloureds, which they regard as being the least they are entitled to, as support for the Government&#x2019;s policy, which in fact it is not. The Government may indicate as much as it likes that it has a solution for South Africa, or that it even has a solution for the world now, and that all groups are satisfied and support its policy. The position in respect of the Coloureds surely proves the exact opposite. Every election to be held, be it an election for this House or one for the Coloured Persons Council, will to an increasing extent come out in favour of those political lines of thought which are removed from separation on the ground of colour and colour alone. I know that the Government realizes this. The further the Coloureds progress and develop materially, the stronger and more militant will the rejection of separation on the ground of colour alone become. The Government is aware of the fact that there will then in increasing measure be a living proof of the rejection of its line of thought. The rejection will grow in intensity until the dogmatic policy of compulsive separation has been replaced by a policy of co-operative association; of the acknowledgement of each group for what it is, with co-operation without domination. [Interjections.] The term &#x201C;co-operative association&#x201D; comes from a South African Quiz published by the State Information Service!</p>

<p>The Coloured representatives are being abolished because in the eyes of the Government the Coloureds do not send the right people to Parliament. Mr. Speaker, all the other reasons are window dressing. Things such as irregularities at elections, exploitation, back-riding and interference by Whites, are all things which really occur. But as far as irregularities are concerned, the arena of white politics are littered with court cases about irregularities at elections. Everyone who used to be an organizer, knows what irregularities took place in regard to postal votes in days gone by. I have no knowledge of anything as irregular in Coloured politics as the things which occurred in this field in white politics. But we do have a means of rectifying such things such as the means we employed in changing the laws relating to postal votes. That is idle reason for the existence of the Electoral Laws Act. If the Electoral Laws Act is not sufficient, there are means of amending and improving it. As far as back-riding and exploitation are concerned, one regrets having to say this, but these things are characteristics of politics all over the world. Where would the Government have found itself to-day had it not exploited racial feelings as skillfully as it did&#x003F; Would it ever have come into power&#x003F; As far as &#x201C;interference&#x201D; is concerned, I want to say that this is a creation of the Government itself. The Government has laid down that the Coloureds are obliged to elect Whites. The result is that the Government has therefore invited Whites to interfere in the elections of the Coloureds. They are doing so at the invitation of the Government. There has always been a very easy way of eliminating interference. The simple solution is for the Coloureds to elect their own people. Then three-quarters of the problem of interference will be solved. For that reason the right of the Coloured to elect his own people forms the essence of the policy to which we subscribe. We subscribe to group representation on an independent voters&#x2019; roll, which in our opinion is the only way in which we can really achieve national leadership amongst the Coloureds, with the privilege of sitting here in Parliament themselves so that White and Coloured may consult man to man on the highest level and hammer out the future of the two groups that are so intertwined as the Whites and the Coloureds are and always will be. Why are we in favour of that&#x003F; In the first place we believe that the abolition of Coloured representation may create the false idea in the mind of the white man that he can get away with all kinds of formulae and sham solutions which avoid the essence of the problem. In this way we will not be rendering the white man any service.</p>

<p>The second reason why we want the Coloured representatives to remain is this. We admit that there is scope for a Coloured Persons Council. The Coloured Persons Council has a function, but that function is at the level of local government. At that level it is a step forward. But the powers of the Coloured Persons Council will always remain very limited. I want to wish the Council the greatest measure of success possible, but personally I do not believe that the Coloured Persons Council, broadly speaking, will ever exceed the status of even a provincial council. I admit that administratively it does open up fine opportunities and new channels for the Coloureds, but politically speaking it will remain extremely limited. Let us take one of its most important functions, namely education. Once one has debated matters of policy, education is handed over to the Administration. Then the political debate on the matter ceases. The fact of the <span class="col_1427-1428" refersTo="page_0736"/>matter is that the real political functions of this Council are going to be and remain extremely limited. All matters of real importance will remain under the care of this Parliament. Do not forget that thousands of Coloureds are working in the postal services; thousands of Coloureds are working on our railways. Our Defence Force is an integrated one. The previous Minister of Defence told us, &#x201C;The members of the South African Coloured Corps were now an integral part of the S.A. Permanent Force.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Together with us they will have to defend South Africa. How can one ensure their loyalty in the long run when there is such a gaping difference in quality between their and our citizenship. The Police Force too is integrated. Thousands of Coloured policemen, who are armed, have to assist along with the Whites in maintaining order and ensurang the safety of everyone in South Africa to-day. In regard to all these vital matters&#x2014;postal services, railways, police, defence, living space, general political policy&#x2014;in regard to all these aspects which give meaning to the concept of citizenship the Coloured Persons Council will never have any say, because the lives of the Coloureds and of the Whites are indissolubly connected. But there is yet another reason, and that is that the existing Coloured Persons Council, to which the hon. the Prime Minister rightly paid high tribute and which he presented as being such a responsible body, has unanimously resolved on two occasions that they wanted representation by their own people in this Parliament. If they are such a responsible body, do they not deserve to be thanked by way of the Government&#x2019;s recognizing their feelings and moving in that direction&#x003F; But another thing we often forget is this: Sir, our work here as members of Parliament is not only to make a few speeches. Ask any member what his most important work is. We are inclined to pay such close attention to groups that we forget about the interests of the individual. But the major part of the work of an ordinary member of Parliament is to deal with the representations of individuals. because the individual has access to his M.P. and his M.P. has direct access to the Government. This is the work we do day after day. Some people can go to their M.P.C. when it is a matter concerning the M.P.C., but others come to their M.P., and I say that the access which an M.P. has to the Government, is of so much importance to the individual in the country that it will be an injustice to the Coloureds when they have no direct access to an M.P. who can also cope with their individual interests.</p>

<p>There is a further consideration. I must say that I am sorry that the Prime Minister tried to talk away the effect which his plans will have to the outside. The vast majority of Coloureds have always been concentrated here in the Cape Province and for that reason they have been given the vote here. Even though a minority number elects their representatives, the thing that is important is that they have representation in Parliament. They have a voice in the highest legislative body in the country. That is what is important.</p>

<p>That is unimportant. They have parliamentary representation. It does not matter whether it is the top layer that elects their representatives. There is parliamentary representation for the whole. I am not saying that we are to allow anyone outside to dictate to us, but at present there is a U.N. Committee that makes a study, in the minutest detail, of the laws made by the Government&#x2014;not of what we say here&#x2014;but of the laws themselves. Let us have no doubt about this, it is not going to take long before this new step announced by the Government is going to be blazed abroad overseas. Since our position is so delicate as it is, need we place more ammunition in the hands of our enemies at the present time&#x003F; Here we are allowing a big chance to slip by. I am convinced that if we were to follow the direction of direct group representation for the Coloureds, it would not take long before half our struggle overseas would be won. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down was as confused and unconvincing this morning as I have ever heard him be. This morning he advanced arguments in which he really became a Progressive in the main and during which he stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that the aspirations of the Coloureds were exactly the same as those of the Whites. What his remaining comments amount to is that the Coloureds must therefore be completely integrated into the white community and must move in the same stream. Sir. if that is the view of the hon. member, then he does not know the Coloured population. I want to read to him a single passage from what one of the respected Coloured leaders said in this connection, and this is the opinion of S. Dollie. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If asked whether we wish to be in Parliament &#x2026;</block>

<p>(this Paliament)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; our answer is certainly &#x201C;yes&#x201D; as long as our affairs are in the hands of the white Parliament. But allow us to manage our own <span class="col_1429-1430" refersTo="page_0737"/>affairs, then we have no further interest in your Paliament.</block>

<p>Hon. members opposite, as well as the hon. member who has just sat down, completely fail to appreciate the real difference between White and Coloured. There definitely are similarities. We admit that the Coloured population is predominantly Afrikaans-speaking and has close associations with the white community. We admit that they are a predominantly Christian community. These are good points and we can appreciate them, but we cannot fail to appreciate that the way of life and the aspirations of the Coloured population are essentially different, and anybody who fails to appreciate this is dreaming political dreams which are far removed from reality.</p>

<p>I want to refer to only one more statement made by the hon. member. He referred to the necessity of direct representation here for the Coloureds and to the value of a Member of Parliament to the Coloured in connection with his needs and his problems. But this is precisely one of the practical problems facing the Coloureds. With their limited representation in this Parliament&#x2014;four Coloured representatives who represent very extensive areas, especially the few representatives from the rural districts &#x2014;the Coloureds generally have no access to and no practical representation in this Parliament. Hon. members in this House will admit that members of the Coloured population often come to us with their problems because we are the ones who are near and who understand their problems. If one talks to them about Mr. So-and-so, they tell you &#x201C;I do not even know where he lives&#x201D;. If we keep in mind the fact that a new Coloured Persons Representative Council, in which the majority of members will be elected members, is being established not only for the Cape Province but for the Coloureds in Natal, the Free State and the Transvaal, we can form an entirely new picture in our mind&#x2019;s eye, and that picture is that someone will be within reach of every Coloured over the length and breadth of the country, someone who will really be his representative in the Coloured parliament. That parliament will co-operate most closely with and will have access to the Department of Coloured Affairs and through that Department and the Minister of Coloured Affairs it will have access even to the Cabinet of the white Parliament. That is the very thing we envisage, namely that the Coloured population will in a practical way have a political instrument and have access to the Government of the country and be able to bring their needs to the right door in this new dispensation which is being held in prospect. Therefore I say the hon. member who has just sat down, was talking at random this morning and I gained the impression that he could not convince himself either. At the beginning he made the statement that if one was following wrong lines of thought, one landed oneself in some ridiculous situation time after time. Well, this I cannot apply to anyone else with as much conviction as I can to him himself, because if I look at the political career of the hon. member I only see Mr. Japie Basson in some ridiculous situation time after time.</p>

<p>I want to proceed by pointing out in the first place that when we look at the report of the commission, it strikes us that from all the evidence submitted one fact emerges about which there can be no shadow of doubt. That is that the present political dispensation, the present form of parliamentary representation for the Coloured population, is insufficient and unsatisfactory. Virtually no one came forward and expressed the opinion that what they now had at their disposal was their ideal or was satisfactory. We read that in the evidence of the Federale Volksparty and in their memorandum. We read that in journals in which responsible people write. Time and again the idea comes to the fore that these people see the present representation in Parliament as a kind of substitute. As one of them puts it, they are expected to follow like a small dog follows its white master, and with that they are not at all satisfied. I say this becomes clear from the evidence presented to the commission as well as from general evidence and the whole attitude of the Coloured population. I just want to read to you what appears in the commission&#x2019;s report in the evidence of the Federale Volksparty (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We as the leaders of the Coloureds are coming to realize that the past policy of integration has always played into the hands of the opportunists.</block>

<p>Mr. Fortein stated in an article which he wrote at one time, and he gave this as his considered opinion and not as an opinion expressed by way of question and reply before the commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus the Coloureds in the Cape have been used for white parties&#x2019; political ends. Our vote in the end came to count for nothing. Our cherished vote only had some importance at general election times.</block>

<p>You see, Sir, this is an expression of that feeling of frustration and disappointment which is very common amongst our Coloured population and their leaders, even amongst the people who do not co-operate at all and who do not agree with the present policy of the Government. Indeed, the fact that the Progressive Party has, according to the latest developments, gained such tremendous support with its high offer of integration, is an indication that what exists is unsatisfactory and not acceptable. I think I need not dwell on this any longer.</p>

<p>I should like to continue by emphasizing that amongst the Coloured population, as is the case with any other nation in the world and particularly amongst its group of leaders, there is a strong desire for self-development. This is also clear from the evidence before the commission. There responsible people said, &#x201C;Our problem is a problem of development&#x201D;. What is more, those people revealed that they would like to participate in that development. They <span class="col_1431-1432" refersTo="page_0738"/>would like to take the initiative. They would like to continue giving the lead in that process of building a nation. They yearn for a nationhood of their own and a national identity of their own and they know that they can never be Whites. This is accepted by the vast majority and they say they are proud to be Coloureds. They also yearn to serve their own community. On the road of integration, on the road of limited, white parliamentary representation for the Coloureds, the Coloured population has always been withheld from realizing those aspirations, and from realizing themselves. Allow me to read only a few sentences from an article by Mr. C. I. R. Fortein. He writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is a very interesting and intriguing development in our sad and ailing history. At last the real ideal Coloured man is beginning to stir within his own bosom. This spirit of self-consciousness and self-respect is the blessing in disguise which has been brought about by the Government&#x2019;s policy of parallel development. It has brought the Coloured man face to face with the realities and logic of the traditional South African situation. So the Coloured man, who is proud of being called Coloured, has come to realize and to learn the national golden lesson of history of looking at himself instead of forever looking at and watching the white man. He is beginning to ask the all-important national question of what his role is in a modern South Africa &#x2026; He is aware of the historical fact that he is being called upon to move forward on his own feet and not on the backs of others &#x2026; Let us remember that only an ailing child goes on using the conflict between his parents as an excuse for his own imperfections of character. This means that we must keep out of the political conflicts of the white man.</block>

<p>Then later he says about the Coloured&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He is no longer prepared to allow the white man to organize and plan his life for him and so forever control his future destiny.</block>

<p>I quote this as an illustration of the line of thought found amongst responsible Coloureds on a reasonably wide front, namely that these people have a serious desire to share in the process of building a nation in their own community, in the creation of a tradition of their own. Why was the white Afrikaner frustrated for so many years. Because he was forced, as a British subject, to reconcile himself with British loyalties, with a British crown and with foreign ideas. He kept up the struggle and at present the Coloureds refer to that in their writings and say that as the Afrikaner has struggled to achieve his national self-realization. they too would like to struggle to become a nation, to have an existence of their own and to render service to their own community. It was Dr. William Nicol who once said that without service a nation can have no heroes. As long as we keep the Coloured population on the level of a population group without the opportunity of rendering service to their own community, without cultivating a national self-respect and a national consciousness, there is no proper opportunity for service and there is no opportunity for the development of a Coloured national hall of fame. As long as we continue on that road, the Coloured population will feel frustrated and will continue yearning for the day and the opportunity to be able to be themselves, and to be able to bring out the best in themselves. As long as he is following as a small dog follows his white master on a lead, there is no opportunity for pride in his own past and there is no inspiration for him for the future and no strength for the task and the challenge of creating a future of his own for himself. When I read the ideas expressed by thinking, responsible Coloureds, it strikes me every time that these people feel the need to create a future of their own for the Coloured population. They accept that there will be a white nation in South Africa and in us they see the guarantee for their safety against the vast Bantu majority in Southern Africa. They accept that and they acknowledge that with gratitude. But they also want to be themselves; they want to be a nation. And as long, as we want to treat and regard them as being an inferior appendage of the Whites, they will remain frustrated and will continue asking and yearning for the day when they will be able to work at the realization of the ideal of their own nation and a nationhood of their own. To me, as to everyone on this side of the House, it is a privilege to testify, when we look back on the work of the National Party over the past 20 years, that we have not only sought the realization of our own national ideals, our ideals as white South Africans, but that we have also been engaged in creating the pattern under which the Coloured will also have an opportunity of becoming a nation. Actually they are not a nation yet: they still are a population group only. Only here and there do we find signs that they are rising from the ashes, that they are becoming conscious of a nationhood of their own. When we started with the implementation of the policy of group areas, we started with the creation of a good and healthy community life amongst the Coloureds. One may go to Bellville. to Parow, to Goodwood&#x2014;indeed, virtually to any town in the Western Cape&#x2014;and everywhere one still sees the remnants of the old dispensation: Coloured shanties amongst the white houses, in backyards and slum areas. There was no opportunity for them to have a healthy community life. We then started with the creation of group areas, the provision of better housing, and the creation of large complexes for these people. Gradually a national consciousness started to develop amongst these people. It was the National Party that had made that possible for them. We had started extending the educational facilities of the Coloureds; we had established a Department of Coloured Affairs and in that Department we created ample opportunities for the Coloureds to start qualifying themselves in the administration of the country. We had started <span class="col_1433-1434" refersTo="page_0739"/>developing his rural areas, something which the Coloureds on the platteland in particular greatly appreciate. We so often have the experience that responsible Coloureds admit that they could never have thought that these things would have been made possible for them by a National Government, because they had always heard that the National Party was the suppressor of the Coloureds. But now it is the National Party that has made these things possible for them, that has created these facilities for them and that has opened these opportunities to them. In addition we have given the Coloureds their own development corporation which is training Coloured businessmen in the interests of the Coloured community itself. To me it is also self-evident and logical that we must arrive at the point where we have to give the Coloured his own political instrument. Very well, let there be restrictions at the beginning. After all, they do not have a great deal of experience in this field. I think we would be making a big mistake if we were to give the Coloured too large a measure of self-government at this stage. But we expect that they will be taking a greater share in the management of their own affairs with an increased measure of skill. This is the best proof of the fact that we are engaged in giving the Coloured the opportunity of not only enjoying certain facilities but also realizing his political and national aspirations. We are not afraid to give the Coloureds the opportunity of developing a leadership of their own. The Coloured population is large enough and the task awaiting its leaders is great enough to keep them occupied for centuries. A tremendous task awaits them and I can well imagine that they will be happy in cherishing and realizing the ideal of building and creating their own nation.</p>

<p>We may debate the question of a homeland of their own for the Coloureds. At the moment I do not have the time to do so. The hon. member knows that we need not necessarily attach all these things to any particular place, to a homeland. These people are co-owners of South Africa and know that South Africa also belongs to them. Therefore they can continue exercising their rights and realizing themselves without their necessarily having a homeland at one particular place. However, I do not want to elaborate on this now.</p>

<p>It was an English-speaking person, one Dr. MacMillan&#x2014;I think he was the moderator of the Presbyterian Church at one time&#x2014;who said in 1938 that they, as English-speaking people, had to help the Afrikaner in realizing his national identity, his national ideals, the destiny of his nationhood. Only then, he said, would we become a true nation in South Africa. I think it is the task and duty of the white man in South Africa to give the Coloured population at least the opportunity of realizing a nationhood of their own and a national identity of their own, as we are doing in the case of the Bantu, If they can serve themselves, they will be happy. If they have the prospect of achieving something and making good within the boundaries of their own communities&#x2014; even now there are signs of that here and there&#x2014;they will be happy. Then we may rest assured that we shall have good neighbourliness between the Whites and the Coloureds in the future.</p>

<p>The theme of the speech of the hon. member for Piketberg was one of &#x201C;nasiebou&#x201D; as far as the Coloureds are concerned. But what worries us about the policy of the Nationalist Party is, what do they exactly contemplate under &#x201C;nasiebou&#x201D;&#x003F; Towards the end of his speech, in reply to an interjection from the hon. member for Simonstown about &#x201C;tuislande&#x201D;, he said we could talk about this some other time as he did not have the time to do so now. So this question of a homeland for the Coloured people, a Colouredstan, remains the 64 thousand dollar question. We cannot leave it in the air in this manner. It was put pertinently by my leader to the Prime Minister. But there was no answer. And we are still waiting for an answer. As yet not a single member on the other side has tried to answer that question. One of the backbenchers on the opposite side, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, talked about a group which was thinking about this.

<p>From the moral point of view it can be justified. It is logical. But to the Coloureds they make no offer of that nature. And when the hon. member for Piketberg quotes Fortein, who apparently wrote an article in which he said that he wanted to keep out of the conflicts of the white man, that they, the Coloureds, do not want the white man to control them any longer and that they want to preserve their own identity&#x003F; Is he offering Mr. Fortein that&#x003F; Are they offering Mr. Fortein that&#x003F; Of course they are not! All we hear from them is that the Coloured will remain under the control of the white man. They will manage their own provincial affairs and affairs of that nature but they will remain under the control of the white man. The supreme power will be vested in this Parliament where the Coloured man has no representation. Naturally he quoted Mr. Fortein. I could have quoted Mr. Fortein. I could quote him against the Government. One cannot quote him in favour of the Government. The same is the case with Mr. Dollie. He quoted him too. Mr. Dollie said: &#x201C;Allow us to manage our own affairs. Then we will have no interest in your Parliament.&#x201D; Naturally, if one gives Dollie his own country where he manages his own affairs completely, he will have no interest in our Parliament. Naturally they will have no interest in our Parliament. In fact, I was going to quote these speeches against the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member has told us what the Government has done to assist the Coloureds. But I say it would be shocking, had the Government in 20 years not done anything to assist the Coloureds. The way they talk one would think the Coloured group is the only one they had been giving any assistance. But, surely, it is all part of the development of South Africa. Everybody else has got assistance; why should the Coloureds have been left out&#x003F; The Whites, the Indians and the Bantu have got assistance. Are we now to be thankful that this Government has done anything at all&#x003F;</p>

<p>You did not show me anything; you might have tried. The commission was appointed to inquire into the prohibition of improper interference. That is how the Bill reads. I must say that, if one reads through the evidence given before that commission, and I think every member on the Government&#x2019;s side will agree with me, there was certainly no comfort for the Nationalist Party. That is why they have to try and ignore the evidence that was given there. But the commission was appointed to deal with this Bill which is before us. What was the main purpose of that Bill&#x003F; It did not mention political rights or the abolition of the coloured vote. The Bill dealt purely with trying to stop interference in the political affairs of other races. It is very noticeable that not one person, sympathetic towards the Government or against it, who appeared before that commission, supported that Bill. Even the majority of the members of the commission could not support the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Odendaalsrus asked why the minority members did not help the majority to formulate some measure for prohibiting improper interference. I say that we did not do it, for the same reason as they did not produce a Bill, because it is impracticable; one cannot do it. That was the difficulty that faced us. We found no way of being able to do it.</p>

<p>You just listen and I hope you will repeat it outside. It is all very well to sit here and be brave. Go and say it outside. This paper has the courage to publish it. It has the courage to face up to actions and actions are being brought against it. It does not hide behind protection as that hon. member does here. It reads further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wie was die dertig blankes wat hulle in 1963 so aktief in die Transkeise verkiesing ingemeng het&#x003F; Verskeie groepe met verskillende politieke leerstellings was destyds baie bedrywig in die Transkei. Die name van hierdie manne is aan die Regering beskikbaar gestel. Moontlik sal dit nog die week in die Volksraad tydens die debat oor die verslag van die Kommissie na Onbehoorlike Inmenging bekend gemaak word.</block>

<p>We are still waiting. Then it goes on to give the names of five people who they say took an active part. Four of them have been banned <span class="col_1437-1438" refersTo="page_0741"/>and named as communists. The other, I understand, is taking action against the paper.</p>

<p>Then they go on further to talk about the Progressive Party and they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is beweer dat Roley Arenstein&#x2014;nou in die tronk&#x2014;hieraan aandadig was.</block>

<p>And then, having mentioned the communists and Arenstein who is in goal, they go on in the same article to link up others&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">Na verneem word, is daar blykbaar ook nog steeds &#x2019;n noue verband tussen die Demokratiese Opposisie van Knowledge Guzana en die V.P. in die Transkei.

<p>It says it is still the case. It is continuing. Who is the chairman of the United Party in Umtata&#x003F; I am the chairman. That is right. Now this allegation is an ascertainable lie. This interference they say, is continuing. I want to say this. I have let my house for the last three years. It is alleged his car is standing outside my house. The people living in my house have no connection whatsoever with the United Party. They are not even members of the United Party. I have accommodation in a hotel. Mr. Guzana has never called on me either in my house or at my hotel. But this paper alleges that the car is &#x201C;gereeld daar te sien&#x201D; standing outside. But suppose Guzana did call on me. Suppose he did come to me for advice&#x2014;is that a crime&#x003F; Does this Government not consult&#x003F; We wish they would do more consulting. But they do consult outside. The Prime Minister eventually appointed an economic committee to help him. We in the United Party do consult with others, we would like to consult more, and every opportunity we get of consulting with others, we do. What would be wrong if Mr. Guzana did come and consult with me&#x003F; But as it happens, he has never come to me for advice.</p>

<p>Again I ask: Is there anything wrong with that&#x003F; I am not ashamed of the fact that I know Mr. Guzana and that we are on a good footing. He and I belong to, and practise, the same profession. We come into frequent contact with each other. I often have discussions with him. What is more, this Government is proud of Mr. Guzana; this Government&#x2019;s information officer arranges for important visitors to the Transkei to meet Mr. Guzana. They do not have to go out to his office in Mqanduli; the Government arranges for the visitors to meet him in the Government buildings. This Government does it. But the suggestion implied in this report is that Mr. Guzana is a communist.</p>

<p>I say I am friendly with Mr. Guzana, but I want to say this too: I am just as friendly, if not more so, with Chief Kaizer Matanzima, because Chief Kaizer Matanzima and I have a closer association than Mr. Guzana and I have. Because Chief Kaizer Matanzima was articled in my office and his son is at present articled to me. I have more discussions with Chief Kaizer and the members of his Cabinet than I ever have with Mr. Guzana.

<p>The hon. member asks what this all has to do with the motion before us. It has this to do with it: The measure introduced by the Government in its original form would stop any association between people of the different racial groups in political affairs, that is what it sought to do.

<p>It is a private quarrel you have with the newspaper.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>This newspaper speaks for the Government. Who is the chairman of this newspaper&#x003F; Unfortunately the hon. the Minister of Transport, who is the chairman, is not here now.</p>

<p><span class="col_1439-1440" refersTo="page_0742"/>I say it is time that steps were taken against this particular paper because it is becoming more and more irresponsible; it is saying the most shocking things, and this is the type of thing we can expect in future. I sincerely hope the Cabinet will not carry out the advice of this newspaper by introducing legislation of the type suggested by the paper.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate what the hon. member for Peninsula said about the Prime Minister&#x2019;s early entry into this debate. I think it is a great pity that the hon. the Prime Minister came into the debate so early. The whole idea of this debate was the following. The request of my Leader was that before the Government made up its mind as to what it is going to do, we should have a chance of discussing this matter in this House and put our points of view, and then let the Government make up its mind after it has heard the discussion. But what happened&#x003F; As soon as my Leader finished speaking, the Prime Minister got up and said the Government had decided to abolish Coloured representation here. The whole object of the debate was defeated. The Prime Minister started his speech by referring to the political rights of the Coloureds, and he suggested&#x2014;and this amazed me&#x2014;that the Coloureds have no political rights. What a suggestion! The hon. member for Houghton has already replied to him to a certain extent on the question of the Common Roll. Other hon. members on this side, for instance the hon. member for Bezuidenhout this morning, dealt with this subject too. The point is not how many were on the voters&#x2019; roll when they were taken off the Common Roll. There were about 50,000 odd on the voters&#x2019; roll, taking Natal as well. The point is this: They had the right to vote; in Natal and the Cape there were people with a qualified vote. More could have got on the rolls if they qualified. In the Free State and the Transvaal they had the right to take part in the election of senators. All provinces had some political say, some political rights. What is being given to them now&#x003F; The political rights which they had in the South African Parliament, the highest legislative body in the land, are being taken away from them and in return they are being given the equivalent of provincial council rights. That is all they are getting. The Coloured Council will never develop to anything more than a provincial council; it cannot develop to more than a provincial council. Why is it necessary to take away their political rights just because they are being given a council&#x003F; I am not going to read all the speeches made at the time, but when the Coloured people were given that council it was not given as a <i>quid pro quo.</i> They were not told, &#x201C;We are giving you the council because we are going to take away your political rights.&#x201D; They were just given the council. There was no suggestion then of what is happening now. In fact, the suggestion was to the contrary.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister went on to attack my Leader for our change of policy. He said we had changed our policy. The Prime Minister defended his attitude by saying he had not betrayed any promises made by the late Dr. Verwoerd. My Leader had reminded him of promises made to Coloureds. He said he would fulfil the promises made by his predecessor. But the Prime Minister did a shocking thing&#x2014;I take it he did it unwittingly. In order to prove to the House that he was carrying out Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy he quoted from a speech made in 1961. I refer to it again because I was mentioned in that speech. I had questioned Dr. Verwoerd, and he had then indicated that once the Coloureds got their own parliament they could lose their vote in this Parliament, their political rights here. I say it was a shocking thing for the Prime Minister to do, because he should have known, or his Whips should have corrected him and told him, &#x201C;Look here, the next year, in reply to the same member&#x201D;&#x2014;that is in reply to me &#x2014;&#x201C;he made a different statement&#x201D;. In 1962 when I questioned him on the subject again he then made it quite clear that he did not intend abolishing Coloured rights. I am not going to read the whole statement. He was asked by Mr. Barnett for how long the representation would stay, and the then Prime Minister replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have said that it will remain in existence. Must I say &#x201C;for ever&#x201D;&#x003F; I repeat that I have no plan at all, that I have no plan in connection with the development already announced, which includes the disappearance of the Coloured representatives here. I am not even considering it.</block>

<p>The previous year I had questioned Dr. Verwoerd on this aspect, and he had given me a different reply. I then asked him: &#x201C;If they had their own parliament&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. the Prime Minister then quite rightly said: &#x201C;The hon. member looks surprised &#x2026;&#x201D; I was surprised. He went on to say: &#x201C;I have already said it twice; what I said was that when we have that parliament, then in my view the white representatives will still be here. Is that clear now&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, I did not ask him; Dr. Verwoerd asked me: &#x201C;Is that clear now&#x003F;&#x201D; But, Sir, what is worse, the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs in stating his policy in 1964, read out the whole of that Hansard report. He read out Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s speech; he quoted my question and he quoted Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s reply, and he said that that should be the end of the matter.</p>

<p>It has been said by certain members here that Mr. Fortuin was prepared to let the Coloured representation in this House go and so was Mr. Schwartz. It has been said that they only asked for it because they said that if they did not ask for its retention, then their party might as well disband. Mr. Fortuin said that it was a question of good faith between the white man and the Coloured that this representation be retained. He said that that was why the Coloured man wanted it; that it was a question of good faith. Mr. Schwartz at one stage said that his party would have to write itself off at an election if he agreed to the abolition of representation. It was suggested then that personally he was not much interested in the matter, and what was his reply&#x003F; He was asked specifically if he had any interest in it personally and he said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. Let me quote the question and answer&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What about you yourself&#x003F;&#x2014;I also want it.</block>

<block name="quote">Independently of your party, do you personally want it&#x003F;&#x2014;Yes, deep down in my heart I want it. I have already said so.</block>

<p>The question was then put to Mr. Poley: &#x201C;What about you, Mr. Poley&#x003F;&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;I agree.&#x201D; The question was then put to Mr. Sanders&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And you, Mr. Sanders, on behalf of the O.F.S.&#x003F;&#x2014;We too want it.</block>

<p>Sir it is no good hon. members opposite trying to pretend that the Coloureds are not interested in this representation. All the evidence given before us shows that they were interested. It is no good saying that the Coloureds were not taking an interest in this matter and that it was difficult to persuade them to come and give evidence. I do not think that, it was so difficult to get them to come and give evidence. All the political parties gave evidence before the commission. Sir the hon. the Prime Minister says that there is no representative Coloured voice for us to consult and that is why he ignores the evidence given before the commission.</p>

<p>Why then does he not respect the views expressed by them&#x003F; Sir, if that is so. why did he not consult the council&#x003F; We asked him and his reply was that the council consisted of a majority of nominated members and therefore it could not speak for the Coloured people. We then ask the Prime Minister why he does not wait until this Coloured Council has been established and then hear what the, majority of the elected members have to say. The Prime Minister himself said that it would not be done until the Coloureds themselves asked for it. Why does he not wait then until they do ask for it&#x003F; Why does he not wait until this council is established&#x003F; Why does he rush into this thing now&#x003F; This question could not have been considered when this Bill was first published in 1966 because in that Bill provision was made for white representatives for the Coloureds in this Parliament. The representatives are expressly excluded from its operation. The Bill gives the Coloureds representation in this House. I say therefore that when the Bill was formulated in 1966 there was no question of doing away with this representation. All that Bill sought to do was to try to prevent interference because, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, the Government felt that it could not interfere in the politics of the Coloured people to its advantage, so it tried to prevent others from getting the support of the Coloured people.</p>

<heading>LIAISON BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS</heading>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion as printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in the opinion of this House more effective liaison between the Legislature and institutions concerned with scientific research is essential in order to achieve greater stimulation and co-ordination of endeavour in this vital field of national activity and that immediate action to achieve such liaison should be taken.</block>

<p>Since I am submitting this motion to the House, I should like to motivate it as follows: We have already had an opportunity earlier on in this Session of taking the initial steps; this was done with reference to the motion of the hon. member for Gordonia, and on that occasion we confined ourselves principally to two aspects. In the first place we discussed how more adequate funds could be made available for research, and in the second place we exchanged ideas in regard to how those persons, who had accomplished achievements in scientific and other fields in a manner which required national recognition, could be honoured. We feel, however, that we must go further; we feel that there are other matters of an organizational nature, and that we should in addition try to determine whether the arrangements existing at present are of an optimum nature; we must also investigate whether it is in any way possible to give added impetus to research activities in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_1443-1444" refersTo="page_0744"/>By way of introduction let me just say that during the recess we were afforded an opportunity of paying a visit to the C.S.I.R. On behalf of this side of the House I should like to convey my thanks to those who were responsible for these arrangements, and I am certain that I am speaking on behalf of all here when I say that each and every one of us was impressed by what we saw there.</p>

<p>Let me say at once that the crux of my argument is not that we are behind in this field. I am aware of what is being done, but it is all relative. If we are doing well, then surely we can still try and determine whether we can do better than we are doing at the moment. The other day, when this matter was being discussed, the hon. the Prime Minister told us that we were at present spending R40 million per annum on research. That sounds like a large amount, and it is in fact a great deal of money, but scientists maintain that we are at present losing R400 million every year, merely in the form of our soil nutrients which are being washed away to the sea. If one views it in that sort of light, one realizes that everything is relative. But what to my mind is the most important matter in research is that it is very often a minor discovery, a minor invention, that results in a large-scale change. One random example which occurs to me is for example gunpowder. Formerly, as you know, we had throughout the world the feudal system of the knights of old in their suits of armour, with their castles, and an entire way of life which they built up around them, and then gunpowder was discovered and the entire system changed overnight. Cities were then laid out in a new way; warfare was conducted in an entirely different way. In fact, other things such as physical size and personal relationships changed, because if you fought with a sword or a lance, physical size and strength could be an advantage, but if you fought with fire-arms it could be a disadvantage. It therefore resulted in a levelling process and that in turn led to and made for large-scale social and political changes.</p>

<p>It is being maintained that we are on the eve of large-scale changes in science, and it is no wonder, measured in terms of the number of scientists involved, because they are increasing at the rate of 7 per cent per year. That means that every ten years the number of scientists doubles itself. It is calculated that 97 per cent of all the scientists who have ever lived and worked, are living and working to-day. In other words, many of the things we see here to-day, are the labours of only 3 per cent of all the scientists there have ever been in the world, and what great achievements did they not accomplish! They represent all the nations of the world. There is Copernicus, the Pole; there is Kepler, the German; Galileo, the Italian; Einstein, the Jew; and then there is probably the greatest scientist of all, Newton, the Englishman.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>You may as well add him too. The scientists to whom I referred often accomplished their achievements despite circumstances and great handicaps which hampered them in their work. Just think of Copernicus. What he did he had to accomplish in the face of great persecution, persecution by our own church leaders. Luther and Calvin persecuted him because he had stated that the world was round and that it revolved on its own axis. They said: No, that is not what is stated in the Bible; the Bible states clearly that Josiah commanded the sun to stand still; he said absolutely nothing about the world revolving on its own axis.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are on the eve of large-scale changes and perhaps we should take just a little look into the future. We must make a random test to try and determine what is still lying ahead for us. But before we do that, we could perhaps place matters in their proper perspective. The human experience, the human being<i>&#x2014;homo sapiens</i> as we know him&#x2014;apparently dates back about a thousand generations. We represent the thousandth generation. Just to give you an idea of how rapidly things change I can make the following comparison; the first 800 generations left almost no record, because they were completely nomadic. It was only the last 100 generations who left any sort of record, and this often took the form of stone implements. It is only the last ten generations who have had any knowledge of the art of printing. It was only the last five generations which were able to measure heat and cold with any degree of accuracy, and it is only our own generation, the thousandth generation which has knowledge of television and antibiotics and all the other marvels of modern science.</p>

<p>We now stand before the 1,001st generation, which is just around the corner. What are the prospects and what are the possibilities which lie ahead for them&#x003F; I can only touch on a few things here and there. The field in which the greatest changes are probably going to occur is that of transport. We have moved, within a few generation, from the ox-wagon to the jet aircraft. Five hundred years ago our transport was so poor that people in Europe were not even aware that America existed. To-day our means of transport are so efficient that within this very generation people are going to move around on the surface of the moon. A radical change is going to take place in the entire world of transport. In America they have already found that the present cost of transporting goods is five cents per ton-mile, and the curve is steadily decreasing. They expect to decrease the costs by another third within ten years. On the other hand, the cost of surface transport, of railways and motor truck transport, is steadily increasing. These two curves are going to cross in the immediate future, and when that happens almost all our <span class="col_1445-1446" refersTo="page_0745"/>transportation will be done by air. That is the reason why politicians like ourselves must look to the future. We must anticipate what is going to happen. We must aim ahead, or as the Englishman says, &#x201C;One must lead the target&#x201D;. If we do this, we will reap a rich reward, but if we do not do this, we will find ourselves in the position of the English politician many years ago, who stared so fixedly at the present that he began planting oak trees on a large scale because he argued thus: If we do not plant oak trees, Britain will not have enough oak wood with which to build its warships.</p>

<p>But there is a second field. The hon. the Minister of Planning, who is also the Minister of Mines is sitting here before us, and let us consider some of the things which could happen in his field. One of the greatest problems in the world is that our supplies of raw material are becoming depleted. It is said that for every person in the modern community one must extract 20 tons of raw material from the soil each year. In America nine tons of steel and eight tons of coal are necessary for every individual in file country. How can we keep up&#x003F; After all, the world does not have that much raw material. We can only do so if we tackle a few things. In the first place we will have to effect a complete improvement in our extractive processes. In the past we were not interested in copper unless the ore value was approximately 5 per cent. To-day we find that copper is being processed if it is near to 1 per cent, but we will have to do far better than that. Technically it is of course possible. We are already processing uranium where file ore value is only one in a million particles. In other words, the ore value is .0001 per cent. Once we are able to do this, if we are able to process this material when it has an ore value of this frequency, the situation of course changes immediately. Here we have the sea around us. The sea covers 400 million cubic miles, and each cubic mile, they say, contains gold to the value of R70 million and four million tons of other ores, salt and minerals.</p>

<p>But we need not even go to the sea. We can look to the surrounding countryside. The whole world is full of igneous rocks and these igneous rocks contain all the constituents which the modern community needs to keep it on the go. Every 100 tons of igneous rock contain eight tons of aluminium, five tons of iron, 140 lbs. of manganese, 40 lbs. of nickel and 20 lbs. of copper, to mention only a few. But to be able to do all these things, we need not only the technical knowledge to process it, we also need the energy. Here we have one of the great problems of the world. Up to now we have primarily been making use of coal to give us energy. But scientists maintain that our demand for energy is going to increase to such an extent that towards the end of this century we will need as much energy in one year as the world needed from its beginnings up to the present. And when you begin to view energy in this light, then all our coal reserves are going to be totally depleted within 30 years. We will have to look further, therefore, and the world is already doing so. To-day already we are thinking in terms of nuclear power, and here the prospects are of course more favourable, because one ton of uranium can be used to generate as much energy as 10,000 tons of coal. We shall also have to think in terms of solar power, and perhaps we should go even further, and once again I return to the sea. The sea currents of the world have just as much energy as 1,000 Mississippi&#x2019;s. With its waves, its swells and its tides the sea generates far more energy than we would obtain if we used all the coal existing to-day. But perhaps we should look even further than that. Using a small wheel as a fly-wheel, one can drive a very large machine. Here we have the greatest fly-wheel of all, the world itself. The world revolves at a tremendous speed on its own axis and is moving through the universe all the time. If we could succeed in harnessing this energy, all these problems to which I have referred would no longer exist.</p>

<p>But let us look at something else. I am thinking now in terms of our business world. The people whose task it is to look into the future, tell us that at the end of this century 95 per cent of the world&#x2019;s business will be controlled by 300 large international organizations, and it is expected that two thirds of them will be American, and 20 per cent will be controlled by the Japanese. Perhaps South Africa could also have a few amongst these 300 if we were able to effect a total improvement in our business and management and if we were prepared to make full use of our human potential. I see many indications that this is not being done. There has been a management system for quite some time in America, I am referring now to the Scanlon procedure, which gives one an increase in productivity of 20 to 30 per cent in one year, and I see no indication that we are utilizing it in South Africa. To give a dramatic example of what can be achieved with this procedure, I am referring to what happened a few years ago with file Parker pen organization, the largest pen company in America. They were doing well and showing good profits, and then, almost overnight, one of their competitors came onto the market with a new kind of pen which was equipped with a snorkel apparatus. One presses the snorkel in and this draws the ink out. Their advertising was wonderfully managed. They had a beautiful blonde appearing on television who sat there with long white gloves on drawing the ink up and showing her hands afterwards without one ink mark on them. The sales of the Parker pen organization dried up overnight; they were in a terrible predicament. In desperation they turned to the Scanlon procedure. They converted their entire management system, and to-day the Parker pen is still there and the organization is still a leading one in the American business world. This is the sort of thing I had in mind. But, in my opinion, to <span class="col_1447-1448" refersTo="page_0746"/>deal with this matter before us to place science on a proper basis, three things are necessary.</p>

<p>In the first place, we must have enough scientists. It is expected that by 1980 South Africa will need twice as many scientists as we have at present, and at the end of this century we will apparently need three to four times as many scientists as we have at present. Where are we going to get them from&#x003F; To reach this target, we will have to do quite a few things immediately. We shall have to try and eliminate the present losses. It is calculated that three quarters of our sons and daughters who go overseas for post-graduate study never return to South Africa. We must find out why that is so. I do not know whether the estimation is correct, but in any case we are losing many of them, and we must find out why this is so. At the moment we are spending plus-minus R140 per annum on the training of our gifted children, and we are spending R420 per annum on the training of our retarded children. And it is precisely the gifted children who offer us a future, but we are doing nothing in particular in regard to their training. We shall have to tackle the entire educational programme in another way. There are modern methods such as programmed training, the learning machine, the staple course technique, all methods which are being used overseas but which we are utilizing on a relatively small scale here. We will have to change the emphasis in our training. Japan is spending nothing more on school training than the English are doing, but they are producing twice as many technologists. Experts say that their phenomenal economic development is precisely owing to this. But we shall also have to make use of our womanpower. We are always talking about manpower, but as far as our women are concerned we have a large reservoir of brain-power which we are not always harnessing. In America 1 per cent of the engineers are women, but in Russia 20 per cent are women. In America 20 per cent of the scientists are women, and in Russia 50 per cent of the professional group are women.</p>

<p>As far as scientists are concerned, we shall also have to see to it that we make proper use of all our scientists, and that we remunerate them properly. What our scientists are receiving at the moment in terms of financial remuneration, is quite inadequate. As far as scientists are concerned, it is often clear that they would rather have remuneration in the form of research apparatus or opportunities to meet persons who are working in similar directions here or overseas. That is the remuneration they often want. I mentioned a few examples of the kind of steps which can be done to increase the number of scientists in South Africa.</p>

<p>But there is a second important step which we shall have to take. We must have a policy for research, a pre-determined national policy for innovation. This is particularly important for a country such as South Africa, because in the field of research I think one can divide the countries of the world up into a few major groups. In the first place there are the super-states, such as America and Russia, where the entire spectrum of research is covered, and who are financially strong enough to be able to do so. Then there are countries such as France, Britain and Germany, and possibly Japan, whose funds are not entirely adequate enough to cover the entire field, but who are nevertheless able to tackle it on a large scale. Thirdly there are the smaller countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden, apparently South Africa will also fall into that group, where it is necessary to go to work selectively. We do not have the funds to cover the entire research spectrum. With us priorities have to be determined. That is why I say that it is necessary for us to have a national policy in regard to research for innovation.</p>

<p>In the third place it is also essential&#x2014;and this is what our scientists feel so strongly about&#x2014;that there is proper liaison with the legislature. I think we must consider here whether it is not possible to make further improvements on the present position. In most of the Western countries scientific research is taken up into a specific department with its own Minister, which undertakes all co-ordination. We have representation of the scientists as far as the Cabinet is concerned, but there is division. Social research is now going to be handled by the Minister of National Education. The C.S.I.R., for some reason or other, is under the control of the Minister of Planning. I think it is necessary to go further. In several Western countries this matter is deemed to be so important that the Prime Minister himself holds this portfolio. That was also the position in South Africa with the C.S.I.R. when General Smuts was in power. That was also the case when General Malan was in power, and I think there are many people who feel that we should return to that position.</p>

<p>But we must go further. The British have established a Parliamentary Scientific Council. That is a council which consists of members of both Houses and of both Parties who meet scientists from all the scientific research institutions. They meet from time to time, and together they discuss the research problems. This is an idea which we could possibly use here, but perhaps it is a technique which would be more successful in Britain than it would be here. That is why I have a fourth suggestion, and this is to be found in Britain as well as in certain other countries. It is that the Government should think, and I am suggesting this with all the earnestness I have at my disposal, in terms of the establishment of a standing select committee for research, which will make a special task of remaining in contact with research undertakings. What our scientists want is that they should not be left out of the reckoning or treated as stepchildren. <span class="col_1449-1450" refersTo="page_0747"/>They must have contact with the Government and with this Legislature which has to vote all the money for that purpose and has to lay down the policy. That is why this kind of arrangement is the one about which the Government should really think. I should like to put it to this House that we are facing a major challenge. We must accept this challenge. We must not act in a way similar to that of the old English lady in America who recently wrote to Werner von Braun, the scientist and space-explorer in America, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why must we go to the moon&#x003F; Why can&#x2019;t we stay here on the earth to watch television as the good Lord intended us to do&#x003F;</block>

<p>It appears to me that we are not going to have the diversion of television in South Africa. That is why I think that we should grab at the moon instead, and do so with both hands.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. W. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Hillbrow most certainly regaled us with a highly interesting dissertation, which depicted in a panoramic way his vision of the science of the future. There are perhaps one or two things in regard to which I do not agree with him. But I should like to say something that will bring us back to earth. This motion is concerned with the organization of science, to which the hon. member referred towards the end of his speech. To my mind scientific research means research in the field of the natural sciences and not that in the field of the humanities or the social sciences. In addition legislature means to my mind this Parliament. We have in South Africa to-day a very large number of small or large organizations which are concerned with scientific research and which were in fact the result of that astonishing scientific and technological development which the hon. member spoke about. This has taken place during the last ten years in particular. These bodies have already been established to make adjustments to contemporary demands. But to-day there are many cases where the State regards it as its task to carry the responsibility for the efficient implementation of research, and we must look to the State to implement this task efficiently.</p>

<p>This motion implies that there ought to be better liaison between the legislature and the bodies undertaking research in this country. And if there are obvious deficiencies or very great deficiencies which we can expose, I would agree that we should do so. Although grounds for improvement to exist&#x2014;because we are dealing here with something dynamic&#x2014; I cannot entirely agree with the overhastiness which is contained in the motion as such. I want to tell the hon. member that almost all the modern countries of the world to-day are seeking improved structures for and organization of research. Everywhere the needs are fluctuating. Everywhere a general tendency to decentralize planning and organizational structures is in progress. This is the case in all the European states, such as the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and others. In addition some of them are federations, and in federations one always experiences a number of problems in regard to certain rights. These countries are far ahead of us in technological development. Nevertheless they have not yet found an ideal solution. If one considers the position in South Africa, then the immediate, overhasty action which is being advocated here&#x2014;if one considers the position over the past few years when the development was so rapid&#x2014;is hardly justified.</p>

<p>In South Africa we have an existing central organization which, since 1964, has remained more or less the same in substance because we have a Scientific Advisory Council on the highest level, with its scientific adviser who advises the Prime Minister and the Minister of Planning. Since the hon. member has just, despite all his other great knowledge, displayed his ignorance by alleging that we have not already rectified this aspect of organization, I want to tell him that Professor M&#x00F6;nig who had instituted an investigation into the organization of science, in his comparisons with overseas organizations for research, regarded the South African arrangement as it existed, as the ideal arrangement. In this he was supported by many experts whom he consulted on his overseas trips. If, in addition to this, cognizance is taken of what has happened over the past few years in particular, and what is at present being envisaged and has been put into operation, it is amazing that we have a research organization which exhibits so few deficiencies. While we are discussing organization the ideal, in my opinion, should always be that there should be continuous contact from the highest authority down through the heirarchic structure to the base of the research pyramid where the active research work is being carried out. It should not be severed. I want to intimate that we have that contact here.</p>

<p>What is the set-up in South Africa&#x003F; Apart from the scientific advisory council and the adviser to the Prime Minister who is included in that and who also advises the hon. the Minister of Planning, we have only one particular research council, namely the C.S.I.R., which one can regard as an excellent institution and in regard to which the member also expressed his appreciation. Parliament delegates power to the C.S.I.R. in order to expand fields of knowledge through groups of experts. It is consequently the responsibility of the C.S.I.R. to report annually to Parliament, since Parliament supplies it with its basic revenue. If the hon. member wants further mediators in this regard, I do not know. The idea of a standing committee for research, which he raised, sounds a little overhasty to me. It also sounds to me like something, as I view the present set-up, which does not exactly fit in. Research is usually a highly specialized task. The priorities in connection with this is something which a parliamentarian&#x2014;most of us <span class="col_1451-1452" refersTo="page_0748"/>anyway&#x2014;said in all due deference, cannot decide on. However, nothing prevents us from taking an interest. For that we have the Department with all the information and access to the Minister so that we can convey our ideas to him. It is therefore a debatable point.</p>

<p>I think that as further needs arise, autonomous research councils will be expanded. If will be organized in such a way that there will be continuous contact and liaison by means of the research councils, between the research worker and the Minister. We still have the situation in South Africa, which perhaps is not entirely satisfactory, whereby the Department of Agricultural and Technical Services undertakes its own research. This is a traditional set-up. It has worked very well up to now. One must consider the circumstances of the country, its development and its manpower, which was also mentioned by the hon. member and which we do not always perhaps take into consideration enough. But in the Department of Agricultural Technical Services one has the Legislature in the person of the Minister who is responsible for research in his Department. And then there are various other departments in our country which are undertaking their own research. They are independent to a lesser or greater degree. Now, if the situation is not an ideal one, one can to a degree concede this. But in countries which are far ahead of us technologically, people are still seeking ideal solutions in regard to the organization of research. Let us take the overseas countries. The hon. member specifically mentioned that the Legislature, the Parliamentarians, should be brought in.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to inform him that in countries such as France, Belgium, and even in America, the tendency exists to create a comprehensive and reasonably complete organization or central organization which controls research in all its aspects. This covers departmental research as well. There it falls, as the hon. member said, under the control of a Prime Minister or a President. But that is precisely what really happens here as well. In France there is an inter-ministerial committee for science. It stands under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. This committee in turn advises a consulting committee for science and technological research, which consists of scientists and technologists and not of legislators. In turn this committee is advised by a delegate-general for scientific and technological research. This body then does preparatory work and co-ordinates research for the State Departments. In Belgium there is something with much the same set-up. In the U.S.A. the President has a scientific advisory committee under him. The chairman of that committee is the President, and he has a scientific adviser and he runs an office for science and technology in the executive department of the President. In all these countries we also find that research is being done by State Departments, which are to a lesser or greater degree autonomous, in truth a research council. We find this in connection with agriculture, health, defence and these people are undertaking research as a part of their executive function. One would almost regard it as applied research. Obviously it is impossible in a large country&#x2014;and in this respect I differ from the hon. member&#x2014;to have only one Minister of Science with all these research activities falling under him. This has been proved in almost all these countries. If the hon. member were to go into the matter and glance at the committee report of Dr. M&#x00F6;nig of 1964 he would see that that was his conclusion. Therefore I cannot agree with the hon. member in that regard. The relevant Minister cannot maintain control over all the scientific activities and the concomitant research.</p>

<p>When we consider the central organization of the overseas countries, we find representatives of Parliament in the central organization which must control research and govern financially in only two countries&#x2014;these were all I could find&#x2014;i.e. in Switzerland and Western Germany, two countries which have a federal set-up.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>The English are also doing this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. W. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>To a degree yes, it is so, and it was you who put it in this way. I am talking more of Europe now, but I concede that this situation is also found in England.</p>

<p>Then there are the national research councils. I am only mentioning the national research council in Switzerland. Twenty-seven scientists are members of that council. Two members of the federal government are also on the council, but they are also scientists. In reality it is only the scientist who can operate efficiently in such a council. In the German scientific advisory council we find 39 members. There are 11 Ministers of Education of State and six representatives of the federal government. I think in these cases it is more to control the federal government by taking care of the finances for research. Except for this I really cannot see why these members are serving in the council.</p>

<p>But after all comparisons alone do not bring us any nearer a solution. One feels that if there are deficiencies, these should be emphasized without being overemphasized. We know that matters of policy in regard to the natural sciences have become an urgent necessity to-day, and it is because of the effect of scientific development on all human requirements. The hon. member put it very well. It is health, foodstuffs, clothing, housing, transport, communication and the industries. In brief, we find this in the entire economic field. All these development aspects are, for their maintenance and continuation, dependent upon scientific research and organization. As a result of that we find this technological revival.</p>

<p>Research work has become extremely difficult; it has become complicated. To-day it requires <span class="col_1453-1454" refersTo="page_0749"/>team work. We have groups of scientists, experts and specialists who have to work for better planning and management and greater financial effort. This leads to the demand for more centralized guidance and coordination. It also results in problems. It results in our instituting improved investigations into seeking a correlation between the research&#x2014; the essence of research. It brings us to the concept of research economy, in which we are seeking a correlation between the research expenditure and the economic growth which originates as a result of that. I want to tell the hon. member that the C.S.I.R. is investigating all those aspects. They are looking at the economic value of any research project. In this case control is taking place; they have been engaged on this for a long time now because it is an extremely difficult matter.</p>

<p>We as policy makers would like to know what part of our national income ought to be spent on research. We should like to see this research being carried out with our restricted manpower and financial means in an economic way. Now it is a question of a delicate balance between two possibilities. On the one hand we must also afford the research worker the opportunity of dedicating himself to the full to his task, with a measure of freedom, even though it is within defined limits. But in the smaller countries research has to be planned and co-ordinated and we must keep in mind the concept of research economy. We received reports in regard to what is being done. We have proof of this. There are the annual reports, you can obtain the information yourself, and you can obtain it at any time. For us as legislators to be representatives ourselves in research bodies&#x2014;and as I understood him, the hon. member meant a Select Committee&#x2014;is not desirable. Such a Select Committee would have to concern itself with the determining of priorities, with the allocation of finances, and with all those kinds of things. I am just not certain that research, this particular field, lends itself to a select committee consisting of what we must, after all, regard as amateurs.</p>

<p>This freedom for research is, as far as I am concerned, very important. We have it here now. In the existing circumstances the Government has decided to delegate authority to people in certain fields. There should also be a central authority at the very top in order to determine priorities. The central authority must look to the future and must always look at the possibilities for development lying ahead, based on the developments of the past. There should always be the idea of no education without research, and no research without education. We have the advisory council at the very top, and I believe the scientific advisory council is a good integration of the scientists with departmental representatives who form a minority. I regard this scientific advisory council as the ideal central body to determine ultimate preferences. Under it will come what the Government now ultimately intends instituting, i.e. the research councils, after a committee which was nominated last year brought out its report. The recommendation of the committee is even now that a national structure of organizations and co-ordinating and financing be investigated. I believe that we have now found a new direction for the organization of research and we will in future have this position that there is continuous contact from the research worker at the bottom right up to the highest legislative authority.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Spearker, it gives me much pleasure to support the proposals made by the hon. member for Hillbrow. I think in his speech to us this morning it became more apparent than ever that if there is one language that is understood by all thinking people, no matter in what country they live and no matter what race or creed or religion they adhere to, it is the language of the scientist. It became clear to me that what scientists do is to find ways and means of making the lives of all of us, no matter where we live, no matter what standard of living we reach, more pleasant. They do this because I think they have within themselves something built-in which makes them want to do more for their fellow-man. There are no secrets amongst scientists. They give what they have discovered to the world. Perhaps there is one exception, and that is only for a temporary period, and that is when a scientist discovers something which can be used to kill people.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned for lunch, I was saying that the only exception we have in the field of science which does not bring betterment to the people, is during the time of war when secret weapons are being used. I said that was only a temporary measure because after the war one soon learns what has been going on. I think it is agreed that scientists work in such a way that their final results and progress are rarely, if ever, kept confidential. There is a desire for co-operation between the peoples of nations and this may be on national or international level. The fact that there is competition in research is good. I think that it is a good thing for a country, and the people of a country, when there is competition in the fields of research. It is a spur to better things and it does help to bring results to fruition more quickly. With the advances that we have had in communication and transport, as said earlier to-day, great strides have been made in the dissemination of the results of research work. To a great extent a lot of overlapping has been minimized.</p>

<p>In the medical field, especially, I would say that there is greater co-operation between countries as far as their discoveries are concerned than in any other field. There is also a desire to get the results of research to the <span class="col_1455-1456" refersTo="page_0750"/>people as quickly as possible. One of the key values of research is to make sure that there is no great time lag between the findings and the eventual production so that those who are going to benefit from the work, can benefit as quickly as possible. As far as the field of medical research is concerned&#x2014;and I think that this is extremely important&#x2014;work which is done by scientists in the field of medicine and their findings are never secret. They are there for everybody to see. If such findings are kept secret, then we who deal with findings are always suspect. I do not think that scientists have any time for those persons who work alone and devise secret formulae which they use for their own benefit. Such formulae usually land in the hands of the quacks and the charlatans. For those people we have no time.</p>

<p>If we are to do our medical research in this country properly, then we must have a reorganization of the present state of affairs. We must assess, firstly, what staff we have at the moment, what training facilities we have and the maximum benefit that can be made of the available resources. The acquisition of knowledge must be made possible to all those who want it. With our population, we find ourselves in the position where we will have to concentrate on the quality of production rather than the quantity. I think that we have had recently a great example in this country of the co-operation that we are willing to give from this country to the outside world. It is helped by the progress we have had in the fields of communication and travel. As we all know, Professor Barnard was immediately ready as soon as he was able to show that there was a way of treating a certain disease, to go and tell other people about what he was able to do. He was not prepared to keep this as a locked-up secret. He gives his knowledge to all who want it. As a result of this medical feat that has occurred first in South Africa, I am hopeful that heart transplants and tissue transplants will soon become commonplace. We can be justly proud of having the first operation of this kind performed in our country. The great thing was that with the limited resources and with the knowledge that was gained from other people, this man was able to find an end to that trail. As soon as he found it, he gave it to others who wanted to know about it.</p>

<p>We are faced to-day with research activity in our country which can perhaps be graded under three heads: State, private and State-aided. The Public Health Act of 1919 states that:</p>

<block name="quote">The State shall be responsible for preventive medicine from outside and within the Republic. They are there to promote the public health and promote or carry out research and investigation into the prevention or treatment of disease.</block>

<p>We have the C.S.I.R., which is a national body, and which is expected to do the research work for the Department of Health. As recently as 1964, an Act was passed in this regard but no provision was made in this Act for the needs of health research. The Act, however, specifies that it shall promote the productivity or the productive capacity of the population of the Republic. There may therefore be a link between productivity and research in that productivity will depend on the health of the people. The State believes&#x2014;and the Minister must tell us whether he believes this&#x2014;that the C.S.I.R. is responsible for medical research for the Department of Health. But is it&#x003F; Is there an agreement between the two&#x003F; Is there any proof that such a state of affairs really does exist&#x003F; I think that it is through the goodwill of C.S.I.R. that progress has been made. This point must be clarified as soon as possible. If it is not clarified, there is a possibility of research not coming to a standstill because that will go on, but being hindered and retarded in its progress. I think the time has come now for any confusion that may exist between the Department of Health and the C.S.I.R. to be cleared up. Delegated powers must be given by Parliament to the C.S.I.R. They must be able to know what they are expected to do and they must be able to do it on their own. What virtually happens now, as far as I can make out, is that the Department of Health tells the C.S.I.R. what they would like them to do. How can the C.S.I.R. budget if they have projects that they want to undertake but cannot undertake because of the shortage of funds. Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister has mentioned that overall R40 million has been voted for research. Well, that is a fair sum of money for our country, but it is not the amount of money that is given for research that is important. What is important is how that money is used; whether there is any wastage anywhere and whether it can be used to better advantage. A body like the C.S.I.R. should be allowed to pile up reserves. Take a man, for instance, who is on the way to discovering the life cycle of some insect. He starts and goes half way and he suddenly discovers in the course of his work that something important has been observed; he wants to go off at a tangent to find out what the end-result of his observation is. Well, he is handicapped. He is handicapped for two reasons. First of all, there is nobody to carry on his original piece of research because of the shortage of manpower and our failure in the past to train sufficient people. Secondly, there may not be sufficient money for him to carry on with his research. Take the case, for instance, of Dr. Fleming who discovered penicillin. If he had not been able to go off on to a side path, we would still have been without that drug. He was encouraged, however, to go in for further research. We do not want the C.S.I.R., if they are going to undertake research for the Department of Health, to be handicapped by a shortage of funds. Nobody can say how much a research project is going to cost because nobody can tell how long it is going to take. It may be a short-term or a long-term project. We have examples of <span class="col_1457-1458" refersTo="page_0751"/>money being spent year after year on research, with little progress being made. Take the question of bilharzia, for instance, where we have spent millions but the disease to-day is as rife as ever, and perhaps it is even spreading. That is the sort of thing that happens. Who is going to undertake further research into venereal diseases which are spreading all over the world&#x003F; Here we are lagging behind. Sir, I am not condemning anybody. My purpose in making these observations is to try to help. We must open our eyes and see what is happening around us. If we are going to be handicapped by a lack of funds and a lack of co-ordination&#x2014;and the co-ordination must be from top to bottom&#x2014;we are going to find ourselves trailing behind most of the civilized countries of the world. I say that there must be some controlling body for research, and that is why I want to support what the hon. member for Hillbrow has said. Let us try a select committee. We have not been very successful up to now, although we have done a lot of work. We must remember that we have gained more from outside than we have been able to give to the outside world.</p>

We have two great South Africans overseas to-day&#x2014; Sir Basil Sch&#x00F6;nland and Sir Solly Zuckerman. We in this country are fortunate in that we are able to make use of the work that they have been doing overseas; and there are many others as well.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to follow up on what the hon. member for Rosettenville has said, except that I shall try in my argument to prove that we do not subscribe to the standpoint that everything which is being done in South Africa in respect of scientific research should always be belittled, as if we were achieving nothing in this process.</p>

<p>I listened with interest to the hon. member for Hillbrow. It became clear to us from his motion that it was his purpose to obtain liaison between the legislature, which would be this Parliament, and institutions undertaking scientific research. We listened to him with interest, and we should like to felicitate him on his speech, but we want to object to the suggestion that what is being done in South Africa in respect of research in general and in particular on certain levels of our political economy is taking place without co-ordination and without any progress being made. I want to say at the outset that liaison and interest on the part of the legislature in the work which is being done by research workers is both good and correct. We must at all times do everything in our power to assist and stimulate that work. But since I want to refer in particular to the agricultural sector of our political economy, I want to say at this stage that we should not lose sight of the fact that it is this Parliament which makes the necessary funds available for research. Of course we take an interest in research in various other fields, but in the time at my disposal, I cannot touch upon those matters in this debate. It is because this Parliament makes the necessary funds available that it is our duty to take an active interest in research, but the Legislature as it is constituted here naturally does not consist of people who are all scientists or scientific research workers. For that reason I think that we as legislators do not have the ability to judge research projects and the work of research workers. I think it is the duty of the members of this legislature to take particular interest in the results of the research and the applicability of the results in practice.</p>

<p>Since, at this stage, we want to make special reference to scientific research which is being undertaken in the agricultural sector, we want to refer to what has been achieved and express our warm appreciation for what has already been done. Sir, mention was made here of a Select Committee in respect of scientific research. From the few ideas which I have expressed here it will be clear to you that I will not oppose an idea like that tooth and nail, but that I do have a few reservations as to whether it would be the right thing at this moment. As far as the agricultural sector is concerned, we know that there is an idea to establish an advisory council in respect of scientific research. In that regard I want to say at once that this may give the appearance of co-ordination, the appearance of liaison, but as a result of practical circumstances, I feel that the opposite will be the case. The reason for this is that there are so many interested groups in agriculture that it is absolutely an inhuman task to constitute an advisory body which can represent the interests of all those groups. That is why the appointment, by Minister P. M. K. le Roux, of the Rautenbach Commission in 1959 was so important, as well as the resulting directorate of agricultural research. The establishment of that body was of real importance for the industry in South Africa, because it was under this body that the so-called advisory committees originated. At this moment there are no fewer than 18 of them that are already doing important research work. <i>Inter alia,</i> I want to refer to the advisory committees in respect of barley cultivation, tobacco, the fibre industry, potatoes, wool and wine, etc. If we look at the Barley Cultivation Advisory Committee, then we see at once the liaison, the co-ordination, which the hon. member for Hillbrow is so eagerly seeking, for on this <span class="col_1459-1460" refersTo="page_0752"/>committee the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is represented by the Secretary or his representative, who is responsible to the Minister, who in turn is responsible to this House. The Wheat Board is represented thereon, as well as the Brewers Institute of South Africa, the breweries that are not members of the Institute and the farmers. If we had the time, Mr. Speaker, we could describe how the other 17 committees are made up and you would then see that this co-ordination which is being advocated now does in fact exist, and in addition you would also see, since the impression is now being created that research work is in fact being done but that we are not actually achieving results, that this is not the case. If we had more time, we could elaborate on this; and I can only mention it in passing.</p>

<p>Sir, this legislature has created many opportunities and channels along which we can obtain the necessary co-ordination. We as members have been organized into various working groups, and on those working groups we must do the necessary work in the interests of the group we represent. We have, <i>inter alia,</i> an agricultural group, and I think I am quite at liberty to state that we are being afforded the opportunity, through the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, to pay periodical visits to research institutes and establishments. Surely that is general knowledge. Hon. members sitting in this Legislature must surely know that in the regions in which they live, periodic invitations to visit research undertakings are being issued. If any hon. member of this House has any reservations in respect of any research undertakings, then he has the opportunity of visiting such an institution on his own request. The classic case is that of an hon. member in the Other Place who had tremendous suspicions in respect of the citrus industry, and who levelled criticism which was not at all times worthy of him. After a visit to the undertaking at Nelspruit, he saw matters in a different light. Sir, when we talk about liaison, do we not take note of these beautiful publications of the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, publications in which everybody who wants to serve can become acquainted with the work which is being done in respect of scientific agricultural research in South Africa&#x003F; Sir, owing to lack of time I must make haste, but I want to ask hon. members on that side whether they do not realize to what an extent co-ordination already exists to-day&#x003F; Just think of the liaison committee which exists for example between the C.S.I.R. and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services where research is being carried out in regard to matters of common interest. We think in particular of the groundnut farmer with his problems of aphlatoxin poisoning or contamination of his groundnuts. Through the co-operation between these two undertakings, the C.S.I.R. and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, a solution was found. We think of tribulosis among sheep. It seems that co-operation between them is going to help us in this case as well. It seems impossible for a simple farmer to believe that there can also be liaison between the Department of Agriculture and the Atomic Energy Board, but we who are interested in these things know that this is nevertheless the case. Here at the fruit experimental farm Bien Donne, research is being undertaken by the particular liaison committee in regard to radio isotopes, with special reference to plant nutrition. On another level there has been liaison between Onderstepoort and the C.S.I.R., again in respect of radio isotope research, with special reference to the effects of that on animal feeding. There has been liaison with the Department of Water Affairs in regard to hydraulic research. But to my mind the most important is this one, where I said at the outset that agricultural research is being undertaken with a purpose, we are not satisfied with mere basic research, as in countries such as Australia and England, where the knowledge is accumulated and then left to stand on the shelves purely for the information of the scientists. No, here I once again want to pay the Department of Agricultural Technical Services a compliment. You who know how this Department is organized will find that there is a chief for the region, that there is an assistant chief for information, and that there is an assistant chief for research. Through co-ordination they still remain responsible to Parliament. There we have this co-ordination by means of which these people hold their consultations, and what they have discovered can be conveyed through the Department&#x2019;s information services to people who need this knowledge the most, the practical farmers in South Africa. That is why, owing to lack of time, I just want to say that we do not have any reason to reject this motion summarily, but we want to leave the impression here that it is with the greatest appreciation that we recognize what scientific research in general has meant for South Africa and in particular what it has meant to the farmer of South Africa.</p>

<p>*Dr. J. H. MOOLMAN. I am sorry that the hon. member for Smithfield tried to create the impression that the first speaker, the hon. member for Hillbrow, wanted to create the impression that there was no co-ordination as regards our research. I think he spoke most highly of the research that was being done in this country with the funds we have available.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to talk about agricultural research, and I want to put it this way, namely that to us agricultural research is probably the most important form of research. If it is true that unless other measures are adopted, we shall have a population of more than 40 million by the year 2000, then I want to know how it will be possible for our thin fertile layer of the earth&#x2019;s crust to <span class="col_1461-1462" refersTo="page_0753"/>feed that population by the year 2000, unless research is done. The elementary needs of man are, after all, his food and his clothing, and owing to research it has already become possible to-day to provide artificially for the needs of man as far as his clothing is concerned. They have made so much progress that they can even extract from the air what they need for the manufacture of clothing. But the fact remains that, even in the flight my hon. friend for Hillbrow took in looking into the future at all the metals and minerals we shall be able to extract from rock, we shall never be able to extract bread from a rock; it has to be produced, and the food of the people must be produced by the farmers out of the fertile vegetable earth we have at our disposal.</p>

<p>Nor is agricultural research the most spectacular and the most stimulating career a researcher can pursue. There are many things that are more spectacular. If we think of the space research we have to-day, and if we think of the scientific research in the field of electronics and the mechanisms that are connected with space travel and atomic energy, then agricultural research is certainly not one of the most interesting forms of research that can be pursued. It astonishes us that we still have at our disposal, although not enough of them, people who are still prepared to do agricultural research. To my mind agricultural research remains the most important of all forms of research.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield created the impression that this motion of the hon. member for Hillbrow could not even serve a useful purpose, but I want to tell the hon. member for Smithfield that if it is possible for this motion to render any service to research, then it was to stress that what should really be done in regard to this matter, was that funds should be voted in this House and allocated among the C.S.I.R. and other research projects, including agricultural research. I know that we as members can go and look for ourselves, but I think the motion introduced by the hon. ber for Hillbrow could not even serve a use-support, points at one of the methods that can be employed, not only to acquaint this advisory body with the needs of the various projects for research, but also to afford the researchers the opportunity to go to such a committee and to state their needs in regard to the allocation of funds in the first place, and, in the second place, the necessity of the projects as far as research is concerned. When I talk about agricultural research, I mean veterinary research, the biological research that is connected with agriculture and forestry, the physical research, and as the Minister calls it, the geological research connected with the structure of the soil and the water. I think the Minister has appointed committees to inquire into all four of these spheres.</p>

<p>But it still does not follow that this is the ultimate aim. It still does not follow that once they have brought out their report we would be in a position to co-ordinate to the best of our ability, which would be necessary for agricultural research. In my opinion there is food for thought for everybody when we consider what fantastic progress has been made in regard to research, particularly in the field of medicine; when we think of the longer span of life man enjoys at present as a result of improved medical facilities and increased and better balanced diets; when we think of the reduction in the mortality rate amongst our children and the methods that have been devised to combat dreaded diseases, and everything that makes it possible for us to live longer; when we think of the phenomenal increase in the number of human beings all over the globe at this stage. Then one wonders how much one should make available, whether one has the powers to do so and whether in a century&#x2019;s time or in half a century&#x2019;s time it will be possible to produce food for the people. Food is the most elementary need of any living being, of mankind as well. I know of the resources which may perhaps be exploited. Once the soil has been exhausted, we can turn to the ocean and see what foodstuffs we can extract from it. But at this stage these are the limits of the resources we can exploit for extracting foodstuffs for the people.</p>

<p>Here in South Africa we have, as far as agricultural research is concerned, more extensive problems to cope with than is the case in any other country I know of in the world. This is attributable to the fact that we have more wild life than is to be found in any other country in the world. Consequently we have more carriers of external and internal parasites than is the case in any other country in the world. Therefore we have at our disposal, if not the very best, then surely one of the best research institutes in the field of veterinary science in the world. This was inevitable; we needed it and we still need it. We shall probably never surmount all the problems. We shall certainly not be able to cure all the diseases caused by parasites and carriers over which we have no control. For as long as we in this country prefer to be the wardens of our fauna, we shall be saddled with these problems.</p>

<p>But we also have other problems in regard to which we are lagging behind as compared to other countries, such as the problem in regard to the increase of our livestock. In paging through the old Hansards this morning, I saw that as far back as 1964 I spoke to the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services about this matter, and at that time I made mention of the percentage of calves in this country. The figures I mentioned at the time showed that the percentage of calves reared in our country was 55 per cent, whereas it was 80 per cent in Australia, 88 per cent in America and even higher in some European countries. If it is necessary to increase the livestock, and it certainly is necessary, and if it is necessary to produce the fodder with which animals are to be fed, and it certainly is necessary to do so, then the necessity for research in two fields&#x2014;i.e. those of water and the utilization of the water resources at our disposal, and the possibility of providing additional water resources by <span class="col_1463-1464" refersTo="page_0754"/>means of desalinating sea water or by any other means&#x2014;becomes one of the most important aspects of research in this country. A tremendous amount of research is necessary in respect of the way in which we may, with our available water resources, develop to such an extent that we shall be able to feed much more livestock and produce much more. Just as several other southern hemisphere countries&#x2014; in contrast to the few northern hemisphere countries which experience similar conditions &#x2014;we are stricken by periodic droughts, droughts which are apparently threatening to become permanent; they last from one year to the next.</p>

<p>I think that the research which can still be done in the field of protecting ourselves against droughts and their harmful effects, is one of the greatest projects that can be tackled in this country. At this moment our agriculture is experiencing a crisis which is unprecedented in the history of our country. Everybody says that this country has never known anything like it. In this regard I think that we have not done everything in our power&#x2014;as far as basic research is concerned&#x2014;to defend ourselves against the destruction wrought year after year by droughts in this country. If in centuries to come we want to feed our population, and if we want to clothe our people, but especially if we want to feed them, then we need research in the fields of agriculture and biology, much more intensified research than we have at present.</p>

<p>I know about the co-ordination that exists in respect of our agricultural research. The hon. member for Smithfield spoke of a coordinating board, an advisory board, for agriculture. Such a board&#x2014;on which I, too, served &#x2014;was established in the fifties: It was an agricultural research advisory board, and after two meetings it simply petered out by itself. It was one of the boards which comprised some of the best brains in the field of research in our country. But, as I have said, this board petered out by itself. The board was comprehensive enough to represent all departments. But all the good qualities of this board could not even save it, and, as has been the case with many other advisory boards and committees, this board simply petered out. Boards of this kind seldom last. An advisory board is established for agricultural research and for other kinds of research, but it only functions for a short while and then dies a natural death.</p>

<p>I think that the motion under discussion can yield very good results. It is an idea that may be put into practice, not only in respect of the co-ordination of all forms of research&#x2014;I do not know whether this board can assist a very great deal in co-ordinating research&#x2014;but also in respect of matters related to it. After all is said and done, it is this board which has to provide funds for research and which must eventually decide how the money is to be allocated amongst the various research boards, be they medical, scientific, industrial or agricultural. For that reason it gives me great pleasure to support the motion introduced by the hon. member for Hillbrow.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rather like a fight in this House, but to-day is not such a day, and I want to welcome this because scientific research and allied matters are probably one of the most important things to South Africa. We have had a good day to-day and it gave me great pleasure to listen to what had come from both sides of the House. I also want to express my appreciation for the way in which this question was approached and also for the thanks that were expressed, specifically to the C.S.I.R. and other bodies.</p>

<p>The hon. member who introduced this motion said that we were doing well in respect of research, but that one could always do better. That is true and we endorse it fully. But I nevertheless think that if one looks at what we have achieved in South Africa, one should also lay emphasis on the good work that has already been done. And that came from both sides of the House.</p>

<p>I also want to express here, and this is the first opportunity I have, the highest appreciation for what has been taking place in recent times. We are thinking of Dr. Barnard and his team and their achievements. We are also thinking of Dr. Van Wyk of the Johannesburg General Hospital and his proud achievement in separating the Siamese twins. This is a unique achievement. That is why I like to talk about these two recent achievements in the same breath. I also want to add to that that we, the House, should say and make it known to the public outside that we are not unaware of those hundreds and thousands of silent researchers whose names one never hears, researchers and technologists who are making it possible for these achievements to take place.</p>

<p>I also want to add the following to that: I think the hon. member for Rosettenv&#x00FC;le did not give us an entirely faithful rendering when he said, &#x201C;We gain more from outside than we have achieved ourselves and given ourselves&#x201D;. I do not think that this is a faithful rendering of what the situation is. The fact of the matter is that in virtually every sphere our scientists are ranked amongst the foremost in the world, perhaps not as far as the scope of the work is concerned, but most certainly as far as the quality of their work is concerned.</p>

<p>I am grateful that it became apparent here to-day that there is appreciation for the virtually immeasurable importance of science and for the practically unimaginable advantages it may hold for us in the future. However, we have a task to do&#x2014;and I, who am responsible for the Department, am including myself&#x2014; and that is to judge all these matters very calmly and with both feet on the ground when it comes to priorities and judging how we are to achieve them when we want to effect improvements. <span class="col_1465-1466" refersTo="page_0755"/>I just want to refer to a few general matters that were mentioned by the hon. member for Hillbrow. He referred to our vanishing assets. I agree with him. It is a matter to which we are paying attention and to which we shall have to pay more attention. I shall mention one example to hon. members. In the past it was always said, simply in passing, that South Africa had inexhaustible coal reserves. A while ago I asked the Coal Commission to ascertain for me whether this was in fact so. This also applies to iron ore and raw materials. No country can afford&#x2014;or may do such a thing to posterity&#x2014;to allow such reserves to be exported if there are not sufficient reserves left for future generations. In this regard the quantities may be there, but whether they can be mined, and, as the hon. member rightly said, whether the methods of extraction can be used, is a question that has to be answered. Now I just want to say that in respect of research in mining a tremendous amount of work and good work is being done by the National Institute for Metallurgy.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member made a statement which I think he made rather hurriedly, namely that South Africa is losing roughly 75 per cent of its researchers and students who are studying abroad. This is very much exaggerated. I have a few figures here, and I should like to give them to hon. members. They relate to the years 1960 to 1965. In medical science the loss is roughly 8 per cent; as regards holders of scholarships granted by State Departments, 5 per cent; as regards holders of scholarships granted by the C.S.I.R., 2 per cent; as regards holders of scholarships granted by the Atomic Energy Board, 5 per cent; as regards Afrikaans-language universities, 6 per cent; and as regards English-language universities, 20 per cent. In agriculture, so I am told, the figure is one to two per cent. These are the maximum figures.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>I have obtained from Dr. Naude of the C.S.I.R. other figures which I shall make available later on.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I am sure that they do not relate to exactly the same aspect. It may therefore be a maximum percentage of perhaps 15 per cent. I want to concede at once that 15 per cent is too high. Even that South Africa cannot afford it. But it is not 75 per cent as the hon. member wants to suggest.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked that we should now have a national research policy in South Africa. Let me say at once, Mr. Speaker, that, as the hon. member for Smithfield pointed out, a tremendous amount is being done in respect of co-ordination, the determination of priorities and the most efficient way of providing funds which have been set aside for this purpose&#x2014;a tremendous amount. In a striking way he indicated here how this was the case in agriculture. The fact of the matter is that in years to come we shall have to see to it that there is even greater co-ordination and greater determination of priorities as far as the various projects are concerned.</p>

<p>Then there is just one last general point, namely the objections the hon. member raised to the separation of human and natural sciences. I think it is sound. The separation in respect of responsibility to various ministries&#x2014;of three things, really&#x2014;has been accepted in South Africa, and I think that in actual practice it has very great advantages. There is the separation between the human sciences on the one hand, and the natural sciences on the other hand. Let us, as far as the whole research programme is concerned, operate on this basis rather than to join the two. This is the case to-day, and I fail to see any reason why it should be changed.</p>

<p>When we talk about research, the determining principal factors are to my mind the following two: firstly, the available capital and, secondly, the manpower. As regards the capital, this is something which is very difficult to determine. It is a problematical matter to be able to determine specifically how much is being spent in respect of research; there are no exact criteria. However, along with approximately 30 other countries we have nevertheless analysed this extremely complicated matter on the basis of the formula of which the hon. member is aware, and we determined that the amount made available for this purpose was approximately R40 million per annum over the past few years. That is roughly .5 per cent of the total gross product. It is very low. But when it is compared with comparable countries, it is still not very low. In Spain it is .3 per cent, in New Zealand .4 per cent and in Australia .6 per cent. But one should also take into account here that some of these countries are buying foreign know-how. In this way Germany bought 80 per cent of its know-how in the post-war years. This situation has changed and at the moment it only buys approximately 12 per cent of its know-how and undertakes 88 per cent of its own research. In Australia there has also been a complete change. Here in our country the ratio, having regard to the position our country occupies, is quite sound, since approximately 40 per cent of our knowhow is purchased, whereas we are undertaking 60 per cent of our own research. I think that a 40-60 per cent balance compares well at this stage. It is a favourable comparison with countries which are comparable to us.</p>

<p>In respect of the capital that is available, I must inform the House that the Government is paying serious attention to this, particularly in respect of funds that may possibly be made available from the private sector. At the moment I am examining this matter very closely to see what should be the composition and other related aspects of a possible central national trust foundation, where the private industrialist, the individual, will be able to render his contribution in respect of research.</p>

There is another very important consideration, namely that several of our universities, virtually all of them, are at the moment engaged in their own fund-raising campaigns. The question is: how will this affect the foundation&#x003F; In this regard I should like to make it quite clear that one should differentiate between the fund-raising campaigns of our universities for the purpose of their normal growth and expansion, and those donations which are specifically made for the purpose of research, research which will mainly be done at the universities.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether the donors would be satisfied with that. I want to invite them&#x2014;because some of them do come to see me about this matter&#x2014;to send in their ideas in this regard to my Department or directly to me. The problem is that there are big companies and other bodies which receive a tremendous number of requests for donations in respect of research. But the board of such a company is not always&#x2014;and usually it is not &#x2014;in a position to judge where its money will be utilized best. I think that if such a national trust foundation is established&#x2014;a trust foundation with a board of high standing consisting of capable people whom we have at our disposal in South Africa, people who are unique in their fields, people who do not have a personal interest in research, and we can mention names in this regard&#x2014;our companies and other bodies will be more inclined to donate money to that trust in the knowledge that it will be administered in the best national interests and distributed amongst the various research projects in the best possible way. I want to emphasize here once again that I should very much like to exchange ideas with those persons who are interested in these things. There is one company which came to see me and which is prepared to donate 1 per cent of their profits, for a period of 10 years, to research, but then they want the assurance that it will be utilized in the national interests, on the highest level and in the best possible way. It seems to me that such a trust foundation will possibly serve this purpose.</p>

<p>The second point, Mr. Speaker, is in respect of the researcher himself. I obtained certain figures in regard to full-time and part-time researchers in South Africa&#x2014;these are tentative figures, of course&#x2014;and found that there were roughly 5,000 full-time and roughly 2,000 part-time persons who are doing research. As far as technicians are concerned, there are more than 3,000 on a full-time basis and approximately 200 on a part-time basis. If one analyses this further, I can say without any hesitation that, after the necessary adjustment has been made as regards the amount of time part-time researchers devote to research, that there are in South Africa at least 5,000 to 5,500 persons who are doing research work on a full-time basis. Percentage-wise South Africa compares very well as far as this matter is concerned. Among certain bodies which are doing major work, there is great concern about the future of our researchers. I just want to sketch this very briefly. We have the researcher whose talent is average, but in order to make breakthroughs we should look after the really talented researcher. I may say that I have received several memoranda in regard to this matter. One of these memoranda says the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The position in regard to research is such that an average researcher does good work. An outstanding researcher, however, is the one who is responsible for new lines of thought, the break-throughs and the technological developments. The success of any research organization depends, in the first instance, on its talented researchers. As long as they are there, spending money on that organization is an investment. However, if they go to waste, further spending is probably inadvisable. One outstanding researcher is worth more than a score of average ones. Therefore, in order to maintain the research services in the country, it has become imperative to look after the good and the outstanding researchers.</block>

<p>Hon. members will realize that once one starts to select certain categories, it may create terrible problems. I nevertheless think that it is incumbent upon us, upon the Government, to see how we can cope with this matter. In respect of our talented researchers&#x2014;apart from the recognition which will be granted to these people pursuant to the announcement made by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;I have decided in principle to ask a number of persons to advise me on this matter, so that I may approach the Cabinet with an absolutely well-considered submission in respect of our talented researchers. I should like to tell hon. members whom I have had in mind to furnish me with the necessary advice in this regard: Dr. M&#x00F6;nnig, the scientific adviser, as chairman and convener; somebody from the Public Service Commission; Dr. Meiring Naude of the C.S.I.R.; Dr. A. Roux of the Atomic Energy Board; Mr. Gerhard Jooste, retired Secretary for Foreign Affairs; Professor Andries Brink of the University of Stellenbosch; somebody from the Department of Agricultural Technical Services; and Dr. <span class="col_1469-1470" refersTo="page_0757"/>Robertse of the Department of National Education.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, is it not strange, particularly here in the Western Province in the grape season, how a whole basket of beautiful grapes can be spoilt so by one little grape which may perhaps have the appearance and disposition of this hon. member. Whether they are English or Afrikaans-speaking is not the point here. I am giving you these names, Sir, in the knowledge that one really has the best people here. I am not committed to all of them. If this hon. member had come to me with five names, as one would have expected from a lady, we may perhaps put all five of them on this board. However, it is very clear to me that there is something that troubles her.</p>

<p>I want to make haste and deal with the following point, namely whether we should have more liaison with this board. Mention is made of this in the motion introduced by the hon. member for Hillbrow. I want to say that I cannot accept it. I want to tell the hon. member that at this moment four committees are inquiring into this matter. We have the committee on physics and engineering; the committee on medical sciences; the committee on geological and ecological sciences, and the committee on biological sciences. Their terms of reference are specific, a suitable national structure for organizations for the purpose of effecting satisfactory planning, implementation, co-ordination and co-operation in the wide field of scientific research, development and application. I think that it will be advisable to await these reports. It is not a lengthy inquiry. I have already said in reply to a question in this House that these reports will most probably be available to us by the middle of the year.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to tell the hon. member that I do not think, as the hon. member for Smithfield rightly said, that such a standing committee will really be competent, even if it is a select committee, to give an opinion on the priorities, and so forth, of research. Thirdly, I want to tell the hon. member that we have our caucus groups. I would appreciate it highly if the caucus groups on both sides would take a more active part in respect of the scientific aspects of the activities of the Department. I also want to say that all scientific work has to be accounted for in this House by various Ministers. I am responsible for the C.S.I.R. and my colleague the Minister of Agriculture is responsible for research done in the sphere of agriculture, and so forth. All funds that are being spent on research to-day and all research that is being done, has to be accounted for in this House by the responsible Minister. What is more, all funds that are made available for this purpose are subject to investigation by the Committee on Public Accounts. That is why I do not think that that will be the solution. I also want to tell the hon. member that in view of the fact that I do not think that this is the proper way, we should rather put our trust in the expert advice which will possibly be forthcoming from these committees.</p>

<p>I also want to reply to the point raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville. The position is that the C.S.I.R. is not doing research for the Department of Health. What is in fact the case, is that in the field of medicine the C.S.I.R. is responsible for the administration, control and allocation of funds which are being made available for medical research at universities and other institutions by the Government and other bodies. It is also true that the Department of Health does a very small amount of medical research. The C.S.I.R., through its committee for Medical Research and a vice-president, has been responsible for that up to now. But even in this respect the question has arisen, particularly in the light of our recent achievements, whether the time has not arrived for a separate medical research council to be established in South Africa. Hon. members will know that something of that nature can only be done by way of legislation. This is under consideration at the moment, namely whether we should in principle entrust the research in the field of medicine to a separate medical research council established by statute. Bodies of which we have to take a great deal of notice have been urging very strongly that such a medical research council should in fact be established. At the moment this matter is in my hands. I want to tell hon. members that even legislation for establishing such a council has already been submitted to me, not by my Department, but by bodies which feel that this must be effected. I hope that in the near future we shall have made so much progress, in respect of the financial implications as well, that I may possibly submit the matter to the Government, and that legislation in this regard may perhaps be introduced during this year still; if not, then in the course of next year.</p>

</speech>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In that regard I just want to say that to my mind such a need does exist. However, I want to make it very clear that in principle the Government has not yet decided on this matter. In respect of the faculties of agriculture and veterinary science a recommendation has been made by the scientific adviser and the scientific advisory board to the effect that at the least the question of where it should be situated, should be investigated. As hon. members know, this board is made up partly of departmental and partly of university staff for the purpose of dealing with problems in that sphere. I may say that the Government has decided to accept that recommendation, and that the Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of National Education and I will possibly make an announcement in that regard. I repeat that it has not been accepted in principle <span class="col_1471-1472" refersTo="page_0758"/>that it should necessarily be located elsewhere. However, the recommendations made by the scientific advisory board have been accepted, namely that investigations should be carried out in that regard and that a detailed report should be submitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that this has been a fruitful debate. I think that there is one thing that we can say without hesitation, namely that our scientists may rest assured that this House and the Government are not adopting an attitude of indifference towards them. I want to express the hope that to-day&#x2019;s discussion will be a new stimulus to those persons who are doing research in South Africa to soar to even greater heights in the future.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. D. TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to deal very briefly this afternoon with the social sciences in spite of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply because it seems to me that social sciences are very relevant to the motion before us to-day. They have not been discussed at all as yet. I would admit that many of these in their turn cannot be divorced from the field of medical planning and research. I think it is true that the two of them more or less go hand in hand&#x2014;at least they should. The social sciences are of course also linked with the question of education, housing and community life in general. It is a well-known fact that despite all the sophistication and the technical knowledge and ability of our modern world, ignorance, poverty and strife still remain rampant in many communities, including our own, and require very careful attention indeed. I am afraid it is necessary to say that these conditions often make a mockery of many of our more brilliant intellectual achievements and are so often forgotten. These are very definitely matters with which the legislators in this country are concerned. I want to remind hon. members that on the 29th January of this year. President Johnson of the U.S.A. presented the highest ever national budget that his country has ever seen. In spite of the appalling costs to the U.S.A. of the war in Vietnam and the aid which they are committed to giving to under-developed countries, in the U.S.A. budget the emphasis was placed upon sociological programmes considered vital to the whole fabric of American society. I want to quote very briefly from what President Johnson said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He called for spending cuts and some traditional programmes which left room for increases in programmes vital to the nation&#x2019;s fabric. He mentioned job training, urban renewal, crime control, family planning, health care for mother and infants, air pollution control and educational research as especially urgent domestic programmes.</block>

<p>He then selected specific issues for increases in their national budget, namely manpower training, model cities, control of rising crime, family planning and health care for mothers and infants, air and water pollution and particularly educational research. I would say that South Africa herself is in dire need of a planned and constructive programme of sociological research of a similar kind. South Africa is not only faced with the recognized problems of human adaptation in a technological society, because our society is becoming a technological society like every other society in the world. We have also to consider with the greatest care the necessary adjustments, which are very important in the scientific field, in the human relations which govern the lives of our four population groups here in South Africa, all of which at this stage happen to be at different stages of development. This in itself presents us in this country with a plethora of sociological problems which are inevitably linked with the provisions of social services with which this House is very much concerned. I would say that this is one aspect of our responsibilities which we ignore at our peril. The liaison between the legislature and the institutions concerned with scientific research, as suggested by the hon. member for Hillbrow, is absolutely essential. One has only to think of a very few items which are matters of obvious concern to the community in terms of the social sciences to which the State, the legislature, the sociologists and all the other people involved should pay attention. Take, for instance, the question of migratory labour and its devastating effects upon family life, and not only that but its devastating effect upon the individual human psyche. Take the question of illegitimacy which we have on an unprecedented scale amongst our Coloureds, and, to a certain extent, amongst our Bantu people, and the dangerous relationship that this bears in its turn to neglected children and juvenile delinquency with its subsequent development, in many cases, to crime. Moreover, poverty, as we know, is rampant in many quarters in South Africa. Indissolubly linked with all these things go the two twin nightmares for any modern community, those of ignorance and malnutrition. Of course, from malnutrition and poverty we then go on to the question of disease, which is a medical question with which I do not intend to deal. But in terms of the motion, I make the point again that all these problems require the closest co-operation between us in this House as legislators and those who work in the field of medical research, social research, educational research, economic research and so on. They are all inter-related: the one cannot possibly function without the other.</p>

<p>I make the point, Sir, that deterioration in community life, which we cannot afford to ignore, leads inevitably to the deterioration of the individual as well, and Government action and research are quite clearly linked as far as these two are concerned. Sir, take the question of the Government&#x2019;s inquiry into the problem of divorce in South Africa. The whole notice of inquiry has just been published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and the names of the members of this commission have been issued as well. Sir, I am sorry if I introduce a jarring note into what has been a very pleasant debate <span class="col_1473-1474" refersTo="page_0759"/>so far&#x2014;it has been like a cooing of doves as between the two sides of the House&#x2014;but I want to say that the personnel appointed by the Government to undertake this research into the reasons for the high rate of divorce in South Africa are good people; there are sociologists, churchmen and welfare workers amongst them, but, of course, it is quite inadequate to undertake an inquiry into the divorce rate in South Africa only amongst the Europeans. This inquiry should cover the whole field of family life throughout South African society, and I would like to know why there are no representatives from the sociological departments of our universities on this commission. I should like to know why there are no ministers of religion from denominations other than the Afrikaans churches. I should like to know quite frankly why there is not one English-speaking person on this commission and why the Minister could not see fit to appoint one or two members of this House to assist in the work of this commission. As I have said, I do not want to introduce a discordant note, but it seems to me that this is something which should be said.</p>

<p>Sir, if you take the very practical question of the substitution of Bantu labour by Coloured labour in the Western Cape, which is Government policy&#x2014;this is a matter of great practical concern to everybody in this House&#x2014;you will find that everybody will tell you that the Coloured people are entirely different from the Bantu people and that this is one of the prime difficulties with which our industrialists and employers of labour in this area are faced. I would suggest, just as an example, that this is a suitable subject for considerable research at a very high level by people from all walks of life in South Africa as well as by people who are concerned with the legislature.</p>

<p>It is reasons such as these, I think, which make it imperative for the Government to support the motion moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow. I agree entirely with his suggestion that there should be a standing select committee of members from both sides of the House. Sir, a lot of the initiative and dynamic could in fact come from members of this House if we were in a position to give it. We are, after all, the mouthpiece of South Africa&#x2019;s population. We are familiar with their problems and I would think that there is every justification for our playing such a part. Sir, one of the things that interested me was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comment on the question as to whether donations from private enterprise to some form of trust fund for research purposes, should be free of tax. I want to read out one brief extract which proves how muddled our thinking is in this regard. This is a letter which the Minister of Finance wrote to the Associated Chambers of Commerce of South Africa in February of this year The Minister in his letter to the president of Assocom says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State&#x2019;s heavy commitments for public welfare and education would not be appreciably lightened by donations from the private sector and thus the State could not be expected to suffer the considerable loss of revenue that acceptance of Assocom&#x2019;s proposal would entail &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is to say, that donations should be tax free&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Moreover, any concession would confer material tax relief only on companies and wealthy individuals which would be unfair discrimination.</block>

<p>Sir, when you consider that as a result of the magnificent achievements of our heart transplant team at Groote Schuur Hospital over the last few months, several mining houses in Johannesburg donated R1 million to the medical faculty of the University of Cape Town for cardiac research purposes, then it seems to me that to have the Minister of Finance making the final decision in all these instances, is wrong in principle and that this country suffers as a result of it. I would like the Minister of Planning to have freedom to build up his trusts on an entirely different basis.</p>

<p>I entirely support the hon. member for Hillbrow in his motion that we in this House should also be allowed to play a more vital part and that we should have more direct contact with research workers in many fields when we are called upon over and over again to legislate here as a result of the findings of the people who work in these particular fields of research.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to move the motion printed in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) there should be better co-ordination of the work undertaken by the Central Government, provincial administrations and local authorities in respect of the health services rendered to social pensioners and all indigent persons;</li>

<li>(2) the powers, duties and privileges of district surgeons should be re-examined with a view to increased efficiency; and</li>

<li>(3) consideration should be given to extending district nursing services with a view to increasing the services to be rendered at old-age homes and other welfare institutions.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_1475-1476" refersTo="page_0760"/>In submitting this motion to the House for consideration and particularly in inviting the friendly attention of the hon. the Minister in this regard, I realize that a discussion of this nature must necessarily be conducted with a great deal of circumspection. In the second place, however, I feel quite at liberty to submit this motion to the House as I know that the matter with which this motion is chiefly concerned, namely the care of our aged and other indigent persons, is one which surely is near to the hearts of all members of this House. Sir, I have said that a motion such as this would have to be discussed with a great deal of circumspection. There are certain reasons for this. I should like to mention them briefly in order to clarify my own point of view, which is, I believe, also the point of view of this House as far as certain points mentioned in this motion are concerned.</p>

<p>Firstly, when one speaks of the rendering of services, one necessarily will have to speak of the work that is being done by the provinces and by the local authorities, including the divisional councils of the Cape, the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board of the Transvaal and other bodies and persons concerned in these matters. At the outset I should like to state emphatically that it is my considered opinion that the work which the provinces have been doing in regard to health services over the years, particularly since the commencement of Act No. 36 of 1919, deserves the appreciation and gratitude of the Government. This applies not only to the provincial authorities, but also to our local authorities, divisional councils and other bodies and persons. The work they have been doing in regard to health services, deserves our appreciation, and I should like to testify to that here. Therefore any remarks made with regard to their work are meant as honest criticism of a system rather than criticism of their work.</p>

<p>But, secondly, the work of district surgeons and district nurses will have to be discussed in this debate and that is why we must be circumspect in dealing with this motion. These two groups are held in high esteem by all of us and they deserve our esteem because they are doing great work. The medical and the nursing professions are among the best professions one can choose, and I think that the work being done by these two groups in particular in our country, deserves our appreciation. But the third thing to be discussed here is a situation that, without anybody being directly responsible and perhaps with the best intentions on the part of the people concerned, has nevertheless arisen during the course of the years, and one is afraid that saying the wrong thing might easily have an adverse effect on the good services that are being rendered.</p>

<p>To return for one moment to the work of our surgeons, the hon. the Minister mentioned here a moment ago that we as a House have taken note of the great service that has been rendered by our surgeons, as well as the work done by research workers. Professor Barnard and his team, the surgeons in Johannesburg, and other surgeons have rendered great services in special fields. I should like to emphasize to-day that the work done in the past and up to this day by ordinary doctors, especially district surgeons in the outlying areas of our country and in mission hospitals etc., deserves as much praise and appreciation as any specialist deserves for his achievements. For that reason the second part of the motion contains the request that the position of district surgeons in particular be reconsidered so that they can do their work, which is also essential, with greater freedom. Thirdly I should like to give the Government and the Minister in particular the assurance that I am aware of the fact that the matter being dealt with here, is a subject which is being dealt with by commissions of inquiry, the reports of which are still being awaited, i.e. the Schumann Commission and the Borckenhagen Committee, and the contents of these reports cannot of course be anticipated. I know that the Government is engaged on these matters and that it cannot, at this stage, consider far-reaching changes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have said that I feel myself at liberty to introduce this motion, and I am doing so for several reasons, the first being that this matter has often been the subject of discussion in this House, and what one has always found striking in the discussion of this matter has been the sympathetic approach of all political parities in regard to the problems of our aged and other indigent persons. It is obvious that this should be the case when the Aged Persons Act, introduced by the hon. Minister of Social Welfare, was being discussed last year, the hon. member for Hillbrow made this very interesting statement. He said that the help being given to indigent persons, including the aged, could always be statistically calculated as an indication of the cultural level of the rest of the community. I think the help which is being unselfishly given to our non-Whites in particular, is certain proof of the cultural level of the Whites of South Africa who are rendering the best services to those people. Therefore I feel myself quite at liberty to introduce this motion to you.</p>

<p>But these matters have not only been discussed in this Assembly. Other people connected with our provincial authorities have in the past had very definite and resolute things to say in regard to the problem with which our aged and indigent people as well as others have to contend. I should like to refer to a speech made by Mr. F. R. Odendaal, Administrator of the Transvaal, on the occasion of the opening of the Congress of the Municipal Health Inspectors in Pretoria. There he had the following to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. President, in spite of the tremendous extent of the provincial services mentioned above and our own contribution which entails such a great diversity, we have no reason to-day to be self-complacent and satisfied, for amongst our population, both white and non-White, there are still thousands of those who are not sufficiently provided <span class="col_1477-1478" refersTo="page_0761"/>for as far as medical services are concerned. I am thinking particularly of those suffering from chronic diseases, the alcoholics and the aged, to mention only a few.</block>

<p>I shall return later to what Mr. Odendaal has said with regard to the aged. Not only the Provinces, but also the commissions that have specially been appointed for this purpose and instituted an investigation into medical services, have reached the same conclusions. I need only refer to the Snyman Commission, a report known to all of us. I should like to take one quotation from it, forcefully worded by the Snyman Commission, which deals with health services in general. They stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission was struck by the immense amount of overlapping in the pattern of medical care in the Republic. At three service levels there are individual and separate service organizations, each levying taxes. The Commission is firmly convinced that the country has neither the financial assets nor especially the manpower to offer such disjointed services, the extent of which will probably increase. The Commission is convinced of the need of closer co-ordination of the various services in order to comply with the highest medical requirements and to make an efficient and economical service available. It is further convinced that the time has arrived to pursue this aim as vigorously as possible.</block>

<p>This is what the Commission said, but the same thing was also said by people outside the medical profession and outside the assemblies of the country. As another instance I need only quote Dr. Cloete, the well known expert on constitutional law who said the following in his book on the provincial, central and local authorities, when he discussed this question of co-ordination. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The final solution to the question of coordination and integration cannot be found at any given moment. As the work of the Central, the provincial and the local government institutions undergoes changes in order to adapt to changing conditions, the need for new co-ordination and integration will continually arise. That is why matters which are the subject of continuous study by all the undertakings concerned, must be the subject of even more exhaustive studies in order to eliminate discrepancies.</block>

<p>I now maintain that changing conditions mentioned by Dr. Cloete, and the discrepancies against which he issues a warning in his book, have originated in our country in the past years in respect of our aged and the other indigent persons, and that this deserves serious reconsideration by the Minister concerned, the Government and by us as House of Assembly. It is a well known fact that the hon. member for Kimberley (South) and other members who participated in the debate during the discussion of the Aged Persons Act last year, stated most emphatically that we should face up to this problem which we have to deal with in South Africa to-day since special circumstances have changed our people&#x2019;s way of life to such an extent that we have a much larger number of aged persons in our country, and that the problem of caring for these aged persons has also as a result of changing circumstances become greatly aggravated and has assumed greater proportions. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) and others pointed out that the urbanization of our population and the industrialization of our country had resulted in our old people moving to towns and cities, thus departing from the large farm houses where a quiet atmosphere prevailed, and where they could enjoy a restful existence in their old age. But those things which we had in the past, are gone for ever. A calculation mentioned in last year&#x2019;s debate, indicated that only 25 per cent of all our aged people were still living with their children in their own homes. 68 per cent must fend for themselves. Two per cent of them, in the words of the hon. member for Kimberley (South), are with strangers, and only 5 per cent could be provided for in old-age homes, which in the words of the hon. member for Waterberg should really be called homes and be developed into homes. We are now being forced by these changing circumstances affecting the lives of our old people to make special provision for their care, even though we do not do so in the other fields of medical provision for the other groups of our population. We may talk at length about how children neglect their duty towards their parents, but one thing we must accept as a fact, namely that this situation exists. Wilfulness on the part of children is not always the cause; it is circumstances such as small flats and economic circumstances, as for example when women have to go to work to supplement the income. These are circumstances that make it necessary for the State to render the best possible services to these people who, in their old age, have become helpless as a result of many adverse circumstances and are dependent on others for help. I should like to quote what Mr. Odendaal, the Administrator of Transvaal, said in the same speech from which I have just quoted. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let me add immediately that organizations exist which sometimes do laudable work under very difficult circumstances to make things easier for these unfortunate people. They undoubtedly deserve our sympathy and support, and are in fact receiving it. But what I am more specifically concerned about, is the fact that these people have entered a kind of No-Man&#x2019;s-Land and that positive measures to provide for them do not at present exist. Society has a duty towards those of its members whose illness is of such a nature that they do not qualify for the usual hospitalization, and towards those who are at their wit&#x2019;s end or for whom life has become too difficult in their old age.</block>

<p>I am sure this House would agree with me when I say that we appreciate very much the <span class="col_1479-1480" refersTo="page_0762"/>work that has been done by these people and organizations over the years. I am thinking of the National Council for the Welfare of Aged Persons who has built homes and undertakes administrative work under difficult circumstances. I am thinking of the work being done by the Federation of Women. Who can evaluate that work in terms of money&#x003F; I am thinking of the work being done by churches in taking care of the aged who have become helpless, having taken upon themselves the responsibility for doing that work. One need only pay a visit to a home such as the Van Rensburg Home in Pretoria, where aged people that have become weak or senile are housed, to see under what difficult circumstances this work is being done. I should like to mention only one example of an ordinary old age home such as we find throughout the country, and my plea is that assistance of a medical nature be given to people living in this kind of home in order to care for them properly. It was the hon. member for Gordonia who said the following last year while the motion of the hon. member for Germiston was being discussed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Health care knows no political dividing lines. I want to tell the hon. member for Rosettenville, as one colleague to another, that it is not divisible along those lines.</block>

<p>The truth of this statement has been demonstrated more than once in the work being done by charity organizations in regard to the care of the aged. At Witbank, where an old age home has been built, English-speaking people and Afrikaans-speaking people and all the churches co-operated because they had accepted joint responsibility, and considered it a joint privilege to take care of the aged there. To this day it is being run jointly and there are long waiting-lists of people who want to spend their old age in that home.</p>

<p>But having said all this, I should like to know why there are such long waiting-lists&#x003F; Why is it that the Department of Social Welfare has voted such a large amount this year for homes, but that those homes that are needed, cannot be built as rapidly as those aged persons require them to be built&#x003F; I want to make the assertion that there is one deficiency which exists in regard to all old-age homes, and not only old-age homes, but in regard to the care of our aged and other indigent persons. This is the overlapping of services and the confusion in the services being rendered to indigent persons. I should like to mention an example. No unanimous norm is laid down in the four provinces according to which subsidies are payable with regard to health services. I must compliment the Cape for being ahead of the other provinces as far as this is concerned. Medical services at old-age homes are being subsidized to an amount of at least 90 per cent of the cost, compared with approximately 60 per cent in the Transvaal, although it has in fact improved a great deal in recent years. But in the Free State this work is being done solely by district surgeons and district nurses under the Central Government, and in Natal&#x2014;so I am informed by an inhabitant of Natal&#x2014;the situation is such that people who fall ill in an old-age home, even from a slight disease such as an attack of bronchitis, simply cannot be treated there; it is expected that they should be taken away to be treated in a hospital. Now you can imagine the confusion which will necessarily be caused in those organizations when they attempt to make these services available to aged people and wonder how far they can go and what they may undertake. There are at present four homes for the senile aged in our country. These are the Helen Home in Johannesburg, the Secura Home in Cape Town, the Home of the Natal Christian Women&#x2019;s Association in Pietermaritzburg, and the Van Rensburg Home in Pretoria.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there are aged people who really need help, then it is those groups of aged people who are not really ill but fall between those who are physically in good health and those who are really ill, those who require regular nursing. Why cannot provision be made for this group of people&#x003F; I maintain that the system of control being divided as it is, it is simply impossible to make adequate provision for this essential medical care at present. I maintain that the experience of our aged in Transvaal, is also the experience of aged people all over the country. I should like to mention an example, and we may laugh because this is the example of one person only and one may think it is a question of appealing to the emotions, but it is the simple truth. In the Transvaal, where this work is being done by the Central Government and the province and the Peri-urban Areas Health Board and the municipalities, who have every intention of doing it well, such a case is not only possible, it happens every day. For example, an aged person living in the area of the Periurban Areas Health Board, falls ill, so ill that the services of a surgeon are urgently required. A surgeon is called in for that person by somebody sufficiently interested in his case, but the law requires that before that district surgeon may go and visit that aged person, he must first be authorized by the magistrate. Only in exceptional cases can this be done later. Now he has to find someone to go and ask that magistrate to issue such an order, and this person must sit there and wait until a magistrate becomes available. Then he must drive back to tell the surgeon, himself a busy man, and if the surgeon arrives at the aged person after hours and finds that that person, who has rendered his services to this country, requires hospitalization, then he informs such an aged person that he must go to hospital. Now a difficulty arises in regard to ambulance services since he is outside the area of the Peri-urban Areas Health Board and they ask beforehand who is going to pay the costs. When he arrives at the hospital, the Provincial Ordinance stipulates for the information of this man and the surgeon on duty that he may not be admitted until the doctor is convinced <span class="col_1481-1482" refersTo="page_0763"/>that it is a case for which the province should pay. Once again forms are filled in and declarations made; this person is eventually reexamined and then goes to hospital. In the rural areas this happens every day. Then, after a few days in the care of a second surgeon&#x2014;and surgeons complain that they are not in a position to give their patients the necessary after-care&#x2014;they tell him that he may go home, and then he goes back to the district surgeon. He then returns to the district surgeon. I know he is able to obtain free medicine from the district surgeon. It is so. All concerned mean well. But what happens to this poor aged person&#x003F; Once he has returned he must obtain another order from a magistrate to have the doctor visit him so that the doctor can state once more that the patient is sick enough to require medication. Once he has received the order, he can obtain that medication free of charge. Or he can go to the Province, pay 50 cents and then he can obtain that medication through the provincial hospital. Is it right that there should be this kind of confusion among our old people&#x003F; I am not saying it is a humiliation; I maintain that the service is being rendered to them with the best of intentions. But now I want to ask: Can we understand that the old people regard this procedure as a humiliation, that the elderly person feels as if he must go with his hat in his hand, almost as if he were asking for alms when he needs those people who have offered their assistance to him&#x003F; And this is simply as a result of this overlapping of services. Last year the hon. member for Gordonia said that in the Cape the position was practically the same. I do not know what the position is in the other Provinces.</p>

<p>In the second part of my motion I specifically requested that the position of district surgeons should be taken into reconsideration. I believe, together with the late Mr. Odendaal and others who have expressed opinions in this regard, and together with hon. members of this House, that these services can be supplied under one central control. I know there may be people who will say: &#x201C;The autonomy of the Provinces and the local authorities is once more being tampered with here.&#x201D; In that case I want to take the sole responsibility upon myself. If autonomy of any local or provincial government means confusion, then I say, &#x201C;Away with autonomy&#x201D;. However, it does not mean that I in any way desire that the rights of our Provinces and local authorities, bodies which are rendering such excellent services, should be tampered with. I want this matter to be seen from the point of view of those bodies as well, in that they sometimes do not know where they stand in regard to the subsidies and the different laws which are promulgated and which they must obey. This need for coordination, which must be considered for our aged and indigent persons, is now an urgent necessity. A start can be made with this coordination with the work of district surgeons.</p>

<p>Over the years we have had various part-time district surgeons at Witbank, people who did outstanding work. At Bronkhorstspruit, in my constituency, there are full-time district surgeons. But I want to put this question: Why is it that posts for these people, whose special task it is to look after the indigent and the aged, are not filled&#x003F; Why is it not possible to fill these district surgeons&#x2019; posts&#x003F; Why is it that of a total of 101 full-time posts 56 are at present vacant&#x003F; Why do part-time district surgeons give up their work so easily&#x003F; I think that we must think seriously about reconsidering this problem. Other hon. members will elaborate on the reasons why the position in respect of district surgeons is so unsatisfactory. I only want to express one idea in this regard. In each town the district surgeon, as far as medical services are concerned, ought to be the main figure, because he is the person who works with our aged and indigent persons; because he must not only be a doctor but also an ambassador to our non-Whites, a person who has to convey the opinions of white South Africa and the image of white South Africa. I want to request that this House make district nursing services available to them and make it possible for them to fulfil the role which is worthy of them.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that the position, in my opinion, cannot be better summarized than has been done by Dr. J. D. Verster, in control of hospital services in the Transvaal, when he addressed the congress of the South African National Council for the Welfare of the Aged, at its special meeting in Pretoria in 1967 and spoke in particular about the aged. He said he had the following to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By way of summary I would like to suggest that except for the accommodation of healthy or reasonably healthy aged persons, the responsibility for the care of aged persons in respect of normal diseases, chronic diseases and debilitated and helpless aged persons, ought to be the responsibility of one single authority. Only then will it be possible to plan purposefully in order to render efficient service on an economic basis. Continuity of medical nursing care is essential in all these cases, and the machinery must exist to offer care in more than one place. Then and then only can there be a question of geriatric services with the necessary research, not only in respect of geriatrics, but even in respect of gerontology.</block>

<p>This is what the Director of Hospital Services of our largest Province had to say, and I as a layman would like to subscribe to this, and I as a layman believe, together with hon members of this House, that our old people, our aged persons, our indigent persons&#x2014;non-Whites included&#x2014;deserve this re-orientation. I believe that along the directions I have indicated a start can be made so that there may ultimately be the necessary co-ordination in other fields as well and so that it will be possible to render satisfactory services.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Witbank has made a fine plea for <span class="col_1483-1484" refersTo="page_0764"/>the care of the aged. He has repeated what my colleagues and I here have been saying for many years. I hope that because this latest plea has come from that side of the House more notice will be taken of it now. We have pointed out over and over again the tragic position of the aged and the difficulties with which they are faced. Any man who has actually practised in this country, in town or countryside, appreciates this position and realizes that it is becoming worse. It is, as the hon. member has said, because we are ceasing to be a rural population and people are moving into the towns, that those who remain behind their contemporaries no longer have the care which they used to receive from their own families. There is no room for the elderly in the house and in the result they have to board out or live in aged homes where, unfortunately, they meet loneliness and lack of personal care.</p>

<p>The first leg of this motion calls for better co-operation and co-ordination of the services. It also should have called, I think, for improvement in the services. There will never be co-ordination and co-operation to the proper extent for these people until the care of these people is placed under one head. I think this matter should fall under the Department of Health. At the moment it is divided between two departments, neither of which really has responsibility over the whole field. As the hon. member said, theoretically the district surgeon has to attend to the old people, but by the time the unfortunate patient has found the district surgeon and the magistrate, and when he has obtained the necessary permission, his condition has generally deteriorated to such an extent that he has to be moved into hospital. But even more, the patient&#x2019;s condition has deteriorated because time has passed and because the conditions under which he lives are so lonely and so difficult, nobody takes any real interest in him. The Department of Social Welfare more or less feels that when it has given the old man money with which to buy food, it has finished with him. It has no great interest in the man. The district surgeon is a man of many parts. Very often he is but a part-time man. As the hon. member said there are numerous vacancies in this field, and we should like to know why there are so many vacancies. The district surgeon is expected to be a forensic physician, an authority on medical jurisprudence, a searcher after detective stories for crime discovery and a post-mortem pathologist. He also has to perform various other police and state duties which are only indirectly connected with the care of the sick. I wish to emphasize the words &#x201C;the care of the sick&#x201D;. So long as the district surgeon&#x2019;s time is occupied to such a great extent by his other work, so long will we experience these difficulties connected with the care of these people.</p>

<p>In Cape Town a good system is in operation, largely, I believe, because of the subsidy from the Cape Province. Nevertheless, the Cape Town M.O.H. tells me that his department accepts full responsibility for the care of the aged and indigent. At one time they did have a full-time practising doctor, who had nothing to do with the district surgeon, carrying out this work. From a medical point of view they have found it more convenient to divide the city into blocks and to appoint a general practitioner in the area who will undertake the care at all times of the aged and indigent. In this way, so has been found, the care of these people is improved, and the number who have to go to hospital has diminished. The reason why this system is so good is because it is separated from the forensic activities of the district surgeon. The doctors who are employed by the Department of Health of the City of Cape Town are practising doctors, not connected with any other particular medical responsibility. They are simply doctors who have accepted the responsibility and who receive remuneration from the Department of Health of Cape Town. At the moment this system is as near as possible to the ideal. It emphasizes what I have said in the past, namely that the Department of Health should undertake the care of these people. They should not in any way be placed under the care of the Department of Social Welfare.</p>

<p>For years I have been of the opinion that the Department of Social Welfare should come under the hon. the Minister of Health. I think if medicine and social welfare both fell under the Minister of Health, it would be a much better combination of portfolios than that of Posts and Telegraphs and Health, as was the position until recently. If the Department of Social Welfare was abolished and Pensions were given to the Treasury or some like department, then we would have a very much better Department of Health and much improved care for the socially indigent, not only those who lack money but also those who are indigent as regards friends and family. In all cases these aged people ultimately come back to the doctor; there ultimately comes a time when they see their doctor, and there they find relief. They receive kindness and sympathy which, after all, it is the doctor&#x2019;s duty to dispense.</p>

<p>If the district surgeon&#x2019;s duties were separated into the two categories which I have suggested, and the district surgeon were used only for forensic work whilst the doctors were to look after the sick and the aged, there would be better forensic work performed and better care of these people.</p>

<p>Let us investigate, too, the question of home visiting, the question of home doctoring. At the present time the aged and infirm are frequently not seen at all by any professional person of the type referred to until they become ill. And that is not the outlook of modern medicine. The outlook of modern medicine is to see that people do not become ill. We all know that with ageing come various degenerations, various susceptibilities to the diseases of the aged. We know that on the limited amount of money given by the Department <span class="col_1485-1486" refersTo="page_0765"/>of Pensions to these people, they can afford few luxuries in the way of food and few luxuries in the way of heat, and consequently they are exposed to malnutrition. The malnutrition of the aged among people without teeth and frequently without the means of heating their food, is a well-known condition. I think the hon. member mentioned chronic bronchitis. We have aged people who smoke, and probably they have been smoking pipes and cigarettes for years, and they will all get chronic bronchitis. But they do not have to be neglected to the point where they develop pneumonia and have to be cared for in a hospital. I believe it is the duty of those who are responsible for the care if these people to see that they are visited every day, including Saturdays and Sundays. They must not be left to die in their single, lonely rooms, and their bodies discovered only when someone has noticed four or five bottles of milk outside the door, or a neighbour, after not having seen an old lady for a couple of days, decides to see what has happened to her. They should be visited by a district nurse or some other competent person every day, including, as I saw Saturdays and Sundays. Never a day should pass that they are not seen by somebody. Preferably they should be seen every day by a professional nurse, although at times visits by the social workers would be a great help and encouragement, especially unpaid voluntary social workers. I would go further and say that at least once a week either a doctor or a psychiatric nurse should call. Many people in mental homes could have been kept out had their position not been allowed to deteriorate. Nobody with a skilled eye and ear like a doctor or a psychiatric nurse, had seen them, and noticed them steadily going downhill. Had such a skilled person visited the patient, it would have been noticed that the patient was developing certain illusions and delusions. The patient could then have been attended to. It is the prevention of illness, of malnutrition, of lack of care that is so very important. These old people must be attended to. They are old, and we will be old soon. Perhaps we will have to go into these old age homes or single rooms, and we would not like the fate I have described to descend upon us. Many of these people have few, if any, relatives. It is the duty of us in this House to see whether we cannot, all of us together, model an ideal way of attending to the old people. We can make a start by blending Social Welfare with Health. We can ask the Department of Health to use their resources&#x2014;the district nurses, the psychiatric nurses, and others&#x2014;to the advantage of these people. The Department of Health should ensure that all these services are available more easily where and when needed. &#x201C;Easily&#x201D; is the keyword here. We cannot expect an old man of 80 or 90, crippled and with a heavy limp, to go out and look for a doctor, hunt for a magistrate, and things of that nature. We cannot expect him to sit for hours in the magistrate&#x2019;s building, waiting to see the magistrate, often without food, and then to go and find a doctor. Thereafter he must still get an order for his medicine. By the time he has done all these circuits, he cannot even find his way home. Eventually he gets to where he should be, namely in the hospital, because the police or the ambulance will pick him up in the road. That is the sort of thing our old people have to face. They either have to endure all this discomfort, or they stay at home and a few days later somebody notices bottles of milk outside the closed little door.</p>

<p>The two Ministers concerned with this subject have a responsibility to see that they provide a service which helps these people, not a service on paper but a service in practice.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>We are truly grateful to the hon. member for Witbank for having introduced this motion. We are grateful for the manner in which and the seriousness with which he introduced the motion. We are also grateful for the attitude adopted by the hon. Opposition as revealed in the speech made by the hon. member for Durban (Central), who is himself advanced in years and who will also soon fall in this category of aged persons. We agree wholeheartedly with what he said, and I do not want to enlarge on it any further, except to say that we should not regard the health services rendered to the aged as forming part of the pattern of ill-health so that it should fall under the Department of Health. I do not think it is right to draw a clear distinction here between the work of the Department of Social Welfare and that of the Department of Health.</p>

<p>This motion consists of three parts: the patient, the doctor, and nursing and medicine. We should bear in mind that our aged are increasing in number because, whereas the life expectancy in the year 1900 was only 49 years, it was 55 years in 1920, and in 1960 it was 68 years for males and 70 years for females. When breaking down these figures, we find that the life expectancy of man has, on the average, increased by four months per year. Most of us can still remember quite well the big gathering we had in earlier times when grandfather reached the age of 70, and we can still remember that the mayor of the town came to congratulate the aged person who turned 90. Only recently we heard aged persons who were older than 90 years being congratulated over the radio. Two years ago we still cared to listen, but to-day we hardly listen when they congratulate somebody who has reached even the age of 105 years. We should, therefore, bear in mind that we are living so much longer. I do not want to go into all the reasons for it. Partly it is as a result of the good work done by the Department of Health. Our higher standard of living also contributes to it, and so does research, better medical aids, better surgical methods, and so forth.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with the indigent, those people who are the responsibility of the district surgeon. As a matter of fact, this is what the motion is dealing with. We are not dealing <span class="col_1487-1488" refersTo="page_0766"/>here with the aged person who still enjoys good health. The aged person regards himself and wants to regard himself as being independent. He fights against the intrusion of things which are strange to him. His thoughts turn inwards and when he becomes ill he involuntarily believes it to be his final illness, the beginning of the end. Such a person requires special care. Under the present state of affairs, it is the responsibility of the district surgeon to care for him. The district surgeon treats him at home and when he becomes seriously ill he is transferred to a provincial hospital. If he recovers there, he goes back either to his home or to the institution from which he came. We must try to keep these people in their own environment. As far as this is concerned, I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member for Durban (Central). An aged person is quite a different person when he is ill&#x2014;for example: his reactions are slow; the thought immediately enters his mind that you only want to send him to hospital to die there and he does not want to go; consequently, he conceals certain symptoms; in other words, he does not tell you everything he should. Such an aged person requires somebody who can approach him sympathetically, somebody in whom he can have confidence. He does not want to be treated by one doctor to-day and land up in a hospital to-morrow where he is treated by a different doctor. Usually he is slow to react and forgetful. He cannot remember what to tell you. He tells you about his illness starting at the time of the rinderpest, and it takes him ten minutes to take off his jacket so that he may be examined. As the hon. member for Witbank said, he gets his medicine through a cumbersome process: through the magistrate to the doctor and from him to some chemist or other. He cannot even read the instructions on the bottle. He is quite a different person. We must remember this because we may also reach that stage one day. For this reason I am glad the hon. member for Durban (Central) mentioned &#x201C;home doctoring&#x201D;. We should like to see such a person being treated at home, but the district surgeon cannot always cope with it alone. The only way in which the district surgeon can be helped&#x2014;and this I want (to plead for&#x2014;is by extending the district nursing services. These nurses may act as a direct link between the aged persons who are ill, the sick, indigent people on the one hand, and the district surgeon on the other. Then there is also the problem of aged persons who require hospital care. Where do they go to after that&#x003F; Probably they cannot be cared for at home. It is particularly in cases such as these Where the district nurse may act as a direct link between the sick aged person and the district surgeon so that she may keep the surgeon informed of the condition of such an aged person.</p>

<p>I now want to say a few words about the services rendered by the district surgeon. In the first place, we should bear in mind that a district surgeon is an ordinary, trained, general medical practitioner and not a special type of doctor. He receives the same basic training as that of any other general medical practitioner. His training includes only a brief course in forensic medicine&#x2014;such as postmortems, the examination of wounds and so forth. His training in psychiatry does not cover a wide field either&#x2014;it includes only the basic facts. He receives only a brief training, probably not more than a few lectures, in geriatrics, i.e. the study of the symptoms displayed by old people. Now this person is appointed district surgeon. Later on I shall elaborate on the reasons given by the hon. member for Witbank for there being such a shortage. What are the duties of the district surgeon&#x003F; What does he do&#x003F; I should like to distinguish between two types of district surgeons: the district surgeon in the countryside and the district surgeon in the urban complex. The main task of the country district surgeon is quite rightly to care for the indigent and the needy, whom we are discussing now, the aged and the poor. But included in that we also have 95 per cent of the Bantu population in the country districts, who are also entrusted to his care. That forms one part of his work.</p>

<p>Another part of his duties consists of forensic work, for example the carrying out of post-mortems, examinations in cases of assault, whether criminal or any other kind of assault. He is responsible for the medical services of the police and prisons; he has to issue all the necessary certificates and he undertakes all the medical work in connection with new appointments in all but a few Government departments, as well as the Defence Force. He has to conduct investigations on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, for example in cases of child neglect, and numerous other investigations which are not directly related to the nature of his training and his status as a physician. We think of the many hours the district surgeon has to spend on court cases. I must say we are grateful for the fact that the magistrates are so kindly disposed and helpful towards the district surgeons in calling them to give evidence at an early stage of the proceedings in cases of assault and so forth. Just think of the district surgeon who has to determine the percentage of alcohol in the case of drunk motorists at any time of the night, also on Saturday nights. He has to attend to all these matters.</p>

<p>The main function of the district surgeon in the country districts is to render services to the Bantu, of whom 95 per cent are under his care. He also has to travel thousands of miles to remote places. I can remember quite well a case which I experienced personally. One Saturday afternoon I had to travel 30 miles to go and examine a Bantu. When coming to the fifth gate I was nearly desperate At the sixth gate I found a Bantu who opened the gate for me. When I asked him who the patient was, he said: &#x201C;I am, Master&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, these are the problems we experience.</p>

<p><span class="col_1489-1490" refersTo="page_0767"/>The main task of the unban district surgeon, on the other hand&#x2014;as the hon. member for Berea, who knows them well, will know&#x2014;is to carry out post-mortems and forensic examinations as far as the legal aspect is concerned. The district surgeon was not actually trained to do this. He also does inoculations for passport purposes. In the cities, unlike in the country districts, there are public health services such as immunization against contagious diseases, etc. These services are rendered by the district surgeon in conjunction with the local authorities. The result is that a position arises for which we cannot blame the Department of Health, namely that, as the hon. member for Witbank has said, 56 out of 105 permanent posts are vacant and that 59 out of 402 part-time posts, are vacant.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what are we doing&#x003F; We should also exchange positive thoughts. I should like to emphasize district nursing once again. Secondly, I want to suggest that we should raise the status of the district surgeon to that of an important person in the community. We should assist him to do the work for which he is qualified, namely, rendering medical services.</p>

<p>Another method of once again giving him that stature is to make him the leading figure as regards health education, as the hon. member has said. I am very sorry that the Press did not give publicity to the establishment of the National Council for Health Education a month ago. That should be the main Object of the district surgeon. He should keep the people healthy and informed. We should make it attractive for him. He should be a person who not only visits those people, but also instructs them as regards their duties. He should instruct them as regards certain symptoms, so that they will be able to notice such symptoms in good time and the disease may be checked. It is so easy to say that we can do so much research to fight, for example, cancer and vote so much money for that purpose; why cannot we do just as much to detect it in good time&#x003F; We will then be able to know that we can obtain better results by treating it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion I want to read to you a short extract from the latest South African Medical Journal. The leading article reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Health ignorance&#x2014;an indictment. The reason for indictment is that one of the most powerful paramedical personnel in a health programme, the health educator, is missing and, what is worse, is not being trained in sufficient numbers to meet the challenges of inadequate health standards in the community. What is required is a professional worker who will regard health programmes as a co-operative venture with the community he serves. We wish to propose that the State should consider the establishment of training, programmes for health educators, who preferably would belong to the same racial and cultural group as the community with which they intend to work.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, an old Bantu once called me to a place far in the country. A small Bantu child was sick; he had pneumonia. I explained carefully to his father, when I gave him a handful of pills, that he should give one pill every four hours. I told him he would be well the next morning. The next day the old Bantu travelled 18 miles on horseback to come and ask me for more of those pills. He had gathered all the Bantu of the kraal together and given them each a pill.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Brentwood referred in his speech to the question of the growing number of old people and referred to the growing challenge that is with us, the challenge to deal with this increasing number of old people He also referred to the question of the district surgeons and I, too, in the course of my remarks wish to come back to this particular aspect.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Witbank in the way in which he introduced this motion indicated that it was his intention that it should be discussed outside the circle of political acrimony. I believe that this afternoon we have had a discussion on that basis, one which in certain instances has evoked comment and one perhaps which has also evoked criticism. But I believe that the criticism which has been given this afternoon has been given as constructive criticism.</p>

<p>One aspect which has been most market, I believe, in the remarks of all the speakers so far, is that there has been very little mention of the term old age pensioner. I think that is something for gratification. Our friends on that side of the House have referred to the &#x201C;oues van dae&#x201D; or the &#x201C;bejaardes&#x201D;. I would like to think that we should use the term as far as possible &#x201C;our senior citizens&#x201D;. We should get away from the term &#x201C;an old age pensioner&#x201D;. We should regard these people as respectable members of our community and we should give them a term similar perhaps to the suggestion of senior citizens.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the first part of the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, in which he refers to the health services rendered to social pensioners and all indigent persons. We have had as a result of debate in the House in the past statements by the hon. Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, and also by the hon. Minister of Health, which would indicate to us that all social pensioners or senior citizens are regarded as indigent for the purpose of receiving free medicines and medical services. We have had from the Minister of Social Welfare an admission that pensioners may have difficulties in regard to claiming their rights, because in many instances they are not fully aware of their rights. The Minister of Social Welfare indicated that he was going to investigate the possibility of issuing some sort of document or authority, which a pensioner would be able to use, which would enable him to know exactly what his rights were in regard to the receipt of free medical services and free medicines. The hon. Minister of Health has agreed in the past that pensioners <span class="col_1491-1492" refersTo="page_0768"/>may have difficulty in regard to information regarding district surgeons. It seems to me then that there is a necessity for some greater liaison and co-ordination between these two departments: firstly, to see that pensioners are provided with the information which they need in regard to these services; and secondly, to see that the manner in which the services are given, is most efficient.</p>

<p>I think it is fair at this stage to ask that if the hon. the Minister is coming into the debate, he should indicate whether anything has been done in the co-ordination of these two departments, and also in regard to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s undertaking that in so far as the names of district surgeons in telephone directories are concerned, steps would be taken at least to standardize the form of announcement which was made. I realize that these matters take time. I hope, though, that the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us that something has been done in that regard.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the position which exists in the platteland. I believe that in the platteland, while the position is very different from that in large urban areas, there is a more intimate relationship between the district surgeon and the magistrate, so that this procedure of the magistrate having to give some form of authority before the district surgeon can carry out his professional services is not as difficult as it might be in the larger cities. We know that once the senior citizen requires the services of a district surgeon, he is entitled to medicine, and if the district surgeon is one who has his drug allowance, he is in a position to supply it. If not, then facilities exist for the medicine to be supplied on the basis of the Government dispensing contract. But, Sir. the problem seems to be more acute in the large areas, in the large cities. If we take for example a city like Durban with a population of roughly 182,000 Whites, we find, according to a survey, that there are estimated to be 24.000 white people over the age of 60. I do not believe that it is unreasonable to state that of those people there could be up to 5,000 senior citizens or people who are in receipt of some form of State pension.</p>

<p>In a city of that nature, there are 5,000 souls, old. more subject to illness and more in need of medical treatment, who rely on the services offered by the provincial authorities and also who rely to a certain extent on the district surgeons.</p>

<p>Now we know, Sir, that the provincial authorities in hospitals supply both an outpatient and an in-patient service. We know that these people can obtain their medical treatment and their medicines from that source. But there are certain problems; there are problems of delays and there is the problem, too, of the senior citizen who lives alone. The hon. member for Durban (Central) has referred to these people, people who might find in the middle of the night that they require urgent medical service. Take for example an asthmatic. What is the position at the moment&#x003F; As far as I have been able to ascertain, a person in that position could call upon an ambulance to be taken to a provincial hospital. There he would receive the necessary treatment. If it is a case of asthma, it might only be necessary for one injection to be administered and the patient might be ready to be sent home perhaps that night or the next morning.</p>

<p>As far as his return home next morning is concerned, I believe that Social Services offer some form of assistance to these people so that they can at least return home by taxi. But I submit that this is a wasteful and extravagant way of treating a person in this position. I believe that other means could be adopted whereby a call from such a person should result in a medical man being available to attend to that person in the place where he lives, be it a room or a flat or anywhere else. I think particularly of the people who live on their own and who are completely dependent upon outside aid. I know that there are people who are so concerned about the fact that they are unable to get a service such as that at any time of the night that they are not prepared to forego the benefits which they get by virtue of their husbands or wives being members of a benefit society or a medical aid society attached to their former place of employment. It means that a couple who may have a small pension by virtue of the husband&#x2019;s employment and who enjoy a social pension, are called upon to pay regular monthly installments to a medical aid society in order to ensure that if at any time they need medical services, they are assured of getting them. I believe that in the big cities, with due respect to the district surgeons and I do not want to belittle their work in any way, the district surgeons do not come out at night if they are contacted for cases of this kind. I believe that the ideal manner in which these problems could be treated would be for a patient to be in a position to phone a district surgeon by day or by night, to receive treatment and if necessary, medicine. We know that in the large cities the district surgeons do not have drug allowances and do not do their own dispensing. Facilities do, however, exist in most of the large cities for urgent prescriptions to be filled day and night. I believe that under the Government contract this could be done so that the persons could be assured of medical treatment and medicines with a minimum of delay. I believe that recovery would take place more rapidly under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Previous speakers have referred to the question of the position of the district surgeon. The complaint has been made that the position in this regard is not satisfactory. I am not criticizing the district surgeons in any way. I believe that they are doing a wonderful job of work, but I believe that their numbers are inadequate, as previous speakers have pointed out. I also believe that their working conditions are not what they should be and that they are overworked and underpaid. I believe that the time has come when the State will have to consider very seriously what can be <span class="col_1493-1494" refersTo="page_0769"/>done to overcome the shortage of district surgeons and to fill the vacant posts which exist now. To indicate the position as far as the district surgeons are concerned, I want to quote from the annual report of the Association for the Aged in Durban (Tafta):</p>

<block name="quote">District surgeons are overworked and do not always have the proper drugs available in the right quantities. They are not permitted or willing to visit old-age pensioners without a certificate or warrant from the magistrate unless they charge a fee which the patients cannot afford. The proper tabulation of medical services in telephone directories is also long overdue.</block>

<p>To sum up I should therefore like to make the following suggestions. First of all we do accept that the position is unsatisfactory. We do agree that departmental co-ordination between the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is necessary. We agree that pensioners need to be informed of their rights. We also accept that the services offered should be available to them. We feel that if the State cannot always provide this service, private enterprise should be enlisted to provide this service. This must not however be done at the expense of the senior citizens. I believe also that the working and salary conditions of district surgeons should be improved as a matter of urgency. Finally I believe that the standard and adequate publication of details of services must be a priority so that our senior citizens know what they are entitled to.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with an important subject to-day, namely the care of the aged. I think that we are placing rather too little emphasis on the first part of this motion in which the hon. member for Witbank asks for better coordination to promote better care. When a world-renowned expert in the field of surgery, Dr. De Largy, was asked how it came about that he became interested in this subject, he replied &#x201C;I saw it coming&#x201D;. In South Africa today we are on the crest of the wave of exceptional publicity as regards medical achievements. I want to say that those who are not blind to what is happening, and who had the privilege of seeing those films about the wonderful achievements should have said, like Dr. De Largy, &#x201C;I saw it coming&#x201D;. But if one just turns aside from that tremendous achievement for a moment to consider what it all involves, one realizes that one cannot ignore the factors which contributed to it. Between 23 and 30 doctors and nurses took part in that successful operation. Since we are faced with a manpower shortage to-day, our advice to industry is always that they should introduce automation and should mechanize and so employ much less manpower. But in the case of this remarkable medical achievement, we have the very opposite process. In earlier years we needed perhaps one nurse to care for 20 patients, but to-day, in these special cases, we find ourselves in the position that at times we need 20 nurses to care for one patient. Here we therefore have a movement in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Consequently I want to make the statement here to-day that I do not think we can afford the luxury of having a divided control of our health services much longer. I believe that if matters continue in this way, and if the development in the field of medicine goes much further, as seems likely at the moment, we shall be faced with an acute shortage in our nursing services. In expressing my concern about nursing services, I feel that it is in fact by means of nursing services that we should assist our aged in the first instance. The actual medical treatment must only come afterwards.</p>

<p>But one must also consider the extent of this problem. It has been viewed from all angles. Tremendous costs are involved. We have in this instance a very clear dividing line between the costs involved in rendering assistance to the Whites and the cost involved in rendering assistance to the non-Whites. Until a few years ago 45 per cent of the money made available to the Bantu for medical aid was used for the treatment of tuberculosis, a contagious disease. The diseases mostly found among the Bantu to-day, are mainly contagious diseases. These contagious diseases have virtually disappeared as a matter of real concern among the aged in the other colour group. We are now up against metabolic diseases, diseases of long duration. Very heavy costs are involved in treating such diseases. In the U.S.A. it is calculated that almost one third of the amount voted for health services is used for the treatment of chronic illnesses. It is an enormous amount of almost 16,000 million dollars. That is a great deal of money, but it is not so much if one considers that it costs each member of the population in the U.S.A. about R40 per year to live 20 years longer. Seen in that light, it is in fact a small contribution.</p>

<p>But I consider the manpower shortage to be an even greater problem, especially in the case of nursing services. I foresee that we shall have to provide special clinics for the aged, clinics where they can feel at home and where there will be no need for them to hurry. What is more in such clinics they will not have to consult a doctor in circumstances which are strange to them. These will primarily be clinics where perhaps one doctor will be able to care for ten times as many patients because they all suffer from the same complaints, whereas one doctor is necessary for ten patients in an ordinary hospital. Because there are only very few such clinics in existence, the provincial hospitals have to attend to these people at the very high cost of between R9.50 and R10 per patient per day. I believe that in such clinics which will each deal with one specific complaint only, it will be possible to render a cheaper yet much more effective service. We are in the position that taxes for health services <span class="col_1495-1496" refersTo="page_0770"/>are levied on four planes. Services are being rendered on four planes. It is not possible to separate these services either cartographically, politically, or economically. Health does not lend itself to division. There is only one object in the case of any medical service, and that is the preservation and restoration of health. The object of any service provided to our aged must be the prevention rather than the treatment of disease. I do not think this this can be done properly under the present circumstances where we have an overlapping of services, a wastage of manpower and are faced with a possible shortage of nurses which may become disastrous in a few years&#x2019; time.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>It appears to me that we are all agreed that the under privileged, and the pensioner, have to receive treatment often and do receive treatment but that what they receive at the moment may or may not be satisfactory. I think we are all agreed here this afternoon that we will expect the Minister to heed the pleas that have been made to him and that he will be able to present to this House some way of looking after those who cannot possibly look after themselves. It seems to me that the question is how we are going to give these people good treatment. It has been conclusively shown to the House that the present system of treatment by district surgeons, however willing the district surgeon is, is not altogether satisfactory. It is not satisfactory for two reasons. Firstly, the district surgeon himself is overwhelmed with work. He is doing work which he should not be doing; he is unable to give sufficient time to the sick patient and, secondly, there is great difficulty in getting his services. Let us take the question of trying to get hold of the district surgeon. The hon. the Minister was recently Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. If he looks at the telephone directory he will find that it is very difficult to find the district surgeon&#x2019;s number. Can you imagine an elderly person, deficient in eyesight, unable to distinguish between the Government section of the directory and the ordinary section, looking for the district surgeon&#x2019;s number, probably at night. The first thing that I would suggest is that the district surgeon&#x2019;s number should be printed in bold print right in front of the directory, on the same page on which the numbers of the ambulance service, the fire brigade and the police appear.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<p>He will come behind the ambulance. The district surgeon should be able to be contacted without difficulty and the obstacles which present themselves before he is able to make the necessary contact, such as having to get a warrant from a magistrate, must be done away with: Sir, red tape could be done away with quite easily. I suggest that the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, with which the hon. the Minister must be in touch, should issue a card to every pensioner, a card with his name and identity number or photograph on it. That card should entitle him to three things: Firstly, it should entitle him to get the services of the district surgeon; secondly, it should entitle him to get an ambulance either from the Central Government. the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board or the local authority. He must be entitled to get an ambulance and one authority must not pass the buck to another authority. Thirdly, the card should entitle him to have his prescription dispensed without answering a long list of why&#x2019;s and wherefore&#x2019;s and all that sort of nonsense. At the same time I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should tell the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions that he must issue a brochure to the pensioner, a brochure which will set out not only the suggestions made by the hon. member for Berea but which will also tell him how to live. It should tell him how to use food so that he will benefit by it. Sir, I believe, like other members, that it is very often much better to see that the man or woman is fed properly than to find under-nourished people continually having to receive services either from the district surgeon or from district nurses.</p>

<p>It is no good our expecting miracles to happen overnight but we must make a start and we must make a start as soon as possible. I like the idea of the hon. member who has just sat down. We previously propagated the idea of clinics. I think the clinic idea is an excellent one. These clinics should be established in or together with or in the vicinity of old-age homes. We have examples of that in Johannesburg. The Witwatersrand Home for Aged Jews has such a clinic, and these people, whether they have means or not, are treated at that clinic and, if necessary, are actually hospitalized there. This does obviate the necessity of having a multitude of nurses and it obviates the necessity of doctors retracing the history of these people over and over again for illnesses which may be minor or major. We know that when a person is ill he considers his case to be the most important at the time, whatever the illness is; it may be a bad dose of flu or an appendicitis or a heart transplant. The under-privileged people now have to go cap in hand for the necessary medical or nursing service, but I think it is time we in this country put a stop to that state of affairs.</p>

<p>Then again, education must be brought to the patient so that he will not have the fear which the hon. member for Brentwood mentioned. The hon. member said, aged persons are very often afraid to go into a hospital. They are afraid because they think that that will be the last ride. Well, we must impress upon these people that the quickest way to be cured is through hospital services. I think we should canvass that idea and see whether we cannot introduce the card system that I have suggested, Secondly, we should see whether we cannot have clinics attached to old-age homes and, thirdly, whether we cannot educate the <span class="col_1497-1498" refersTo="page_0771"/>aged how to use food properly. Fourthly, we must impress upon them that hospitals are there to cure people and not to kill them. I also want to make the suggestion that the Department of Social Welfare should, if possible, encourage the establishment of friendship clubs in close proximity to or at these clinics, friendship clubs where people can exchange ideas and where they will be encouraged not to remain alone but to come out and meet other people to discuss matters of common interest.</p>

<p>Sir, unfortunately I am unable to continue because of the time allocated to me. I will now sit down and await the Minister&#x2019;s reply with interest.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>I know that the House expects me to be brief, and I shall try not to disappoint them in that expectation. In the first place I should like to congratulate everyone who has taken part in this discussion, on the valuable contributions which they made. I want especially to congratulate the hon. member for Witbank, firstly for the fine subject which he chose and then also for the splendid, warm and humane manner in which he presented it. I should like to give him the assurance that it is not only his heart which beats warmly for our aged; I think that the hearts of most of us beat as warmly for them. It is because we have such a soft spot in our hearts for the old people that we should like to do the best for them. We should like to do everything for them. We should like to give them more if it is possible. But the question in connection with all these problems is: What is possible&#x003F; However much one would like to give them everything, if it is not possible, then it is simply precluded. In this discussion we must never forget that the numbers of the aged are constantly increasing. Not only are the numbers constantly increasing, but the pattern of society has changed. The aged no longer live with their children. They are no longer cared for by their children. They do not live in one place; they are dispersed in our cities. It is that pattern which is creating so many problems for us to-day. It is that pattern which makes it so difficult for us to render services to them which otherwise would so easily have been possible. Sir. we have a white population of 3&#x00BD; million in South Africa. Let us make a very low estimate and say that 10 per cent of that 3&#x00BD; million are aged persons who are in need of those facilities which we all need when the years have mounted up. In other words, there are no fewer than 350,000 of these persons who need that assistance and those privileges. To afford them those priviliges we do not only need money&#x2014;we can perhaps afford it&#x2014;but we also require manpower. We require the services of the doctor, the nurse, the ambulance driver, the services of hundreds and hundreds of people. The question is whether that manpower is available and whether we can afford to pay for it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Witbank told us in the first place that we must provide district nurses to serve our aged. Sir, how gladly would we not do so, and how necessary is it not, but is it possible to provide these facilities, although we would very much like to do so&#x003F; We know that there is a shortage of doctors and nurses. If there is already a shortage of nurses, will it be easy to provide sufficient nurses to render these services to all the old people everywhere in the cities and towns&#x003F; It may be possible to a certain extent, but we shall certainly not be able to do so on a comprehensive scale. As you know, Sir, the State already provides district nurses to the country areas, to the local authorities and to welfare institutions. The State pays seven eighths of the nurses&#x2019; salary and only expects the local authority or the charitable institution or the women&#x2019;s organization in the country district to pay one eighth&#x2014;only one eighth, but it is an essential one eighth, because it is that one eighth which ensures that that body takes an interest in the nurse and sees to it that the nurse renders good services. I know that these services are not available in our cities at present, but the Department of Social Welfare is already considering, and has already decided, to subsidize such nurses to a larger extent in the cities as well, and I want to give the assurance that where it is at all possible in the cities, the Department of Health will give serious attention to the matter. But there is still always the problem of the manpower shortage.</p>

<p>Now we come to the second request made by the hon. member for Witbank. That is that we should place the services of our district surgeons at the disposal of our aged, free of charge and without their being inconvenienced in having to obtain permission from the magistrate. Let me just remind the House of the difficulties in this regard. The difficulty in the first place is to obtain sufficient district surgeons. As one of the hon. members has reminded us, there is a shortage. Nearly half of our permanent posts for district surgeons are vacant. They simply cannot be filled. There are various reasons for this. The first is that as the standard of living in our country increases, and everybody wants more and more services, and more and more persons expect doctors to call at their homes, the greater the shortage of doctors, because they simply cannot meet all the calls we make upon their services. Therefore, with the increase in the standard of living in our country, there is an increase in the shortage of doctors and their services. In America the doctor-to-population ratio is the best in the world; there are more doctors per unit of population than in any other country in the world, to the extent that our own country and European countries look almost ridiculous by comparison. But even in America there is already talk of a shortage of doctors. This is because the standard and the requirements set for medical services, are so tremendously high. We must therefore accept that there is <span class="col_1499-1500" refersTo="page_0772"/>a shortage of doctors in South Africa. But at the same time we want to say to the district surgeon that when he is called in by an aged person, he must go immediately without a magistrate&#x2019;s having given permission or having issued a certificate. But do you know what the effect of that certificate is&#x003F; It is merely that small check which prevents people from calling in the district surgeon unnecessarily. All doctors will tell you that one of the things to which they object is to be called out for trifling matters or unnecessarily during the night. That temptation is always there, and unfortunately the same holds good for our aged as does for the rest of the population. This is one of the greatest objections which doctors have to-day in connection with the medical aid funds. They do not want to render services to those aid funds because they say that they are called out at any time of the day or night when it is often unnecessary. If we should do away with magisterial permission altogether, it would mean that we must expect the number of district surgeons we have to decrease even further. Even more of them will leave our service and they will be even less inclined to accept a Government position and to assist the aged. There is one aspect of the position in this connection which is not so gloomy, and that is where the relationship between the magistrate and the aged is a personal one, where he knows them personally and can consider the matter on a personal basis. He can then go to the district surgeon of his own accord and say that if those persons whom he knows should call in the district surgeon, the call must be considered a necessary one. He can say: &#x201C;I grant you permission to visit them freely if they should call you in.&#x201D; It also depends on the personal relationship between the district surgeon and the persons concerned, but it depends primarily on those persons themselves.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) suggested to us, as did the hon. member for Brentwood, that we should increase the status of the district surgeon and that we would then obtain more district surgeons. We are doing so, and have already done so to a large extent. This is receiving our constant attention. We have already made the function of the forensic surgeons, those surgeons who have to conduct post mortems and who have to investigate accidents and murders, and who have to appear before the courts all the time, a special one. We have arranged special courses for our own doctors at the medical schools, so as to have specialists among our district surgeons, men who specialize in forensic medicine alone, so that we may relieve most other district surgeons of that burden and in that manner increase their status. But remember, even if we increase their status, the other problems still remain.</p>

<p>Now, if we regard the problem of our old people in this light, as one which we should very much like to solve, then I ask, together with the hon. member for Rosettenville, what the solution is when the aged are scattered all over the country, when one often finds that they are neglected, when one cannot obtain sufficient nurses to visit them regularly, when one cannot even obtain sufficient doctors to visit all of them regularly. Does the solution not lie in a totally different direction&#x003F; Is the real solution not to come nearer to that one which we already see so much in South Africa, and that is to make more homes available for our old people, homes where they can be happy and not feel humiliated, where they can feel they are still respected members of the community&#x003F; There can perhaps be one nurse there, or the matron can perhaps call in a nurse when she thinks that it is necessary, which will largely eliminate the need for the services of a full-time nurse, and which will mean that the district surgeon will not be called in unnecessarily. Are we not much nearer to finding a solution when we approach it from the housing point of view&#x003F; If we approach it from this point of view, do we not then almost automatically solve all these other problems&#x003F; I really think that if we consider the problems which we are up against as a country, as a Government and as right-thinking people who are trying to do what is best for the aged, then the solution which we are seeking is to be found along the lines of housing. The hon. member for Rosettenville made a very interesting suggestion with a view to facilitating matters for our aged. He referred to the telephone directory. I want to remind the hon. member that last year I extended an invitation to the hon. members opposite and told them that we would welcome all their suggestions for improving the telephone directory and making it a handy book But I am still waiting for the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestions, and it is now perhaps a little late already. But the hon. member made another suggestion. That is that we should issue brochures to educate the old people in the matter of eating and living habits, because, as he rightly pointed out, one&#x2019;s health is largly determined by what one eats. But is this not part and parcel of life in general&#x003F; Throughout our lives we are constantly educated and trained to try and have us eat and live properly, and nevertheless there are so few of us who know how to eat and how to live. I think that the hon. member for Rosettenville is starting rather late in life if he thinks that one can teach people correct eating and living habits in their later years when they are already old.</p>

<p>We have had a very fruitful discussion here. I know that the House feels that the time has come for us to conclude, and I therefore gladly comply with that wish.</p>

<p>With leave of the House, motion withdrawn.</p>

<p>When this debate was adjourned on Friday, I was appealing to the Government not to break faith with the Coloured people, and in the two minutes left to me I wish to end by quoting from a speech made in this House by the then Minister of the Interior, now the Acting State President, on 12th April, 1960, just after the Sharpeville crisis. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before the Vote comes under discussion, I should like to make the following brief statement.</block>

<block name="quote">I wish to make use of this opportunity on behalf of the Government and myself, and I am sure I also speak on behalf of the responsible sections of all groups of the population, to express our sincere appreciation of the way in which the Coloured community calmly and loyally stood on the side of law and order during the recent disturbances which were caused by law-breakers and agitators.</block>

<block name="quote">I fully realize that many members of the Coloured community went through a difficult period as the result of intimidation. They refused to submit to this pressure, however, and once again in a time of crisis upheld the unblemished reputation of the Coloured community.</block>

<block name="quote">In this connection attention is drawn, with appreciation, to the lead given by a number of esteemed leaders of this community.</block>

<block name="quote">In these difficult days the Coloured community has stood loyally by the white population, as we expected they would do, and I want to assure them that they will not find us unappreciative of their courageous and loyal attitude.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I did not intend participating in this debate, for the simple reason that in the first place I deemed it unnecessary to do so after the Prime Minister had summarized in such a clear way the attitude of this side of the House, and in the second place because I did not think it a sound practice to participate in a debate where another Minister carried the responsibility, particularly in view of the fact that my successor in regard to Coloured Affairs, the present Minister of Coloured Affairs, is in my opinion handling this portfolio with great success. But unfortunately repeated attempts have been made on the part of the Opposition to play the former Prime Minister, the late Dr. Verwoerd, and myself who served in his Cabinet as Minister of Coloured Affairs, off against the present Prime Minister and my successor. Repeated appeals have been made to us to furnish explanations as to why the late Dr. Verwoerd and I stated repeatedly on occasion that the present representation of Coloureds would not be abolished. That is why I feel it is necessary for me to say a few words in this regard.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to make a few remarks about the background of the present representation. I want to begin by saying that it was not the policy of the National Party that the representatives of the Coloureds, as they are sitting in the House of Assembly to-day, should have entered the House of Assembly in this way. The original policy with which the National Party went to the country in 1948 made provision for the representatives to come into Parliament in some other way. We all know that the fact that a separate voters&#x2019; roll was subsequently established, on which the present representatives gained entry to this Parliament, was the result of a compromise which had been accepted. [Interjections.] Of course it was a compromise; the hon. member ought to know that. It was the result of a compromise, and the result of the compromise was to give representation here to a limited group because, as was said at the time, under the leadership of the late Mr. Havenga, a promise had been given which had to be kept. On these grounds that compromise was agreed to, because the National Party Government did not, with its first attempt, have the necessary number of votes at its disposal to ensure that its policy was carried through. It was in order to keep the promise which had been made on that occasion that the present form of representation was chosen, but it was not in accordance with the policy of the National Party originally laid down. That is the first point I wanted to make. The second point I want to make in regard to the background to this matter is that this representation, without any doubts, was established on the understanding that it would be white representation; in other words, it would have to be representation in accordance with the cornerstone on which the Union was established, i.e. that this Parliament would consist of Whites and Whites only. Let me remind hon. members of the fact that when the Union was established an attempt was made to do away with that basic principle. That was one of the reasons why the establishment of the Union almost failed. The <span class="col_1503-1504" refersTo="page_0774"/>basic principle was that this House and the Other Place would consist of Whites only. That, in brief, is the background to this representation.</p>

<p>Against this background I want to put a question, and also try to furnish the reply. Did the late Dr. Verwoerd, and myself who at that time served as the Minister responsible under him, ever consider the present representation to be an important link between Parliament and the Coloured population&#x003F; To that my reply is unequivocably: No. I am going to try and prove this.</p>

<p>I ought to know, and I do know, what Dr. Verwoerd thought about these matters, because he spent hours with me going over Coloured Affairs. He took a great interest in them. He paid special attention to carving out a policy in respect of the Coloured population. I can inform this House that I did not make any important speech during that time in regard to Coloured Affairs in regard to which I did not first consult with him. His view was that we should first follow a positive policy of upliftment.</p>

<p>Wait a minute; the hon. member should not always talk out of turn&#x2014; it has already cost him a constituency. His view was that we should first follow a positive policy of upliftment and give the Coloureds a representative council of their own before we could do away with what he regarded as something redundant. I should now like to read out a few quotations. In the first place I want to quote what he said on 7th December, 1960, in a statement after the National Party, of which he was the chief leader, had given very carefully considered attention to this matter. In the first place he referred to the establishment of the Union Council for Coloured Affairs. His speech appeared in an official publication of the Department of Coloured Affairs, from which I am now quoting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since its creation a year ago, the Union Council for Coloured Affairs has shown itself to be an important link for consultation with the Coloured people. The aim is the continual development of its status and authority pertaining to matters affecting the interests of the Coloured people throughout the Republic. It has therefore been decided to reorganize this council by the appointment of more elected members and by entrusting to it additional functions. While the organization therefore so far as its composition and functions are concerned will continue to play an important r&#x00F4;le and act not merely in an advisory capacity, Coloured leaders will be given the opportunity of employing their talents and energies in growing measure in the service of their own people. Methods will be devised by which this organization&#x2019;s activities &#x2026;</block>

<p>that is the Union Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; decisions and requirements can be brought to the attention of Parliament. (I repeat.) Methods will be devised by which this organization&#x2019;s activities, decisions and requirements can be brought to the attention of Parliament.</block>

<p>We did not say that we would bring the resolutions of the Union Council and their considered opinion to the attention of this Parliament by means of these remaining four members as representing a small minority, but that we would create new methods and means of doing so. He states further&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">It is also intended to hold annual conferences based on the pattern of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x2019; conference between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Coloured Affairs and leaders of the Coloured community to discuss matters of common interest.</block>

<p>Not a word was said about this important liaison which we are now hearing about from the Opposition side. [Interjections.] Those hon. members must wait just a moment, because I did not interrupt them when they were talking. Subsequently I made a speech on colour policy before the South Africa Club in London by special invitation. I submitted this speech, which I still have in my possession, to Dr. Verwoerd before I made it. Nowhere in that speech did I refer to the present representation of the Coloureds. On the contrary, I stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are developing a Coloured Representative Council consisting of elected members, and we hope to let them gradually deal with certain legislative and administrative matters concerning the Coloured people. This council will be enabled by an Act as from next year to have direct means of consultation with the Government and, for example, with a joint select committee of both Houses of Parliament.</block>

<p>Nowhere in this speech did I refer to the four Coloured representatives in this House. [Interjections.] Hon. members must give me a chance. I shall tell them the whole story. They must not be so restless. I am still going to refer to other matters and hon. members must not become restless at this early stage.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was in 1963. In 1964 I introduced legislation into this House on behalf of the Government in regard to the Representative Coloured Council. On that occasion, and I quote from Hansard of 10th April, 1964, column 3996, I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Therefore no political party which has the interests of white South Africa at heart and <span class="col_1505-1506" refersTo="page_0775"/>believes in the happiness and prosperity of our country along the road of diversity and variety can adopt the common voters&#x2019; roll or the principle of direct representation as a solution.</block>

<block name="quote">No arrangement in respect of a nation&#x2019;s political course of development is cast in final form at any particular period. A nation is a living organism which from time to time undergoes new processes of development. Where we therefore have four main population groups in South Africa, namely Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu, we shall from time to time have to examine our instruments for mutual consultation and revise them as South Africa and its various peoples develop &#x2026;</block>

<p>I stated clearly that what we were trying to establish there was not a final pattern. I stated clearly that we were leaving the way clear to allow of a move in another direction. Nor was there even a reference to the present form of representation, because we never regarded the present form of representation as a growth point for the Coloured population. I shall tell you why. Let us examine the history of this matter. We regarded the Union Council and the Representative Council, together with the other positive steps such as the Department of Coloured Affairs, the Coloured Persons Development Corporation, their own bank, their own educational advisory body and local authorities, as the growth points for consultation with the Coloured population as well. Our premise was that as these positive steps which were taken, were culminated and became a reality, the need for this result of a compromise would disappear.</p>

<p>Presently I shall read to that hon. member a few things which will astonish him. We never wanted to emphasize the possible abolition of the present representation too strongly. I shall tell you why. It was because&#x2014;and hon. members are my witness&#x2014;every step which the Government took in those years, whether it was the Development Corporation, or the rural development, or the Education Act, or whatever it was, was fought tooth and nail by the Opposition and presented to the world in a negative way. We adopted the attitude that we should first develop the positive aspect so that they could serve as evidence of this Government&#x2019;s goodwill and honesty. We would then have been able to give attention to this matter. If we had not done that, the Opposition would have continued to hold up this limited representation to the world as the only steps which the Government wanted to take in respect of the Coloured population. That is why we adopted the attitude that this representation would die out as the other points of growth took shape. That is the history, Sir. Nobody can deny it. Let me now add the following to that.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My name has been used repeatedly here because, after I had been asked directly whether we intended abolishing these Coloured representatives, I said &#x201C;No&#x201D;. I repeat it. I did say that. The late the hon. the Prime Minister said: &#x201C;Must I guarantee this for ever&#x003F;&#x201D; for we were engaged on a positive programme and I do not deny it, but during that entire process I cannot call to mind any occasion where the present system&#x2014;I am not speaking of individuals&#x2014;contributed anything to the establishment of those positive steps which the National Government established for the Coloured population.</p>

<p>Sir, why is the United Party and the Opposition as a whole omitting to mention a very important element in this entire history&#x003F; For this is not where the story ends. The story goes a little further. Mr. Speaker, let me finalize that story for you a little. When the original four Coloured representatives, i.e. Messrs. Bloomberg, Le Roux, Barnett and Holland, came to this House they came here as members of the United Party and of its caucus. They were not here as members of the United Party caucus for long before they withdrew themselves from that caucus &#x2026; [Interjections.] They withdrew from that caucus. Or else they were thrown out. The fact of the matter was that they could no longer reconcile their conduct as members of the United Party caucus with their position as Coloured representatives.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They issued a statement in which they declared that they were representing the Coloureds only as a group. Initially they had had the support of the United Party election machine behind them when they were elected. They then freed themselves. Why&#x003F; Because, as the National Party Government came to light with its positive measures in this House, those hon. members were forced to recognize the instruments which this Government had created. [Interjections.] Of course they first tried to make the Union Council appear ridiculous. They first belittled and derided it, and subsequently they accepted it. Just as the United Party also initially ridiculed a Representative Council and subsequently accepted it. In October, 1963, the United Party suddenly changed policy again when it thrust in the hon. member for Karoo as a United Party candidate. That is the further course of that history. After the Progressive Party came to the sudden realization that one could take advantage of the present system of representation to gain representation in this House. Consequently on 31st August, 1964 I made a speech in my constituency with Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s knowledge and permission, a speech which was reported and in which I warned against the way in which white politicians <span class="col_1507-1508" refersTo="page_0776"/>and white political parties were abusing Coloured politics in South Africa. I also warned the Coloured teachers and said that on behalf of the Government I wanted to make an appeal to them not to allow these white elements from exploiting Coloured politics any further. Shortly after that Dr. Verwoerd ratified what I had said in public. But what did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition do&#x003F; Fourteen days after my speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made a speech at De Doorns in which he attacked me. He said that he did not agree with my actions. He said that he could not agree with my warning. Nor could he agree with my actions in turning certain Progressive Party members out of the Coloureds&#x2019; rural areas. As I have already said, my actions met with the approval of Dr. Verwoerd.</p>

<p>After that a further step followed, again with the approval and knowledge of Dr. Verwoerd. In September, 1965, the Festival Congress of the Cape National Party was held. On that congress I made a speech, a speech which was approved by Dr. Verwoerd himself. Therein I stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A measure of confusion exists in respect of the four white representatives of Coloureds in the House of Assembly. Let me say at once that it was never the intention that they should represent the Coloured population in its entirety. They are the representatives of a limited number of voters, voters who formerly could have qualified for the old common voters&#x2019; roll. The Government has always adopted the attitude that it is committed to a continuation of this compromise which was agreed upon a number of years ago, but I must issue a warning: If this limited representation by Whites is abused by the Opposition and integrationists to an ever-increasing extent to attack the policy of the National Party and present it as illogical, the time will come when the basis of this representation will have to be reconsidered. May I point out that the policy of the National Party in 1948 stipulated that the four representatives, who must be White, would have to be elected by the Representative Coloured Council.</block>

<p>This is what I said with Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s approval and knowledge at our congress of that year, and by means of a special motion the congress ratified this statement. Therefore we did not leave the world in the dark as far as our plans in that regard were concerned. After that Dr. Verwoerd had a bill in regard to political interference, which I had warned against, drawn up and came to this House with it. Then the tragic scene of Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s death played itself out here and the Bill was ultimately discussed here under the leadership of the present Prime Minister. Subsequently the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, in spite of his statement at De Doorns, stood up here and admitted that a <i>prima facie</i> case could be made out for an investigation into this matter. Mr. Speaker, that Bill, which was intended to prevent political interference, was the forerunner of the debate we are conducting here to-day.</p>

<p>What is the position to-day&#x003F; Throughout history it has been clear that this white representation, restricted as it was to a qualified separate voters&#x2019; roll, opened the door to white politicians and white political parties to make misuse of this representation in their own interests. This left only one way open&#x2014;the Opposition admitted this itself, because when the Opposition was confronted by this problem they abandoned the representation by Whites in favour of the principle of direct representation by the Coloureds themselves. With that they admitted by implication that the only way in which the Whites could be prevented from abusing, or collaborating, with a system of representation as it still exists at present, was to give the Coloureds direct representation here. But that brought the Opposition in direct conflict with the principle to which I referred at the beginning of my speech, in conflict with one of the corner-stones on which union took place in 1910&#x2014;namely, that this Parliament should consist of Whites only. Without this principle union could never have been possible, and without it there would never have been a Republican constitution. This principle has always been one of the cornerstones on which South Africa has built.</p>

<p>That is why there was only one way in which this problem could be tackled, i.e. to build the Coloureds a house of assembly of their own&#x2014;in other words, as they develop, as their abilities develop to that stage, and as they reveal the necessary sense of responsibility. In this way the Coloured leader is being afforded the opportunity of keeping in contact with the broad mass of the Coloured population. In terms of the policy which the United Party now advocates they are providing, whether they want to admit it or not, an opportunity to escape to that Coloured leader who does not want to have anything to do with the matter, and who wants to flee from his responsibilities towards the masses, and come and seek refuge in the company of white South Africa, leaving behind the broad masses of the Coloured population as a neglected proletariat. That is the course which the Opposition advocated. If the hon. member for Transkei and others on the opposite side now want to appeal to us to keep our word, my reply is that we have in fact kept our word. We have done so by creating instruments, on the economic, educational and the political level, by means of which consultation can take place; but not only that, by means of which responsible leaders can be called forward, leaders who can serve their own people. In addition we have kept the door open to proper liaison with this Parliament, and not a link which would be a continuation of a compromise which was agreed to years ago. The present representation is not an efficient link, because they represent a small and subordinate portion of the Coloured voters of the Cape. We maintain that if one wants to create a link, one must <span class="col_1509-1510" refersTo="page_0777"/>create a link which will be a proper link between the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and this Parliament. This then is what the Prime Minister undertook to do, namely to discuss this matter with the Coloured Persons Representative Council when it was established. On the grounds of this consultation, the Government will come to a decision.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister began by telling us that the form of representation which the Coloured has here to-day was actually the result of a compromise.

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says it was a forced compromise, but I shall quote to him from the speeches of important leaders on that side of the House made during the crisis in regard to the Coloured vote in which nobody ever regarded the matter as a compromise. The hon. member for Parow more or less repeated what the hon. the Minister had said, i.e. that they had never regarded the representation of the Coloureds as a point of growth. But does the hon. member forget the speeches which were made, such as this one by Mr. De Wet Nel, during the Joint Sitting in 1954&#x003F; This is what he said on 21st May, 1954&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let me in addition just say this. There is a desire on the part of the Coloured population to have their own representatives, and I speak now of the mass of the Coloured population. This principle has already been tested throughout the world. We have to-day this phenomenon in nearly all countries where there are minority groups.</block>

<p>Then he goes further, and in col. 324 he has the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So we can go to countries in Africa. Take Tanganyika, take Kenya. There we saw how the Indians wanted their own representatives in that House and how the Natives had their own representatives there. True enough. Those are people of their own race. But that principle still exists which they regard as the just principle. I just want to state this proposition here to-day. If I were convinced in my heart that with this step I could do an injustice to the Coloured population, I would not vote for it.</block>

<p>If he was satisfied that he would be acting unfairly or unjustly towards the Coloureds, he would never have voted for that legislation. In addition he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not believe that one can build a nation on injustice. Those things go against my very soul. But I am convinced in my heart that not only are we not doing the Coloured population an injustice, but we are hereby going to do them and the country as a whole a good deed.</block>

<p>That is what the former Minister of Bantu Affairs said, although he was not Minister yet at the time. He only left Parliament a year or two ago. He stated further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have a duty towards the Coloureds and also towards South Africa, and that is to create a state of affairs where both European and Coloured can be happy and where the opportunity can be created where the Coloured will not have suspicion and where contempt for the European will not be fostered. We must create a state of affairs where the Coloureds are happy in their own community, where they will be able to send their own representatives to the House of Assembly, representatives who will have to account to them, and if they do not do their duty then they have the fullest right to kick them out. That will give him political satisfaction and then we will be doing South Africa a service.</block>

<p>That was the attitude at that time. Now the hon. the Minister has created the impression here that the decision which they took was only a compromise; it was not really an honourable one and it was not really honest towards the Coloureds of South Africa.</p>

He then quoted from a pamphlet which was published by the Department of Information in regard to &#x201C;The Coloured People of South Africa&#x201D;, but why did he not also quote what I am going to read now&#x003F; It is on the first page&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On December 7th, 1960, the following statement was issued by the Prime Minister, Dr. H. F. Verwoerd: The Government has for a considerable time been paying special attention to the situation of the Coloured population and to positive methods for improving that situation. During its final deliberations it had the advantage of having at its disposal a report prepared by a special Cabinet Committee and a Committee appointed by the Congress of the National Party. Because attempts were made to create confusion regarding the existence and activities of these Committees, it should be mentioned that their recommendations coincide with and form the basis of this announcement.</block>

<p>What is this &#x201C;announcement&#x201D;&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To this should be added that both the committees and the Cabinet, as well as the Deputy Minister &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the present Minister of Defence, who was then responsible for Coloured Affairs&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to whom is especially entrusted the promotion of the interests of the Coloured community, and who was a member of both committees, agreed that the representation of the Coloureds in Parliament by white people should remain as it is.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>But what the Minister is doing is to quote something where the idea was originated by them that the Coloured Council would be the link between Parliament and those people. [Interjections.] How can the Minister now maintain that it has never been the policy of the Government that these people should remain here&#x003F; And the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is now drawing my attention to the fact that this was a wonderful piece of propaganda. Here is Parliament on one side and there the Coloureds are sitting with their representatives in the Senate, and down below, as large as life, the representatives of the Coloured Council are sitting talking to their representatives here in Parliament. Now I just want to ask the Minister whether this entire pamphlet must now be discarded&#x003F; Must it be altered or burnt&#x003F; Must a new piece of propaganda be published for overseas consumption&#x003F; No, that story of the hon. the Minister of Defence that what they are doing now is not really to change their policy, makes the matter a far more serious one. Then the people of South Africa were the victims of a great bluff in 1951 when they placed the Coloureds on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll for then their argument was precisely that the Coloureds should be placed on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll because the old franchise meant nothing after all and now they were being afforded a wonderful opportunity of stating their case in Parliament through their own people. That is the situation. And that at the beginning in the majority report of this Commission, which we are discussing now, it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must nevertheless immediately be conceded that this system (of separate representation) succeeded in creating greater stability and better relations between the said population groups, and that the persons elected to the House of Assembly by the Coloureds generally made an honest and praiseworthy attempt to serve and to promote the interests of the Coloured people.</block>

<p>This is what is stated in the majority report of the Commission itself, but now we have been forced to hear from hon. members on the opposite side, such as the hon. member for Piketberg and Parow that the representation which the Coloureds had, never really amounted to much, because the Coloureds were coming to see them. That is what the hon. member for Piketberg said. [Interjections.] Now hon. members on the opposite side are saying that the representation no longer means anything, and the Coloureds are now coming to the white representatives in Parliament. If they do away with representation, what will the position then be&#x003F; Then the Coloureds will simply come to them again and even greater responsibility will be placed on white representatives in this House. But in the past in 1951, in 1954, and in the years subsequent to that the argument was put forward that the old franchise meant nothing. For that reason it was necessary that they be put on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll and that would be in the best interests of South Africa&#x003F; And now&#x003F; Now the hon. the Prime Minister wants to abolish that representation. What is further stated in this report&#x003F;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloureds often have to look to the Whites for guidance and are unfortunately only too easily exploited in the process, perhaps mainly because the Coloured group has not as yet attained political maturity.</block>

<p>It is precisely because of the fact that these people have not yet achieved maturity that they ought to have representation in this House. Surely one cannot throw the Coloureds to the wolves. They do after all have an interest in the affairs which are discussed in this Parliament, they vote, and their views ought to be heard here.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that the opportunity we have been afforded over the past few days of considering the various parties&#x2019; policies in regard to the Coloureds and Indians has been a good one. Undoubtedly it is inevitable that <span class="col_1513-1514" refersTo="page_0779"/>these things be reviewed. It is essential for a few very good reasons, because as far as the Bantu in the country are concerned, the course has already been clearly demarcated by the hon. the Prime Minister and his supporters on the other side of the House. Their policy is that these people have no representation in this Parliament; that there should be absolute division as far as the Bantu are concerned; that the Bantu will have separate areas; and that they will have separate citizenship. As far as the Bantu are concerned, the policy of the Government is that they should be set on the road of general, absolute freedom and that the Whites will gradually withdraw themselves from the Bantu. Against that we on this side have also stated our policy clearly as regards the Bantu. It is that there will be no separation; that there will be no general independence; that every form of assistance will be given the Bantu and that there will be representation for them in this Parliament by means of white representatives and communal councils. At least the Bantu have their homelands. The problem as far as the Bantu are concerned is not the same as in the case of the Coloureds, because they have their own territories. As far as the Coloureds are concerned, the position is entirely different. Of the almost two million Coloureds we have in South Africa, approximately 80 per cent are living in the Cape, and the entire Cape is their territory. They can acquire rights anywhere in the Cape under the Group Areas Act. They can purchase land anywhere; they can even farm in their own rural areas; they can build a house on land which they have purchased. In other words, the Coloureds and the Whites are sharing the so-called white homeland territory.</p>

<p>Our policy on the other hand admits clearly that the Coloureds are different from the Bantu. I think hon. members on that side of the House also admit that the Coloureds are &#x201C;different&#x201D; from the Bantu, but the difficulty is that they have no practical way of recognizing that &#x201C;difference&#x201D;. The approach of the Government has been to try and place the Coloureds on the same basis as the Bantu, with resulting major drawbacks. The hon. the Minister of Defence, a former Minister of Coloured Affairs, has told us that a separate legislative assembly will be created for the Coloureds, but where will the jurisdiction of that legislative assembly or legislative council begin and where will it end&#x003F; The Coloureds do not as yet have connected territories, except of course their own group areas. If they must have any jurisdiction, then a separate territory for these people is a pre-requisite, and I should like to ascertain what the attitude of the Government is in this regard. What is the end of the road which the Government is envisaging for the Coloureds&#x003F; Will a ceiling be placed on the powers of this separate body, or will there be no ceiling to their powers&#x003F; We are told that the Coloureds will now have a great deal more power if they are only prepared to abandon their present representation in Parliament.</p>

<p>When the Coloureds were granted representation in this Parliament, surely it was not the idea that their representatives here would only represent the Coloureds&#x2019; interests. Surely it also affects the Coloureds when we discuss the agricultural industry here, or defence, or education or finance. Their representatives here surely have the right to make their views heard in regard to these matters. They do not come here to present the problems of the Coloureds only. Surely one cannot shift them to one side completely. You cannot give them a parliament of their own, as the hon. the Prime Minister is prepared to do for the Bantu. They share the rest of South Africa with us, particularly the Cape. Mr. Speaker, I am asking hon. members on that side to consider the powers which are set out in Appendix B of the report. Are they being given more powers here than they already have under Act No. 49 of 1964&#x003F; I think we are entitled to put that question to the Government. Sir, it is being said so often that Coloured representation in this Parliament must be removed because the Coloureds are being exploited; because they are a political football. We are continually hearing that they are receiving much more to-day than they did under the old dispensation, and that we must take away their representation in Parliament because then we will be able to develop a national pride in them. Hon. members on that side are continually telling us that we must remove the elements which can mar relations between Whites and Coloureds, and that the present representatives of the Coloureds are, after all, doing nothing for them. If in the future there should ever be a collision and friction between this Parliament and the Coloureds&#x2019; House of Assembly, as the hon. the Minister of Defence has just called it, which one of those parliaments will then be removed, if the argument of hon. members in that regard is correct&#x003F;</p>

<p>Representation for the Coloureds in this Parliament, as has already been mentioned here, is not regarded by hon. members on that side as a point of growth. They regard the Coloured Legislative Council as a point of growth, but always subservient to this Parliament, or as a body with identical powers to this Parliament. Or will the Representative Coloured Council not have the same powers as this Parliament&#x003F; I think hon. members on that side ought to give us the replies to these questions, and if they want to see what idea people who more or less agree with them have, they must simply look on page 80 of the report, at the memorandum submitted by Dr. I. D. du Plessis. But, Mr. Speaker, the debate has also taken a very interesting turn. We on this side have been told that we have changed our policy. It is alleged that this Government has never changed its policy and appointed a commission to investigate its own policy. The <span class="col_1515-1516" refersTo="page_0780"/>hon. the Prime Minister did not accept all the resolutions and recommendations of his Commission. He rejected them in more than one respect. For example, it will not be called a legislative council, but merely a representative council. Also, the chairman of the Executive will be designated. In contrast to this the Commission recommended that the chairman be elected. Certain recommendations in regard to the liaison between the Council and Parliament were made, but the Prime Minister rejected them as well. He rejected the Coloured Affairs Commission; he rejected the idea of select committees.</p>

<p>When I listen to the hon. the Prime Minister I am certain of one thing: he knows what he does not want, but as yet he does not know what he wants. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now put a very interesting question to the Prime Minister. Each year for ten years already we have been hearing that there is a new dispensation for the Coloureds. Every few years new announcements are made here. We have been given the impression that the Coloureds are now standing on the verge of a large-scale new development which will result in wonderful conditions and a wonderful new future for them, and with which they will from now on be satisfied. There is one matter in regard to which I agree with hon. members on the opposite side, particularly with the hon. member for Malmesbury, and that is, as the hon. member said, that a tremendous task rests on the shoulders of the Coloureds themselves, i.e. the task of uplifting themselves economically. It is true that in many respects they have a tremendous backlog in the sociological field. Even physically they have a fantastic backlog. More than anything else it will be their own task to wipe out this backlog. If there are Whites who also want to lend a hand in this respect, people who out of human considerations want to help the Coloureds, should they be influenced against this upliftment work, or should they rather be encouraged to give the Coloureds that assistance&#x003F; Should only a group consciousness be developed amongst the Coloureds, or should a broad South Africanism be inculcated amongst them as well&#x003F; According to the present policy of the Government they are only interested in inculcating an insular nationalism amongst the Coloureds, but when it comes to a broad South Africanism amongst our Coloureds, the Government is apathetic. I want to ask, how can we inculcate a healthy spirit of South Africanism amongst the Coloureds without the Whites playing any part&#x003F; Why should political parties not play a part in this&#x003F; If this may not be done by means of direct interference, then it can be done by putting the various policies to them. I have a cutting here of a speech the hon. member for Moorreesburg made a few years ago. In that speech the hon. member stated that, &#x201C;the time had come for the National Party to put its case to the Coloureds&#x201D;. There is nothing wrong with that. It would be welcomed. Let any political party put its case. Why should we now impede that development amongst the Coloureds&#x003F;</p>

<p>I just want to say, nobody denies the need of liaison between this Parliament and the legislative body of the Coloureds. The hon. the Prime Minister himself admits the need for that; he does not know yet what form it will take. This will be determined in due course. But apparently this will not take place soon, because it will only be in 1971, when their representation here is abolished, that the legislative or representative body will be created, and only after that will the consultation take place in regard to what the liaison will be.</p>

<p>Now it is interesting that amongst a certain group in the National Party the idea of a separate state for the Coloureds, a separate <span class="col_1517-1518" refersTo="page_0781"/>territory for them has originated. The hon. the Prime Minister has not said anything about this. However, we have learnt of the existence of a group who are working for that within the National Party. It is also interesting to note that the National Party newspapers are killing the idea, because they know the Cape, and they know that anything like this is simply impossible. And what are they suggesting now&#x003F; They are suggesting a strong party commission. It is so strange that another commission should be appointed now. After all we have always heard that this Government has all the answers to the problems of South Africa. We are now discussing the report of a commission, and while we are busy with that, there is another suggestion for another commission to investigate the question of the future of the Coloureds. What reasons do they give for doing so&#x003F; They say the reason is that an end can then be put to all this chopping and changing in speeches and in writings.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since we last saw in South Africa such confusion amongst the ranks of the National Party in South Africa as when it comes to a policy for the Coloureds, so much so that another commission has to be appointed to go into the matter. It is so obvious that the solutions which were offered in the Commission&#x2019;s report are totally inadequate. Nobody is satisfied with them. That is why another proposal has been put forward for another commission of inquiry.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Coloureds, the obvious dilemma of South Africa is the following: For obvious reasons we cannot have total integration of Whites and Coloureds. Nor can we have total separation in their own homelands. Here too the reasons are equally obvious. The furthest we can go with the Coloureds, is a form of parallelism on a local basis and a body which can never get much further than a provincial council. That is about the furthest we can go with the Coloureds when we talk about separate development. What can be aimed at is equality &#x2026; [Interjections.] If the hon. members on the opposite side think they can go further, they must tell us. As I have said, we can aim at equality, or we can aim at equal value in these spheres. But somewhere we must have efficient liaison, because the interests of South Africa, the interests of the Whites and the Coloureds are inextricably linked. Because the Coloured is such a good partner, and has been, it is essential to have that liaison. Representation in this Parliament, whether by Whites, or by Coloureds, is what the Coloureds want, and this has become an irrevocable fact. His representation in this Parliament not only affords him an opportunity of speaking on behalf of his own people, but also gives him a share in all kinds of national affairs. The Coloured is not only concerned with his own affairs, no matter how urgent they may be. [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the half hour at my disposal, I want to confine myself to what I find essential in the report and in the debate. I want to deal with the matter against the background of my experience as Minister of Coloured Affairs for almost two years now. I want to begin by saying that through my contact with Coloured communities and Coloured leaders throughout the country, especially during the past two years while I have been in charge of Coloured Affairs, I have come to the realization that the greatest single need of the Coloured population in our country is to have pride in themselves. I have come to the conclusion that even if this Government spent millions of rands more on housing, schools, rural development, etc., and the Coloured could not be inbued with a spirit of service to his fellow-men, then all this work of upliftment, however well meant, would ultimately be futile. In other words, if we want to have the Coloured rendering his maximum contribution as a human being towards the development of South Africa, I think it is necessary that the Whites should reach the stage where they stop assigning a permanent position of immaturity to the Coloured. It is my conviction that the Coloured can render this service and contribution as a human being to his own population group and to South Africa only if he is enabled to find his own feet and to stand on his own feet so that he may develop a feeling of pride and self-respect. This report proves time and again how the Whites repeatedly have to do the Coloured&#x2019;s thinking for him and make his decisions for him. This means that the Whites, who have fulfilled this function over the centuries, must now reach the stage where they afford the Coloured an opportunity of playing a greater part as far as doing his own thinking and making his own decisions are concerned. Though I say that I am convinced that this opportunity of full self-realization is necessary, I am afraid that we, the generation of Whites in this House, will still have to be prepared to accept the responsibility of helping the Coloured to do his thinking and make his decisions at this stage of his development. I say this in the face of the prospect that the decision that will flow from the commission and our discussions here, a decision we are called upon to make, will help us to enable the Coloured to do his own thinking and make his own decisions to an ever-increasing extent in the future. But at present the responsibility to help him make those decisions still rests on our shoulders.</p>

<p>When I say that this is the course that his development must take, it does not mean that I now want to cut off the advice and the guidance which the white man must still give to the Coloured. No, in spite of the steps announced in connection with the prohibition of mixed parties, I want to say that those Coloureds who will still need the advice and guidance of the Whites in the future, will still be able to get it from those Whites whose <span class="col_1519-1520" refersTo="page_0782"/>intentions are sincere. We are not going to allow this interest we have in the Coloured population to be cut off by any action of this nature. All we want to do is to enable the Coloured better to think for himself and make his own decisions as from now on. Otherwise we will land ourselves in the position to which the Rev. Botha, an authority on the Coloureds and a very sympathetic person referred before this commission, i.e. that if the Whites indefinitely take the political leadership of the Coloureds upon themselves, very little will come of Coloured leadership itself in the future. Mr. Tom Schwartz, the chairman of the Federal Party, also referred to this opportunity of self-realization that we are going to create, in the sense that with the establishment and development, of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council the Coloureds are being offered enormous opportunities. But through various speakers the Opposition has now asked what the optimum of this Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council is going to be. This is a strange question. Has this Parliament ever in the past been called upon to determine the optimum of the Whites or of the Opposition&#x003F; No, I have on various occasions in taking part in Coloured gatherings put it to them&#x2014;and I did not hesitate to do so, because I considered it to be my duty&#x2014; that we were showing them the way, but that how rapidly and how far they would progress along that way would ultimately depend upon themselves. I again emphasize this fact here to-day. How important this Coloured Person&#x2019;s Representative Council is going to become will ultimately depend on their own will and ability. We fully realize that the Coloured has been dependent upon white leadership and advice over the years. We also realize that it will be totally unrealistic and unfair to cut it off all of a sudden. Neither will this be done. No, we will not leave the Coloured to his own devices, in spite of what the United Party says or wants to say. We shall not even leave him to his own devices in this new dispensation. As long as his administration needs the assistance of white officials, they will receive such assistance from this Government. As long as there is a Minister of Coloured Affairs&#x2014;and I take it that there will always be a Minister of Coloured Affairs&#x2014; he will be there as the link between them and this Government. He will be there to consult with them whenever they need it. What is more, these liaison bodies to which the hon. the Prime Minister referred will mean far more to the Coloureds than any representation in this Parliament could ever have meant to them.</p>

<p>But now the Opposition comes along with the cry that such political realization is impossible without having a homeland for them. The Opposition are not putting forward this homeland idea because they have become great homeland apostles. On the contrary, we know how they abhor this idea. We know that they abhor the idea of a homeland with self-government and self-development. The idea of a homeland is being put forward by the Opposition with only one object in mind. It is being done in an attempt to embarrass the Government. I do not intend enlarging on the references made by this side of the House, which will appear in Hansard, because then I would also have to confine myself to dealing with such frivolous remarks as those made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout when he said that the Western Province would have to become the homeland for the Coloureds. No, I do not intend confining myself to the Opposition. I want to confine myself to our own people, that is to say, our thinking people in South Africa. It is understandable, as certain hon. members said, that people should think in the direction of something like that for the Coloureds. I can understand it. It is perhaps our system of Bantu homelands that has caused people to think in that direction. Another explanation may be that it is necessary for the birth of a nation that that nation should have ties with the soil. This is an essential requirement for nationhood in the case of our own nation as well, and this applies to all the nations of the world. Consequently I can understand that the idea of a homeland is being considered. If we think in this direction, however, we shall find ourselves faced with the practical problem, that, unlike the Bantu, the Coloureds do not have a continuous area of this country as their own. This is a fact that we must keep in mind. In our thinking in this regard we then come up against this practical problem. In actual fact the Coloureds in this country occupy mainly two kinds of areas. One kind is the rural areas. The other is of course the urban areas. Because of the pattern of history they at present occupy nearly 2 million morgen of rural area, the major portion of which is situated in the North-West Cape, namely the Richtersveld, Concordia, and the Steinkopf areas, which I myself have visited. This forms part of their rural areas. Elsewhere there are other rural areas, bringing the total to approximately two million morgen. But in addition to these areas, and as a result of the sorting out and the resettlement which have taken place under this Government, group areas which are occupied by Coloureds, i.e. the urban Coloureds, have been established at the white cities and towns in this country. In many of these townships, the urban living areas, the Coloureds can already purchase and own land to-day. This trend is being developed further and further.</p>

<p>I now want to make the statement that in the light of the facts of history these rural and urban areas are the only practical basis on which we can think in terms of a home with an emotional content for the Coloureds. I refer to an &#x201C;emotional content&#x201D; as far as these areas are concerned, Mr. Speaker, because I believe that any nation, any person with national feeling, wants to feel that he has ties with the soil. I think this is a basic need in the case of any person in the world with national feeling, i.e. that one wants to feel that one has <span class="col_1521-1522" refersTo="page_0783"/>ties with the soil, because only then can one realize oneself properly. Even though, as a result of the course of history, our Coloureds to-day occupy rural areas on the one hand and urban areas on the other, areas that are not continuous, I am convinced that these areas still conform to the basic requirement in that the Coloureds can have ties with the soil in these rural and urban living areas. This being the position, I want to say that I have no doubt that these living areas, whether they be the rural areas where the management boards are developing, or the urban living areas where we are now, with the assistance of the Provincial Administration, getting greater development of local management, can gradually develop as a home for the Coloureds, and in fact become accepted by them as their home. I emphasize &#x201C;their home&#x201D;.</p>

<p>This brings me to the term &#x201C;homeland&#x201D;. I feel myself compelled to say a word or two about this term and, at the outset, to warn against its use. You know, Mr. Speaker, one of the things that struck me in the two years that I have been dealing with Coloured leaders, deputations and communities, is that there is quite a feeling amongst the Coloureds that they do not want to be associated with the Bantu. The other day in Kimberley again, where the hon. member for Karoo was also on the platform, a few questions were asked. One question that was put directly to me by one of the Coloured leaders was whether we could not take steps to prevent intermingling of the Bantu and the Coloureds, because, he said, &#x201C;Mr. Minister, we as Coloureds want to live a life of our own. We do not want to be associated and intermingled with the Bantu&#x201D;. This being so, I want to say, firstly, that the Coloureds are developing as a separate group. They want to be seen and judged as such in that development. They do not want to be seen and judged together with the Bantu or the Indians. This is their identity that is developing and of which they are proud and which you and I must respect in them. Apart from the fact that the use of the word &#x201C;homeland&#x201D; has a Bantu association for the Coloureds, I think we should not use terms that can confuse the Coloured population. I think they have been confused enough in the past. I say this in all amity towards my two friends who thought about the matter. We must of course think about the matter. After all we are not stagnant in our thinking. I say this in all amity towards them: We must be careful not to use terms which may confuse the Coloureds in this country, and what is more, may create illusions which in future may present us with problems the extent of which cannot be foreseen. I think we must be careful in the choice of our terms. I therefore ask that we should not use terms that may create confusion or may perhaps destroy what we should really be building up. Yes, Mr. Speaker, building up; and I say this in the conviction that, even though these rural and urban areas are not continuous like the Transkei&#x2014;unfortunately this is the only example that one wants to project onto each and every one that is different&#x2014;the Coloureds will accept these areas as their home as they are developed. To me it is pointless to say that they are not continuous. After all, the home of us Whites is not continuous either. In fact, our home in the Republic is now being interspersed with territories such as Botswana, Zululand, the Transkei, etc. Surely we too have no continuous home in South Africa. Consequently this is no argument to me. On the contrary. As an optimist I have every confidence that as these areas are developed further, the Coloureds will in due course attach national significance to them, an attachment which will make them feel that they too are anchored in the soil of South Africa, so much so that, as Mr. Tom Schwartz said, the Coloureds will be prepared to fight for South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now come to the reference to our previous Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd. Quotations have been made from what was said by Dr. Verwoerd. Quotations have been made from the speeches of the Minister of Defence and from mine as well. I want to do something very unusual now. I also want to quote from what Dr. Verwoerd said, but from what he said on an occasion which one normally does not mention. I want to quote this because I think it is of significance in getting down to the true facts in regard to the attitude adopted and the development in thought in the past. On 1st April, 1966, Dr. Verwoerd called me to his office in the Union Buildings to appoint me as Minister of Labour and of Coloured Affairs. That day in the Union Buildings Dr. Verwoerd told me amongst other things that he felt that the representation of the Coloureds in the House of Assembly should be abolished, as he did not regard it as logical and correct. He said that he thought it was necessary to allow the Coloureds to stand on their own feet at last. &#x201C;But,&#x201D; he added, &#x201C;there are objections to that.&#x201D; This is what Dr. Verwoerd told me that day. He believed that it should be abolished. But he admitted that there were objections to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize the date. It was on 1st April, 1966. I now want to take you to the second date, which was last year. Last year it was decided by this Government, under the present Prime Minister, that not merely a small part of the work of the present Department of Coloured Affairs would be transferred to the representative council to be established, but in fact the major part thereof. I want to emphasize this, because at that time there was a difference of opinion, perhaps more within the ranks of the Department itself, on the question: Shall we simply transfer it piecemeal, or should we transfer the major part of it&#x003F; It was under the present Prime Minister that this Government decided that we could no longer feed these people on tiny morsels. If we had confidence in their ability to grow towards maturity on their own, we also had to have the confidence in them to assign that work to them. It was then that the decision was taken which certainly has also <span class="col_1523-1524" refersTo="page_0784"/>given us greater clarity as regards the pattern of development to be followed by the Coloured people in South Africa. I concede that perhaps we did not always have this clarity. But the fact of the matter is that as this development of the Coloured proceeded, as the transference of greater responsibility proceeded, it also became increasingly clear to us that the necessity and desirability of having Coloured representatives was falling away. The fact that there has consequently been a change and a development in Nationalist thinking is not something of which I or anyone on this side need be ashamed. Because, Mr. Speaker, if we want to be ashamed of ourselves, we must be ashamed of ourselves if our thinking becomes as stagnant and inflexible as that of the United Party, a party which cannot come forward with any positive proposals in regard to this difficult matter of colour relations in South Africa. We had many aspects to take into account in this matter. We had to take into account the fact that the Coloureds might feel aggrieved at the removal of their representation from the House of Assembly. It is true that they may feel aggrieved; I concede that. As time and again appears from the report, they regard it as having show value. As has been said, they merely want to be here. They do not mind having only four representatives, but they merely want to be here. Some of their spokesmen in fact admitted that this show value was of little significance to them. But it does have show value, and I concede that in that respect there will be disappointment in certain quarters. But to suggest, as the Opposition does, that it will cause resentment, is absolute nonsense, and I say this with the greatest emphasis, and I say it not because of what is stated in the report, but because of my contact with them in the past two years, which enables me to testify to what goes on in the minds of these people. And what goes on in the minds of these people is such that they said time and again when they were asked what their attitude would be if the Government should decide to abolish representation: If the Government in its wisdom should do this, we would accept it. I concede that perhaps they would not be elated about it, but this white Parliament has a very great responsibility in this matter, and there were many more factors that we had to take into account. We also had to take into account what the Coloured witnesses stated in evidence before the commission to the effect that if one had a strong representative council here which was going to administer R50 million and perhaps more in the course of time, and over against that one had four representatives here, or six, according to the policy of the United Party, one would have a clash between the views of the representative council and those of the people here. This was stated in evidence by these people, and in more than one place in the report of the commission. Dr. Van der Ross, when he was still leader of the Labour Party, was questioned on this, and when he was questioned about such clashes, his attitude was: If clashes occur, the Government will be to blame and they would therefore have to be resolved by the Government. Mr. Speaker, we are not going to wait until clashes occur. That is not the way to build up race relations. That is not the way to handle this delicate situation. No, these people themselves declared that if the Coloureds were represented here as well as on the representative body, they would speak with two voices, and consequently the Government had to take this into account as well. I do not think we can allow the Coloureds to become even more confused in the future than they were in the past. We dare not place them in the position of having two statutory mouthpieces, because that can only lead to great confusion and frustration amongst them.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that we as Whites are called upon to perform a great and responsible task at this juncture. As I said at the outset, we must still assume the responsibility of thinking and deciding for the Coloured people, and we must do this&#x2014;and specifically this side of the House must do this&#x2014;without paying attention to reproaches which may come from that side, which has in the past made no positive contribution in regard to this task. We must accept this responsibility and we cannot pay attention to reproaches about reversing of policy. Sir, we have a responsibility in this House which you and I may not shirk. We have a responsibility to place the Coloureds on a road which will enable them to realize themselves, to develop a national pride and self-respect so that they may take their place in this country with pride, and so that you and I can be proud of them as well. Because this is our responsibility, I support the course which is now being taken.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to travers&#x00E9; very much of the speech of the hon. the Minister who has just sat down. I have listened with great interest to what he has had to say, because we generally listen with interest to what that hon. Minister says. As he was speaking the thought went through my mind that in the years to come no doubt those who come after us will be sitting here and Parliament will one day be debating this question, because we are not solving it now. There will be quotations from Hansard, and I can see hon. members opposite quoting from the speech of the hon. the Minister who has just sat down, and I can see hon. members on this side quoting from the same speech, and they will each claim that what he has said was justification for their point of view in regard to the difficulties with which we will be faced in future. The hon. the Minister said categorically that the Coloured representatives have to go. He dealt with a private discussion he had with the late Prime Minister which we are not in a position to deal with, which he said took place on 1st April. Sir, I think that is an unfortunate date on which to make such an important decision. Anyway, the Minister made that assertion and we can take it that it <span class="col_1525-1526" refersTo="page_0785"/>is so, and now the line to be followed by the Coloured people has been developed by the Minister. It is one of perpetual subservience, without representation in this Parliament, but merely having representation in a &#x201C;skakelkomitee&#x201D;, whatever form that is going to take; and apparently there is some doubt about that now, if I understood correctly the interjection by the hon. the Prime Minister. But prior to that, only ten minutes earlier, we heard the hon. the Minister say that the Coloured people will go as far as they are able to and as far as they wish to determine, to the optimum of their development. That is why I say that there will be quotations from his Hansard speech in the years to come. Yes, he said both things. He said the Coloured people should go to the optimum of their development. What is that if it is not representation in this Parliament&#x003F; What political rights are there in South Africa which do not lead to representation in this Parliament&#x003F; What are we doing here&#x003F; It is the optimum as far as political rights are concerned. Is there anything higher&#x003F; What is there higher than representation in this Parliament&#x003F; If this is the basic difficulty between the Government and we on this side of the House, then it is well that we should get it cleared up for us by the hon. the Minister who has just sat down. Because as far as we on this side of the House are concerned there is no argument about it that the highest political right a man can have is to have his representative in this Parliament. I want to come back to this presently, but I say that the speech of the hon. the Minister who has just sat down does not help us a great deal. It contained a great deal of yes, if and but. That is the way I take his speech. It does not help us, nor does it help the Coloured people.</p>

<p>I want to take my stand this afternoon on the point that we on this side of the House, and a great many hon. members on that side of the House, believe in principle that white leadership should be maintained over the whole of the Republic. Now they keep quiet. Sir, not a single Nationalist is prepared to say no. I have to take it that they all agree with me. Even the Prime Minister has an ingratiating smile on his face, as much as to say: &#x201C;You know, Douglas, I agree with you in my heart of hearts&#x201D;. And I think he does. Let us accept it that at any rate on this side of the House that is basic. If that is so, I can see that difficulties in the political field can arise in regard to the solution of the problem in regard to the Bantu franchise, the Coloured franchise and the Indian franchise. It is inevitable. But what we are concerned with is that a policy shall be worked out on the basis of white leadership over the whole of South Africa. We had hoped that this commission which was established to deal with the Coloured people was going to evolve a policy which, because they were able to sit down round a table and hear evidence, could have led to some form of agreement as to the best principles to be adopted, whatever the details might be. Sir, I want to say that one of the chief terms of reference of that commission was the question of undue interference, and it was not the question of the abolition of the Coloured representatives in Parliament. I am not going to quote at length from the report, because my time is limited, but it is quite clear that the fact is that the question of interference received scant attention from the commission.</p>

<p>Eventually the majority of the commission said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission recommends that the above-mentioned Bill be not proceeded with in its present form, but despite the new political dispensation proposed for the various racial groups, your commission is nevertheless convinced that legislation against improper interference by one race group in the politics of another is desirable.</block>

<p>They said that such legislation was desirable and then left it at that and said nothing about how that undesirable interference was to be dealt with; and they did not say how it was to be handled because they did not know. That is the truth of the matter. [Interjections.] In dealing with the question of undue interference, I want to deal also with the Coloured people in Natal and the Indians, because the majority of the members said in effect that what they were recommending now for the Coloureds they also recommended for the Indians; what is good for the Coloureds is also good for the Indians. I go further than that and say that in my opinion what is being recommended for the one group, whether by this commission or by any other body or group in South Africa, sooner or later will be accepted as the pattern by those who are less privileged. That is the point I wish to make. Any racial group which is less privileged than another will sooner or later come to claim the same rights and privileges as that more privileged group. If we give something to the Bantu and we do not give it to the Coloureds or to the Indians, the Coloureds and the Indians will one day ask for the same treatment.</p>

<p>Let us deal with this question of the franchise at once. In terms of a law passed by this Parliament for the Transkei, there is a franchise, for the purpose of electing their Parliament in the Transkei, for Bantu men and women of at least 21 years of age&#x2014;for the raw Native, the tribal Native, who used to be called the &#x201C;red blanket Bantu&#x201D;. A 21-year old man or woman, irrespective of any kind of qualification in regard to income or education, has the franchise. They are good enough to vote for the members of their Parliament in Umtata. We are told by this commission and by speakers here that the Coloured people are still immature and they are not able to exercise a franchise like that.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>What the hon. the Minister is saying is this: &#x201C;I took away the right of the Coloured people in Natal to be registered as voters 10 years ago and now I tell you that there are only a few left on the roll.&#x201D; He himself is responsible for taking away their right to vote. Sir, how far can irony go in a matter of this kind&#x003F; What we are dealing with now is the question of the maintenance of white leadership over the whole of the Republic, where the different racial groups are going to demand the same rights as those given to other groups.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to the Coloured people of Natal. Over and over again, throughout the whole of this debate, the Coloured people are referred to as though they are the Coloured people of the Cape. The Coloured people of the Cape are not the Coloured people of South Africa. The Coloured people of South Africa are the Coloured people in the Transvaal, in the Free State, in Natal and in the Cape. There may be far more Coloured people in the Cape but that does not mean to say that the other people are not entitled to justice. What is the difficulty in Natal at the present time&#x003F; I want to deal with my own province for the time being. They are repeatedly placed in the difficulty that they are viewed through official eyes almost as though they were part of the Bantu population. That is their big complaint&#x2014;and they are right. They are viewed as though they were a portion of the Bantu population. Sir, they are not derived from the same racial forefathers, from the same nations, as the Coloured people in the Cape. The Coloured people in Natal do not look upon the people from those Western nations as their forefathers. They have a totally different racial derivation. These people, in their religion, in their education, and in the whole of their outlook, are affiliated with a different group of Europeans altogether. They are not affiliated with the Cape Coloureds. They do not look upon their destiny as being associated with the destiny of the Coloured people of the Cape and they are entitled to have their views taken into account, and some of them came forward to give evidence. It is very interesting to see how they reacted to the invitation to come to give evidence. Let me say in passing that the Indians were called in by officials because by and large they said that the Indians were afraid to give evidence before the commissioner of inquiry. They said quite categorically that they were afraid. Sir, the hon. the Minister of Defence, in the course of his speech just now, said that he knew what the late Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, thought in regard to this question of the Coloured people. He quoted from a speech made by the late Dr. Verwoerd in 1960 and from speeches subsequently made by himself. In view of what he quoted here, the question arises why the late Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, did not himself take the necessary steps to do away with the Coloured representatives in this House.</p>

<p>No. I was listening very carefully to hear that explanation. Sir, what I want to ask the Minister of Defence is this: If he knew what the late Prime Minister was thinking in 1960, what was the position of his own colleagues&#x003F; Did they not know what the late Prime Minister was thinking&#x003F; For example, did the then Minister of Indian Affairs not know what the late Prime Minister was thinking in 1963&#x003F; I want to quote what the then Minister of Indian Affairs (Mr. <span class="col_1529-1530" refersTo="page_0787"/>Maree) said on 21st May, 1963 (col. 6434). He felt it necessary to say something about the Coloured folk and this is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If perhaps one day the Coloureds themselves were to ask for it we could consider it, but of our own volition we would never consider depriving them of their representation in Parliament. That is a right they have, which we will not take away from them.</block>

<p>They were trying to keep the peace with the Coloured people by saying to them: &#x201C;Your representatives in Parliament are safe; they will always stay there; that is a cardinal principle as far as we are concerned,&#x201D; but the whole time they were working out a scheme whereby they were going to remove Coloured representation from this Parliament. The crowning inglory was the appointment of this committee. Why did the present Prime Minister agree to the appointment of this select committee which was turned into a commission, if their minds had been made up since 1960&#x003F; Now I am beginning to understand why hon. members on that side reacted in the way they did when my colleague, the hon. member for Karoo, and others on this side wanted to know what was the policy of those members of the commission who were adumbrating a certain policy on the commission. They had made up their minds on political grounds even before they started their deliberations. They cannot understand hon. members on this side coming to the commission with an open mind to see whether they can hammer out a solution to this problem. That approach by hon. members on this side was not within their comprehension. Sir, I want to quote now from <i>The Argus</i> of 11th March, 1965. I should like the hon. the Minister to hear this. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government will put the Coloured voters back on the common roll when they reach the necessary stage of development,</block>

<p>Sir, this is the kind of thing which is bedevilling the whole of our consideration of this problem. The proper place to have denied that report was here in Parliament at the first opportunity when Parliament met. Blythe Thompson was an official candidate for the Nationalist Party and he was fighting an election when he made that speech. I have given his precise words in quotation marks. This paper could have been challenged with regard to the accuracy of that report, because the paper quoted in inverted commas, as a verbatim report, what Blythe Thompson had said. Sir, if that is what a candidate for the Nationalist Party says in a constituency in which he thinks there are a lot of &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; people and liberals and others of that kind, namely &#x201C;the Minister has told me that probably the Coloured people will be back on the Common Roll one of these days&#x201D;, that is the kind of thing that is bedevilling all our relationships in dealing with this matter.</p>

<p>Sir, I have heard much criticism of the Coloured Representatives in this Parliament. Speaker after speaker on the Nationalist side has criticized them for the little that they have done. There are four of them; how much was expected of them; how much would any four hon. members on that side have done for the plus-minus 2 million folk that they represent here&#x003F; How much can four people do in this Parliament&#x003F; What did they have to do&#x003F; [Interjections.] I am saying that they are being criticized for the little that they have done. I am not saying it; I say that there has been criticism from speakers on that side of the House. There has been repeated criticism. What did they want them to do&#x003F; What did the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, who is not here now, do here last week&#x003F; He took the speeches made by hon. members for Moorreesburg and Uhlatuzana and he rattled all their ideas about <span class="col_1531-1532" refersTo="page_0788"/>homelands for the Bantu; then he shook them clean out of the bag, then he blew it up and he popped it, just as a child blows up a paper bag. He had a big bang, and that was the end of the hon. member for Moorreesburg and the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. Sir, when we are talking about what is done by the four Coloured Representatives here, let us see what was said by the witnesses who appeared before this committee. I have here a very interesting piece of evidence. This is what was said by one Coloured witness from Natal (page 269 of Report)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are going to have what is called a working executive of five members &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is for the proposed &#x201C;skakelkomitee&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; one of whom will be appointed by the State President. The executive will now be responsible to the State President. There is no tie at all with Parliament. At this stage I have a tie with Parliament. If I have a problem now I pick up the telephone and speak to Mr. Volker, my Member of Parliament, and he attends to the problem for me. That is going to be lost.</block>

<p>Then later on another witness said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An interesting point arises here. Say, for instance, Mr. Volker, my representative in Parliament, phones me during election time to tell me that Mr. So and So wasn&#x2019;t living there any more and wants to know where he could be contacted. Well, in terms of this Bill I would be guilty of interference if I gave that information to Mr. Volker, however legitimately I did it.</block>

<p>This question was then put to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You say Mr. Volker is your representative. Have you ever contacted him to do anything for you&#x003F;</block>

<p>He replied&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>No, my time is very short. I only have about five minutes left. I want to quote a little bit more. Sir, I think the hon. member writes the leading articles for a little paper called <i>Die Nataller</i> in Natal. When you see him busily writing here, he is probably writing leaders for that paper. <i>Die Nataller</i> of 26th January this year had a very interesting leading article.</p>

<p>I do not write leading articles.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>But the hon. member is very closely associated with it. In any event, this is what stands in the leading article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some State servants and even some politicians are understandably impatient with those who like to draw lines on maps but in some of the Nationalist Government&#x2019;s cocombatants in the propaganda war in respect of apartheid a similarly understandable impatience is developing with the dawdling of the State in indicating the boundaries of the homelands. Territorial separation will not grip the imagination of the Bantu until such time as it can be demonstrated to them spectacularly. Lines on maps, capitals and border posts are not merely going to satisfy armchair critics; it is a real part of apartheid. When these things really exist, then lots of criticism of apartheid will be hamstrung and then a large portion of the disbelief in the practicability of territorial separation will disappear. And it surely brooks no argument that it is just this disbelief that has a paralyzing effect on the execution of our national policy.</block>

<p>I was told that the hon. member for Unhlatuzana wrote this leader. But, Sir, instead of &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; let us put &#x201C;Coloureds&#x201D; or &#x201C;Indians&#x201D;. Where are the homelands for the Coloureds and the Indians&#x003F; This is basic to the whole concept of the full political development of these people, in spite of what the Minister of Coloured Affairs says. This afternoon he was only a tinkling cymbal; what he proposes has no substance in it&#x2014;he was holding out only prospects in the sky, by and by. There are no boundaries, Sir. There are no boundaries defined for the Bantu; there are no boundaries defined for the Indians; and there are no boundaries defined for the Coloureds. This is the Government&#x2019;s policy I am talking about. Well, if the Government is going to have this policy then let them tell us where the boundaries will be of the areas they are setting aside for these people so that they can develop, as the Minister said, to the fullest extent to which they are capable&#x2014;the highest possible political development. But where are these places&#x003F; Until that is defined in terms of this leading article of <i>Die Nataller.</i> I say it will hamper and hamstring this entire hamhanded effort, i.e. to try and create viable communities. It is nothing else than fairy tales that are being enunciated at the present time, fairy tales to create cover for a completely untenable concept, <span class="col_1533-1534" refersTo="page_0789"/>a concept which the Government has never yet worked out in detail and in respect of which the Government does not know neither how it will work out, nor where they are going. But of this I warn the Government: Do not create a separatist movement in South Africa. I am serious. Do not create a separatist movement. Let hon. members on that side of the House, particularly members of the Cabinet, look at America to-day and at the separatist movement that is taking place there. If this Government had been in America to-day would they have been leading the Black Moslem movement for Negro separatism in the United States&#x003F; Would they have been the leaders of that movement&#x003F; Because that is apartheid.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a different country, but what will they do here in South Africa, which is also a different country and where we have not only the Bantu but also the Indians and the Coloureds, who are much closer to us than the Negro is to the Whites in America. So, I want to warn the Government: Do not start a separatist movement as a result of your own specific party policies. It may catch on. Your separatist movement may catch fire. And then&#x003F; What will happen to South Africa&#x003F; Let me go back to where I started: We stand for complete white leadership over the whole of the Republic and a separatist movement is going to wreck that completely. And the Government will be responsible for that, because they put the fire in the dry grass.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast concluded by warning the Government not to spark off a separatist movement in South Africa. It reminds me of the history of the hon. member himself, because is he not the man who called up Natal to &#x201C;march&#x201D; on occasion&#x003F; Is he not the one who wanted to steer that province away from the rest of South Africa&#x003F; He explained to us here that the policy of his party was one of &#x201C;white leadership over the whole of South Africa&#x201D;. But this could hardly be meant seriously. That is the party which announced at its congress a short while ago, and in this House, that non-Whites would be represented in this House to an ever-increasing degree, a policy which steers away from the principle which has been in force since 1910&#x2014;the principle that this Parliament will consist only of Whites. And then the hon. member still comes forward and says that their policy is a policy of &#x201C;white leadership over the whole of South Africa&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I want to return to the subject of this debate. Thus far the debate has been of a high standard, free of those emotions which typified similar debates in previous years. I am disappointed, however, that this high standard has not been maintained throughout. I refer to the allegation made by some members opposite that the reason for the Government&#x2019;s plan to abolish the present representation of the Coloureds in this House is that the Coloured representatives are allegedly not supporters of the Government. This allegation was not in accordance with the otherwise high standard of this debate. What is the position in this connection&#x003F; The Government surely does not need four extra members to reinforce it in this House. On the contrary. There are other people who are in urgent need of help. If members of the Opposition are accusing the Government of wanting to do away with these Coloured representatives because they are not supporters of the Government, I want to ask the United Party why they want to do away with the two Coloured representatives in the Cape Provincial Council.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>There you have the answer, Sir&#x2014;because they are members of the Progressive Party. The problem we are up against and with which this commission concerned itself, is one of improper political interference, coupled of course with the question of political representation of the various race groups. Surely it is a fact that the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition agreed in 1966 that such a problem did exist and that it was so serious that it should be referred to a Select Committee, which eventually became a commission of inquiry. Surely there is this problem of improper political interference. Hon. members opposite admitted this themselves. Therefore it is inaccurate to claim that the Government wants to do away with these four persons because they are not supporters of the Government. If no case was made out for action to be taken against improper political interference, I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition why his party supported the Government on two occasions in this House when legislation was passed to extend the political life of the four representatives here. Surely they did this in the knowledge that there was a real problem of improper political interference at that stage. Therefore I am disappointed in the United Party in this House and also in its representatives on the commission of inquiry because they are trying to evade that basic problem in this debate and want to imply that no such problem actually exists. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said here that in actual fact there were only two aspects of importance, namely the question of possible financial aid from abroad for political parties, and the problem of unlawful registration, <span class="col_1535-1536" refersTo="page_0790"/>something that can be dealt with under the Electoral Act. I maintain that that side has evaded this problem and pretended that no such thing exists. They evaded it to such an extent that in their minority report they did not even get so far as to make any practical suggestion in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I feel sorry about and about which I want to express my disappointment. I am referring to the attitude adopted by certain hon. members opposite in that they want to couple the question of homelands for Coloureds as well to the political pattern for Coloureds and Indians. I want to say here to-day that homelands have nothing to do with this matter.</p>

<p>We are well acquainted with the willfulness of that hon. member who is screwing his eyes up now. I want to say that the question of homelands has nothing to do with the question of the representation of Coloureds here or elsewhere, and with whether it is moral or not. The problem which we are faced with calls for practical planning. It is a real problem, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition conceded two years ago. Now I just want to put this question: Why must the question of homelands form part of the question as to whether it is morally justified to deal with the political dispensation of a certain race group in a certain manner&#x003F; Because the Bantu have their own traditional homelands, must we think and act in a stereotyped way as far as our population problems are concerned&#x003F; The Coloureds and the Indians in South Africa are in a totally different position to the Bantu. As I have said, the homelands of the latter are traditionally their own. These homelands belonged to them from the earliest times until a foreign government planted its flag there, ostensibly to protect the Bantu. The position of the Coloureds and the Indians is quite different and can be compared to that of the Negroes, who are a minority group in America. What has happened in America can be a lesson to us. There they attempted to satisfy the Negro by having political integration, as hon. members opposite want to have. They not only failed in this regard, but also succeeded in causing them the greatest economic distress. Therefore I say that those persons whose primary thought is that political rights in this Parliament for the Coloureds and the Indians, who are minority groups, are the <i>alpha</i> and <i>omega</i> of their well-being, are making a very great mistake.</p>

<p>I want to return to what hon. members opposite have suggested, and that is that the Government&#x2019;s view of the political future of the Coloureds can only be morally justified if it is coupled to the idea of a homeland of their own. Sir, unlike the Bantu the Coloureds are by no means an individual nation which has traditional ties with certain territories. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout suggested that the traditional homeland of the Coloureds was the Boland alone.</p>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member will not bluff those of us who live in the Boland. If the hon. member had watched the N.B.C. film the other morning and listened to what a physician like Professor Chris Barnard said about the Coloured population of South Africa, he would have known more than what he displayed here. The Coloureds in South Africa are scattered. They are not descended from one group, but from a variety of indigenous population groups and others from outside, <i>inter alia,</i> the slaves. They also have white blood in their veins. They are scattered over a large area of our province. Therefore I say that there can be no question of their already having a homeland. Our Coloureds are in fact not yet a nation. The Coloured leaders who are emerging to-day, also say that they are endeavouring to consolidate the various factions of the Coloured population. That is What we should like to see, i.e. that a nation should come into being. But while a nation does not yet exist, while it does not yet have a community life of its own, there can be no talk of an individual homeland, because in such a community which has not yet found its nationhood, there can be no idealistic urge to make sacrifices for an individual homeland. Let me take Israel as an example, to which people came in the late forties from all the corners of the earth to establish their own homeland, their own home. There was something which inspired them, which attracted them. That is something which must still be shaped and built up in the Coloureds. The basic need and problem of the Coloureds to-day is a social and economic one. It is not a political problem. That is how the Government in its wisdom saw it, and it has <span class="col_1537-1538" refersTo="page_0791"/>drawn up a programme which will be of fundamental assistance to them, and does not promise them something which they cannot attain as yet. We want to assist them to develop economically and socially, starting in their own group areas round the towns and in their rural areas, to which the hon. Minister of Coloured Affairs also referred a moment ago, so that they may develop through their own local forms of government to having their own system of government in which the white man will afford them the opportunity of managing their own affairs and working at their own salvation. This is the road which is being opened to the Coloureds by this Government, and this is the road along which they can develop, beginning with their own community which they must build and develop themselves, through a process to which the hon. member for Piketberg referred last week to the realization of individual nationhood. When this happens and they have their own management bodies, and have reached the furthest point to which they can go in their own management bodies&#x2014;and there I disagree with the hon. member for South Coast&#x2014;they will be in a position to help us think and to think seriously themselves about their own future and the future of the areas in which they live and work. Therefore I want to say: Individual homes for the Coloureds are developing rapidly, but the discussion of homelands can only be an academic one at this stage. We are not going to fall for the joke of the hon. members on that side of the House of suggesting that an individual and separate political system for the Coloureds can only work, can only be morally justifiable, if it is coupled to a homeland.</p>

<p>But. Mr. Speaker, why do the hon. members who are so fond of mentioning the moral aspect not apply the moral test to the dispensation which existed for the Coloureds in the past, the present dispensation and the dispensation to come, on the one hand under the dispensation which the Government wants to establish for the Coloured and on the other hand under the dispensation which the Opposition envisages for them&#x003F; What happened to the Coloureds in the 100 odd years in which they enjoyed so-called political rights along with the Whites in this Parliament, when they were on the common voters&#x2019; roll&#x003F; As far as that is concerned, I want to agree with the hon. the Prime Minister. It was a shadow representation in this Parliament, because not only could only some of them exercise the vote, but even those who could exercise the vote, were in the hands of white politicians when it came to the question of whether they were to be placed on the roll in a certain constituency or not. What did it benefit the Coloureds&#x003F; Did it in any way promote the social and economic position of the Coloureds&#x003F; Did it in any way promote their political position in this country&#x003F; The reply to that is of course, a definite &#x201C;no&#x201D;. There has been progress in the past ten years, since the dispensation of this Government was introduced. In this connection it is interesting to look at the debates conducted on this matter in the past, when the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also on occasion assumed the role of a prophet, and I want him to listen to this. On 22nd April, 1952, he said, according to Hansard (col. 4166)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am convinced that the day we have removed the Coloureds from the quarrels of the European groups the relations between the races will improve considerably.</block>

<p>And this has in fact happened, Mr. Speaker. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am convinced that when the measures of the Government have been taken and the Coloureds have been removed from the political differences of the Europeans, it will not only be to the benefit of the Coloureds, but we shall also be able to get nearer that national unity which we all desire than we have been able to get thus far in South Africa.</block>

<p>When he was a prophet. As I say, Mr. Speaker, it was done in accordance with the programme which the National Party laid before the people in 1948. The position which the hon. member prophesied in those days, has become a reality. The relations between the Coloureds and the Whites have improved, and also those between the different sections of the white population, and therefore we no longer have the heated discussions of those days.</p>

<p>But at that time no one could foresee&#x2014; there was then no such thing as a Progressive Party&#x2014;that the United Party would act like a swarm of bees and that a small swarm would hive off. The Progressive Party came into being. The actions of that Progressive Party were totally repudiated by the white voters of the country. They sought the opportunity to make use of a system in which they do not believe and which they totally condemned and abhorred, namely separate representation, to get into this House once more. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his followers felt as strongly as we did that this was something improper which would break down the good relations which had developed between the Whites and the Coloureds, and that action would have to be taken against it. Therefore, rightly, this commission was entrusted with the task of seeking ways and means of eliminating those unfortunate phenomena which had manifested themselves. Therefore I see a great deal of good in the majority report of the commission and in the Government&#x2019;s plans announced as a result of the report. Because <span class="col_1539-1540" refersTo="page_0792"/>that majority report and also the Government&#x2019;s plans go right down to the root of this problem. They seek to create a separation which will ensure the Coloured a political and worthy existence here in South Africa.</p>

<p>The evidence before this commission proved, in the first place, that the Coloureds to-day, after these 10-12 years, attach great value to the body which was created for them by legislation, the Coloured Council. The evidence proved that during this time there had been a growth in leadership and independence among the Coloureds. The evidence proved that the opinion exists among the Coloured leaders, a very representative opinion, that the representation of the Coloureds here in Parliament does not really mean very much to them. This appears from the evidence. It is recorded here in black and white. Now hon. members of the Opposition must not come and tell me, as the hon. member for South Coast did: Do we now consider that these people have not done their duty&#x003F; I do believe that they have done their duty. But I believe that they had an impossible task in more ways than one. In saying this, I want to come back right away to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He made the assertion here that representation in Parliament means not only the representation of a constituency, but also the representation of individuals and their problems. I think that the past number of years have proved to us that a representative such as the hon. member for Outeniqua, for example, with the best will in the world, cannot manage all the individual problems of his voters. What is more, Mr. Speaker, effective representation in this House means that one must live among the people and with the people, that one must not only pick out individual little problems, but that one must have one&#x2019;s finger on the pulse of the people and one&#x2019;s ear to the ground, so that one may know what one&#x2019;s people are thinking and doing. A white representative in this House is not in a position to do that, apart from the fact that his constituency is so large, because he does not live with the people he represents. Therefore he cannot be the best form of representation here. While I am on the subject of the size of constituencies and the impossibility of maintaining individual contact with the voters, I also want to refer to the greater impossibility which hon. members on the Opposition side want to create with their proposals for one Coloured representative in this House for the Transvaal and one representative for both Natal and the Free State. How can the man representing those people in this House maintain contact with them&#x003F; I have perhaps one point of criticism about the manner in which the Coloured representatives in this House have done their work. I think that this is also mentioned by responsible Coloureds. The point is this, that even after three of them left the United Party caucus, they still followed the United Party and voted with them, for example, on a motion of no-confidence in the Government&#x2019;s agricultural policy, something which has nothing to do with Coloured affairs.</p>

<p>Yes, there are Coloured farmers. I do not think, however, that those representatives voted on that occasion in terms of their knowledge of such conditions. The ridiculousness of the motions submitted on occasions by that side of the House was so evident that it was also ridiculous that those representatives should follow the Opposition and vote with them on that matter. But the report of the Commission also showed that the point of view of those responsible Coloureds who want to see the retention of Coloured representation here, was only advanced on the basis of expediency. I am not saying this in order to offend those people. I think that Mr. Tom Schwartz was one of the people who said that. It was an argument of expediency because they felt that it will cause a measure of interference for their political party if this representation was done away with too soon.</p>

<p>These people also spoke of a decade or so. This hon. member served on the commission, but I shall have to deal with him as well. When the hon. member was attacked a few days ago about the two contradictory standpoints he took up within the space of five minutes, he said that he had not acted on behalf of the United Party, but as a member of the commission. Now I want to say to that hon. member that on two occasions during the time of that commission he himself said&#x2014;and it is recorded in black and white in the report&#x2014;&#x201C;We of the United Party.&#x201D; [Interjections.] He acted on that commission as a member of the United Party. I think that the hon. member must read again the report which he helped to draw up. Those Coloured leaders proceeded from the standpoint that the representatives could still remain in this House for a decade or so to lessen the shock of the changeover. But the commission also found that there was a striving towards leadership and individual service among the Coloureds to-day. And as a result it is as plain as a pikestaff that the franchise in the hands of the Whites has never in the past been a blessing to the Coloureds, and that it was the great cause of their backwardness. What the Coloureds need to-day is leadership to teach them that hard work opens the road to success and that a sound community life must be built up in their own areas around the cities and in the rural areas. The acquisition of political instruments which are now to be given to them will open a future of their own for the Coloureds.</p>

<p>Mention has been made here of the proposals of the hon. members of the Opposition in <span class="col_1541-1542" refersTo="page_0793"/>that commission when voting had to take place. I want to reproach them for not having put forward any proposals in the minority report which they brought out, such as those embodied in the proposals which they made when voting had to take place. For me this testifies to inability, I almost want to say to neglect on their part in dealing with this problem. Secondly, I want to make the assertion that the first proposal which they submitted, namely that a return should be made to the position of common voters&#x2019; rolls as in the period prior to 1955, is ridiculous in the light of what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself said in this House last week about the findings of his Party&#x2019;s commission, namely that no one among the Coloureds is apparently interested in returning to the position as it then was. To return to that period means a return to the wretched position of the Coloured as described by the late Dr. B. K. Long, in his day himself a member of that Party, when it was proposed to do away with the system of the common voters&#x2019; roll in the future. The members of the commission on that side of the House suggested a return to that position, although the Coloureds themselves did not want it. It affords numerous opportunities for improper interference. That is my great criticism of them. They must investigate ways and means of eliminating improper interference, but here they suggest returning to a situation in which improper interference would run riot. The hon. member for Outeniqua testified to what happened in those days and what has also happened of late. Thirdly, I want to reproach them for shortly afterwards proposing a separate voters&#x2019; roll with everything contained in the new policy of the United Party. Now I want to ask them why that policy, which they suggested then, of having separate voters&#x2019; rolls and separate representation for Coloureds in this House, is not a diminution of rights, even with the removal of the two Coloured representatives in the Provincial Council. A few weeks later their congress made its decision. It made these two proposals of theirs, made within five minutes of one another, look ridiculous. With reference to that, I want to ask what there is for the Coloured population of South Africa in the policy of the United Party and in its plans for their future.</p>

<p>With reference to the statement by the hon. member for South Coast that they want to retain white leadership over the whole of South Africa, I also want to ask what there is for the white man to-day in the policy of the United Party. What happens to the guarantee of peace and order which exists to-day between the various race groups&#x003F; What is to happen to South Africa if stronger pressure is exerted for having greater numbers of non-Whites in this House&#x003F; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that if he is in power, this will not happen without having a referendum. I put this question to him last year and have not received a reply yet. He intimated here the other day that the standpoint of the United Party in such a referendum would be not to support an increase of such representatives, and that he could rely upon the support of this side of the House in such a referendum. But then surely it is ridiculous. If you do not want something, why must a referendum be held in the matter&#x003F; That is the question which I asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition last year and which he has not yet answered.</p>

They are bluffing the Whites with this sort of story about the referendum, which means nothing. Therefore I want to say that this whole new scheme of the United Party as embodied in its new policy of separate representation for Coloureds in this House, by Coloureds if possible, is actually aimed at bringing about political integration here. They realize that they can get nowhere with the white man&#x2019;s vote and therefore they are trying to gain support among the Coloureds by this means. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch had great pleasure this afternoon posing the standard questions put by professional questioners of the Nationalist Party to United Party speakers. It is a pity he had to repeat questions which were answered adequately and fully by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when he spoke several days ago. Let me begin with the last question. He wanted to know why a referendum would be necessary under a United Party Government and why the matter of the extension of rights to the non-Whites should be referred to a referendum at all with the United Party in power. But he and I both sat here and heard the Leader of the Opposition say that that would not be necessary under a United Party Government; but that it was necessary to protect the people against rash, foolhardy and ill-considered action by other governments that might come into power. He made it perfectly clear that this safeguard would be written into the Constitution and would be binding upon future governments, and he specifically referred to the still startling example of what happened when the Bantustan policy was put to this House by the then Prime Minister without its even having been referred to a congress, nor to the caucus, of the Nationalist Party. I remember distinctly that the Leader of the Opposition specifically said that he felt that decisions like that should not be taken by individuals and by small groups, but by the people. So the hon. member for Stellenbosch <span class="col_1543-1544" refersTo="page_0794"/>can now accept that our policy to have matters like this referred to a referendum is intended to protect the people against the foolhardy actions of a Nationalist Party Government if it should again come into power in future.</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted to know why we were in favour of abolishing the Coloured Representatives in the Provincial Council. The reason is simple, namely that under our policy, now accepted in this respect by the Nationalist Party, there would be a Coloured Council with real executive functions, which would cover the same field of government as the provincial councils and more; those representatives therefore would become redundant. It is as simple as that. But neither under the policy of the Nationalist Party nor under our policy is it the intention to hand over full sovereignty over all aspects of government to the Coloured Council; for that reason the Coloureds should have representation in the Parliament which will conduct the government of South Africa as a whole and which will be sovereign over all the affairs of the people. That is where we differ. But where there is a body which does the work of the Provincial Council, it becomes redundant and superfluous to have Coloured members of the Provincial Council.</p>

<p>Finally, the hon. member for Stellenbosch reproached us for not having participated in the discussions on the Commission, of which I had the honour to be a member, to devise ways and means of stopping improper interference. But I have two difficulties in that regard, which neither the hon. member nor anybody else opposite has cleared up. The first is that we did not have any evidence before us on that Commission on ways and means that could be employed to stop improper interference; and secondly, we are satisfied, and we said so on the Commission&#x2014;it is on record in the minority report&#x2014;that all the examples of improper interference which have come to our attention in this House and elsewhere can adequately be dealt with under the existing Electoral Act. We are convinced of that. Look at all the examples we have had of charges of corrupt practices against the Progressive Party, which the Government accepted as true. Surely if the Government accepted them as true, it could have put the machinery of State in motion to prosecute those people who suborned Coloured people and corrupted them. But I want to say at once that I no longer attach as much importance to these allegatoins about malpractices, as I did at one time; because the Government quite obviously could not prove them. If those charges are true, then I accuse the Government of a neglect of duty in not bringing those people to punishment, whether they belong to the United Party or the Progressive Party or the Nationalist Party. Anyone who is guilty of the type of malpractice we have heard about should have been brought before the courts and properly punished. But the only people punished were a few Coloured commissioners of oaths who were found guilty of malpractices, and it is right that they were punished. But if it was proved that they committed those malpractices because they were induced to do so by Whites interfering in the affairs of the Coloured people, those Whites should have been brought before court and punished before the Coloureds, because their guilt was greater. No, I think the hon. member for Stellenbosch has not done himself or the country or his party a service by putting that type of question.</p>

<p>I also want to say that I was very glad, at the start of this debate to-day, to hear the hon. the Minister of Defence. His speech was most interesting. I have always respected and admired his debating ability. There is not another man in this House who can defend a lost cause as ably as he can, and whose imagination is so fertile in finding grounds for defending lost causes.</p>

<p>He made out a strong case to-day to prove that the representation the Coloured people have in this House is worthless and that it was never the policy of the Nationalist Party to have this type of representation; that it was a concession to the conscience of the late Mr. Havenga. But then I want to know how it was that during those long protracted debates we had in the constitutional crisis concerning the Cape Coloured vote in this House, member after member of the Nationalist Party got up, including the then Prime Minister and the present Minister of Defence, and assured us that the representation they were offering the Coloured people, by white people on a separate Roll in this House, was an improvement on the previous representation.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I am most grateful to the Minister. I do not want any misunderstanding between us on this. We want to get down to the facts. They did not want to emphasize the negative, namely the abolition of the representation of the Coloured people in this House, because they wanted to establish the positive. But, Sir, this 1964 speech by the hon. the Minister was made during the discussion of the Bill when they were establishing the positive, namely the Coloureds&#x2019; Representative Council. And what did the Minister of Defence quote&#x003F; I do not want to repeat tediously; it has been quoted twice in this debate. He quoted what the Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, said in reply to the hon. member for Transkei. Mr. Hughes asked him whether the Coloured Representatives would stay here if they had their own parliament, and the Prime Minister then replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member looks surprised, but I have already said it twice. What I said was that when we have that parliament &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, when the positive is established&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the White Representatives will still be here. Is that clear now&#x003F;</block>

<p>That is a direct denial of what the hon. the Minister of Defence has said, or else&#x2014;and this we cannot escape&#x2014;he is accusing the late Dr. Verwoerd of conniving with himself to commit a fraud upon the people of South Africa; and I do not accept that. I have a higher regard for the honour of the leaders of this country than to accept that imputation. Therefore I think the hon. the Minister of Defence should be ashamed of himself, that he should dare come to this House and make the insinuation that as a deliberate act of policy the people of South Africa were given assurances when at the back of their minds they had already decided that those assurances would not be honoured. I cannot believe it. [Interjections.] I am privileged that my leader should make suggestions to me. I can give the hon. the Minister this assurance that I shall never be put into the position, as the result of the policies my party follows, of having to accuse my leader of fraud. [Interjections.] After the hon. the Minister made the statement that they were bluffing the people, that they were not telling the people the truth&#x2014;two years afterwards&#x2014;Allen Drury had an interview with the Prime Minister, and the late Dr. Verwoerd gave Mr. Drury the assurance&#x2014;he knew he wanted if for publication throughout the world&#x2014;that it was not the policy of the Nationalist Party to abolish the white representatives of the Coloured people in this House. But the Minister of Defence tells us that long before that interview with Drury, for years he and the late Prime Minister had concocted a plan to abolish the representatives of the Coloured people once certain conditions were satisfied. I think that is a miserable explanation and I think the hon. the Minister should be thoroughly ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>I am very glad the hon. the Minister now admits that he was giving the wrong facts to the House. All I want to suggest in the interest of intelligent debate is that we do check our facts when they are easily ascertainable, before we make rash statements here.</p>

<p>Now, I want to express my regret that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police, who was Chairman of the Commission which dealt with this involved matter, is not here this afternoon. With his usual courtesy, he advised us that he would not be here to-day for a certain reason and we regret the fact that such reason should <span class="col_1547-1548" refersTo="page_0796"/>necessitate his absence. I explained to him that it would be necessary for me to deal with one aspect of the debate which concerns him, and he fully understood. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stood up to reply to the hon. the Deputy Minister, he was very critical of the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech. Members of the Commission, notably the hon. member for Odendaalsrus and others, took exception to that and pointed out that we all respected the quality of the chairmanship of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I confirm that. This was a Select Committee, and afterwards a Commission, on which it was a privilege to serve under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister. We had the greatest courtesy, understanding and objectivity from him at all times, and the criticism of my leader, as I heard it and as he has confirmed to me in consultations, was not directed against the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister at all. It was directed, and quite rightly so&#x2014;and I want to emphasize it&#x2014;at the fact that a man of that calibre had to be forced by the circumstances of his party&#x2019;s policy, to come and make the speech he made here. To think, Sir, that a man of the undoubted intellectual ability of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police had to get up here and try to explain why the Nationalist Party majority on that commission did not heed the evidence! I think it is pitiful that a man of such ability should have to be used for a purpose like that. Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister made the point that the witnesses were not representative and that there were no recognized leaders of the Coloured people. The hon. the Minister of Defence said the same and the hon. the Prime Minister said the same. Apart from emphasizing the valid criticism that they have not produced any leaders for their separate development policy in the last 20 years, I want to know this from the Government: If they knew that there were no recognized leaders, if they knew that there were no authoritative spokesmen for the Coloured people, why did they refer this matter to a select committee and to a commission at all&#x003F; Why did they have the investigation to try to determine the feelings of the Coloured people amongst other things&#x003F; Whom do they regard as leaders of the Coloured people&#x003F; Every political party that I know, which is lawful amongst the Coloured people, came and gave evidence before that commission. Is it the attitude of the Government that all political movements amongst the Coloured people are irresponsible and cannot be respected and that the opinions of their leaders must not be heeded&#x003F; Is that the Government&#x2019;s attitude&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am most grateful for that question. I can understand why the hon. member is concerned about the future of the Coloured people; it is one of the likeable aspects about this hon. member that he does concern himself with the future of the Coloured people. I promise him that I shall deal fully with his question in due course, but it would be a great help if hon. members would ask questions which relate to the point with which one is dealing. Sir, I think these things should be noted for the record: We had a glowing tribute from no one less than the hon. the Prime Minister to the wonderful work that has been done by the present Coloured Council. No tribute could be more glowing. We have to accept the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s word for it because the proceedings of the Coloured Council are not published. The Government&#x2019;s confidence in the value of this Coloured Council is so great that they do not want the world or the South African public to know what the Coloured Council talks about. The Prime Minister tells us that it is a wonderful body, a responsible, respected body. Why then must we hear from the hon. the Minister that there are no responsible or acceptable leaders amongst the Coloured people&#x003F; Have they been appointing Coloured people&#x2014;15 of them&#x2014;regularly to this Coloured Council who are not recognized as respectable and worthy leaders of the Coloured people&#x003F; Sir, the whole speech by the Deputy Minister was unworthy of his quality and of his calibre. I think it should be placed on record that we do not criticize or condemn his chairmanship. What we condemn is this type of argument by the hon. the Deputy Minister to defend a cause which is in fact indefensible. Sir, I think that hon. members opposite who served with us on the commission will agree with me that it was a commission which for a time held out hope that we would be able to find an approach to the problem of the Coloured people that could be looked upon as a truly South African approach. This was so until the hon. the Prime Minister, speaking first at Durban and then at Windhoek, made a pronouncement about his policy for the Coloured people, a pronouncement which prejudged and anticipated the findings of the commission. We looked upon this as a very serious matter. I was surprised, in view of what I am about to relate, that in his speech on Wednesday, the hon. the Prime Minister levelled the reproach at us that we on that commission sought solutions that did not accord strictly and to the letter with the policy of the United Party as it was then. He thought that we were doing something dishonourable. He suggested that the majority on that commission had no freedom to seek a solution; that they were appointed to that commission merely to propagate and to enforce the preconceived prejudices of the Nationalist Party and that they were not free to look for new avenues or for a new approach to the Coloured people. Sir, I was absolutely surprised because the Prime Minister was contradicting himself and was repudiating the chairman of the commission. I think it was on Monday, the 21st August, when we met here in Cape Town, just after the Prime Minister had spoken in <span class="col_1549-1550" refersTo="page_0797"/>Durban, that the hon. member for Peninsula raised a point of order. He drew the chairman&#x2019;s attention to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech at Durban. If any hon. member opposite is interested, he will find this at page 295 of the report. in the right-hand column. The hon. member for Peninsula drew the chairman&#x2019;s attention to this speech by the Prime Minister and said that if this was true, the Prime Minister was defining policy in advance, that this would bind members of the commission and that we reserved our position as the commission would then serve no purpose. He wondered whether the commission should go on. In reply the chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police, made a considered statement in which he said that he had discussed this with the Prime Minister&#x2014;and hon. members will find that at page 296 in the left-hand column&#x2014;and that the Prime Minister had given him the assurance that he had spoken in general terms; that he was not prescribing to the commission what it had to decide and he added that no decision would be taken until the commission&#x2019;s report had become available. These are the words of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police (page 296)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hy &#x2026;</block>

<p>The Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; het my terselfdertyd die versekering gegee, &#x2019;n versekering wat ek as verteenwoordiger van die regerende party ook kan gee, dat daar hoegenaamd geen Regeringsbesluit oor hierdie aangeleentheid geneem is nie, en dat die besprekings vaniaar in die Volksraad en nou ook weer in Durban gedoen is in &#x2019;n gees van afwagting van die aanbevelings en verslag van hierdie kommissie.</block>

<p>He then went on to say that the Prime Minister had discussed this matter at Durban &#x201C;alles in afwagting van die bevindings van hierdie kommissie&#x201D;. My colleague, the hon. member for Transkei raised the same objection and also indicated that the minority would reserve their position on the commission, and again the Deputy Minister of Police, the chairman of the commission, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not think that I can add anything more to what I have already said. That is what the Prime Minister told me, namely, that he was only discussing the matter generally and in the same spirit in which it was discussed in Parliament. As a member of the governing party I can give you the assurance that the party has taken no decision on the matter at all. As a matter of fact, everybody is awaiting the findings of this commission.</block>

<p>Sir, I cannot understand why the Prime Minister has deviated from that attitude to the extent that he has. I cannot understand how in his speech he could reproach us for having taken a line during the sitting of the commission which was a genuine attempt to find a solution which could be acceptable to all white South Africans and, according to the evidence, to most of the Coloured people as well. How has the attitude of our public leaders degenerated over the years! I have in my hand a book written by the late Senator Heaton Nicholls. <i>South Africa in My Time.</i> He devotes a chapter to the history of the Natives Affairs Commissions which led to the 1936 settlement and the attitude that was adopted there. I do not want to weary the House with a lot of detail.</p>

<p>Sir. it is relevant to the point that the Prime Minister made that we should have been bound by our party&#x2019;s policy on this commission. I think it is in the interests of Parliament that we should establish that that is not the purpose of commissions, because then we could never hope, in a select committee or a commission, to find any solution which breaks new ground for South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, in 1930 General Smuts, according to Mr. Nicholls, raised the question of an article which had appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> when the 1930 commission was about to sit. I quote Mr. Nicholls&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There followed a protest by Smuts that a statement which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> tended to throw the Native question back into politics. Then General Hertzog declared (Hansard, page 7, 1930): &#x201C;It is necessary to begin on a basis of trust in each other and to make each feel that we want to put everything of a party character behind us. If we cannot do that, then I am convinced that we shall not only fail to reach a solution but it will be much better for us not to have met at all.</block>

<block name="quote">I am sorry that such a fabrication has been quoted in a newspaper.</block>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, that such a fabrication has been quoted by the hon. the Prime Minister. I have the authority of my leader to say that if we had been advised in advance that this select committee, which was afterwards to become a commission, was being appointed by the Prime Minister, not in an attempt to find a solution to the problem of the Coloured people but merely for the one party to face the other, each bound by its own caucus, then we of the United Party minority would not have served on that commission. It would have been utterly futile. I think we should get that clear for the purpose of the record.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I have lots of time. I promise the hon. member that I will answer it. Sir, let us go back to the commission. I am not going to indulge in long quotations; I want to get to the question put to me by the hon. member for Malmesbury. If one looks at the burden of the evidence given before that commission, one finds that the massive bulk of the evidence was not in favour of Nationalist Party policy because the vast majority of the witnesses wanted representation in this Parliament&#x2014;on a Common Roll with direct representation or on a separate roll with direct or indirect representation&#x2014; but very few, a tiny minority, thought that they would be satisfied with no representation in this body. We have quoted to the House again and again how even supporters of Government policy like Tom Schwartz, had to admit that he would have to disband his party if he advocated the abolition of representation in this Parliament. In other words, the Coloured people as a whole felt so strongly about it that they said that no political party among the Coloured people who propagated such a course had any hope of survival. It is the most powerful evidence for a man supporting the Government to say that if he propagated that aspect of Government policy he would estrange himself from his own people. Sir, another thing that struck us &#x2014;and one must be objective in this matter&#x2014; was that there was no support for the then policy of the United Party. I want that on record too. All the Coloured witnesses wanted a different form of representation from that which they had before the constitutional crisis of the 1950&#x2019;s. I also want it to go on to the record that there was no Coloured witness of any importance who saw an ultimate solution to their problems in the policy of the Progressive Party. There were some who supported it and there were some who supported Nationalist Party policy, but they all said that that would be an interim stage in their political development. They all eventually wanted full citizenship. I think my fellow-members on the commission will admit that. Under examination, witness after witness came to the conclusion eventually that they wanted full citizenship, and you cannot blame them. Any human being would ask for that. But in the circumstances of South Africa, in the circumstances of the Coloured community, not one of the three parties that I have mentioned is willing to give them that, not even the Progressive Party. Not even the Progressive Party will give them what they want. That party wants a qualified franchise which, in practice, will disqualify more Coloured people than white people. To that extent it is also discriminatory, because the fact of the matter is that fewer Coloured people than white people can qualify under that party&#x2019;s policy. That is a fact. The point I want to make is that the Coloured people all want to attain full citizenship as soon as possible, but that the white people of this country are not prepared to give them, and they should not be prepared to give them because it would be dangerous and wrong in the interests of all South Africans.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that almost all of them, with only one or two exceptions, were willing to accept direct representation as an alternative until we could work out a final solution to their problem. All the witnesses of any standing, let me put it that way, were willing to accept that. They did not want a return to the situation that existed before 1955 when Coloured men could vote in the Cape Province, subject to certain qualifications, when Coloured men could vote in Natal, subject to certain qualifications, when Coloured women had no vote and when the Transvaal and Free State had no Coloured voters. That was the policy of the United Party, too. They do not want to return to that state of affairs. That was our policy because we were involved in the highly dramatic and excitable crisis surrounding the Constitution. Our attitude, trained as we are in the Roman-Dutch law and our system of jurisprudence, was this: Before anything can be done about a problem, injustice must be restored. The Latin maxim is <i>Spoliatio ante omnia restituenda est.</i> It means that before a matter is investigated, injustice must be restored to the despoiled. That was our basic principle. We who served on this commission were satisfied that the Coloured people did not want that from us; they wanted a new deal immediately. I know the hon. member for Malmesbury is still hoping that I will avoid answering his questions. But let me assure him I will not. We then consulted with the hon. member for Peninsula; we acted as friends, consulted with one another and took common decisions on certain matters, not on all, and it was agreed that the hon. member would support the Opposition if we placed on record that it was the policy of the United Party to undo the injustice of the 1950&#x2019;s. We did so, but our proposals were rejected by the majority of the commission. Then under a solemn appreciation of the importance of the duty which the hon. the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition had imposed upon this commission by the agreement between the two of them, we sought to put before the commission a solution that should have been acceptable to both parties, namely separate representation, direct representation of Coloured people by Coloured people, with representation for their women and for the Transvaal and the Free State too. It was a very conservative suggestion but at the same time an improvement on this side&#x2019;s previous policy and also an improvement on that side&#x2019;s policy. [Interjections.] I will come to that in a minute. We had very good reason to believe that the developed Nationalist in South Africa &#x2014;I wish to make it clear I am not talking about &#x201C;verligtes&#x201D; but about &#x201C;ontwikkeldes&#x201D;&#x2014; was in favour of such a policy, because I first <span class="col_1553-1554" refersTo="page_0799"/>heard of direct representation as a real issue in our politics from the leaders and formers of public opinion in the Nationalist Party. [Interjections.] We on this side thought that, in the interests of the country and to get this matter out of the political arena once and for all, and to give the Coloureds a square deal, we should make the suggestion which we did. The four of us make no apologies. It was a measure of our sincerity and our deep desire to find a solution to this problem that we did that, but our proposal was rejected. That proposal was based on ideas raised by the thinking and enlightened Nationalist of the country, but it was rejected by the majority of the commission. Then, as a result of the examinations by the Connan committee, which was a party committee, and as a result of the evidence before this commission, we went to our national congress and, with certain modifications, we adopted the principle of that suggestion as the policy of the United Party, and in the result we got away from the undoubted anomalies&#x2014;the existence of which we admit&#x2014;which were contained in the policy the United Party had up to then, which was first to remove an injustice done to the Coloureds. That is my answer to the hon. member for Malmesbury. I hope he is now satisfied. If not, we can argue about it on the hustings. But those are the facts. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Something that interests me very much is the charge that has come, from both sides of the House, that this party or that party has changed its policy, as if the mere fact that there has been a change in one&#x2019;s outlook and convictions, an adaptation of one&#x2019;s thinking to the facts of a situation, is morally evil and should be condemned. If that is the attitude of hon. members in this House then there can be no intellectual progress in this world of ours whatsoever. I do not think we can accept as a tenable moral principle, as a moral precept, that change in itself is evil. What one should do, and here I am calling upon hon. members on the other side to pay attention, is to decide whether the change which one is making is in itself as an act morally defensible. A change can be good; a change can be bad. I want to lay the charge against the Government now that their change is a bad one. Our change was made with several motives. It was made in order to enable the Coloured people to fit into the federal concept that the United Party has developed for South Africa, to make them part of the logical federal concept which we have for South Africa, a concept which history is going to prove as surely as I am standing here to-day to be the only concept which offers a peaceful solution to the problems we face to-day. More and more witnesses are coming from the most unexpected quarters to confirm that. The only white man who could speak with true authority on the Coloured people before the commission was Dr. I. D. du Plessis. Whilst he was under cross-examination he told us that ultimately if the Coloured representation in Parliament was abolished a super body would have to be created in which all races would be represented on a federal basis. He was not prompted but of his own volition used the words &#x201C;on a federal basis&#x201D;, because he knows that ultimately that is the only possible solution for the problems of South Africa.</p>

<p>We made the change in our policy also because we wanted a policy which would be uniform for all Coloured men and women in all provinces. In the opinion of many of us this adjustment was over-due, and we are glad that the change was made.</p>

<p>Finally, we made this change bearing in mind that we had to recognize the special position occupied by the Coloured people in this country. The Coloured people&#x2014;and I want to emphasize this&#x2014;are part of the Western development in South Africa. They have white blood in their veins. They are Christians. They are Afrikaans-speaking. It is a strange thought, and I speak as an Afrikaans-speaking person, that though we are a small nation, one of the smallest in the world but also justifiably one of the proudest, we are, because of a political Government representing for the time being the majority of the Afrikaans-speaking, also being looked upon as the pariah of the world. We are regarded as such quite unjustly. When I think of the hostile world, then I feel it should be a source of gratification and encouragement to us all to know that we are not completely alone, that there is in the world one other great Afrikaans-speaking community totalling more than 1&#x00BD; million, namely the Cape Coloured people. Surely the task of statesmanship in South Africa must be not to drive those people away, to estrange them from us, not to deprive them of their few remaining rights and humiliate and hurt them, but rather to bind them to the white people with bonds that cannot be broken. What Dr. D&#x00F6;nges once said in a moment of hopefulness will then become true, namely that in South Africa there will not be three million hearts beating but five million hearts beating as one. That is the fundamental difference in the approach to this problem between hon. members opposite and us on this side.</p>

<p>When one looks at the change being made by hon. members opposite then one sees a different picture. The change is bad, retrograde, shameless and unjust. I have made a very drastic statement and I will prove it from the mouth of the Nationalist Party itself. In the past when we on this side expressed fears that this injustice would ultimately be perpetrated upon the Coloured people, we were chastised by the Nationalist Party and called hateful agitators. We were condemned and damned for daring to suggest that they could do anything so perfidious. In this connection I should like to read to hon. members what <i>Die Burger</i> said, not in 1961 or 1962 or 1963, the dates quoted by the hon. the Minister of Defence as the times when the change came <span class="col_1555-1556" refersTo="page_0800"/>about, but what it wrote on the 7th May, 1965. This is what was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Van Opposisiekant word nou weer oor die Kleurlingverteenwoordiging in die Volksraad propaganda gemaak wat ons al dikwelstevore gehoor het, maar wat juis in hierdie stadium besonder skadelik is vir rasseverhoudinge.</block>

<block name="quote">Daar word te kenne gegee dat dit die Regering se eintlike doel is om die blanke Kleurlingverteenwoordigers in die Volksraad te verwyder.</block>

<p>That is so&#x2014;if we did suggest that then we were speaking the truth. The hon. the Minister of Defence has now confirmed that we could read their innermost mind, if what <i>Die Burger</i> says is true. I continue&#x2014;</p>

<p>The sanctimonious rectitude of it all! Here it is: Here we are to-day discussing the commission&#x2019;s report accepted by the Government, and they are doing exactly what they said was a false accusation by the perfidious United Party. How can we as adult South Africans ever hope to approach this vexed problem of race relations in South Africa if that is the standard by which the Government party is conducting the affairs of this country&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Oh yes, sanctimonious. [Interjections.] What is the position now that the majority report has been accepted by the Government&#x003F; As far as our relationship with the Coloured people is concerned, and as far as the status and position of the Coloureds are concerned, we have entered a period of dangerous uncertainty. Hon. members do not have to believe me when I say this. I suggest they again read the article by Dawie in Saturday&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> where he calls upon the Government for heaven&#x2019;s sake to keep the dialogue within the Nationalist Party alive. He suggests the appointment of a commission to try and find some certainty because of the uncertainty that has been created. He sees the dangers, the unfortunate dangers created by Government policy. That is so because the Government itself is now uncertain of the future course upon which it has embarked. It has steered South Africa upon unchartered seas, and in the result they find it impossible to answer the simplest questions put to them by the Opposition. I was criticized earlier to-day because I answered in detail questions put by the hon. member for Stellenbosch. But we do that because it is in the interests of the dialogue that we as the white governors of South Africa should keep up to find a solution to the colour problems of this country. But why are hon. members on the opposite side afraid to answer simple questions&#x003F; Some days ago when we opened this debate my hon. Leader put certain fair questions to the Government, but not one of them has been answered.</p>

<p>To-day the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs attempted to answer one, but I do not think he can be proud of his answer. The Leader of the Opposition, having listened to the hon. the Deputy Minister, asked how members of the Government could justify the complete disregard of the evidence before the commission, but no satisfactory answer was forthcoming. Other members asked the question: If there is no responsible opinion or leadership amongst the Coloured people to be consulted, why then is the Prime Minister so anxious not to establish links between the council and this Parliament until he has consulted the new Coloured Representative Council&#x003F; Where is this responsible leadership going to emerge from overnight&#x003F; One election, and the Coloured people will emerge from a dismal darkness of incompetence to the light and to brilliance&#x003F; It does not make sense. But why is there no answer&#x003F; Why must this insult to the Coloured leaders of South Africa remain&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked the Government (and the hon. the Minister of the Interior when he replies, should note this question): What is the true definition of improper interference by one race in the political affairs of the other&#x003F; We have had no answer. The only answer we seem to get, is that it is improper interference when people ask Coloured people to vote for anything but the Government. Is that what they mean by improper interference&#x003F;</p>

<p>There was another question, the one which some attempt was made to reply to, namely &#x201C;What is the optimum development for the proposed Coloured Council&#x003F;&#x201D;, referred to by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Police when introducing this debate. That is not a trick question. It is a most cardinal question, because I can recall, and you will recall, Sir, that the late Dr. Verwoerd some years ago got up in the House and proposed that there should be established for the Coloureds and the Indians their own Parliaments, and he suggested they should be allowed to develop to full sovereignty. For a short period Dr. Verwoerd envisaged three sovereign parliaments, sovereign in all spheres of government in South Africa. Obviously, he could not sustain that, because it is a logical impossibility. Under the federal concept there can be legislative bodies that are sovereign in defined spheres of governmental activities; one can give them certain tasks which they can control <span class="col_1557-1558" refersTo="page_0801"/>in their own discretion; but one cannot in a union as we are, have more than one parliament with full sovereignty. There cannot be one parliament declaring war if we should ever fight the communists and the other one remaining neutral, or declaring war on the side of the communists. It is ridiculous. It cannot be done, and Dr. Verwoerd abandoned that idea. So my hon. Leader is perfectly entitled to ask &#x201C;What is the optimum development to which this Coloured Council will be allowed to develop&#x003F;&#x201D;, and all credit to him, the Minister of Coloured Affairs and of Labour tried to answer. But he laboured. He did not even produce a mouse. He said that the optimum development will be that they will put them on a course where they can develop. If ever there was begging of a question, it was that answer. I want to repeat now to the hon. the Minister who is going to reply on behalf of the Government, the spokesman for the Government: Tell us, when you speak, as you spoke through the Deputy Minister of Police, of the optimum development to which this Coloured Council will be allowed to progress. How far is that&#x003F; But when they reach that optimum development, what more is there for the Coloured people&#x003F; At what stage will the Coloured people of this country be made to feel that they belong to South Africa, that they are part of South Africa, that they can also have a voice in the sovereign Parliament which governs their South Africa&#x003F; I think that, Sir, is a fair question.</p>

<p>Then there is another question which my hon. Leader put to the Government to which there was no attempt to reply, except in some way, to which I will refer, by two young members. What is now the future blueprint for South Africa&#x003F; We do not agree with the Government, but as far as Bantu policy is concerned, they have a blueprint for the future of South Africa. They will fragment South Africa into about eight states. Seven will be black; and one will be mixed. In the mixed state there will be a vast majority of non-Whites, and the industry of that mixed state will be more and more dependent upon the labour of the pure black states. They have a blueprint; one can see where they are going. They are going to a very dangerous place. But, Sir, what is now the blueprint for South Africa as far as the Coloured people and the Indian people are concerned&#x003F; We heard voices. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana with more gallantry than insight, tried to suggest that the homeland idea should be developed for the Coloured people.</p>

<p>As Schalk Pienaar wrote in <i>Die Beeld</i> yesterday: It is very easy for people living in Natal to suggest solutions for the Cape Province. But then that hon. member was followed by the hon. member for Moorreesburg, who speculated in the same direction. But those speculations did not go far. The hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, obviously speaking for the Government, told these young gentlemen not to be stupid. As a matter of fact, he was more critical of them than I could have been, and I think he should be congratulated. I think that he is correct. I must agree with Schalk Pienaar again, who also said yesterday that people who make that suggestion, namely that there should be a Coloured homeland, a colouredstan, for South Africa, are not thinking; they are guilty of escapist flights of fancy. Schalk Pienaar confirmed that if one wants to think in terms of a homeland for the Coloured people, one can only think in terms of the Boland, of the Western Province, extended a little beyond its present boundaries. And he added that no one of sound common-sense, no Nationalist would even conceive of that.</p>

<p>Schalk Pienaar further referred to the suggestion, to go back to the days of Mr. Pirow, that the Coloureds should be given a homeland in the semi-desert areas of the North-Western Cape. He said that is so immoral that it cannot even be discussed in the interests of decent race relations. So that is thought dead, or rather I hope it is dead. We should not delude ourselves. I agree with the hon. the Minister. He did not put it in these words, but I think he will agree with me if I say that this was also his thought, namely that there could be nothing more dangerous in our search for a solution to the Coloured problem in South Africa than for us to indulge in flights of fancy which can never be translated into actual policy, into actual achievement, and to bluff the people of South Africa that we are going to find a solution to the Coloured problem by giving them their own homeland somewhere in the Cape Province, where 2,000,000 people will be able to live and live decently like human beings, without creating the most untold friction between Whites and Coloureds in this country. To bring them under this impression would be grossly irresponsible. That would be an act of injustice to the thinking of the people of South Africa. That would be misleading people beyond even the wiles of the worst politician that you can think of. I am glad and I want to commend the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs that he has scotched the escapist flights of fancy, of the hon. members for Umhlatuzana and Moorreesburg.</p>

<p>I have so many quotations here that I have abandoned all hope of dealing with the matter in the time permitted. But there is one. I would have quoted Professor Olivier, who wrote in a booklet on the colour problem for Sabra in May, 1965, and he pointed out that this idea of a Colouredstan is impossible. But I think, for the edification of the hon. members for Umhlatuzana and Malmesbury, I shall quote what the late Dr. Verwoerd said when he spoke to the Union Council for Coloured Affairs in Cape Town on 12th December, 1961. This is one of the more profound statements made by Dr. Verwoerd, with which every South African must agree. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">Vir die Bantoe wat hul eie tuislande het, is dit redelik maklik om sake so te re&#x00EB;l.</block>

<p><span class="col_1559-1560" refersTo="page_0802"/>I do not agree with that, but that was Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s conviction.</p>

<block name="quote">Al kos dit tyd, kan &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n duidelike beeld vorm en &#x2019;n hele mikpunt stel omtrent hoe selfbestuur aan hulle gegee moet word.</block>

<p>Well, that one can do.</p>

<block name="quote">In die geval van die Kleurlinge is dit nie so nie. Ek wil dit duidelik stel dat hoewel daar mense in die Kleurlinggroepe is wat die indruk probeer wek dat die Regering vir die Kleurlinge &#x2019;n tuisland wil skep in &#x2019;n aparte deel van Souid-Afrika, dit nie so is nie.</block>

<p>Quite obviously it was never a policy or even the thinking of Dr. Verwoerd to do anything so preposterous as the suggestion made so charmingly by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. Dr. Verwoerd went on and he said:</p>

<block name="quote">Dit vorm geen oplossing vir die Kleurlinggroep nie, en &#x2019;n eie tuislandbeleid is in hierdie geval glad nie toepasbaar nie.</block>

<p>Then Dr. Verwoerd went on and referred to the point made by the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs that the Coloureds do have vast stretches of land which they own in the Cape Province. But he discounted those tracts of land as ever affording as homeland, in the sense it is used in terms of the Bantu policy, for the Coloured people of South Africa. Dr. Verwoerd went on:</p>

<block name="quote">Die Kleurling beskik wel oor miljoene morge grond waar &#x2019;n deel van hulle gemeenskap landboukundig kan presteer. Dit sal ook probeer word om die bruikbaarheid en vrugbaarheid van daardie gebiede te verhoog, byvoorbeeld deur die aanleg van besproeiingskemas. Selfstandige Kleurlinge sal op die boerderygrond gevestig kan word. Dit is egter net &#x2019;n deel van die ekonomise potential van die Kleurlinge wat behoorlik ontwikkel en beskerm moet word.</block>

<p>No reference is even made to it being part of their political potential. It is only part of their economic potential which must also be protected.</p>

<p>In the spirit in which the United Party opposition accepted office on that select committee and commission, namely to try to find a solution to this problem, I want to make an appeal to the Government, and indeed to South Africa. Let us keep on thinking and arguing even if we laugh at one another. Let us for God&#x2019;s sake keep on discussing and arguing about the future position of the coloured people in the South African community. I think we are all agreed that they are an important community. We all deeply regret that among some of them there is deterioration which is visible and which this Government and this Parliament have tried to solve by means of the legislation we adopted last year. There is not a thinking politician in South Africa worthy of his salt who does not want to find a solution to the problem of the Cape Coloured people and the Coloured people generally which will enable them to make their full contribution as South Africans to the solution of our problems, to the creation of wealth and the establishment of a stable society in this South Africa of ours. I do not believe that there is one person, no matter how &#x201C;verkramp&#x201D; he may be, who does not appreciate that the Cape Coloured people occupy a very special position in relation to the white community in South Africa. If we want to think clearly at all, we dare not they that fact. Let us keep on thinking and discussing. But do not let us delude ourselves into intellectual cul-de-sacs such as the suggestion that it will ever be possible to create for these unfortunate people a separate homeland where they can develop to the utmost and enjoy sovereignty and realize their personalities to the utmost. I say that that will be an intellectual cul-de-sac. It can lead us nowhere. It must end in frustration, hopelessness and disaster for the peace of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. P. MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are indebted to the hon. member for Yeoville in that he once again adopted a brand new attitude to-day in regard to the future of the Coloureds. It is a brand new attitude in this sense that the so-called referendum question that was dealt with by the hon. member for Stellenbosch, was given a brand new complexion by the hon. member for Yeoville, namely that they do not want to grant the Coloureds more than six representatives in this House. Provision for a referendum is written into the Constitution so as to prevent other Governments from perhaps granting the Coloureds more than six representatives in this House. In other words, I am to accept&#x2014;and I should like to know if this is not the case &#x2014;that the quota of six representatives the United Party is prepared to allow in his House, is the ultimate fixed limit of the Coloureds&#x2019; representation in this Parliament under any circumstances. It can never be more or fewer; it can only be these six. Is this the United Party&#x2019;s new official attitude&#x003F; The Leader of the Opposition did not put it that way. I should like to have clarity in this regard. The Leader of the Opposition definitely did not put it that way. Those hon. members are very quiet now. But I want to go further as far as this theme is concerned. This is what I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. If this were the case, is it morally and ethically right for them to have only six representatives in this House&#x003F; Another important question is the following: Will the Coloured community accept it and be satisfied with six representatives in this House for ever, whereas the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council is granted limited powers which, according to those hon. members, are not even equivalent to those granted to the Provincial Council&#x003F; But I shall come back to this point later on. <span class="col_1561-1562" refersTo="page_0803"/>The hon. member for Yeoville placed himself here on a very sacrosanct pedestal. I want to quote specifically the words he used here, words such as &#x201C;solemnly, genuinely, in all sincerity, with a deep desire&#x201D;. He used these fine words in order to say how sincerely they had gone into this matter and how sincerely they had sought a solution. Now they are blaming us for not having found a solution to their liking and for having allegedly approached this matter with pre-conceived ideas. But in spite of this sacrosanct attitude adopted by that side of the House, they came forward with a proposal&#x2014;and I do not wish to go into it now&#x2014;which they did in fact put forward as their final word, namely that the representation should be as it was proposed by the hon. member for Peninsula. What happened subsequently&#x003F; Before the Government received the report, in which that fine proposal is to be found, and before the Government had any time to react to that proposal&#x2014;the Government is at liberty to accept any recommendation, be it from the majority report, the minority report or composed of excerpts from both reports&#x2014;the United Party threw overboard its entire policy in Bloemfontein and then came to this House with a new point of view. With all its sacrosanctity the United Party rejected in favour of this new point of view everything that had been achieved. Does that give a one permission to put oneself on a sacrosanct platform in regard to this matter&#x003F; [Interjections.] No, unfortunately I cannot react in five minutes&#x2019; time to everything the hon. member had said in an hour. That is impossible, and I also want to make my own speech. As regards those two spheres I touched upon, I do not think that the hon. member brought credit to his side. His sacrosanct platform collapsed under him like an anthill, or rather a dung-hill.</p>

<p>In the time I have left, I should like to make my own speech. I want to say that before gears were synchronised in the motor car industry, the following notice appeared at the start of a steep 20-mile mountain pass in America: &#x201C;Be careful which gear you choose, because you will be in that gear for the next 20 miles.&#x201D; That was in the time before gears could be changed while the car was in motion. In respect of the Coloureds I want to say that in view of the fact that the Coloureds are now being granted political rights for the first time really, we should here and now select the right gear, and not the wrong one, to drive in, because we shall be in that gear for a long time. The majority report selected a gear in which we shall not only be able to drive for the first 20 miles but in which we shall also be able to stop after those 20 miles in order that we may review the whole position once again, recongnoitre the road ahead and select another gear in which we may drive further. The United Party&#x2019;s minority report also selected a gear for the first 20 miles. But after the first 20 miles of steepness they will, in that gear, have no more control over the car and it will unceremoniously leave the road and plunge down the precipice. That is the difference between the majority and the minority report. I signed the majority report, and I want to indicate briefly why I did so without any hesitation whatsoever. In the first place it made allowances for, and it is still making allowances for the basic facts in regard to the situation of the Whites and the non-Whites in South Africa. In the first place, it recognizes the Coloureds as a separate nation. No matter how closely they are related to the Whites by virtue of their language, religion, customs, etc., they are not, they cannot and they do not want to be an integral part of the White Nation. I want to quote evidence to corroborate this. There are two points of view in this regard. The Coloureds themselves view this in two ways. The first is the point of view of the Labour Party. This is the way they put it on page 40 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To work for the elimination of the colour bar in legislation, as well as the practical application thereof.</block>

<p>In other words, they do not want to be a separate nation. As far as colour is concerned, they want to wipe out all dividing lines and merge with the Whites. But what does the large majority of the Coloureds, as represented by the other two political parties, have to say&#x003F; On page 60 the Federal Coloured Peoples&#x2019; Party says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Federale Kleurlingvolksparty het &#x2019;n positiewe pad ingeslaan wat helder en duidelik voor hom oopl&#x00EA; en al wat gevra word is dat tyd aan hom gegun moet word om die hele Kleurlingsvolksgroep na selfstandigheid te lei.</block>

<p>It wants the Coloureds to form a separate nation. It does not want them to form part of the White nation. What does the Conservative Party say on page 11&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die party sal hom verder beywer vir die volste verwesenliking van die national verwagtinge, begeertes en ideale van die Kleurlingbevolking van Suid-Afrika deur &#x2019;n kragtige volksgevoel en samehorigheid aan te moedig &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">Die party onderskryf ten volle die nasionale beginsel van selfbeskikking en selfverwesenliking en vasberadenheid vir die Kleurlinge van die Republiek van Suid Afrika &#x2026;</block>

<p>Without a doubt this party also prefers a separate Coloured nation. I also want to quote what Mr. Petersen, the leader of the Conservative Party, has to say on page 130 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Konserwatiewe Party is die party wat veral onder die minderbevoorregtes &#x2026; rondgaan ten einde hulle bewus te maak van <span class="col_1563-1564" refersTo="page_0804"/>die roeping wat voor hulle l&#x00EA;, en wat van &#x2019;n mens verwag word. Ons het aan hulle verduidelik dat sedert volksplanting daardie groot blank boom was terwyl die Kleurlingbevolking al die jare as &#x2019;n klein boompie onder daardie groot boom gestaan het. Toe het dit gebeur, en ons s&#x00EA; dank die Here, dat sedert 1948 daardie klein boompie onder die groot boom uitgehaal is. So het ons dit aan hulle gestel. Soos verstaan kan word, het die groot boom al die sap opgeneem, maar nou is die klein boompie daar op sy eie geplaas waar hy ook nou tot sy eie kan kom. Die Konserwatiewe Party is bereid om in sy strewe die Regering te help om daardie Kleurlingboom wat nou daar eenkant geplant is tot sy volheid te laat kom.</block>

<p>That is the point of view. The Coloureds want to be a separate nation. This majority report makes allowances for that fact. I want to mention a second basic principle for which the majority report makes allowances, namely that at the moment the large majority of the Whites in South Africa are not prepared, just as future generations will, for the same reasons not be prepared either, to accept or absorb the Coloureds as part of the White population. I need not illustrate this fact. I can merely state it. The National Party is not prepared to do so. The Progressive Party says that they are prepared to accept total integration. The United Party&#x2014;with a few exceptions such as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, the hon. member for Karoo, and others&#x2014;is not prepared to advocate total integration with the Coloureds either.</p>

<p>There is a third point I want to make. At present the Coloureds are a minority group&#x2014; and I am not going to evade this&#x2014;which may rightly lay a claim to being recognized and to being granted certain rights by the Whites. There is, however, another fact that should be added immediately. In granting these rights the Whites must thoroughly take into account the fact that the Coloureds will not always remain a minority group. The solution to this problem must be such that when that day comes, the course the Government is now marking out for the minority group will also make provision for the Coloureds when they are in the majority, without making the position of the Whites untenable at that stage. That is the next step. Provision has to be made now for the minority group, but when this group becomes the majority group, the same policy must still be applicable. I also want to state a fifth basic concept. At the moment the Coloureds are living, and will be living permanently, within the geographic territory which the Whites, in implementing their Bantu homeland policy, finally set aside for themselves as part of White South Africa. This matter is also being taken into account, and I shall discuss it presently.</p>

<p>There is one last point I want to mention. The time will come when the Whites will have to choose in respect of the Coloureds, as they now have to choose in respect of Bantu between two alternatives, namely either (1) to share political rights in their part of White South Africa with a majority group of Coloureds, or (2) to subdivide that territory as well so that the Whites and the Coloureds, each group in its own territory, may develop to full self-realization. That is the choice with which the Whites are faced.</p>

<p>The majority report made allowances for these basic principles. In his first official speech as Prime Minister, the Prime Minister clearly outlined the policy to be followed in this regard. He did not deal exhaustively with this report or with anything else, but in broad outline he said: &#x201C;I am indicating to the Coloureds a road, leading away from the Whites; not in hostility, but a road of their own.&#x201D; He also added, &#x201C;A commission of enquiry has been appointed and we are awaiting its report.&#x201D; There is a second reason for my signing it, namely the fact that the majority report took the evidence into account. That is why I felt at liberty on various occasions in this House to say by way of interjection: We have the evidence on the basis of which we did that. I feel that it is my duty to quote this evidence now. I want to start by saying, in the first place, that no Coloured group had asked for a reversion to the common voters&#x2019; roll on a qualification basis. Not a single group had asked for that. I am now asking those hon. members where they found the evidence for making such a recommendation. On what evidence did they base their recommendation&#x003F; I submit, and I challenge them to oppose me, that not one single Coloured group had asked for that. Those who did in fact ask for that, were the very leftist organizations, such as Nusas, the Black Sash, and others. Those organizations I can readily link with that concept, but no Coloured group asked for that. No Coloured group asked that the White representation here should be continued in its present form and that the representatives should still be elected in future in the way it is being done at present. No Coloured group asked for that. There were several other interpretations, but no group asked for that. Except for the leftist Labour Party, all the Coloureds were agreed that interference by one population group in the politics of another was undesirable and harmful and should be combated. If the hon. member for Houghton does not want to believe this, she should read the report more thoroughly, and there she will find all the evidence to the effect that all of them pleaded against interference, except for the Labour Party which welcomed interference. All of the Coloured groups were in favour of the development of the Coloured Persons Representative Council. It was found in the end that all the Coloured groups wanted a link with Parliament in the meantime. I want to quote specifically what attitude the Federal Coloured People&#x2019;s Party adopted in this regard, as it appears on page 60 of the report. It is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die siening van die Federale Kleurling Volksparty in hierdie verband is kort en <span class="col_1565-1566" refersTo="page_0805"/>duidelik, en kom daarop neer dat ons nie kan sien tot watter nut die huidige blanke verteenwoordiging in die Republikeinse Parliament vir ons is nie. Ons herhaal net dat die huidige verteenwoordiging nie vir ons tot nut is nie en aan geen verwagtings voldoen nie.</block>

<p>And then he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indian die Kleurlingverteenwoordiging nog wenslik is na die totstandkoming van ons eie parlement, dan is ek sekerlik geregtig om te versoek dat ons eie Parliament sy eie blanke verteenwoordigers in die blanke Parliament moet aanwys.</block>

<p>Not as is the case at present. Nor is it the United Party&#x2019;s policy he is propagating here. Not at all. But let us go on. The following question (see page 156) was then put to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As die Regering &#x2026; besluit &#x2026; om liewers die Kleurlingverteenwoordiging af te skaf, sal u dit nie so beskou dat u daarvoor gevra het nie, maar as wetsgehoorsame burgers s&#x00EA; dat die Regering in sy wysheid daartoe besluit het en dat julle dit so sal aanvaar.</block>

<p>To this the leader replied, &#x201C;Yes, that is so.&#x201D; And then he went further and said, &#x201C;In other words, if my party is in power at that time, then we shall co-operate.&#x201D; And then the following question was put to him, &#x201C;But you yourself do not wish to take upon yourself the responsibility for asking that it should be abolished.&#x201D; To this he replied. &#x201C;I do not want to take it upon myself at all.&#x201D; Later on I shall illustrate the reason for this by means of a further quotation. Now we come to the next step, as indicated by the Conservative Party (page 132)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek s&#x00EA; dus dat ons nie twee stemme kan h&#x00EA; nie. Wat ons betref, ons wil h&#x00EA; dat die Kleurlingraad die eintlike mondstuk van die Kleurlingmense moet wees.</block>

<p>And when it was aked why, if that had to be the actual mouthpiece, they still wanted Coloured representatives here and to what purpose this would be, the reply and the real reason came from Mr. Fortuin (see page 133)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons voel dat die vier Kleurlingverteen-woordigers in die Volksraad behou moet word sodat daardie mense wat nog op die draad sit en vertel dat ons hierheen kom om die Kleurling te kom verkoop; kan sien dat ons die Regering vra om niks van ons weg te neem nie.</block>

<p>That is the only reason why he wants it. And then (see page 135) the following question was put, &#x201C;Then they may just as well go after 10 years&#x003F;&#x201D; And then, after we had explained to them exactly what the Government envisaged in respect, of this matter, we had the following reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons het nie so daaraan gedink nie. Ons gedagte was dat hulle behove moet bly. Maar as die opset is soos dit hier nou vir ons geskilder is, dan maak dit ons opnuut dink. As ons dan na 10 jaar voel dat ons wel oor die manne beskik wat bekwaam genoeg is en ons kan aan die land en aan die Regering die bewys lewer dat ons bereid en bekwaam is om die leisels te hou, dan meen ek sal die Regering self kom en s&#x00EA; dat ons nou die leisels moet oorvat.</block>

<p>And when it was asked what they would say then, the reply was, &#x201C;I shall say &#x2018;yes&#x2019;.&#x201D; In other words, we have the support and we have the necessary evidence. And then the following very pointed question was put (see page 144)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is dit reg as ek s&#x00EA; dat as die Verteen-woordigende Kleurlingraad uitgebou kan word tot &#x2019;n behoorlike parlement, die blanke verteenwoordigers in die Volksraad nie vir die party belangrik is nie en al wat u daar soek &#x2019;n skakel is&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply to this was, &#x201C;That is all, that is correct.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That is the evidence of the two major political parties for Coloureds which are at the moment going down well with the masses outside. Except for the Labour Party, they are the two big ones. Even the Labour Party made this matter essential for us. When it was pointed out to this Party (see page 123) that there was a possibility of a clash about these two points of view between the representatives here and those of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, Dr. Van der Ross personally replied as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Regering sal dan kennis moet neem van die feit dat hy self die posisie geskep het waar so iets moontlik is. As dit dan sou ontstaan, moet die Regering self na vore kom met &#x2019;n oplossing.</block>

<p>In other words, he also leaves us this opening, namely that we may immediately come forward with this solution if necessary. That is exactly what is contained in the recommendation of the majority report. The majority report says that the Government itself should accept the responsibility of abolishing these representatives. In that case no Coloured leader can be blamed for having asked for that, and then there cannot be any political platform from which the accusation can be levelled at him that he would be to blame if they should be abolished. In that way we shall be doing them a favour, as they themselves admitted. We shall also be helping the Labour Party by explaining to them that we want to prevent the clash beforehand. But why is the abolition really being recommended&#x003F; <span class="col_1567-1568" refersTo="page_0806"/>In the first place, our terms of reference were to discuss and investigate improper interference. And when we discussed and investigated it, we found that the main reason for the interference, as became apparent from all the evidence, was that White persons had to represent Coloureds in this House. That is why there is interference. The Whites interfere in Coloured politics because the Whites have a platform here from which they can talk. That is why there is interference. Then the immediate choice is whether Coloureds should be represented here by Coloureds&#x2014;then the interference would be less&#x2014; or whether Coloured representation should be done away with altogether. And they admitted immediately that this was the only alternative. And when it is pointed out that since 1948 this Government has had a mandate from the electorate, namely that no non-Whites may hold seats in this Parliament, and that it is therefore not possible for the Government to take such a decision, the following argument was immediately raised: Then there is only one alternative, then one might as well abolish it. Let us see what the parties did with the evidence contained in the report. The United Party came forward&#x2014;in the light of the evidence I have just read out&#x2014;with the most foolish thing imaginable, namely by way of the proposal put forward by the hon. member for Transkei, i.e. that they should be reinstated on the common voters&#x2019; roll. As I am saying, nobody asked for that. I challenge the United Party to quote any evidence on the strength of which they introduced that proposal. Then we have this other argument in their recommendation. They accept the new Coloured Council with its 40 elected members, but they do not want any law relating to interference of any nature whatsoever. In other words&#x2014;let us face the facts&#x2014;then it means that those Coloured Council elections could degenerate to such an extent that all three of the White political parties represented here at the moment would be able to enter full-steam into those election campaigns with the capital, organizers, workers, and energies each of them has at its disposal. And they would be able to fight to their hearts&#x2019; content. One would merely be moving the platform from one place to another. To render a service to whom and to what&#x003F; The Coloureds&#x003F; One simply does this to have a lot of puppets there who will realize that they are dependent on the White party that supported and assisted them for their seats in the Coloured Persons Representative Council. That would not imply any future whatever for the Coloureds. That is what they are envisaging with the recommendations, as they stand here. I also want to analyse the United Party&#x2019;s new policy in this regard. I am now coming back to that point of view, and I also see that I do not have much time left. What is being recommended now, is that there should be six Whites or Coloureds here and two in the Senate. I do not want to accept that this is for ever and ever, as the hon. member for Yeoville said.</p>

<p>I would rather accept his leader&#x2019;s word that this is being done &#x2026; Well, I shall furnish the exact reasons for that at a later stage. I shall deal with them later. At present there are four Whites in this House, without any pressure from any side or anywhere, the United Party comes forward and makes it six, not only Whites, but possibly Coloureds as well. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is very allergic to pressure. He admitted it himself. He said so a few times. And if he starts making this concession without any pressure, then I want to say at once that nobody can be sure in what direction pressure will eventually force him. But let us give the Opposition the benefit of the doubt. Let us accept that they want to retain these four members here and, with the minimum expansion to the North, that they want to grant the Transvaal one and the other two provinces one. Let us give them that freedom and that benefit of the doubt. Then I say immediately that that is not all. According to the United Party this number can only be increased if the White electorate were to decide to do so by way of a referendum. And now I want to ask the question which we put to them and which the hon. member for Yeoville tried to answer: What is the advice of the Leader of the United Party going to be at such a referendum&#x003F; And what was the reply of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when this question was put to him&#x003F; His, and not that of the hon. member for Yeoville. By way of a high-sounding statement he said that their advice would be such that White leadership would be confirmed. I invite the hon. member to deny this. He did not say that it was a guarantee against other governments. What does this fine, haughty statement of his mean in plain English&#x003F; I just want to know what he is saying. He can either stand on a platform and make an appeal by saying; &#x201C;Vote against, vote no; don&#x2019;t allow the Coloureds to have more representatives,&#x201D; or he may stand on a platform and say, &#x201C;Vote yes, let them have more.&#x201D; Now I ask the Leader of the Opposition: What proposal is he going to put forward&#x003F; What attitude is he going to adopt&#x003F; Will it be the same attitude he has to adopt now&#x003F; Or what attitude is he going to adopt&#x003F; Because he will still be in difficulties. If he says, &#x201C;Vote no,&#x201D; then it means that he wants to give the Coloureds a permanent ceiling of six representatives. If he says yes, he will never be able to put a stop to the situation, because once he starts moving, on what grounds will he ever be able to cry &#x201C;Halt!&#x201D; in this matter&#x003F; Then he, with his wrongly selected gear, will be on the downhill road on which he will never be able to stop again. But now I want to give him the benefit of the doubt once again. I accept that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will say no, i.e. that one should not go any further. Fine, if he said that, I am asking him whether the Coloureds will accept it. Will they resign themselves to that&#x003F; Or will they perhaps bring pressure to bear&#x003F; He need not wait until then to determine <span class="col_1569-1570" refersTo="page_0807"/>whether they will in fact bring pressure to bear. By way of a quotation I can tell him right now what the Coloureds will do in this regard. I am quoting the words Dr. Van der Ross used in his evidence. The Labour Party asked for ten representatives in Parliament. The following question was put to him (see page 122)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Vir hoe lank sal die Kleurlinge tevrede wees met 10 verteenwoordigers in hierdie land&#x003F; Wanneer sal hulle begin vra vir gelyke behandeling met die blankes&#x003F;</block>

<p>His reply to this was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons maak natuurlik hier &#x2019;n toegewing. Ons stel dit baie duidelik dat proporsioneel dit geensins geregverdig kan word nie. Ons verwag natuurlik dat dit met verloop van tyd sal groei.</block>

<p>He says it very clearly. And then this question was put&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Met ander woorde, die uiteindelike ideale oplossing volgens u standpunt sal wees dat daar volgens die huidige getal stemgeregdigdes 65 lede gekies sal moet word in hierdie Parlement&#x003F;</block>

<p>His reply to that was, &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Then the following question was put to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">En u sien 10 verteenwoordigers as die begin, &#x2019;n proses wat uiteindelik daarheen moet lei&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply to this was, &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; And then the hon. member for Gardens&#x2014;the good, conservative, rural U.P. supporter&#x2014;came forward and said that he would like to try to put this matter right. He realized that the evidence was too damning and that he wanted to do something about it. He put the following question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moet ons dan aanneem dat die Kleurlinge met verloop van tyd sal vra vir meer as 10 verteenwoordigers&#x003F;</block>

<p>He was rather astonished when he asked this. Then Dr. Van der Ross replied very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Kleurling sal altyd vra vir meer en meer om sy posisie as landsburger te handhaaf.</block>

<p>All these facts are to be found on page 122 of the commission&#x2019;s report.</p>

<p>There we have the policy of the United Party. More and more will be asked. No, the difference is the following. I am saying this to the hon. member for Yeoville right away. The difference is that it tells the Coloureds that they must realize their political ideals here. Here the Coloureds are given the starting-point of six, and here they must realize themselves to the full. We say that we are not granting those things to the Coloureds here. They must not realize themselves here. The Coloured must realize themselves in their own Coloured Persons Representative Council which we have created for them and to which we shall gradually grant more powers. That is the difference. What did the National Party do with this very same evidence&#x003F; We accept the wish of the majority of the Coloureds and the majority of the Whites, namely that these are two totally separate nations, with separate identities each of which should be developed in its own sphere to full self-realization. That is why we are separating the political rights of the two, and that is why this Parliament will eventually and exclusively become the political home of the Whites only. And at the same time the Coloureds are politically placed in a position from where they may realize themselves to the full through their own political institutions. We are not ashamed of saying this and we do not shrink back from this, namely that by means of the Coloured Persons Representative Council we are now deliberately placing a ceiling above the heads of the Coloureds. But we are granting them control, effective control, of those things in which they are really interested and which are really near to their hearts: their education, their welfare services, local authorities, rural areas, etc. We are granting them those things in which they are really interested, along with real, effective powers. We are placing a ceiling above their heads. We are openly telling the whole world that such a ceiling does exist and that there is also a reason why there is such a ceiling. The reason is that at this stage the Coloureds are a minority group in this country. As a minority group they can therefore not make demands for full control and full government along with the Whites. As a minority group they are therefore given that ceiling above their heads. What it is being given now, is nevertheless much more than is being given to minority groups in other countries. Those rights are far more than those the Red Indians in Canada have, they are far more than those the Eskimos in Greenland have, they are far more than those the Tamils in Ceylon have, and they are far more than those the Asians in Kenya have at present. We say that there is a ceiling above their heads, and we are deliberately placing it there and we are not ashamed of it, but we are specifically not granting them control of international conditions, of war and peace, of foreign policy. They are not interested in those matters, and we, as the majority in this country, are capable of deciding about them for ourselves.</p>

<p>But I want to go further by saying that we do not intend to run away from the idea and the fact that this Coloured minority group may eventually become a majority group. That <span class="col_1571-1572" refersTo="page_0808"/>is why we have now chosen a way along which we can, when we reach that stage, look ahead and move on. Once we have reached that stage, we say that it depends on the Coloureds themselves, if they become leaders, to return to their own people in the meantime and to uplift them rather than to &#x201C;try for White&#x201D;, as so many of them are doing. Such people become the leaders of the people and the heroes of the future; the others become the traitors and the renegades who try to ingratiate themselves with the other side. That is what history has always shown. This step places me in the position where at a later stage I can think again, and when I say think again, I specifically put it in that way, that we can think at that stage about what the future should be like, because then it is a new situation. Then I want to say immediately that at the moment it is not the official policy of the National Party to establish a homeland for the Coloureds, as the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs also said here to-day. But the steps we are taking now do not eliminate the possibility of a geographic home for the Coloureds which is their own, if that should appear to be the ideal solution at a later stage. We dare not close that door of a geographic home for the Coloureds. In everything we do now and later, we must always keep that door open, because it may, when we reach that stage, afford us the true and only alternative solution. I want to add at once that it need not be a geographic unit Zululand will never be a geographic unit. Eastern and Western Pakistan are separated from each other by hundreds of miles, but it is one state. The U.S.A. is not a unit; Alaska is situated at a great distance from the other states. Japan is a group of islands. It need not be a geographic unit. The fact simply remains that we shall have to deal here with a situation where we are starting out on a road but shall at a later stage be able to reflect and decide once again. That is what the Government is doing at the moment, and that is the road we shall take. When the opportunity occurs at a later stage, we shall be able to decide again. But if the Opposition has its way, the only decision that can be taken in the future is to grant these people more and more representatives here until one day the majority in this Parliament will be Coloureds, and then they (the Coloureds) will perhaps decide to give the Whites a homeland somewhere in South Africa, because then they will be in control here.</p>
