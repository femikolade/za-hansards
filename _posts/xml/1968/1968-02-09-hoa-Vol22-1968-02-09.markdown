<heading>Vacancies for Pilots in S.A. Air Force</heading>

<question by="#raw" to="#minister_of_defence">

<num>*18.</num>

<from>Mr. W. V. Raw</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Defence:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) How many vacancies exist in the South African Air Force for pilots of (a) jet and (b) piston aircraft;</li>

<li>(2) what salary and allowances are paid to a pilot upon qualifying to fly Mirage or Buccaneer aircraft;</li>

<li>(3) what is the estimated cost of training a pilot to fly a Mirage or Buccaneer aircraft;</li>

<li>(4) how many qualified jet pilots resigned from the Air Force during 1967.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_defence" to="#raw">

<from>The MINISTER OF DEFENCE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Pilots of the South African Air Force are classified as General Duties officers and are carried against General Duties posts. The duties attached to General Duties posts include flying training tasks, operational flying tasks and staff duties and pilots are, therefore, trained to fulfil all these tasks. It is, therefore, not possible to distinguish between vacancies for pilots of jet and piston aircraft. If the question in intended to establish how many pilots are qualified in jet and piston aircraft respectively, it is not in the public interest to furnish this information.</li>

<li>(2) The salaries and allowances paid to pilots depend on their respective ranks, e.g.:&#x2014;

<ol>

<li><p>(a) Salaries.</p>

<p>Candidate Officer: R1,020 &#x00D7; 180&#x2014;1,380</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant: R1,680 &#x00D7; 120&#x2014;2,400</p>

<p>Lieutenant: R2,400 &#x00D7; 120&#x2014;3,000</p>

<p>Captain: R3,000 &#x00D7; 120&#x2014;3,600</p>

<p>Major: R3,600 &#x00D7; 150&#x2014;4,200</p>

<p>Commandant: R4,200 &#x00D7; 150&#x2014;4,800&#x2014;5,100</p>

<p>Colonel: R5,100 &#x00D7; 300&#x2014;6,000</p></li>

<li><p>(b) Flying Allowance.</p>

<p>Candidate Officer: R300 per year</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant to Major: R600 per year</p>

<p>Commandant and higher: R450 per year</p></li>

<li><p>(c) Flying Instructors&#x2019; Allowance.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant to Captain: R120 per year</p>

<p>Major: R240 per year</p></li></ol></li>

<li>(3) The careers and training of pilots differ from pilot to pilot up to the stage where they qualify as jet pilots. No pilot is trained continuously from his <i>ab initio</i> flying training to the Mirage or Buccaneer pilot standard. A realistic figure of the cost of the training of a jet pilot can, therefore, not be furnished.</li>

<li>(4) It is not considered in the public interest to divulge this information.</li>

<heading>Tanker Sivella: Oil Leakage</heading>

<question by="#murray" to="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<num>*21.</num>

<from>Mr. L. G. MURRAY</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to the imminent threat of oil leakage <span class="col_255-256" refersTo="page_0145"/>from the French tanker <i>Sivella</i> which is lying off the Cape coast;</li>

<li>(2) what steps have been taken and are contemplated to disperse the oil and to protect marine life and the foreshore.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#murray">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li><p>(2) The Division of Sea Fisheries of my Department, in collaboration with the C.S.I.R., kept a close and continuous check on conditions since the <i>Sivella</i> ran aground off the Cape coast. The Division&#x2019;s research vessel <i>Trachurus</i> and patrol boat <i>Wagter III</i> carried out various surveys and standard oceanographic observations were made. Samples of the crude oil were taken for experimental purposes in the Division&#x2019;s laboratory. Simultaneously, the effect of several brands of detergents on various forms of marine life was tested. The preliminary findings in this connection showed that these effects ranged from absolute mortality, especially among certain species and using solutions of 100 parts per million, to moderate mortality or sluggishness when using solutions of 10 parts per million. In tests with oil only, all creatures were normal after twenty hours. It would, therefore, appear to be extremely inadvisable to apply detergents for the dissolution or emulsification of the oil. The application of mechanical methods for this purpose appeared to be more acceptable and preparations were made to disperse the oil by means of nets dragged between two vessels, while experiments in this connection are being actively pursued in the meantime.</p>

<p>Thus far the need to take such action has fortunately not arisen as the oil slick which, on Monday, 5th February, 1968, extended over a solid area of one by one quarter mile with a thickness of less than one half of a centimetre, was found last Wednesday to have broken up in small patches with numerous lumps over an area of several square miles close to the shore at Bok Bay. Depending on weather conditions it was expected that the oil would have drifted ashore in this vicinity by last night. This part of the beach is not much used for recreational purposes and, in addition, very little or no damage to marine life should be caused. A further close inspection in the vicinity of the <i>Sivella</i> revealed no further leakage of oil from the vessel.</p>

<p>I may add that as a result of the oil disaster in the British Channel last year my Department, bearing responsibility for the preservation of marine life and the C.S.I.R., which agreed to act as the co-ordinating body, decided some time ago to collect all available information on this problem in the light of experience gained by other countries. This information, supplemented with such further studies and research as may prove necessary will, it is hoped, enable the Government to meet contingencies of this nature along the South African coasts.</p></li>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#murray">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>I was in touch with the Director of Sea Fisheries less than half an hour ago. He told me that he inspected the coast this morning before lunch-time and that the position was not nearly as bad as it was made out to be. He has personally seen only certain patches of an emulsion of oil. He does not think that it will cause any damage to marine life. As far as the question of cost is concerned, I cannot give a reply at this stage.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would now like to discuss agriculture, but before I do so, I want to say that I am not quite certain whether I should congratulate the hon. the Minister of Agriculture on having acquired an additional post or whether I should sympathize with him. I would like to remind him that a former colleague of his had his portfolio taken away from him as the result of criticism fom this side of the House on the ground of his incompetence. Similarly another Minister was deprived of one of his portfolios yesterday as a result of criticism from this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister, as Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, has already come in for considerable criticism from this side for the unsympathetic manner in which he has been treating the farming community of this country, especially for the methods used in price fixation, methods which have caused them great hardship. I am not certain whether the hon. the Minister will not perhaps find himself holding the Forestry portfolio in the near future, with the present Minister of Forestry and Tourism only holding the Tourism portfolio.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to confine myself to soil erosion, or perhaps I should say soil erosion and soil conservation, but so little is being done in connection with soil conservation that there is not much to say about it. Of course, we realize that the present Minister is not directly responsible or has not up to now been responsible for this state of affairs as he only took over this post quite recently. The Department is in a shocking condition as the result of neglect and bad management in the past. Sir, I want to say straight away that that is no reflection on any of the officials. They can only carry out the Minister&#x2019;s policy, and they are doing their best under almost impossible conditions. In the past we have focussed the attention of this House and the Government on the deterioration that is taking place in this country in regard to our soil. We maintained and I still maintain that our soil is deteriorating at an increasing tempo. Our soil is deteriorating at a faster rate than the rate at which we are rehabilitating it.</p>

<p>I would like to remind the House that some 12 to 15 years ago it was estimated that we were losing our soil at the rate of 300 million tons per annum, and some three years ago the Deputy Minister of Agriculture told us that we were losing our soil at the rate of 400 million tons per annum. Since then we have had a drought. The veld has been denuded to a large extent; there is less grass and bush; the veld has become more bare, with the result that wind erosion and storm erosion are causing far more damage than in the past. The Government has not taken our warnings to heart, and I should not be at all surprized if the loss of soil to-day amounts to 500 million tons per annum. They have failed to tackle this problem seriously; they have failed to show drive, and we on this side and the vast majority of farmers outside have no confidence in this Government&#x2019;s effort or lack of effort in connection with this national danger. The soil will continue to erode until this Government is eroded away. Sir, in the past and again fairly recently, we put up a very strong case for a greater effort on the part of the Government to combat soil erosion. I pointed out that the Government effort was so puny that damage by soil erosion was getting more and more each year. I quoted authority after authority, the authority of leading farmers and farmers who hold positions in agricultural associations and the authority of senior officials of the Department to show what retrogression was taking place. I should like just to quote a few of these authorities. Mr. Coertze, the chairman of the Midlands Agricultural Union, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot help asking myself is the veld improving or deteriorating&#x003F;</block>

<p>A conservative statement. Mr. Bennie van der Merwe, chairman of the Cape Woolgrowers, said: &#x201C;No increase in wool production during the past 30 years due to the deterioration of pastures. We have a case for serious attention.&#x201D; Dr. Verbeek: &#x201C;No improvement in practice of over-grazing. The positon is now worse than before.&#x201D; Mr. Wouter van der Merwe, head of the Free State Agricultual Region: &#x201C;Natural grazing in North Cape in quality and quantity has deteriorated and damage will be irreparable.&#x201D; Then I quote the Soil Conservation Board: &#x201C;Gravely concerned about the destruction of these vitally <span class="col_277-278" refersTo="page_0157"/>important resources; it endangers the future of our country as a whole.&#x201D; Mr. J. P. van der Merwe, Director of Soil Conservation: &#x201C;The soil generally is in a worse condition than it was 20 years ago.&#x201D; Sir, so I could go on quoting prominent senior officials and prominent farmers who warned this Government as to what the position was with regard to soil erosion. Last year and the year before when we quoted these opinions, which are not our opnions, but the opinions of people who deal with this question continuously, the Minister&#x2019;s reply was: &#x201C;It is possible to exaggerate the dangers to agriculture.&#x201D; Sir, am I to believe that prominent, senior officials of the Department and prominent farmers would exaggerate the dangers to agriculture&#x003F; The Government is not prepared to face up to the realities in connection with this most important question. I do not think that the Government fully knows what is really taking place. In the past they have always blamed the droughts, but if these problems had been tackled in time, the effect of the drought would have been less severe than it actually was. That was the position two years ago. What is the position today&#x003F; I believe that it is still deteriorating at a much faster rate than the rate at which we are rehabilitating the soil. Sir, I want to read out a statement which was made only a matter of a month ago in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Injudicious soil cultivation could spell disaster for the agricultural potential of the Southern Cape, Mr. J. H. Stapelberg, officer-in-charge of the Outeniqua Experimental Farm said &#x2026; but continuous soil cultivation, with two crops a year, is destroying the soil structure completely. The soils are losing their friability and water-holding capacity and are becoming water-logged at times. Expensive fertilizer is being leached out rapidly. The real writing on the wall is the fact that wind erosion is increasing and dust storms are no longer rare.</block>

<p>A very important report is that of the Soil Conservation Board, and I quote from the Annual Report of the Board for the period 1.7.1965 to 30.6.1966 (final paragraph, page 1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board wishes to emphasize that the present crisis condition of the veld in the drought stricken areas cannot be attributed solely to the direct consequences of the present drought. The harmful grazing and veld management practices of the past, such as overtaxing the veld and continuous grazing instead of a system of rotational grazing which would give the veld a chance to rest, have in the course of years had such a cumulative deleterious effect of the veld that it could offer no resistance to this drought and has now reached the breaking point. Rain alone can no longer bring full recovery to this ruined veld.</block>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister knows what happened at Lindley recently where there was a conference attended by 150 delegates representing soil conservation committees. According to a newspaper report I have here &#x201C;Feelings sometimes ran high.&#x201D; Why&#x003F; Because these people are so frustrated. According to the report a certain official said he &#x201C;wanted to express his displeasure and frustration at the slow pace at which progress was made with soil conservation. He said this was mainly due to the scarcity of manpower.&#x201D; This is the position after all these years. Progress is too slow. We are losing the battle against soil erosion at a fast rate. I also have a very important report which appeared in a recent edition of an agricultural periodical which reads as. follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. S. J. du Plessis said in his opening address at the recent congress of the Eastern Cape Agricultural Union that progress with our soil conservation was so slow, and the rate of deterioration of our vegetation and soil so rapid, that the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services instructed his Department to give the highest priority to soil conservation during the coming five years.</block>

<p>The report continues as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. J. A. Dreyer, assistant chief of Agricultural Technical Services in the Free State recently said at Christiana that, although the Soil Conservation Act has been in force for 21 years, it is being applied in a disappointing fashion. Soil enjoys such a lot of publicity that it is unnecessary to go into details. Everyone who is interested in soil conservation realizes that progress is painfully slow.</block>

<p>I say I think this report is particularly important. Further on the article reads as follows, referring to a speech made by a certain person at Middelburg at the end of last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, the farmers in South Africa, have till now lived on the capital of our fatherland &#x2014;a fact which we have to acknowledge in shame &#x2026; (It was) also declared that unless there is a change in the disposition with which conservation farming is carried out, he would not hesitate to advise the Government to take much more drastic steps.</block>

<p>The article quotes him as using the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we do not act now, we will become an impoverished nation.</block>

<p>All these things were said by the former Minister of Agricultural Technical Services. He said that action must be taken now. I say that action should have been taken 20 years ago, and continuously since then. We have already lost for all time 25 per cent of our original soil fertility. That has gone, we can never regain it. It is estimated that the cost to our country in loss and damages amounts to R300 million per annum. Erosion and desiccation of <span class="col_279-280" refersTo="page_0158"/>the soil do not stand still and wait for conservation to overtake it. There can be no more tragic mistake than to assume that conservation campaigns can be planned on a long-term basis of unlimited time. We all realize a little footpath to-day may become a small sluit next year, and in ten years&#x2019; time it can become a huge donga. These things have to be tackled in time in order to save a tremendous amount of money.</p>

<p>What is the position to-day&#x003F; In a speech made last month an appeal was made to other bodies to follow the example of stimulating an awareness of the vital role of the country&#x2019;s soil. According to the report of the speech I have here, the speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Stressing the rapidly-growing demands on agriculture &#x2026; said that South Africa was already vulnerable in her agricultural resources, soil structure and climatic conditions. She would however double her population in 30 years. Loss of agricultural potential thus is no longer a matter of local importance, it has become a matter of national consequence.</block>

<p>The report continues by quoting the speaker verbatim&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because our soil is vulnerable and stability in agriculture is becoming an urgent necessity, we shall have to speed up the programme of adjustment. We will have to create a national awareness of the importance of constructive development and protection of our soil. Our task is to create the right attitude among all sectors of our population. Since the future of each of us is so directly tied to the condition and potential of the soil, veld and water resources, it is a task which we dare not leave to the other man.</block>

<p>It is clear we have to speed up this type of work. Mr. Speaker, do you know who said all these things at the meeting last month&#x003F; Nobody less than the present Minister of Agriculture. At last he has realized that something has got to be done to speed up this most important work. I wonder how &#x201C;kragdadig&#x201D; they will be about these matters. For 20 years they have shown no force, no drive whatever in this matter. What is more, the hon. the Minister has to a large extent been the nigger in the woodpile in this matter. The farmer cannot afford to withdraw grazing under the present scheme, because the hon. the Minister has been responsible to a large extent for the low incomes of many farmers due to his price fixation. He fixed the prices too low. the farmers do not possess the capital, and consequently they cannot undertake the soil conservation works in order to qualify for the subsidies. Their incomes are so low that they cannot even go in for loans, because with high bond rates of interest they have to pay, high overdraft interest rates they have to Day, and with redemption on the bonds having to be made, it is impossible for them to undertake additional loans which will mean long-term results, and they will not be able to meet their commitments. Therefore they cannot go in for loans to enable them to tackle these problems.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, it has been the case for quite long enough. Ever since this Government took over, the farmer has been in trouble. My experience is that every time we have a Nationalist government, the farmer is in trouble.</p>

<p>The crux of the matter is that the farmer cannot generate sufficient funds through his own operations to undertake the necessary work. We all know what a tremendous shortage of staff there is. I do not want to read out what the position is in that regard. Complaints are contained in the last annual report of the Soil Conservation Board. I want to say that the hon. the Minister must make greater use of farmers who are prepared to assist the extension or field officer. I know they do that to some extent, but the extent of their assistance is far too small. I remember the old soil erosion scheme of the 1930s under which farmers did the work. They went out, they planned the contour walls, took the necessary levels, they did all that work for a very small remuneration. Similar activities can be undertaken again on a much larger scale and it will be of tremendous assistance in getting the work done.</p>

<p>With regard to the scheme introduced some two years ago under which portions of a farm can be withdrawn from grazing, I wish to say that to my mind this is a good scheme in theory, but in practice it is not working out. I do not think that under present conditions a farmer can afford to withdraw a large portion of his farm if all he receives as subsidy for the withdrawal amounts to something like per cent on his capital investment. This applies particularly to the farmer who is bonded&#x2014; and most of them are bonded&#x2014;and who today has to pay very high rates of interest, owing to this Government&#x2019;s policy. He has to pay tremendously high rates of interest on overdrafts because of the Government&#x2019;s policy. He finds it impossible to come out on the subsidy being paid to-day. Now this scheme was introduced in September, 1966, for the first time, and the first applicants were accepted for a period of 20 months, two growing seasons. Last year when we discussed that, I warned the Minister that I did not think his scheme was going to work and I asked him how many farms were under the scheme. He replied that it was 1,000. It is 1,000 out of 120,000 farms. I made inquiries recently as to what the position was now. There are now, including those former farms, 1,160. In other words, during the year that started September, last year, only 160 have applied and have been accepted.</p>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not say that. But one must give him enough to encourage him to withdraw.</p>

<p>Why are we not making the necessary progress&#x003F; The primary function of a government in this case is to play its part at all times and to give the financial aid and technical assistance to the farmers. The delays are so frustrating that they are damping the farmers&#x2019; enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Let me read from a speech made by Mr. J. B. van der Merwe at Grootfontein:</p>

<block name="quote">One of the main reasons for the slow progress, in my humble opinion, is the irritating, time-wasting delays to get the conservation machinery to function in a district and on the farms. The everlasting delays everywhere and all the time! There is probably nothing to paralyse enthusiasm, willingness and drive to a greater extent than these delays.</block>

<p>That is an official of the Department. That is what he blames for the slow progress. The administrative duties, the extremely limited number of field officers leave little time for planning and instruction. I repeat, Sir. More farmers should be employed under the guidance of these extension or field officers and then more will be done. But there is a tremendous leeway that has to be made up. Let us take the Boland&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is alarming that in such an intensive agricultural region only 8,000 out of the 24,000 farms are being planned and that only 5 per cent of these 8,000 are fully planned. The reason for this is a lack of officers, especially those who do the field work in connection with soil conservation, said Mr. Walters.</block>

<p>In the 1966 report of the Soil Conservation Board of the Highveld region they point out that in 1957 they had 34 active officers. In 1966 they only had 16 and there were 57 positions that should have been filled. They have 16 officers to fill 57 positions. The position is getting worse and there are more and more resigning. In a small sub-region, the Middle Highveld, resignations took place at the following places: Heilbron in April, Senekal last August, Kroonstad last November and there are more to follow. So what use is it that we propagate amongst the people conservation methods, for example, by &#x201C;The festival of the soil&#x201D; which would normally be a good thing, if the work cannot be carried out&#x003F; We had a field officer for 700 farmers. I think there is now only one for about 1,000. The Government must get down to finding out where the bottlenecks are and replan and remove them.</p>

<p>I have said before that we must declare war on soil erosion. We spend round about R250 million annually on our defence&#x2014;we have no objection to that&#x2014;to prevent attacks from the outside enemies of our country. At the same time we are losing the battle against this dangerous enemy inside our country. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#visser">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>They proved it so ineffectively and found it so hot to handle that they suddenly dropped it and to-day moved onto less contentious ground. We admit that soil conservation is extremely important and that this House and this Government give all the attention they can, and spend all the money that is available, to tackle the problem of soil conservation to the best of their ability; it is a long-term problem which cannot be solved overnight.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, the United Party could not more clearly have shown its inability to make a success of the no-confidence debate over the past five years than by concentrating their attack on no more than 10 to 20 per cent of the aspects of Government policy. The entire balance they have left virtually untouched. <span class="col_283-284" refersTo="page_0160"/>[Interjections.] Their concluding statement last year was that the Budget solved no problems &#x2014;note carefully what they said&#x2014;and that this Minister would not be doing his proper duty until he had put a stop to the deterioration of the rand, in other words, of our entire currency. That was the hon. member for Pinetown. &#x201C;The deterioration of our entire currency&#x201D; were the words used by that side of the House in the last days of the debates. They omitted to say something about the improved international political image of this country, of this Government and its policy. I think, Mr. Speaker, that everyone who goes abroad will have to admit that not only has the political image of South Africa among its own inhabitants improved considerably in the past years&#x2014;the numbers on this side of the House prove it&#x2014;but its international political image has improved considerably and markedly and has never been as good as it is to-day. This is particularly the position in unofficial circles. I am referring to persons who do not move in Government circles, because these persons can often not do otherwise. I am speaking of the man who thinks for himself and is not led by particular circumstances in other countries which he has to take into account. I want to begin by just reading to you what has appeared in the <i>Spectator.</i> The writer wrote as follows from America&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would be splendid to be able to say after 250 years that the racial situation here on the political island called the Deep South is being tidied up and that the Blacks and Whites are learning how to get on well together. But the Southern Americans by and large have not. A few of them living in enlightened pockets have. The very great bulk of them have not. What is more, the situation surrounding those pockets is worse than it has been in perhaps 50 to 60 years.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House may safely say, if we consider how South Africa has fared in the past 20 years, that there are few countries in the world where the people have succeeded to such an extent to co-exist and to maintain prosperity as in South Africa. And in South Africa there are greater problems, on account of the composition of the population, than in most other countries of the world. Our political image is stronger and is as good as can be expected in the circumstances in which South Africa finds itself. The United Party&#x2019;s political image is internationally at the lowest possible ebb. [Interjections.] Everyone knows how we are entering into relationships with the rest of Africa, for example with Malawi and with the Protectorates. Even the <i>Star</i> of 30th October said: &#x201C;Uganda softening towards Southern Africa.&#x201D; We are constantly improving our relationships with the rest of Africa.</p>

<p>But that is not all. Let us consider our military strength. No one has mentioned the work done by this Government to make South Africa militarily strong. No one has criticized it. It is one of the cornerstones of the policy of any government. They have kept silent about it. We all know what it is. But, Sir, let me read to you what has appeared in an international publication sponsored by U.N.O. They had this to say about South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<p>Sir, a great deal of the legislation introduced by hon. Ministers on this side of the House to place labour relationships on a proper footing was fought tooth and nail by that side of the House. Now they claim the credit for themselves. They were too lacking in good deeds when they governed. But I shall come to that later.</p>

<p>I want to read something else to you, Sir. Mr. De Kock goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that our fine record of industrial peace is based on the fact that our industrial-legal system and the way it is administered accord so well with the character of our people.</block>

<p>This is what Mr. Alan de Kock, who is an industrialist, said about this Government&#x2019;s handling of labour relationships. Sir I can also show <span class="col_285-286" refersTo="page_0161"/>you how this Government has laid sound foundations and done sterling work in the development of infra-structures which that side of the House shamefully neglected in the years from 1938 to 1948. Those infra-structures are the foundation upon which private initiative helped to bring about the great economic progress made in South Africa. Sir, I need not refer you to the great economic progress that has been made&#x2014;I shall come to that later, and I shall in particular compare the progress made under this Government with the progress made under that side of the House. One of the most important tasks of the Government was to regulate human relationships in this country, to place on a sound footing the co-existence of all peoples in Southern Africa, and as far as possible to provide a decent living for each population group. Members on that side of the House have in the past few days laid special emphasis on economic apartheid or economic integration. But they forget what the Government has done to bring about political apartheid in the country. It is a difficult task. Tremendous progress has been made in spite of the greatest opposition from that side of the House. They also forget the progress and the achievements in the field of social apartheid. Now they are tackling the question of economic integration. But the difficulty is this: They cannot understand the concept of &#x201C;economic integration&#x201D;. They see economic integration purely as a matter of numbers, as the presence of an increasing number of Bantu in the white areas of South Africa in recent years.</p>

<p>Previous Prime Ministers and the present Minister of Bantu Administration have told us repeatedly that the presence of Bantu in South Africa does not constitute economic integration.

<p>I am not playing with words. The non-Whites, too, do not have the right to own and cultivate ground along with the Whites. If those things are done, then it is economic integration. But the fact that workers come from the reserves and from other countries, as is the case in Europe, to work here, is not economic integration. This Government does not accept that.

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is a ridiculous figure. That hon. member ought to be ashamed to use such figures. They ask what it will cost, but they ought to know. When they declared war in 1939, did they not tell the country what it would cost in lives and money to win the war. They did it from year to year, as this Government is also doing. They should understand the language of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. It is everyday usage. Why do they now want us to give something which they themselves did not give&#x003F; It is an equivalent case. This side of the House is waging war against poverty in the underdeveloped areas. This side of the House is waging war against any attempt by that side of the House to integrate the Whites and the Bantu politically and economically in this country. Listening to them I can imagine what will happen if this Government should do what they say. They think that one only has to pump a lot of money into the Bantu areas and that there will then be development. That is what they think. Have they not learnt from Great Britain&#x2019;s experience&#x003F; What did Great Britain experience in Africa when she wanted to take that course&#x003F; It was the greatest economical d&#x00E9;b&#x00E2;cle you could imagine. Great Britain found that you must first have the material development of human beings. You must develop the human being, because human development must be coupled with material development. That side of the House wants to build the walls without laying the foundation. They want to erect a roof before the walls have been built, instead of laying a proper foundation. This Government is laying that proper foundation and it takes time to lay that foundation. That side of the House also fought the border areas development policy of this side of the House tooth and nail. They are virtually alone in that. The Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Industries, Tucsa and other labour organizations accept the development of border areas and the development of under-developed areas in principle. They differ here and there as to its implementation, but that is understandable. They accept it. I can mention many other instances where it has also been accepted. Let me read to you. Sir, what the Witwatersrand Christian Council says, according to <i>The Star</i> of 4th January, 1967:</p>

<block name="quote">It is true that many Africans still maintain their tribal affiliation and come to work in <span class="col_287-288" refersTo="page_0162"/>the urban areas, returning home for long periods. If these people could earn a living with a comparable wage in the country, more of them would prefer to work nearer their homes.</block>

<p><i>The Star</i> even contains a report which reads as follows: &#x201C;Sudan sets up border industries.&#x201D; That is not all. Members on that side of the House do not always agree with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I can mention at least four members on that side of the House who have declared themselves in favour of the development of border areas, including the hon. member for Hillbow. Let me read what one of them, the hon. member for East London (North), said. He said in the House of Assembly on 16th September, 1966&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is disturbing to us on this side of the House is that in the past the industries have been concentrating too much in certain areas. We believe that if the Government is sincere as regards the border industries, they had better get on with the job and stop talking such a lot.</block>

<p>The hon. member gave that advice to the wrong side of the House. It is advice he should give to his hon. Leader and to several of his frontbenchers. I should like him to get up and repudiate what he said here. On this matter there is dissension in that party.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to one further aspect, and that is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said about the border areas. According to the <i>Cape Times</i> of 6th February, 1967, he said, while opposing the border areas, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was, firstly, the question of the establishment of border areas which were likely to cause inflationary tendencies in the economy.</block>

<p>This is one of the reasons they advanced against the development of border areas. I want to refer the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to none other than Lord Keynes, the great English economist, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where unemployment is as high as 4 per cent a year, money pumped in to utilize those resources should pay off in higher output without inflationary strain.</block>

<p>I hope that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will stop using that foolish argument in connection with the development of border areas.</p>

<p>I want to suggest that this Government accomplished one of its greatest feats in the economic field. We know however since 1948 the United Party has proclaimed from the rooftops that the Government has too many ideologies; it only gives attention to ideology, but not to the basic needs of the people. The economic achievements of this Government are far above the average of the Government of that side when they were in power. I want to mention a few figures. One concerns inflation. The average depreciation of money during their period, from 1938 to 1948, was 4.75 per cent per annum. Under this Government it was 4.3 per cent per annum, an improvement of 10 per cent per annum. Work it out over the number of years. From the end of June to the end of December last year there was only a rise of .002, from 1.126 to 1.128, and then those hon. members speak of the deterioration of the rand. That has been their story all these years, the deterioration of our economy, the collapse of our economy. Up to last year they said so, but this year they conveniently kept silent about it in this debate. Then Minister Hofmeyr said that, as past experience had shown, the danger of inflation tended to become greater in postwar years than in war years. Their own Minister said that. Mr. Oppenheimer has said, according to the <i>Cape Argus</i>: &#x201C;State hailed for inflation fight.&#x201D; He praised the Government for its fight against inflation. Here is a comparison drawn by the <i>Financial Times,</i> under the heading &#x201C;Prices in Great Cities&#x201D;, in November, 1967, and according to that statement the conclusion is &#x201C;Johannesburg a cheap city still&#x201D;. Then the hon. members opposite speak of the deterioration of the rand. Where has there been any deterioration in our currency&#x003F; Under their Government the value of money depreciated more rapidly than it has done under this Government.</p>

<p>But let me take the standard of living, the increase in our standard of living. It is the sum total of all our economic activities. In the past few years since we became a Republic, the average increase in the Republic was 4.3 per cent <i>per capita</i> per annum, after provision has been made for all increases in the cost of living. Under their Government it was only 2.95 per cent per annum, an improvement of 46 per cent on their performance. Where does the ideology come from which they talk of&#x003F; We have an ideology and we are proud of it, but in spite of that the National Party has raised the country&#x2019;s standard of living considerably, compared with what it was in the time of the United Party Government. There are the gold reserves. When this Government came into power in 1948, it had to take action to check the drop in the gold reserves. In 1948 the ratio of statutory reserves to total commitments to the public was 31 per cent. It was very low. In 1967 it was 45 per cent. This shows how much better this Government has governed than that one did. Our exports are another factor. In 1948 the export of goods, excluding gold, represented only 30 per cent of the total imports. We know how that side of the House stresses the importance of exports. In their time it was only 30 per cent, but in 1967 it was 70 per cent. It has more than doubled. Take the national debt, the last example I want to use. In 1938, when they began, the relevant figure was 70.4 per cent. In 1948, when they went out of office, when the people rejected them, it was 71.6 per cent, that is to say, the ratio of the national debt to our gross inland revenue. In 1966 it <span class="col_289-290" refersTo="page_0163"/>decreased to 46.9 per cent under this Government. What has this Government, with its ideologies and all, not achieved for South Africa in the material field&#x003F; I can quote many examples in this way. Here in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 14th July, 1967, it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The country&#x2019;s economic achievements since 1961 have surprised the world and South Africans themselves.</block>

<p>In the <i>Financial Times</i> of England we find the heading &#x201C;Strength in Isolation&#x201D;. So I can go on and refer to France, America and England. Here they say: &#x201C;South Africa is Britain&#x2019;s best investment,&#x201D; and in America they say: &#x201C;South Africa safe for investment&#x201D;. This is the image of South Africa which the National Party has built up over a period of 20 years. I believe that the population of South Africa, on the basis of the achievements of this party, will have the fullest confidence to return the National Party to power for another 20 years, and that for the next 20 years the Opposition will find themselves in even greater darkness than they do at the moment.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. LINDSAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Florida has certainly disappointed me this afternoon. I have great respect for his views normally as an economist, but to-day he spoke as if he was trying to say something in which he had no belief at all. He talks about the war, but he knows very well that the one debit factor about a war is the expense involved in it and the accompanying inflation, as America is now experiencing, and he also knows that the only credit there is from a war is the subsequent development which takes place after a war. as happened after the last war, which are now reflected in the figures given by him. He also knows very well that the success of South Africa is due to the very failure of the Government to carry out its policy. He talks about labour relations and industrial legislation. Where does that legislation come from&#x003F; From the United Party when it was in power. No, I think, quite apart from the speeches made from this side of the House, if any further justification were required for this motion, it could not have been more clearly given than by the floundering of the Government members. It is quite amazing, even amongst senior members and Ministers, to see how they do not even know their own policy. They do not even know how its development to Self-Government has taken place. That has been debunked completely, and not only has that been debunked but also the illusion that the general public, and even those hon. members, know what their policy is. I think it is most important that we understand and always remember that these portions of South Africa which are going to be cut away are going to become independent. They are not going to remain reserves or homelands, but they are going to become independent states. Our South African Bantu labour will therefore become foreign labour, and that is the crux of the whole matter. I have to quote none other than the hon. member for Heilbron, who said, when he was in charge of the commission into foreign labour&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact nevertheless remains that foreign Bantu labour has many disadvantages and that it is always a risk to establish one&#x2019;s labour force out of the ranks of foreign nationals who, being prohibited persons under this country&#x2019;s immigration laws, cannot acquire permanent residence and who in many instances become undesirable persons.</block>

<p>He is the very man who does not even know what a migratory worker is, who says they will keep them in the white area; they do not have to go back to the homelands; they do not belong there. How can a man be a migratory worker and how can he serve a contract for 12 months and then have to return somewhere if he does not have to go to his homeland&#x003F;</p>

<p>I will not deal with the ideology. That has been amply covered by the hon. members on this side. I do not want to deal with the policy. I think that has been more than covered by hon. members on this side. But I do want to deal with some practical results, something that is happening in a true homeland. I want to talk about a homeland, a true homeland, and not one that by a trick of fate happens to be a developing area such as we have in the case of Rosslyn or the whole of Natal, but the land of the Amaxhosa, the Ciskei and the Transkei and the Corridor, the border area between the two. We have there the two areas, the Ciskei and the Transkei, and between them we have this corridor, the northern boundary of which is the Kei and the southern boundary of which is goodness knows what, because we cannot get the Government to determine it. However, let that be beside the point for the moment. What is the position in that area&#x003F; Because this is a true example of a true homeland, one half of which already has self-government. You have 1.8 million Bantu living in that area, giving it a density of over 85 per square mile, the highest density in South Africa, barring only the Witwatersrand and the Orange Free State goldfields. That is the first point. The second is that there are over 3,000,000 Xhosas in South Africa, of whom only 1.8 million live there, which means that 1&#x00BC; million are outside. We know that it is in such a state at the moment that that area cannot even cope with the people who are there, excluding the natural growth, and according to Government spokesmen we are still going to see that these people who are outside are put back there, almost doubling that density. Sir, we have heard from my hon. Leader about the necessity for consolidation. Of course, the hon. member for Heilbron suggests that consolidation is no longer necessary and he quotes of all places Britain: Britain with her islands is not consolidated and she controls her outfit very well! After all, why then cannot Matanzima <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_0164"/>control his outfit and the Ciskei and everything else that goes with it&#x2014;Whittlesea, Glen Gray, Herschel etc.&#x2014;and then I do not even mention the minor ones like Goshen, Lesseyton and Mgwali. How are those islands going to be controlled in South Africa&#x2014;all in white South Africa&#x003F; Sir, one just has to look at the map to appreciate the absurdity of that statement. I will not even ask what the cost is going to be. We have been told that the cost does not matter, but I would like to have at least an estimate of the cost.</p>

<p>We have been told that homeland growth is dependent on agricultural and industrial development. A failure in either of these is going to be a brake on the other. We are all aware of the low development in the Kei area, primarily in the Ciskei. Agriculture in all its spheres, fishing, mining, all the primary industries constitute the fundamental weakness because through it we have the low purchasing power and the low division of labour and hence our small markets and low level of trade. The result is the low opportunity for investment in secondary industry. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has given the figures of development in the Bantu areas. We must remember that those figures are for all the Bantu areas in South Africa and therefore relative. We can say that the Ciskei, for example, produces 131,000 bags of maize annually, but we must not forget that there are half a million people, which means that there is not even one bag of maize annually for an individual.</p>

<p>Not even half. Sir, I endorse the comments of my Leader that the officials in the Transkei and in the Ciskei are doing their very best to help the people along but they are completely hamstrung by Pretoria with too many ministers and too much red tape. Despite all their efforts, productivity is still standing still there; the graph is a straight line, and the population is increasing all the time. Sir, every economist has told us that in order to effect development we have to have capital. We want to know what amount is available and where it is going to come from. We have to improve the productivity of this capital by an increase of the ratio of Land to labour which means either increasing the land or reducing the labour. The Bantu have by natural means tried to improve this ratio by going out of the land themselves. We have been given the figure for the Transkei migrant workers. The position in the Ciskei is even worse because it is in a worse condition. But, of course, now the Government is even changing that and going against economic theory. Then they think that they are going to put the matter right. They are prepared, as we have heard, to inhibit the growth of South Africa, to give these people no outlet at all. and what amazes me even more is that they then talk about respect. The Bantu must have his own area for development where he can give full expression to himself so that he can have self-respect. Employment, which means being paid for what you do, which gives you self-respect, is being taken away by moving a man from his employment and putting him where there is no employment for him. They put him in an area where they have to provide the housing and where they have to provide the subsistence as well, and then we expect self-respect to be maintained.</p>

<p>Sir, our danger is not what the hon. member for Florida suggested, namely Communism, and that therefore we have to build up our defence so terrifically. Our biggest danger is this poverty encouraged by this very policy that we are stuck with here. They say that the way to solve our problem is to establish border industries. What success has been achieved in this regard&#x003F; The hon. member has quoted the success achieved in Pretoria at Rosslyn and in portions of Natal, but what is there in the Ciskei, the one area where there must be border industry development&#x003F; Virtually no development. I can do no more than to quote a statement made at a farmers&#x2019; association meeting in the Kei by a farmer from Kei Road who said: &#x201C;We were promised that there would be industries established for these people. Where are these industries&#x003F; I am sure that even the Government is not aware of the influx that is taking place here.&#x201D; Sir, that is quite clear. The Government has no concept of the influx that is taking place. We have heard the discussion here about these different villages. Let us start with Mdantsane. Mdantsane is a closed township which is only there to replace Duncan Village, and now it has been opened for the returnees from the Western Cape as well. Five per cent of the houses have to be allocated for them. Last year when we asked the hon. the Minister what the population of Mdantsane was he said 5.300 families because there were 5.300 houses. Sir, there are 6,743 houses now. Does he still say that there are 6,743 families&#x003F; Because if he does, I can assure him that I will give him the population figure for Mdantsane, a figure of 67,000, which will be nearer than any official figure that he can give. In the same way I can give him a further shock. They say that there is no unemployment or that there is very limited unemployment. In Mdantsane certainly there is unemployment. But I will give him my figure. My figure is 30 per cent unemployment in Mdantsane and he cannot deny it. Whatever figure he may give, my figure will still be closer to the factual position.</p>

<p>Then, of course, we also have the statement by the hon. the Deputy Minister who says that he will not return anybody to the Ciskei if there is no employment for him. Can you imagine it. Sir&#x003F; He will not return anybody to the Ciskei who has not got employment, when all this unemployment already exists. Why these villages therefore&#x2014;Sada. Ilige, Mngqesha&#x003F; These villages are all being developed at the moment, and they are not just for pensioners as was mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister. Great exception was taken to the fact that they were called refugee <span class="col_293-294" refersTo="page_0165"/>camps. Why the exception&#x003F; Are they not villages established primarily to accommodate people who are taken from here and who are kept there until they can be placed, if ever&#x003F; They are border refugee camps. Are they not housed there and are they not fed there&#x003F; Some of these villages are planned to hold more than 20,000. I ask again: What must these people do&#x003F; Of course, the hon. the Deputy Minister says that there are going to be 108 of these villages by 1970. They are going to house more than three-quarters of a million; that is his figure, and we know that we can add to that. What are they gong to do&#x003F; He goes on to give detailed figures as to the requirements of these different villages in the commercial field&#x2014;the number of butchers, the number of general dealers, the number of caf&#x00E9;s etc. Sir, does he not know what is going on in South Africa&#x003F; Does he not know of a Bantu Investment Corporation and of a Xhosa Development Corporation, which are buying these very places from the Whites for the Bantu and whose big problem to-day is that they have not even got managers for those places, let alone owners&#x003F;</p>

<p>Employment without houses is bad enough, but housing without employment is catastrophic. Is it any wonder that we are called the most depressed area in South Africa&#x003F; Sir, I just want to say that we have a subsistence economy. On top of that there are the droughts and you can see to-day what they are like. You have a falling death rate and a population growth&#x2014;growing naturally and, by Government pressure, too high for a revitalized or extended rural economy to absorb. That. Sir, means that the concealed unemployment is becoming overt unemployment. That is why we find people roaming the streets, and burglary, stock and produce theft fast developing into an explosive situation. Sir, the Government is giving effect to a policy notable for its exemptions and exceptions, unproductive expenditure and lack of appreciation of priorities. The hon. the Prime Minister has said: Let us see what the people say in Bloemfontein, Pretoria West and Swellendam.

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In the main I want to confine myself to the charge made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that the measures taken by this Government in the monetary, fiscal and economic fields were unsuccessful, and that they are going to lead to our downfall and economic deterioration. I want to point out that South Africa has experienced a period of economic growth which has been unparalleled in the history of the country. It is no wonder that periodicals have even referred to &#x201C;the five fabulous years since 1961&#x201D;. But it is not only in periodicals that statements of this kind are being made; that fact is also being emphasized by overseas businessmen coming to this country. There are visitors almost every day who are interested in investing in this country. They are interested in investing here because they know that our economy is growing and that the prospects here are very favourable. In addition, they know that they are dealing with a stable Government, which is a very important factor. They also know that we have had industrial peace in this country, something which is practically unknown, and also unparalleled in many other countries. The same confidence which is being displayed by countries abroad, is also being expressed by domestic entrepreneurs in South Africa.</p>

<p>It is after all the main task of the Government to try and maintain a high rate of development here so that we can provide work for our large and growing labour market, but at the same time we must also raise the standard of living of our population. When we consider that the real net growth during the past six years, even after the rate of inflation and the increase in prices has been taken into account, has been 6 per cent per year, we have reason to feel satisfied. It is higher than that of any country in Europe for example, in fact, it is higher than the figure in any comparable country. It has been calculated that our growth during the past six years has been between 6 and 7 per cent. It is high, even higher than we calculated in the economic development programme. In that programme we envisaged that with our available capital, with our manpower and with the utilization of our production sources, we would have been able to maintain an average rate of growth of 5&#x00BD; per cent. Even this figure is higher than it has been in the past. I want to concede that agriculture has played an important role as far as the growth during the past few years is concerned, a role which has perhaps been greater than it was in the past. We hoped that the rate of growth would be less. This year it may even be less than in the past.</p>

<p>It is clear that this rate of growth of 6 per cent is too high, and this Government did in fact take deliberate steps to try and reduce the tempo of this rate of growth. That is why it is to be welcomed that there is a deceleration in growth in certain sectors of our economy. This is what we want, so that the pressure on labour and capital in this country can decrease and so that we can once again develop a regular and average rate of growth. There are, as I have said, healthy signs in various sectors that the rapid growth and the pressure are diminishing but an even further improvement has to be made. A phenomenon which I want to refer to specifically is that although the Government has taken steps to try and reduce the pressure on prices, there has nevertheless been no unemployment. The country&#x2019;s unemployment figure is practically the same as it was at the beginning of 1967, after which the Government adopted strict measures. It is clear therefore <span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_0166"/>that we have in fact succeeded in our aims. We were able to maintain this high level of development although drastic fiscal and other measures were adopted to curb this rate of growth. We also succeeded in reducing the rate of increase in the cost of living considerably. It is quite obvious therefore that the Government has been successful in its measures. That is why I want to refer specifically to what happened in regard to the cost of living. The fact is that although there has been a major increase in the price index during the past three to four years&#x2014;in 1964 it was 4 per cent, in 1965 3.2 per cent and in 1966 3.8 per cent&#x2014;it appears that the increase in costs last year was only 1.8 per cent.</p>

<p>We have therefore succeeded&#x2014;and this is really an achievement&#x2014;in confining the increase to 1.8 per cent, i.e. less than the 2 per cent which is normally considered to be a reasonable increase in a growing country. We are therefore in the position that the cost of living is not increasing nearly as rapidly as in the past. When we consider the price index since June last year, we see that, even if we calculate it on an annual basis, the increase in our cost of living has been a mere .3 per cent. That means that the increase is less than that of any other country in the world. As far as our wholesale prices are concerned, too, we find that there has in fact been a decrease during the past six months. It appears therefore that as far as the combating of the increasing cost of living is concerned, the Government has met with considerable success. Whereas the price of housing increased considerably in 1966, it was only about one third as much in 1967. We find the same trend as far as transport and foodstuffs are concerned. I must say that in this period of increase, our industries, particularly the manufacturers of clothing and footwear, have made an important contribution to keeping the cost of living down. In that sector there has been practically no increase.</p>

<p>The Government also took steps to relax import control. This has contributed to the development of keener competition in South Africa. But the striking fact is that our imports have decreased over the past few months, in spite of the above-mentioned relaxation. This is an indication that the domestic buying power and consumption are decreasing. Our exports are still increasing considerably.</p>

<p>Reference was made here to wage claims. It is true that appeals were made to workers and trade unions to manifest responsibility as far as their wage claims were concerned. It was requested that increased wages should be accompanied by greater productivity and that workers should not be unreasonable. The Government has been reproached for having taken these steps, but it was essential to have made that appeal. That appeal was successful and contributed to the fact that new factors, factors which could have had the effect of increasing the cost of living, were not introduced into our economy. Wages were not frozen, as in other countries. It was also said here that it should be noticed how the worker&#x2019;s position has deteriorated under this Government. That was part of the charge made here. The fact is that even if we go back as far as 1958 and draw comparisons between the average income of the factory worker, the mine worker and the Central Government employees and the increase in the consumer price index, we find that the factory worker&#x2019;s wages increased by 47 per cent, that of the mine workers by 44 per cent, and that of the Central Government employees by 41 per cent, whereas the consumer price index increased by only 18 per cent. That indicates that the worker in this country, in spite of increases in prices, also received his fair share in regard to increased wages. I went even further and tried to determine what had happened during the past few years.</p>

<p>The latest available information indicates the wages paid in these sectors up to September of last year. When we compare those wages with the number of labourers, then it appears that the average wage in the mining industry, and that includes White and non-White, up to September of last year, increased from R494 to R557 in comparison with those of 1966. In the mining industry this figure is lower than the figure in other sectors because there is so much Bantu labour in this sector. For the worker in the mining industry this did mean an average increase of R61 however. In the manufacturing industry the corresponding figures are R1,063 and R1,160, an increase of R97 per worker. In the construction industry we also find an increase: There the average wage of the worker increased by R147. This is an indication that during this period, while there was inflation, the position of the labourer did not deteriorate; on the contrary, his position improved considerably. It appears therefore that we were quite right in making an appeal like that to our workers, and that the worker in South Africa played a part in enabling us to return to this measure of normality. He helped to curb effectively these abnormal price increases with which we have had to deal during the past few years. The Government is determined to continue with these steps which it took to keep that rate down. These steps may not be popular ones. In fact, they have already been exploited by the Opposition for political gain. But they were aimed at obtaining a greater measure of price stability, and the indications are that the Government&#x2019;s measures have been successful.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to another aspect mentioned here, i.e. the devaluation which has taken place and its possible effect on certain sectors of our economy, particularly agriculture, as well as certain industries. We have been asked here what we are going to do about this. It is well known that the Opposition has lent its support to the Government in regard to its decision on the British devaluation. According to them that was the right step to take. Nevertheless they referred to the sectors which are suffering as a result of devaluation and how they may perhaps have <span class="col_297-298" refersTo="page_0167"/>been better off if we had also devalued. The hon. the Minister of Finance announced immediately that investigations would be made into those sectors which were being prejudiced. He made the following statement in that respect (<i>translation</i>)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nevertheless certain of our agricultural export industries will perhaps find it difficult to retain their markets in the devalued countries without increasing their prices considerably. The Government is aware of this possibility and will consider suitable measures in order to help solve the problems of these industries in deserving cases. Certain South African industries may also be threatened by disruptive competition as a result of cheaper imports from countries which have devalued. In such cases the Government will be prepared to consider taking protective steps.</block>

<p>This was announced a day after the British Government decided to devalue. Since then we have been determining which of these industries and agricultural sectors are being prejudiced. The effect of devaluation could not have been foreseen and determined immediately. The degree of adjustment or assistance necessary could not have been determined at that stage. That is why negotiations have subsequently taken place with the bodies concerned and they have submitted their problems to the Government. I do not want to go into detail. The canning industry, the canners of fruit and vegetables, are faced with serious problems. Perhaps this industry is responsible for having created its own problems because the various concerns in the industry could not work together as far as their overseas markets were concerned. Most of their exports go abroad, and now we find that the independent canners in this country are competing and undercutting one another in the overseas markets. By doing so they are undermining the economy of their own industry. They, too, are faced with particular problems as a result of devaluation. I have held discussions with them. We have passed an Act to establish a board for the canning industry. At the request of the canners this Act has not yet been put into effect, but as a result of the discussions, they have now agreed to this Act being put into effect. This board will be constituted as soon as the commencement of the Act is announced. Unfortunately this board cannot do anything about this year&#x2019;s problems. The board will first try to reach an agreement as far as next year&#x2019;s marketing is concerned. The canning industry is therefore faced with a major problem this year. They are faced with this difficulty because they have sold this year&#x2019;s crop in advance for sterling. The result of devaluation has been that they are suffering major losses because they are being paid in sterling.</p>

<p>They are not the only ones to have been heavily struck. Quite a number of other exporters also sold in sterling instead of stipulating that they be paid in rands and cents. They even sold to Europe and stipulated that they be paid in sterling. Consequently they are suffering considerable losses. They could have protected themselves against this commercial risk. They could have insured themselves against possible changes in the exchange rates.</p>

<p>Problems are also being experienced by the sectors concerned with fruit juices, frozen vegetables, meat products, yeast, deciduous fruits, sugar, liquor, coffee, molasses, sweets, starches, certain metals, etc. I have here a long list of firms which have already discussed their problems with us. The merits of these representations are now being investigated in conjunction with the Departments of Finance, Agriculture, Trade and Industries, as well as Forestry in order to see what can be done to help them in their particular situations. I can therefore give the assurance that, as far as these bodies which have in fact been prejudiced are concerned, thorough investigations are at this stage being made into their problems, the extent of those problems, and what can be done to support them. Devaluation has confronted us with problems, but I am convinced that it was a step which is in the interests of most of South Africa. And that is why it has been supported to this extent by the private sector, as well as by the organized bodies. Britain was forced to devalue in order to try and restore its unsound economy. It had problems with its balance of payments, and a great measure of unemployment. When it was forced to negotiate large foreign loans in order to rectify its position, speculation against the pound took place. This assumed such proportions that Britain was obliged to devalue in order to rectify its own position. South Africa, as was not the case in other years, did not follow suit. And I think it was a step forwards towards freeing our rand from the chronically sick British pound. I hope that Britain will succeed in recovering, because there are already speculations as to whether she will be able to remain on her feet or whether a further devaluation will not be necessary. But we also know that this effect and the advantage devaluation gives Britain will have been wiped out again within two or at the most three years. Then the position will be equal again. The fact that it was not necessary for us to devalue and that our economy was strong enough to allow us to refrain from following Britain is proof that we have come of age in the economic sphere as well. The rand is standing on its own feet and it is a rand and a monetary unit in its own right. I also trust it will be accepted to an increasing extent and that in future our exporters will compete and that they will stipulate that payments should be made in rands and not in the monetary units of other countries. It is the normal custom for exporters to stipulate that they be paid in their own monetary units. That is an example which we can definitely follow here. It is important that certain or our competitors did not devalue. That strengthened our own position. But we were in this strong position that we were one of those countries which decided at <span class="col_299-300" refersTo="page_0168"/>an early stage what we were going to do, and our decision had a good effect on other countries and perhaps contributed to the fact that they did not devalue.</p>

<p>South Africa&#x2019;s exporters have therefore found themselves in an unfavourable position in certain respects. But it is an unfavourable position which will soon disappear. I am convinced that the steps which we have now taken to refrain from devaluing were in the interests of South Africa and that is the very reason why we are experiencing such a great measure of confidence in our own future. That is why we see headlines such as: &#x201C;South Africa heads for boomlet&#x201D;; and, &#x201C;Optimism sweeps industry, says reporter&#x201D;. These are only a few of the indications. They are to be found at home as well as abroad. We know that if we continue to strengthen South Africa economically, in order to establish stability here, it will not only be to our advantage at home, it will also strengthen us in more than one sphere. I want to refer here to the <i>Financial Times&#x2019; Survey of South Africa</i> of 25th September, 1967. Here the following is said, under the title: &#x201C;Strength in Isolation&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Nations General Assembly opened last week with a report from U Thant calling on South Africa&#x2019;s main trading partners to take more efficient measures to persuade the South African Government to abandon its present course. It was a token gesture, an almost ritual plea, which was ignored by the international press for the sufficient reason that no one, including U Thant, can to-day seriously believe either that the governments which trade with South Africa are going to do anything of this sort, or that the South African Government has the slightest intention of turning aside from its present policies. The point is clear: South Africa is safe, at least in the short term. And the short term seems to be getting longer and longer with every month that passes. In the 18 months since the <i>Financial Times</i> last published a major survey of the Republic, South Africa&#x2019;s position has been consolidated on almost every front.</block>

<p>That is the finding overseas. And I am convinced that nothing has as yet happened here &#x2014;in spite of the strict measures which the Government had to take in order to rectify our economy&#x2014;to undermine the confidence abroad as well as at home, in the economic and financial policy of this Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs has just told us a few things in regard to the effect of devaluation on some of our export produce, particularly agricultural produce, etc. We want to thank the hon. the Minister for the fact that he stated that each case would be considered on its own merits and that they were already aware of the problems confronting those people. Of course that is nothing new. The hon. the Minister of Finance has already made an announcement to that effect on a previous occasion. Nevertheless we owe the hon. the Minister a vote of thanks for the fact that he stated that they would investigate those matters thoroughly. But there is no doubt that these people are going to be confronted with problems and that they will have to suffer losses. And I think that the fruit farmers, the exporters of grapes and the canners, are all tremendously concerned at the fact that they are going to suffer losses. But the hon. the Minister told us that they had succeeded during the past year or two in bringing down the upward trend of the cost of living. Well now, one is satisfied with the small things which are received from time to time. But the hon. the Minister did not deny that the cost of living had in fact increased and had increased considerably during the past few years. We are glad that it did not increase as much as it did on previous occasions. But the cost of living is still being felt to-day. And it was this very Government which promised the South African nation in 1948 that they were the people who had the solution to the increasing cost of living. And since that time not one year has gone by in which we have had a lower cost of living in South Africa than we had in that year when they took over. The hon. the Minister was also forced to tell us that he welcomed the fact that there had been a downward trend in the development of South Africa. There must definitely be a downward trend in the development of South Africa if we want to combat inflation. But, would a downward trend in the development of South Africa have been necessary if this Government had paid early heed to the advice of this side of the House and if they had not given the nation of South Africa ridiculous advice by saying, &#x201C;Spend for prosperity,&#x201D; when they knew that there was insufficient manpower in South Africa&#x003F; And the hon. the Minister knows that. It was one of the fundamental reasons why we have inflation in South Africa. It is because the possibilities for development in this country could not be adjusted to the quantity of manpower and trained manpower in South Africa. And the hon. the Minister and his Government will in future have to struggle with inflation again unless they pay attention to this problem, namely whether South Africa will have sufficient trained manpower for future development. That is the position, and unless the Government gives some attention to that problem, we will never solve the problem of inflation in South Africa. [Interjections.]</p>

It is the fact that we are and have been forgetting our isolationist politics. But yesterday afternoon we had to hear from the former hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs that he would continue with his attacks on the American Field Service.

<p>The hon. Chief Whip must please give me a chance now. The hon. the Minister of Health then quoted to us from a book by Professor Edwin Munger in which it is stated what a danger it would be to South Africa if we should continue to participate in that service. That service has been in progress in South Africa for quite a few years now. We have already sent quite a number of young Afrikaans and English speaking men and women to America under this scheme. We have also had a number of their young men and women in our country. Now I wonder in how many cases the hon. the Minister of Health has held discussions with those young men and women who have had that experience and who have participated in the American field Scholarships. He quoted what Professor Munger said, but I can quote what Mr. Barry Goldwater said. And Mr. Barry Goldwater received a great deal of support in the person of the Minister of Health when he was a candidate for the American Presidency a few years ago. What did Mr. Barry Goldwater say when he was in South Africa a few weeks ago&#x003F; According to <i>Die Burger</i> of 12th December, 1967, he had the following to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

The hon. member does not want to accept Mr. Goldwater&#x2019;s words. He is accepting Professor Munger&#x2019;s word. Now I want to ask the hon. member: Will he accept the word of Advocate Dawid De Villiers&#x003F; I think every South African should be extremely proud of a man like Advocate De Villiers, because he was the man responsible for and who helped us to win the South-West Africa case. I think he rendered just as good a service to this country as a man such as Professor Chris Barnard has done. And what did he say about this scheme&#x003F; He said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the Field Service is concerned, I have in our office in the U.S.A. seen thick ledgers of correspondence with young South Africans, mostly English speaking, who came to the U.S.A under this organization&#x2019;s programme and then wrote for assistance because they found it necessary to defend our country there.</block>

<p>The people found it necessary to defend South Africa, and here they are being granted an opportunity to do so, whereas that party on that side of the House, which is always so eager to defend South Africa, refuses to avail itself of such an opportunity.

We in South Afirca have nothing to be ashamed about. We know that it is so&#x2014;except of course the Government. But the Prime Minster is being thwarted, and a search is in progress for the people behind S. E. D. Brown. He is one of the chief propagandists against the American Field Service. I am afraid it is the hon. the Minister of Health who is sabotaging this outward tendency of South Africa. I believe that the Government is not trying to avail itself of its opportunities. They maintain that it would be wrong for something to have been created here which would have enabled our young people to be sent overseas where they would have come under foreign influences. Now I want to put the question: Would it also be wrong&#x2014;let us forget for the moment about our young men and women going there&#x2014;for the young American men and women to come here.

<p>Yes, it would probably do that hon. member a great deal more good to participate in something like that than it would perhaps do me. We moved this motion of no confidence firstly because we have no confidence in this Government&#x2019;s policy of separate freedoms. We do not believe that it is a solution to the racial problem of South Africa. We believe that it is a perilous policy, and we believe further that it cannot be applied to all race groups. Secondly we moved a motion of no confidence here because, if it is the considered opinion of the Government to apply a policy of separate freedoms, they must proceed to do so, but they are moving in an opposite direction. Actually this is a two-sided motion of no confidence. In the first place it is the wrong policy to apply in South Africa, and in the second place, the Government is not prepared to implement it. In reality they on that side ought themselves to vote for this motion of no confidence, because they themselves are not prepared to implement that policy. That, and the fact that they are applying economic integration in South Africa, where they ought to be segregating, proves that they do not have much confidence in their own policy of separate freedoms. One cannot bring, about a separation unless one develops the possibility of the homelands. One would be inclined to say that the Government thought that the Bantu were not capable of developing. Why are they not prepared to allow white capital in those areas&#x003F; If they listened to experts like Dr. Eiselen they would see that the Bantu is even better suited to secondary and tertiary industries than he is to the agricultural industry. They have all the possibilities, but the Government is not prepared to avail itself of that opportunity. No, they say, our solution lies in border industries.</p>

<p>Border industries may perhaps take one half way, but in the long run industries within the reserves are a number one priority in order to make those areas viable. Hon. members on that side ought to realize that. Border industries are nothing else but a transference of economic domination. What one fears in your own area and what troubles you in your own area, that you are prepared to go and do only a few miles further away. Hon. members on that side of the House maintain that the White cities cannot be allowed to become integrated. But what is happening now&#x003F; The more the white cities become integrated, the more one also finds that Whites are coming to the white areas. But what is the position to-day in the country areas, where this problem is at its worst&#x003F; They are luring white people away from those areas. The place of the white people is being taken up by an increasing number of Blacks. Apparently the Government welcomes this. I have never heard them express concern at the fact that tens of thousands of black people are taking the place of the white people in the rural areas. Apparently they are blissfully unaware of that.</p>

<p>That brings me to the position of our agriculture, which is one of the reasons for the increasing depopulation of the rural areas. It is because the agricultural industry is to-day no longer receiving the attention it ought to receive. Secondly it is because those people can no longer make a decent living. Hon. members on the opposite side can argue as they please now, but I will furnish the hon. the Minister with just one quotation. This is a statement made by the S.A. Agricultural Union itself, which was submitted to the commission, and which appeared in <i>Die Landbouweekblad.</i> This is what they said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The income per farmer is decreasing at the rate of 0.67 per cent per year. In contrast to this the <i>per capita</i> income of the national economy is increasing by 1.55 per cent per year, and this is a gap which is steadily increasing.</block>

<p>For the entire national economy the increase per annum is 1.55 per cent, but for agriculture the decrease is 0.67 per cent per annum. I shall furnish the hon. the Minister with many more examples.</p>

<p>This is an extract from <i>Die Landbouweekblad</i> of a memorandum submitted by the S.A. Agricultural Union itself to the commission of inquiry in regard to agriculture. The hon. member for Christiana has always had the habit of asking: &#x201C;Where do you get that from&#x003F;&#x201D; In other words, he is creating the impression that what an hon. member on this side of the House uses is usually not authentic. I want to read to the hon. the Minister what one of the members of the Wool Board said a short while ago in regard to our agricultural industry. What does Mr. Sarel Hayward say&#x003F; Mr. Sarel Hayward is a member of the Provincial Council, a Nationalist M.P.C., as well as a member of the South African Wool Board. According to <i>Die Landbouweekblad</i> he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_305-306" refersTo="page_0171"/>Three to 4 per cent of our young farmers are leaving their farms. They have farmed themselves to a standstill owing to a lack of capital. If this state of affairs should continue, it is heading for disaster. The man who is still able to make his own way has to pay impossible rates of interest and he is gradually going downhill. No help is available until it is too late.</block>

<p>This was not said by a United Party supporter, but by the National M.P.C., who is also a member of the South African Wool Board. [Interjections.] No, I do not believe he will be next to be nominated. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those who do in fact receive assistance receive so little that it does not serve to put them on their feet again.</block>

<p>If such an assertion is being made, how can a Minister still try and create the impression that everything is going well with the agricultural industry in South Africa&#x003F; Is he surprised that the people from the country areas are going to the cities and that they prefer to seek refuge there&#x003F; I can also quote what Mr. A. Paul said. He is also a member of the Wool Board. He said that farmers would have to be helped with subsidies for their interest. That is the situation to-day. I want to give the hon. the Minister another quotation. Apparently he will never take our word for it. I am sorry. Sir, that we have to use these quotations every year, but apparently the Government is not prepared to understand our representation. They do not believe it. This is what Mr. G. R. Pauw, assistant chief manager of Federale Volksbeleggings, has to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be borne in mind that 73 per cent of the South African farmers make a profit of less than R3,000 a year, whereas 10 per cent of them make a profit of only R1,000 a year.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if that is not a serious state of affairs, then I do not know what is. Recently I read an annual report of the company of which Dr. Piet Neethling is one of the directors. He states in that report that they want to limit the capital which they are going to spend on agriculture as far as possible. The reason he gives is that the profits made on agriculture are too small, and that the company&#x2019;s money, which it needs, cannot be invested profitably enough in agriculture. But hon. members on that side of the House are apparently satisfied. One can continue in this way and mention one point after the other. Whether it be technical matters, or production costs, or increased staff, or better prices, or soil conservation&#x2014;there is not one single problem which the farmer in South Africa has come up against during the past 20 years that this Government has solved. There is not one. I am giving the hon. the Minister, or anyone speaking after me the opportunity of mentioning to me one problem that they have solved in regard to the agricultural industry during the past 20 years. They are prepared to say that they will use all the money, it makes no difference what it is going to cost, in order to implement the Bantu homelands policy. But what was the reply to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition two years ago when he stated in the House that we should help the agricultural industry whatever the cost&#x003F; He said that he realized it would cost a great deal of money. Was the Government right to adopt that kind of attitude&#x003F; No, Sir. When it comes to separate freedoms, to ideology, they say that it makes no difference what it is going to cost. To-day the opportunity is there for the Government. They are experiencing difficulties in the agricultural industry. They should be prepared to reveal precisely the same sentiment in regard to the agricultural industry in South Africa as the one they revealed there. Then we will believe that they are prepared to do something for the agricultural industry. In regard to the statement that this Government is the friend of the farmer. I can only say that they have never been. They tried to create that impression before 1948, and subsequently they have forgotten the farmer of South Africa. Any farmer who still believes to-day that they are in fact his friend, is living under the greatest illusion which anybody in South Africa could live under.</p>

<p>The farmers themselves solved a problem. Of the 71 constituencies situated in the rural areas of South Africa, that party has only six. They only have three in the whole of the Cape and three in Natal. They do not have a single constituency in the rural areas of the Transvaal, nor in those of the Free State. In South West Africa that party does not exist at all. That is what the farmers of South Africa think of the United Party and what they still remember of the time when Mr. Strauss was Minister of Agriculture. The hon. member made the statement here that the rural areas were being depopulated. That is true. There is a gradual decrease in the number of farmers in the rural areas. That is a world-wide trend and it will not be possible to prevent it anywhere in the world. But now he also makes the statement that the Blacks in the rural areas are steadily increasing in number. I find it a strange situation that the white farmers, as he has said, are becoming fewer. This Government is doing nothing or very little for the farmers, but more and more labourers are being employed in the rural areas.</p>

<p>Those were his very own words. That is the sort of illusory argument raised by that side of the House, and that is why the rural areas and the farmer will never return the United Party to power. I just want to mention a third point in regard to farming. During the past seven years South Africa has been experiencing extensive droughts, such as virtually never before in its history, and these are apparently continuing this year. Yet South Africa has, in spite of those droughts, not only kept its rate of growth, but also its economic position so sound that we are to-day, as has been pointed out, one of the countries with the highest rate of growth. If this Government is doing nothing for the farmer, how did our country manage to survive these seven years of drought&#x003F; We shall not settle this matter across the floor of this House. I want to extend an invitation to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. There is a golden opportunity for asking the farmers of South Africa to state what they think of the National Government and specifically of my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, and how the farmer in South Africa is being treated. There is to be a by-election in Bethlehem. Will the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tell us in his reply to this debate who the United Party candidate in Bethlehem will be&#x003F; From the nature of the case the United Party cannot win the constituency of Bethlehem, but in Bethlehem the United Party can try to put to the test what the hon. member has tried to say here in words. But I shall leave the matter at that. Our problem is that we have too many candidates. In fact, we have too many members and too many votes. We have too much of everything. Do you know who gives us that&#x003F; The electorate of South Africa gives that to us because they have confidence in this side of the House.</p>

<p>We have now come to the end of an entire week of so-called no-confidence debating, a no-confidence debate introduced by the Leader of the Opposition and his lieutenant, the hon. member for Yeoville. I am not going to read it here, but I nevertheless want hon. members and the public outside who are interested in these matters, to read the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 2nd and 26th February, because then they will also have read both speeches made by those members. We have an Opposition that does not think; the <i>Financial Mail</i> thinks for them. I do not know whether to-day&#x2019;s Financial Mail is on sale yet, but if it is the reply to this debate will most probably appear in to-day&#x2019;s edition of the <i>Financial Mail.</i> But it was a good thing that we had that. This no-confidence debate took place after and against the background of 20 years of National Party r&#x00E9;gime. I have worked it out, and I think that since 1948 this is the 26th motion of no-confidence in the National Government. It is also taking place after 18 months of leadership by the hon. the Prime Minister and after a recess of six months. Then the hon. the Leader introduced the motion of no-confidence, and a wide field was covered. What has happened now&#x003F;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says we got a hiding. There are some families where the little girl should get more hidings. In the first place there is the economy. What has become apparent&#x003F; It has become apparent that this Government has governed in such a way that all the attempts at applying the brake to the economy, have not been quite as successful as we would have liked them to be in order to combat inflation. We want to maintain the rate of growth at 5&#x00BD; per cent, but we have not quite managed to do so. It is weak government that allows an economy to grow to that extent. Sir Alec Douglas Home is a cautious person and a person I know well, a person who, quite rightly, does not want to give an opinion on South Africa. But, after all, if the sun is shining he cannot help saying that it is a clear day. Having said these things, he could not help saying, &#x201C;What I will say is that South Africa has a thriving economy&#x201D;. In the third place I want to say the following. We are speaking against a background of 20 years of National r&#x00E9;gime. This is the Government which would supposedly have caused all the banks to close down, and so forth. This Government has governed in such a way that within an hour or an hour and a half it was possible for us to decide with ease that we would not devalue, because the position of the rand was strong enough. Since we are talking about the economy, I just want to mention a few points in this regard. During the 20 years of National r&#x00E9;gime, and this is the question that should be asked in 1968, the total production of our country has shown an increase of 376 per cent, i.e. 18&#x00BE; per cent per year. As much as that over a period of 20 years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not going to allow myself to be side-tracked by that hon. member. He should ask the Bureau of Statistics of the University of Stellenbosch about these things, because they are the people who work them out. There is not one single branch of industry in our economy that has not shared in this great prosperity. Our manufacturing industry has quintupled itself. But what is more important is the fact that we are living in a developing world, particularly as regards the manufacturing industry. Over the past ten years the total increase in the manufacturing industry all over the world, amounted to 70 per cent. In Canada it was 61 per cent. In the mighty U.S.A. it was 57 per cent, in Britain it was 36 per cent, and in South Africa under the National r&#x00E9;gime, with the policy of separate development and all those things those hon. members do not like, it was 93 per cent. This is what has become <span class="col_309-310" refersTo="page_0173"/>apparent in this motion of no-confidence. I wonder whether the hon. the Leader of the Opposition really wants to avail himself of the opportunity of replying to this debate. I think that it would be amiss to reply to a motion of no-confidence if these are the facts that have become apparent. Let me mention a few things in respect of agriculture, about which that hon. member had so much to say. In 1948, when the National Party came to power, the total agricultural production was R376 million a year. Last year it was R1,307 million. That is the agriculture in respect of which that hon. member wants to give out that this Government has not lifted a finger to stand by the farmer in difficult times. I just want to furnish one last figure. After 20 years this is what South Africa looks like under the Government in which no-confidence is to be expressed. In 1948 62,000 new motor cars were sold in this country. Last year 185,000 were sold.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>What do these figures prove&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They prove one thing, namely that the on. the Prime Minister has acted sensibly and correctly by not even moving an amendment to this motion of no-confidence. But other matters were also touched upon. Reference was made here to labour, and my colleague, the Minister of Labour, replied to them. I just want to emphasize a few of these matters because the United Party is trying to make the white worker fear this Government, particularly in respect of the presence of Bantu labour in the border areas. My colleague pointed out that since 1954 there had been an increase of 80,000 white workers in our factories. Under the National Government no danger was created for the employment of the white man in South Africa. Let me say this immediately. The numbers of the Bantu in South Africa are increasing at present, and have always shown a far greater increase than those of the Whites. If we in South Africa want to create a safe future for all of us, we shall have to see to it that the numbers of the non-Whites who are to be provided with employment will always in the future be greater&#x2014;in numbers, not in ratio&#x2014;than those of the Whites, otherwise we shall have unemployment and then we shall have to contend with problems. The first priority of this Government is, <i>inter alia</i>, to see to it that not a single man or woman in South Africa is begrudged a decent existence. That is where our task lies. But the fact of the matter is that percentage-wise as well, the Whites in industry in South Africa have remained constant. The figure in question was 28 per cent and then it rose to 30 per cent, and for the past four years it has remained constant at 25 per cent. I repeat this because these are the things in which we are interested. These are the things this Government is doing. As regards artisans, the number of Whites in 1958 amounted to 88 per cent, as my colleague said. In 1967, after nine years, it was 87 per cent, a constant figure. The working man in South Africa has nothing to fear under a National Government.</p>

<p>References were also made to non-White affairs. What has become apparent from this debate&#x003F; One thing has become apparent, namely that the policy of separate development is not only a policy, but also an accomplished fact in South Africa, something which nobody can ever again undo. Separate development has taken its course, and I challenge any member on that side of the House to go to the Bantu in the Transkei, for instance, and to tell them that you want separate development to be undone. You may also put this question to the Whites in South Africa. But what has become apparent from this debate&#x003F; It has become apparent from this debate that we are right in saying that the price it will cost does not matter. We know that there is one price we shall not have to pay, namely the survival of our Whites. Secondly we said, &#x201C;Both feet on the ground&#x201D;, as the late Oom Serfie said, because we are moving along as the development can be absorbed by the Bantu, who will have to take care of it eventually. What has come to light from the other side&#x003F; More light was shed for us upon their point of view. Our standpoint is separate freedoms and separate development and having a white Parliament here in Cape Town. It is pure white and so it will remain as long as the National Party is in power. But we are making progress as far as the United Party is concerned. As far as they are concerned, we know now that in Parliament there will at least to begin with be 25 people representing the non-Whites. Every voter in South Africa knows now that it is that party&#x2019;s policy that in this Parliament there will be 25 people representing the non-Whites, and at least eight of them may be non-Whites. Is that correct&#x003F; That is six here and two in the Senate. But the United Party has also made sure of one thing, and for that purpose they are using a measure which we, the National Party, introduced virtually over their dead bodies, so to speak. They want to make sure that Coloureds will be sitting in this Parliament as soon as possible, and that is why they want the separate voters&#x2019; roll. That is why the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has succeeded in making them abandon their basic stand against a separate voters&#x2019; roll and having it accepted as part of the policy of the United Party; because the separate voters&#x2019; roll ensures that those voting are Coloureds only, and as is the case with every other nation in the world, Coloureds will naturally vote for Coloureds. Using our measures you want to make absolutely sure that at the first election there will be at least eight Coloureds in Parliament.</p>

<p>But you are now taking that measure of ours a little further, because you want to do something that we would never have done. You want a separate voters&#x2019; roll for the Indians as well, a second separate voters&#x2019; roll, a second classification. By those means you are making absolutely sure that in this Parliament there will be 25 people representing non-Whites, <span class="col_311-312" refersTo="page_0174"/>and if that is not a balance of power group, then I do not know what it is. The hon. member for South Coast quoted somebody who had said, &#x201C;The point of contact is the point of friction&#x201D;. Let me state clearly that we disagree with him completely. The more points of contact it is possible to have between the various peoples in South Africa, the better, but this principle would be valid in South Africa if it read as follows: &#x201C;The point of rivalry or contention is the point of friction.&#x201D; And do you know where that point of contention will be&#x003F; Those 25 people, including the eight Coloureds, whom you want in this Parliament. Such is the progress we have made, and now the voters of Pretoria (West) and of Bethlehem and of Bloemfontein know that this is the policy of the United Party.</p>

<p>But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his members gave out dramatically that little was being done and that much more should be done for the scientists in our country and for education in general. Let me just tell him that I agree with him that more should be done, but I am at least saying this with the pride we can justly take in the almost superhuman little niche South Africa has, taking into account our small population, gained for itself in respect of science in the comity of nations. The contribution made by this small country in the field of science&#x2014;be it in the field of medicine or in the field of atomic energy or whatever&#x2014;is proportionately greater than that of any country in the world of which I know. But we may not leave it at that. We cannot merely say that more should be done; we must state what has already been done. The C.S.I.R. is a body which has grown in South Africa under the National Government, and it is esteemed in the world as being one of the greatest of its kind. We have the Atomic Energy Board, which was established by this Government. We have the National Institute for Metallurgy, but in addition to that, do you know that this small country has five medical schools&#x003F; We have ten universities, including two new ones which were established under this Government; and in addiition five university colleges were established by us, also for the non-Whites. With what justification can the Leader of the Opposition point his finger at the Government and say that not enough is being done in respect of science&#x003F;</p>

<p>A few words were also said about justice&#x2014; just a few words about the calm and order and peace in this country. It was said that we were doing too much to take the agitator and the communist by the throat if necessary. That is the total contribution made by the Opposition in respect of the calm and order and peace in this country. As far as my own Department of Planning is concerned, did you suggest to us a comprehensive plan&#x003F; Did you help us with our water plans&#x003F; Did you help us in connection with the planning of our economy&#x003F; Did you give us any assistance in respect of the planning of education; any assistance whatever in respect of the planning for the lower income groups and the aged in the country&#x003F; This happened to strike me. This is the Party that is attacking the Government. In all the private motions introduced here, this side of the House considered those groups and the aged, and that side did not introduce a single private motion to that effect. This is how it goes with a party that has become like that Party. But do you know, Sir, why this is so&#x003F; Because, in the first place, the United Party is un-national. [Laughter.] Hon. members are laughing now, but let us just test this as from 1910.</p>

<p>I do not want to be personal. I am only taking the leaders of our nation in order to test one thing, namely that what is national in character grows and becomes stronger, and what is unnational falls into decline and disappears. In 1910 we had General Hertzog and General Botha, both Boer generals, and the idea I am now going to express as to what is national, is not my own; it originated with ex-Minister Serfontein. In 1910 two generals served in the Cabinet at the same time, and simply because one of them was national and said &#x201C;South Africa first&#x201D;. he was expelled. Only twelve years went by and by that time that which was national had grown to such an extent that General Hertzog became Prime Minister and the other one was no longer there.</p>

<p>Yes. Let us test this against two other leaders the people had, namely Dr. Malan and General Smuts. They attended the same university together. General Smuts was the mighty leader in the war years. Only ten years went by after 1938, and he who was national, became Prime Minister, and that Party which was un-national is now sitting over there. Let us take a third example, the late Advocate Strijdom and Mr. Strauss. They were admitted to the Bar in the Transvaal at the same time. They had the same opportunities, except that Mr. Strauss had an advantage in that he was a member of that mighty war cabinet of General Smuts&#x2019;, whereas in 1938 Advocate Strijdom was the only National member in the whole of the Transvaal. But he who was national became stronger and gathered people around him, and in 1954 he became Prime Minister here, and at that time Advocate Strauss was not even the leader of the United Party any more. And as far as the present situation is concerned, has a Prime Minister ever been in a stronger position in any country after 18 months than the present Prime Minister&#x003F; Let us bring proof. There are no politics involved at present. There has not been any by-election lately. This is a valley period in politics. There have been five National Party congresses. Better South Africa has never seen. I attended each of them. But the Prime Minister went to Nelspruit <span class="col_313-314" refersTo="page_0175"/>for an ordinary meeting, and that was the greatest meeting Nelspruit had ever seen. The Prime Minister went to Vryheid in Natal and the same happened there, and then the impossible came about. The Prime Minister went to Rustenburg for an ordinary political rally. The people did not come in order to complain, but do you know how many people were there&#x003F; There were 12,000 people. Has a party and its leader ever been in a stronger position in this country than that&#x003F; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will soon rise in order to conclude the debate on his motion of no-confidence, and against what background is he going to do so&#x003F; His Party is 33 years old now.</p>

<p>What has happened to that Party, in contrast to the National Party&#x003F; In the course of 33 years the National Party has gained 77 seats from the United Party, and it has retained them all without losing a single one. In the course of the same 33 years the United Party has gained six seats from the National Party, but it has not retained one of them. I am not even mentioning the total number of votes, because that is old news. We are not only taking their seats from them, but their people are also deserting them and becoming angry with and ashamed of them. But do you know how bad it is&#x003F; In the course of 33 years 49 United Party people went over to the National Party, in the House of Assembly, and another 14 left them and joined other parties. Fifty-three of them have therefore left them in 33 years&#x2019; time. This is the Leader and the Party that is introducing a motion of no-confidence. The United Party has at least had two gains; in the course of 33 years they gained two members, Mr. Sutherland of the Labour Party and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, but they did not make a gain in his case; he merely returned. But let us look at the Party as it is at present. That Party does not represent a part of the nation; they represent a part of a part.</p>

<p>If we have an election to-morrow, what will happen&#x003F; That Party represents a part of a part, 33 out of 89 urban seats, and only six out of 71 rural seats. If I get into my car here and I drive until I reach the centre of Johannesburg, I do not enter a single U.P. constituency. I can make detours, but those detours must at least be wide enough to include Port Elizabeth on my way to Johannesburg before I can drive through a U.P. constituency. This reminds me of the chief warden of the zoo on the slopes of Table Mountain. He told me that the local climate does not agree with zebras, and at the moment there is only one zebra here. Nor does it seem to me as though the zebras are going to increase in number. It seems to me as though the Party over there is the zebra party of South Africa.</p>

<p>In conclusion, before the Leader of the Opposition rises, I want to say this. In its 33 years of existence that Party has fought seven elections. It started in 1938 with 111 seats. In 1943 they lost 22&#x2014;then they only had 89; in 1948 they lost another 24&#x2014;then they only had 65; in 1953 they lost another 8&#x2014;then they only had 57; in 1958 they lost 4&#x2014;then they had 53; in 1961 they lost 3&#x2014;then they had 50, and the year before last they lost 11, and now there are only 39 of them. That is a Party which shows a deathly downward trend in every sphere, and it is the Leader of such a Party who now has to rise and reply to a debate on a motion of no-confidence in the Government.</p>

<p>He has changed a few of the figures, but what did he do to refute the arguments which have been advanced on this side and to deal with the criticism which has been levelled at the Government&#x003F; Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister was silent; the Minister of Planning did not deal with the subject. Must we assume that the Cabinet associates itself with the statement made here yesterday by the hon. the Minister of Health&#x003F; Or is it that this great strong party opposite, about which we have had the Minister of Planning patting himself on the back for so long, is led by a Prime Minister who cannot control his own people&#x003F; <span class="col_315-316" refersTo="page_0176"/>Sir, in opening this discussion I made mention of my satisfaction with certain aspects of the opening speech made by the Acting State President. I drew attention, <i>inter alia,</i> to the fact that the Government had given itself a pat on the back for not having followed Britain&#x2019;s devaluation policy and complained that there was still vagueness and uncertainty as to the position in respect of certain primary producers and those who processed their goods for export to Great Britain which had devalued. When the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs came into the debate this afternoon, I was sure that he was going to make the position absolutely clear. What did we get&#x003F; We had more vagueness; we had a reference to the original statement which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government is aware of this possibility and will consider suitable ways and means in deserving cases to assist in solving the problem of these industries.</block>

<p>I thought that at least we would hear what a deserving case is, but not a word from the hon. gentleman. He tells us he is having discussions, three months after devaluation. He spoke about the canners and certain others and their difficulties. Does this hon. gentleman realize that the Australian Government has already made the position absolutely clear to its canners and that they are already in the market and undercutting us&#x003F; Not a word about this from the hon. the Minister. We still do not know what the position is. The public does not know where these people are and they do not know where they are: how can they plan ahead&#x003F; What is the position with the wine exporters&#x003F; Sir, the whole position remains vague and uncertain, and after a four day debate, in which we have drawn attention to this matter and responsible Ministers have spoken, we have no further idea as to what the position is and it is as uncertain as it was before.</p>

<p>I can tell the hon. gentleman right here and now that a large number of farmers and a large number of canners are very dissatisfied indeed. Sir, I went further in opening this debate. I complained that it was an illusion in the minds of the public that this Government was good at managing the economy of the country. Sir, what did we have this afternoon&#x003F; We had a penegyric from the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs as to how strong the economy was, but he did not tell us that it was strong because this Government was not carrying out its policy and he did not tell us that it was because of their misjudgments and their bad management of affairs that they have had to take such drastic measurer to deal with the cost of living and with inflation in South Africa. That charge was never refuted by the hon. the Minister. He knows very well that they have had to take drastic action. He knows very well that that is due to the fact that they delayed too long and did the wrong thing. And what is happening now&#x003F; There has been a check in the rising cost of living but at what level has it been checked&#x003F; Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister challenged us to give an example of any group that is not better off than it was two years ago. The hon. member for Durban (Point) got up and gave him six or seven examples.</p>

</speech>

<p>Yes, that the standard of living has not improved. The hon. member for Durban (Point) gave six examples, one after the other and the Prime Minister cannot deny one of them. I have not the slightest doubt that the hon. the Prime Minister thinks that the civil servants and post office workers are better off to-day than they were two years ago, and that is why there is the biggest agitation we have known in South Africa from civil servants for increases in salaries and wages.</p>

<p>It has everything to do with it. The hon. the Minister told us what; wonderful peaceful labour relationships we had in South Africa. I would have thought that he would have the kindness, the charity, to have acknowledged that it is due to the industrial legislation which the United Party put on the Statute Book, but not a word from him; he does not even say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, what we see is an erosion of living standards as a result of misjudgments, as a result of taking wrong actions, as a result of this Government acting too late. When I dealt with those things I said to the Prime Minister that the Government was asking the people to make sacrifices. They are asking the people to make sacrifices, and I said that we were entitled to certain assurances. Those assurances were that efficiency in Government departments was being raised effectively, that Government expenditure was being cut and co-ordinated and selected on a basis of priorities to protect the best interests of the whole economy; that we are getting value for money with this very big Defence spending and, lastly, that the Government has used all the means at its disposal to reduce the cost of living, for example, by reducing tariffs, costs of transport and by the removal of duties which put up costs. I did not get these assurances. I am not surprised that I did not get these assurances because the Prime Minister knows as well as I do that the hon. the Minister of Transport is sitting with a vast surplus on his transport charges, and I do not believe the hon. gentleman can give me those assurances in respect of any of those requests. Is he surprised that I have no confidence in the Government&#x003F; I go further, Sir. I did not speak of agriculture but the question of soil conservation and agriculture has been raised here. Sir. a more miserable record than this Government&#x2019;s record in regard to the management of those affairs we have never had in this country.</p>

<p>[Interjections.] Sir, we spoke to the Prime Minister about this question of funds for education and gifts for educational institutions. We raised the question with the hon. gentleman as to the conditions under which gifts can be given by private people to those institutions. They get no tax rebates for gifts of that kind; there is nothing to encourage them. I believe that there are essentially three problems to which we have to have regard here. The first is that we have to train the white people for leadership in South Africa. The second is that we have to do what we can to prevent the brain drain, and the third is that we have to improve the educational qualifications of all our people. I believe that only in that way are we going to have a strong economy, and that is why for 20 years on this side of the House we have said that we believe that the provision of adequate educational facilities is something that should be given priority in South Africa.</p>

<p>Will he tell us what he did to help&#x003F; Sir, we have said that the provision of proper educational facilities should be a prior claim. One of the difficulties we have to-day is that there is such a shortage of trained teachers. It is no good shilly-shallying about this; we have either got the teachers or we have not, and at the moment it seems that we have not got the teachers and that we will not get them unless we pay them better and unless we give them better opportunities. That is why I have said that I believe that expenditure on education will have to be doubled. I go further Sir. I believe our universities are in grave danger of becoming fifth-rate teaching institutions because of the way in which we fail to support them. I believe our professors and lecturers are the worst mid in the English-speaking world and we are not going to keep those people, good South Africans though they be, if that position is going to be allowed to continue. People do not take the momentous decision to leave their country unless they are so frustrated because of lack of facilities that they do not get a chance to live out to the full here.</p>

<p>I want to say something else, Sir. We are a young country; we have to compete in world markets without the opportunities of mass production. Our dependence on the scientists and experts we have is something that is becoming daily more obvious, and that is why we have <span class="col_319-320" refersTo="page_0179"/>said on this side of the House and invited the Government to support us, that every white child, regardless of its parents&#x2019; financial position, should be educated up to the maximum of his ability free of charge. We have said that. We received no support from the Government for those appeals.</p>

<p>I go further and I say it is not going to be enough only to educate our Whites but we have to educate our non-Whites to higher educational standards so that they can be more productive in the interests of the whole country. An illiterate untrained man in the modern world is no good to you. I know the number of non-Whites in higher education is very limited indeed. There is only an infinitesimal number. I know that expenditure on non-White education has been stepped up very much in the last 20 years. But we are still in the position that the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on Bantu in schools, on Bantu education, is R13.5 per head against R74.5 for Coloureds and Indians and R114.1 for Whites. I want to say that a policy of encouraging self-help and co-operation amongst the Bantu is a good one, but we cannot hope for one moment that they are going to be able to come out within the limits of that R13 million fixed ten years ago for Bantu education. I do not believe it is fair that what is by far the poorest group in the country should not be assisted more by the state in order to try to attain higher standards. I know we cannot afford free education for everybody up to Matric because there are too many non-Whites. But we can do a great deal more than we are doing at the present time. It is with those objects in view that we on this side were so much in favour of free education for Whites, that we have encouraged large white families, that we have stood for family allowances through the years, that we have stood for subsidized housing schemes. I know I will be asked, &#x201C;Where is the money going to come from&#x003F;&#x2019;&#x2019;. I believe that with higher productive capacity this country will find the money and be wealthier than it is at the present time as a result.</p>

<p>Then I have had to deal with the protection of the white worker. I dealt with the illusion that this Government was the friend of the white worker in South Africa. We drew attention to the threat of the border industries and queried whether the workers in those industries were all working under wage determinations. I wanted to know whether they were working under industrial agreements negotiated with the trade unions. I pointed out that there was this wage gap, that there was wage differentiation which the department said was due to lower living standards of the Bantu working in the border industries. Now, what has been done to close the gap&#x003F; There have been a lot of figures given, by my hon. friend from Yeoville and by the hon. the Minister, and I see there were some more figures in <i>The Star</i> of the 6th of this month. The report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department of Labour statistics show that the percentage of non-Whites employed in factories has remained almost constant over the last three years, increasing slightly from 74.2 per cent to 74.3 per cent at the end of 1966. These statistics are slightly different to those published at the end of last year by the Trade Union Council of South Africa, showing the racial composition of the labour force in the manufacturing sector of the economy. TUCSA which said its information came from the Bureau of Census and Statistics showed that the non-White share of the manufacturing labour market had increased from 73.4 per cent to 74.8 per cent.</block>

<p>The fact of the matter remains that the Bantu are pouring into our industries three times as fast as the European, and it does not matter whose figures are right or whose figures are wrong. It shows that economic integration is still continuing at a very high pace. It shows that the Government is not able to do anything to lessen the interdependence upon each other in the economic sphere of the different races. They still work together in the same industries, whether they are in Rosslyn or whether they are on the Witwatersrand. White and Black are still working together in the same industries.</p>

<p>I am sufficient of a realist to accept that the employer must be prevented from exploiting the opportunity to employ non-Whites in white jobs at a lower wage, at a lower rate of pay. Unfortunately job reservation cannot protect the white worker as long as there are too few Whites to do all the jobs that are available. The Government&#x2019;s policy, their Bantustan policy, is creating jobs for Blacks in white areas and reducing job opportunities for Whites in the existing industrial areas. Border development is actually encouraging the recruiting of non-Whites to do white jobs and under-cutting the Whites. Many industries are lost already to the White worker. The whole province of Natal is probably lost. Industrialists cannot be blamed for taking advantage of the opportunities that the Government gives them. But the upshot of it all is that the white worker is being left high and dry. An experienced trade unionist at the moment said <span class="col_321-322" refersTo="page_0180"/>that the white worker &#x201C;is fighting for his very existence against this state of affairs being created by the Government&#x201D;. These people are demanding a solution from the Government. What is the solution they are demanding&#x003F; I believe the solution they are demanding is the solution the United Party has been offering through the years, namely the rate for the job. Here is what Mr. Murray, the president of the TUCSA said. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister said they do not want it. Let me read what Mr. Murray said, president of possibly the biggest trade union council in the country and general secretary of the Boilermakers&#x2019; Society. He predicts that the coming year will be &#x201C;the turning point in the affairs of the white worker in South Africa&#x201D;. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Either we tackle this problem and solve it, or we can sit back and watch our jobs become eroded and fragmented into nothing. Job reservation is not the answer because there are not enough Whites to reserve jobs for. Immigation is inadequate and separate development will not work, not in our lifetime anyway. We are left with the alternative of eliminating cheap labour itself. We call it &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; or &#x201C;equal pay for equal work&#x201D;. In other words, pay Whites and non-Whites exactly the same and let them compete on equal terms for what jobs are available.</block>

<p>Then he goes on to deal with mechanization and automation, which we hear so much about from the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In industrial countries automation and advanced mechanization have been introduced to increase efficiency and productivity and to improve the standard of living all round. In South Africa the same equipment appears to be introduced in many cases merely to replace a skilled man with unskilled cheap labour. The employer in this country will always take advantage of cheap labour as long as cheap labour is available and if it happens to be comparatively unskilled and irresponsible he will design a machine which removes skill and responsibility from the job.</block>

<p>Is &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; enough&#x003F; I do not believe that &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; is adequate protection alone, because one has to accept that there are a number of white workers who will fall by the wayside. I believe there is a very small number. But I believe there are a number who will fall by the wayside. Therefore, I believe we have to go back to our old civilized labour policy. I believe that we have to be prepared to accept a national minimum wage for the white worker in South Africa.</p>

<p>I go further. I believe that the Industrial Tribunal, whose function it has been to issue job reservation orders, has been kept equally busy with exemptions. I believe there are over 800 different exemptions already. I believe that that tribunal should be kept busy formulating proposals which will enable it to act as a sort of court of appeal or an ombudsman for any section of the white labour group who feels that their jobs have been threatened by competition from non-Whites at a lower standard of living. I believe that has got to come. I want to say I have great faith in our trade unions in assisting in adaptations which will be necessary. They have a lot of experience, and they have done it so far on terms that have been acceptable to themselves. I suggested some time ago that there should be a national convention on labour matters. I believe it is even more urgent to-day than it was then. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Labour whether in border industries the industrial agreements are operative at all&#x003F; Will he tell us whether, where there have been re-allocation of jobs, they have been done with the consent and approval of the trade unions concerned&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There is unhappiness about this. I believe the Industrial Tribunal could play a real role as a court of appeal in order to ensure that the white worker has proper protection.</p>

<p>If I could sum it up, I would say that we are not going to solve our problems until South Africa is ensured of a sufficient supply of trained labour by the provision of better education facilities and technical training. We are not going to get a solution until all race groups know that they will get an improvement in their standard of living when changes in the labour pattern are made. I have said already there must be special attention paid to the education of Whites. Special attention has also got to be paid to the training of non-Whites and more attention to management and productivity. I believe that the trade unions must be entrusted as far as possible with the task of smooth adjustment to changing labour patterns and that we must give consideration to a national minimum wage for the white worker in South Africa. I believe until those things are done the white worker is not going to get protection. I do not believe he has adequate protection under this government. I believe that this story that the Government is the friend of the white worker is not being proved to be the position and that the white worker is faced with a crisis to-day more serious then at any time in his history.</p>

<p>I raised a fourth matter, and that was the illusion that the separate development or non-European <span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_0181"/>policy of this Government was giving a solution to Black-White relations in the Republic. What is the yardstick, what is the test of success&#x003F; Hon. members opposite have made it quite clear what their test is, namely that the reserves should be able to absorb the natural increase of their inhabitants and give them jobs at a decent standard of living. They also hope that the reserves will be able to absorb those whom the hon. the Deputy Minister hopes to send back from the white areas. What success have they had&#x003F; If one looks at the figures, if one sees what has been happening then one cannot help using the phrase of which General Smuts was so fond. He said, &#x201C;Hulle retireer vol moed&#x2014;maar hulle retireer.&#x201D; That is what is happening with these people.</p>

<p>The question is, can this policy of theirs be made into a reality&#x003F; That is the question with which we are faced. I gave certain figures as to what it has cost to create jobs in border industries. I gave figures of what it had cost to create jobs inside the reserves. Despite the fact that we have had the entire talent of the Ministry of Bantu Administration and Development, not one of those figures has been challenged. It is quite clear from those figures that it looks like something of the order of R800 million just to resettle the 400,000 families in agriculture. It looks as though jobs shall have to be found for a natural increase of 39,000 males alone in the reserves every year, and it looks as if there is no hope whatever at the moment of the measures they have taken being adequate to achieve their objective, let alone give work to the Bantu they intend sending back to the reserves. They are spending something like R100 million per year on the reserves at the moment, but just to get work for the 39,000 will probably cost R195 million a year more. It is quite clear that in order to bring about a change that will give them a chance of success is going to cost thousands of millions of rand.</p>

<p>We had great claims from the various Ministers that there was development in the reserves. We were told what tremendous improvement there was there and what vast progress had been made. Well, I took the trouble of finding out what the average income per head was of a Bantu in the reserves at the time the Tomlinson Commission sat. That commission found that for the year 1950-&#x2019;51 the average income per head of the Bantu in the reserves was of the order of R48. Dr. Adendorff, the chairman of the Bantu Investment Corporation, gave the figure for the period 15, 16 years later and according to this the average income per head in the reserves to-day is R53. Having regard to the decrease in the value of money since 1950-&#x2019;51, can any Minister get up here and tell me that those people are to-day enjoying a better standard of living&#x003F; Can they get up and tell me that there has been any improvement&#x003F; On the contrary&#x2014;there has been a deterioration. It is for this reason that I pointed out that the Bantu themselves would be able to give very little help financially with the result that that financial help would have to come from the white economy. And what is happening about it&#x003F; Of course, we are being told by Ministers that we ought not to worry, that we should be proud of the fact that the income per head of the Bantu in the reserves is higher than in any Bantu state in Africa. But let us accept Dr. Adendorff&#x2019;s figures&#x2014;R53 per head, R22 of which is earned in the reserves and R31 being contributions from relatives outside the reserves. Let me say here that it gives me no pleasure at all to quote these figures because they prove that the Minister&#x2019;s statement is totally incorrect. I have the figures here of the average income per head in certain other states in Africa, figures supplied by the Africa Institute. In Zambia it is R139; in Senegal, R146; in Rhodesia, R153 (including the Whites); in Liberia, R175; in Lesotho, R70; in the Ivory Coast, R99; in Gabon R227; in Egypt, R97; in Angola, R66; in Botswana, our neighbour. R70; in the Congo, R99; and in the Congo (Kinshasa), R66. This then is a comparison of the average income per head of the Bantu population of those countries with the average income per head of the Bantu in the reserves in South Africa.</p>

So, this is the progress we have been told about. This is the measure of the Government&#x2019;s failure to develop the reserves. This is the illusion that they have the solution. I have asked the Government what it is going to cost to make their policy a success. Well, either they do not know, or they are afraid to tell the people of South Africa. The truth of the matter is, I think, that they are afraid to tell the people. I believe they are afraid that the people of South Africa will say that the sacrifice they are being called upon <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_0182"/>to make makes the Government&#x2019;s policy entirely unrealistic.</p>

<p>That is not the point at all. The hon. the Prime Minister is trying to drag a red herring across the trail, and he is doing that because he is going to spend R491 million within the next five years and he is afraid the people will jib at it. Therefore he wants me to say that it is necessary. I believe that if private white industry is allowed in he could get away with spending a good deal less. But I want to take the matter further and draw his attention to what Professor Sadie, the professor of economy at the University of Stellenbosch, has to say. I think it is vitally important that this be drawn to the attention of the Government. Professor Sadie said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Omdat grensnywerhede so naby bestaande nywerheidsentrums l&#x00EA;, gaan baie van die kumulatiewe voordele van die grensnywerhede na die blanke gebied en nie na die Bantoegebiede nie.</block>

<p>He says that in terms of developing the reserves the border industry policy is utterly misconceived. He proceeds to deal with the criticism of that policy, the suggestion that it is colonialism in a modern form. Then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar ons in Suid-Afrika ondervind vandag nog die voordele van hierdie koloniale kapitalisme&#x2014;dit word nou net buitelandse belegging genoem. Dit is &#x2019;n mite dat &#x2019;n gasheerland magteloos staan teenoor buitelandse kapitaal. Dit is eerder die buitelandse belegger wat magteloos staan.</block>

<p>In regard to the development of the reserves he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die enigste manier om dit te bewerkstellig, is met die groots moontlike gebruik van die ondernemers-iniisiatief uit die ontwikkelde sektor. Daar moet teruggekeer word na die advies van die Tomlinson-kommissie. Blanke ondernemers moet met alle mag aangemoedig word om na die Bantoegebiede self te gaan.</block>

<p>For how long has the United Party not been saying this&#x003F; For how long have we not been pointing out how vitally important it is that the reserves should be developed&#x003F; You see, Sir, this Government is still sitting under its policy with one unanswered problem&#x2014;how to cope realistically with the Bantu outside the reserves, increasing at the moment faster than the Bantu inside the reserves. If the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy does not work&#x2014;and it cannot work because he cannot spend the necessary money on it&#x2014;what is he going to do about this problem&#x003F; He cannot continue with what he is doing at the moment. He cannot continue in that way because that is going to lead to political insecurity in South Africa. Now I believe that there is an alternative. I believe that if you want political security, it must guarantee white survival and give us the assurance that we will live in peace with the non-Whites in South Africa. I think that if we are to live in peace with them, they must feel that their demands will be satisfied and that they will be given a square deal, and they must believe that they also have a great future in the Republic. I think that <span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_0183"/>securing these aims means many problems because we are outnumbered so much. It means protecting the Whites against the undermining of their standards on the one hand and it means helping the non-Whites to realize their aspirations on the other. All South Africans have a reasonable fear of being swamped by sheer preponderance of numbers. I think that fear persists in white South Africans. They have it about their homes, about the conditions where they work. They have it about their schools and their children&#x2019;s education. They have it about places of recreation. They have it about this House, Sir. They have those fears. We recognize those fears, and instead of offering the doubtful security of a smaller, poorer and defenceless white South Africa surrounded by eight independent black states, we believe we can offer real security and prosperity and happiness for a far greater number of the people. This is how I believe the excessive movement of the Bantu from the reserves into the white areas can be checked. I believe that that means that those reserves have to be developed far faster than at the moment I believe that we have to retain reasonable and necessary influx control and that the only Bantu allowed into the white areas must be those for whom there is work. I believe there must be a stronger white nation built by encouraging an increase in the white birth rate, with adequate family allowances as I have indicated, and by immigration.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, &#x201C;Botha-Botha-babas&#x201D;. I believe that the quality of white leadership must be maintained by the best possible education for the Whites in South Africa. I believe the unlimited growth of South Africa will ensure higher living standards for everybody. I believe that race harmony can only be fostered by maintaining separation in residential areas, at schools, by respecting the sanctity of family life, by applying the pass-laws in a just manner and by building up a stable middle class of Bantu. I believe unfair competition for jobs will be eliminated by ensuring that there are civilized rates for civilized jobs. I believe that we can improve the economic position of the country by developing new industries not only in border areas but also in new areas on the basis of a sound system of decentralization.</p>

<p>As regards border industries I want to say that we in the United Party have never been blind to the advantages of decentralization for economic, sociological and strategic reasons. But care and attention must be given to that. It is not right that for strategic reasons all our development should be in half a dozen highly developed areas. It is true that the urbanization of the Bantu people brings many problems in its train. But at the same time there may be cases where there will be an advantage in moving a factory to the worker rather than the workers to the factories. The paramount consideration remains that the policy of decentralization must not be carried out in a manner that will lead to the disruption of the economy as a whole. It must have regard to what industry can bear and the costs of production and productivity. I have listed several important points to which I believe the Government should give attention. But I believe that the security of the Republic and loyalty to the Republic can only be ensured by establishing a federal form of government here in South Africa. I believe that a federal form of government will allow for group differences and varying rates of development and will provide the protection of one authority over the whole country. The fundamental principle in the race federation scheme is that each group administers its own affairs through its own institutions of Government as far as possible. In order to elect representatives to such communal institutions or councils there must logically be separate voters&#x2019; rolls. But equally fundamental is the principle that each race must be representated in the body that deals with matters of common concern and exercises sovereignty over all South Africans, that is the central Parliament.</p>

<p>Oh yes. I do not think that the hon. the Minister paid sufficient attention to what was going on in Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>I have noticed that hon. members opposite have been very quick to seize upon the figures of the number of representatives for the Coloureds, Bantu and the Indians, both in this House and in the Upper House. They have been particularly anxious to seize upon the fact that Coloureds will have the right to elect their own people. But they have been very disappointed to find that we did not think it was right that the Bantu should be represented by Bantu. The hon. the Prime Minister particularly has criticized me very severely for having changed my mind on that subject. Just to put the record right I want to read to him what was said by the late Prime Minister on the issue of sovereign independent black states. This is what he said in 1951:</p>

<block name="quote">All those areas can become self-governing and in this sense they can have baasskap over their own fate, but all the areas will be in the geographic and economic unit of the Union of South Africa and dependent on it. Also in respect of any international relations concerning the defence of this country. it speaks for itself that South Africa is the trustee and the ruler of the whole.</block>

<p>Then a pamphlet was written at the time of one of the previous elections. This is what it said:</p>

<block name="quote">In die reservate kry die Naturelle ook vir &#x2019;n aantal vasgestelde sake op verskillende maniere selfbestuur onder die leiding van die Regering, soos onder andere bepaal deur die 1959-wet, selfs die hoogste vorm van selfbestuur wat huile kan geniet, maar word die reservate nog geen onafhanklike state soos die Verenigde Party valslik beweer het. Huile val nog onder die algemene gesag van die Regering wat die belangrike algemene sake, soos byvoorbeeld verdediging, behartig.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, do you know who was the author of that pamphlet&#x003F; It was the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. There later came a change in that policy, because that is not their policy at the moment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It is not their policy to make them sovereign independent states. It makes that quite clear. I now wish to quote a part of the speech of the late Prime Minister when he announced the change&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Bantoe sal kan ontwikkel tot aparte Bantoestate. Dit is nie wat ons graag sou wou gesien het nie. Dit is &#x2019;n vorm van verbrokkeling wat ons nie graag sou wou gehad het as dit binne ons beheer was om so iets te vermy nie. In die lig van die magte wat toesak op Suid-Afrika is daar egter geen twyfel dat dit mettertyd sal moet gedoen word.</block>

<p>In other words, Sir, the policy has been changed, and changed as a result of pressure from outside, since the announcement on the 10th April, 1961 (Afrikaans Hansard, Vol. 107, Col. 4277). The hon. the Prime Minister is welcome to study it. He will find that the whole basis of his policy to-day, is a change brought about by pressure from outside. Then he complains, Sir, that I have changed my mind and say that there is no pressure for Black to sit in the House. The point I had wanted to come to is this. While hon. gentlemen have paid so much attention to the representation of Bantu and other non-Whites in this House, they missed one of the essential [inks in the policy we have outlined. That is that there should be a link by way of a committee of this House with a committee of each of the communal councils, and that that joint committee should be bound by Statute to consult on matters affecting the non-white people dealt with in this House. In other words there would be a link with the Coloured Council, a link with the Indian Council, and a link with the different Bantu Communal Councils, which would result in their being able to discuss matters of importance to the non-European people. It would result in their being able to get a clear idea of each other&#x2019;s point of view. We would not be faced with the position that when we came to this House we had to rely on what the Minister says the non-European is wanting; there would be people in this House who would have discussed the matters with them and had their point of view. But I am not going to deal with the representation of the various groups. It has been set out in every Nationalist propaganda newspaper and every nationalist organ. What I am going to say is that the picture of federation emerges clearly. A separate role for each group; a communal council or councils for each group; defined representation for each group in the central Parliament; and links between the various groups and the central Parliament by a system of linking committees. On that road I believe lies future development in South Africa. By way of the linking committees we can get the position where there will be a greater understanding of each other&#x2019;s desires, aspirations and needs. I think, Sir, that the concept of <span class="col_331-332" refersTo="page_0185"/>apartheid fails, because it is utterly impracticable. We are not separated economically, territorially or politically in South Africa.</p>

<p>With pleasure, let me just finish this section. You see, Sir, we can practise conventional separation on social levels; that is sensible.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a party to the decisions in Bloemfontein, they had his full support and he stands completely with me on this issue.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has been giving guarantees, but I can give guarantees too. They can rely on my guarantees. I believe that this is a development on the basis of which we can have progress in South Africa, and that the federal concept is the only basis on which the races can live together within one state in South Africa. Thereby we can channel the individual abilities and the contributions of each race, to the best advantage of all. In a nutshell, if I may put it this way, the United Party policy, I believe, will strengthen and protect the role of the Whites in South Africa; will develop the country&#x2019;s resources in order to strengthen its economy; will improve continually the standards of living of the people of all races; and will establish a system of government that will ensure that all races cooperate harmoniously to their mutual benefit, freeing other groups of the fear of being swamped by a black majority, by providing opportunities for the full development of the Bantu people themselves. We maintain naturally traditional, social and residential separation. I believe we can make South Africa stronger than it would ever be under divided authority, by keeping it under one authority. I think it is right, after all that we have heard of the criticism of this policy on the other side&#x2014;very ill-informed criticism&#x2014;that I should quote from a body of opinion, which I know hon. members opposite do not regard as being English Press. There was an evaluation of that policy by an organ of the English Press&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party&#x2019;s federal alternative to separate nationhood, as developed and clarified by last week&#x2019;s central congress, must command the serious consideration of all. These proposals do have the merits of being in touch with life and reality and do represent a serious attempt to come to grips with the inescapable facts of South African life. The United Party&#x2019;s federal framework must be seen as a flexible, adaptable framework that could absorb stresses and strains and be developed as needs be to meet concrete real life situations. The United Party&#x2019;s federal plan can claim attention as a concrete alternative to a Nationalist dispensation. which is at best a rapidly receding mirage, and at worse racial tyranny softened by slogans.</block>

<p>That is the <i>Cape Times</i> of 30th October of last year.

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as I know this is the very first time in the history of this country that a Parliament on South African soil is asked to consider legislation on prize jurisdiction. As hon. members probably know, it is a centuries old general rule of international law that belligerents may in time of war seize and appropriate private sea-vessels and any property thereon belonging to the enemy. The origin of so-called prize courts to decide about the legitimacy of the capture of enemy property can in fact be traced back to the Middle Ages, when lawlessness at sea was the order of the day. Until the introduction of the Consolato del Mare, however, there had been no clearly defined rules in regard to the capture of enemy property. As is known, the Consolato del Mare was a set of maritime rules and customs regulating the capture of ships and any property thereon them and observed by the communities of the Mediterranean region. Important sections of those rules were replaced by the famous Declaration of Paris in 1856, but the general rule authorizing belligerents to capture private enemy property remained intact.</p>

<p>In the course of time, however, the development of aviation necessitated an extension of the general rule regarding the capture of private enemy property, as the air, like the open sea, is an international thoroughfare used by both belligerent and neutral countries. Accordingly the Hague Air Rules were formulated as far back as at the Hague conference of 1923, and even then it was accepted that aircraft, like ships, might be captured. The British, wasting no time, passed legislation as far back as 1939 in terms of which the right of capture was declared applicable also to aircraft and anything thereon.</p>

<p>Summarized briefly, it therefore amounts to this, that the capture of private enemy property consisting of ships, aircraft and any property thereon by belligerents in time of war is authorized by international law. As a rule, however, the property of neutral powers may not be captured in this way. Besides, unlike in the case of captured public property such as warships, the right of ownership in captured private property does not <i>ipso facto</i> pass to the captor upon capture. As a matter of fact, at every capture the question arises whether it was a legitimate capture, that is to say, whether it was made in accordance with international law. For this purpose every belligerent is obliged by international law to establish a court or courts in its own area, which for the sake of convenience we may call prize courts. The captor must bring the property captured by him into the area of jurisdiction of one of his prize courts without delay and must submit the matter to the prize court concerned. The court concerned then decides all questions relating to the legitimacy of any capture and at the same time in fact serves as a safeguard to neutral powers that they will not lose their property through illegimate capture. If such a prize court finds that any particular capture was legitimately made, it declares the captured property forfeited to the captor, upon which the right of ownership in the property passes to the captor. If, on the other hand, the capture is found to have been illegitimately made, the court orders the captured property to be returned to the person from whom it was captured, and the court may in addition make an order as to costs.</p>

<p>As the lawyers among us know, prize courts may be courts of law functioning in a judicial way or administrative tribunals functioning in an administrative way, or they may even be something between courts of law and administrative tribunals. Prize actions are adjudicated upon in terms of international law; prize courts. however, are not international courts, but municipal or national courts. Although they apply international law, they are nevertheless bound by their own national law. In the case of any conflict between international law and national law, the latter prevails.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of South Africa has always exercised prize jurisdiction in this country. This brings me to the question which has probably occurred to hon. members, namely from what source our courts derived their prize jurisdiction in the past. since I stated at the commencement of my speech that this was the first time a South African Parliament was being asked to consider legislation in this connection. The establishment and jurisdiction of prize courts in South Africa are controlled, in some cases since the previous century, by British legislation which applied in the former colonies of which the Republic is composed. The most important of those Acts are the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, and the Prize Courts Act, 1894. The British legislation concerned still applies in the Republic to-day and may be invoked if necessary. I doubt whether hon. members expect me to deal with that legislation in detail here. I may mention briefly that the first-mentioned Act grants admiralty jurisdiction as well as prize jurisdiction to colonial admiralty courts, in our case the various divisions of our Supreme Court, but in spite of that the colonial admiralty courts may not exercise the prize jurisdiction granted to them unless they are specially authorized to do so. In practice such authority will be granted by way of a proclamation issued by the State President, and in 1939 and 1940, for example, it was in fact granted to the provincial divisions of the Cape and Natal as well as the local division of <span class="col_337-338" refersTo="page_0188"/>Natal by proclamation of the then Governor-General. Several prize actions have in fact been adjudicated upon by our courts in the past. As a matter of interest I may mention that the British legislation has been used on occasion to appoint the former High Court of South West Africa, sitting at Walvis Bay, as a prize court. This could be done at Walvis Bay, as you know, actually forms part of the Cape Province.</p>

<p>But times have changed and South Africa is a sovereign and independent Republic today, and hon. members will agree with me that it is quite unfitting for a sovereign and independent state to conduct its affairs in the international field by means of foreign legislation. Furthermore the British legislation of which we have to avail ourselves to-day in the field of prize law, is difficult of access and besides, from the nature of the case, not available in both official languages.</p>

<p>This brings me to the Bill we are dealing with to-day. I believe that, after the observations I have made, the measure is more readily understandable to all of us and that it is therefore not necessary for me to explain the Bill in detail.</p>

<p>The present position is that our courts have to consult international law in determining what is a &#x201C;prize&#x201D; or a &#x201C;matter of prize&#x201D;. As you will notice, however, we are trying in clause 1 to clarify the matter by defining &#x201C;prize&#x201D;. It is, however, not our intention to depart from international law in so far as it regulates the matter in question. The definition is no more than a summary of the provisions of international law in this regard and will, I hope, simplify matters considerably for the courts, legal practitioners and litigants. As I said earlier in my speech, the prize courts of any country are also bound by the national law of the country concerned. Neither does international law prevent us from declaring by statute ourselves what we consider as prize. However, in view of the fact that one is dealing with international matters here, it is obviously desirable to depart as little as possible from the concepts of international law. Hon. members will concede that in the definition of &#x201C;prize&#x201D; we have eminently succeeded in doing justice to the concept of &#x201C;prize&#x201D; as found in international law.</p>

<p>The capture of property on. for example, a ship does not necessarily mean that the ship itself has to be captured. It is also conceivable that a neutral ship may be carrying enemy property. In such a case the &#x201C;Declaration of Paris&#x201D;, which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a neutral flag protects enemy property, except contraband of war, will admittedly apply, but the fact remains that such property may be captured and that the legitimacy of the capture will have to be determined by a prize court.</p>

<p>The prize jurisdiction now being granted to the various divisions of the Supreme Court by Clause 2, corresponds to the prize jurisdiction which they have to-day. The only difference is that in future, as in the case of the major countries of the West, the prize jurisdiction will be permanent and will not have to be granted by proclamation from time to time.</p>

<p>You will also notice that no provision is being made for appeal against the decision of a prize court. We need not be concerned about that, however, as a decision of a prize court will be nothing but a decision of a division of the Supreme Court and will consequently be subject to appeal in terms of the provisions of the Supreme Court Act, 1959, in the same way as any other decision of the said court.</p>

<p>It will be possible to make extensive use of the ordinary rules of the Supreme Court in the adjudication of prize proceedings, but we shall in all probability find it necessary to supplement our rules, judging by the large number of special rules which the British have found it necessary to issue in this connection. As in the case of the ordinary rules of court, it is left to the Chief Justice to issue such special rules.</p>

<p>For the rest I do not think the provisions of the Bill need be elucidated any further.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that all of us in this House are very indebted to the hon. the Minister for the painstaking summary he has given us of the background which has resulted in this Bill coming to this House. Naturally, we have no objection whatever. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will direct his attention in this regard also to those matters relating to shipping cases which have to do with disputes&#x2014;which arise so constantly&#x2014;relating to civil matters in time of peace, as he has done in the case of this Bill which relates merely to prizes, <i>jure belli.</i>When one looks at this Bill one does perhaps wonder whether our sailors might not be a little displeased to find that some of the provisions which applied under the old Colonial laws are being repealed. Under the War Prize Act of 1864, for example, it was possible, if Her Majesty or her successor were to declare that prize bounty was to be granted to officers and men, depending on bow many men there were on the opposing ship, to get &#x00A3;5 per head for every crew member of the enemy ship when the engagement commenced. It was the function of the prize court to determine how many men there were on that ship and each man got &#x00A3;5 per head. One appreciates that perhaps that is to-day a small figure, but in 1864 it was a large figure. It does show that the times have changed and that the encouragements which were given in those days do not apply to-day.</p>

<p>We have no objection to this Bill. There are some aspects of this Bill which we will, during the Committee Stage, ask the hon. the Minister to direct his attention to, namely: How is a condemned prize determined&#x003F; Who determines what prize is a condemned prize&#x003F; And how does the court know it is condemned&#x003F; We should also like to know what other powers and appropriate orders the hon. the Minister has in mind that this court should <span class="col_339-340" refersTo="page_0189"/>in fact have or make, having regard to the history of prizes and the existing legislation. The old order changeth, yielding place to new, but we must fulfil our function in this regard in a new era on the high seas around our coasts. We support the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. the Opposition for the way in which they have accepted this measure. I want to return now to what the hon. member for Durban (North) said. I just want to say that what we are in fact doing here is only to take permanent authority, whereas previously we were on each occasion obliged to put the British Statute into operation by proclamation. This is all we are doing by means of this measure. Furthermore, hon. members must remember that it has always been the position that where international law differed from national law on any particular point, the latter took precedence. This will be the position in future as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall not be surprised if this Bill is received with acclamation in more than one respect. Not only does it contain a great deal which can be of benefit to the administration of justice, it also brings relief in a quarter where it will definitely be welcomed. What I have in mind in the latter connection are particularly those provisions, of which there are quite a number, which are to the benefit of the accused.</p>

<p>There is probably nothing in the Bill which is not clear to us all. Consequently I do not want to deal at length with each clause at this stage, but I do nevertheless want to elucidate a number of important aspects of this Bill for the convenience and information of hon. members. In the first place I think that hon. members are probably interested in the considerations which gave rise to Clause 2. This is the clause which is aimed at making it possible to try offences at a place other than the place where they were committed. In this regard it may be mentioned that it happens fairly frequently that a person commits offences in the area of jurisdiction of more than one Attorney-General, or that he commits an offence in the area of jurisdiction of one Attorney-General, but that most of the witnesses, as for example in the well-known Strachan case, reside in the area of jurisdiction of another Attorney-General. But that is not all. In the congested motor traffic which we find nowadays between one province and another it is by no means a rare occurrence that a person residing in one province is involved in a motor accident whilst travelling in another province and that the passengers in his motor car residing at the same place as he are the sole or most important witnesses to the incident. Should he, months after the event, be charged with culpable manslaughter he, as well as the witnesses, would, for the purposes of the trial, have to return to the place where the collision occurred. This is so because an offence must normally be tried at the place where it was committed. Seen objectively, however, it really makes no difference in what court an offence is tried, because the way in which a trial takes place and the legal principles obtaining at a trial always remain the same irrespective of the place where the offence was committed or where the trial takes place.</p>

<p>The existing legal provisions in the present connection cause unnecessary inconvenience and expense, particularly if it is taken into account that in cases such as the one I gave you as an illustration, an inspection <i>in loco</i> of the scene of the accident is not always a <i>sine qua non,</i> and is in fact seldom carried out in such cases, which are tried in urban centres. In the circumstances therefore we are now creating the machinery whereby the anomalies which are now being encountered may be eliminated to everybody&#x2019;s advantage. In passing it may also be mentioned that there is nothing sinister in the provision where the Minister may order the transference of a trial. Surely it is obvious that the possibility cannot be excluded that two Attorneys-General may not agree on the necessity for a transference of trial, and that for the sake of efficiency it is better that the decision in regard to a transference should be vested in one official only.</p>

<p>I am referring now to Clauses 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9. Hon. members are undoubtedly aware of the fact that a magistrate cannot release on bail any person who has been charged with murder or high-treason and that an accused in such cases must, of necessity, appeal to the Supreme Court if he wishes to be released on bail. The inconvenience and expense in this regard are obvious. I have an idea the reason for the existing provisions in this regard is probably that the said offences are capital crimes for which the death sentence may be imposed. However, there are various other capital crimes, but the same restriction in regard to bail do not exist in respect of those crimes. So, for example, there is nothing to prevent a magistrate from releasing persons on bail who have been charged with robbery, or house-breaking with aggravating circumstances, or even with sabotage, which are all capital crimes, unless an Attorney-General, of course has prohibited their release.</p>

<p>It is well known that in most cases where individuals have been charged with murder, <span class="col_341-342" refersTo="page_0190"/>there is no real danger that they will not appear at their trial should they be released on bail. It is quite unnecessary therefore to compel such persons to apply for bail to the Supreme Court at great cost and inconvenience to themselves. The principles obtaining in a higher court and in a magistrates court in regard to the consideration of an application for bail are precisely the same. In addition it is not the intention, despite the concession we are now envisaging, to deprive an accused of his rights to apply to the Supreme Court for bail. In this regard I should like to draw attention to the provisions of Clause 6. It naturally follows that an accused whose application for bail in a magistrates court has been refused, may appeal the lower court&#x2019;s decision in a higher court. Taking all things into consideration, it would appear to me that we can safely accept the envisaged change.</p>

<p>Since we are dealing with bail, we may as well say a few things about clause 7. The most important provisions of that clause are contained in the proposed section 105 (4). As hon. members know, bail means the releasing of a person under arrest by the entering into of a recognisance by himself and one or more guarantors. The entering of such a recognisance does not require the immediate payment of a cash amount. Actually the recognisance is only an admission of a financial debt which only becomes payable if the accused should neglect to appear to the specified time and the recognisance be declared estreated as a result. A person entering into such a recognisance on behalf of an accused is a guarantor, but although a guarantor, in so far as criminal cases are concerned, may be described as a person who exposes part of his means to estreatment on behalf of an accused, such exposure of his means is not the only requirement which obtains in respect of that person. The general principle in regard to the acceptance of a guarantor, is that the guarantor should have an interest in ensuring that the accused appears at the stipulated time. An agreement whereby a guarantor is indemnified against loss, or the bail is deposited by him, is according to the judgment illegal and against public policy, whether the indemnification is offered by the accused, or some other person. It also follows therefore that a person who has the authority to approve guarantors, is entitled to inquire whether guarantors are in some way or other being indemnified and, if that is the case, to reject them.</p>

<p>However, a person who, in terms of section 105 (1) pays a cash amount on behalf of another person is according to a recent decision of the local division of the Witwatersrand Supreme Court not a guarantor although he. just as in the case of a guarantor, exposes part of his means to forteiture on behalf of an accused Obviously such a person does not have all the rights, nor is he subject to all the obligations of a guarantor, neither can he be rejected even if he enters into an agreement in terms of which he is indemnified against loss of bail.</p>

<p>What has happened now is that in recent years a practice has originated whereby persons who have established so-called bail bureaux are running a profitable undertaking. the <i>modus operandi</i> of these persons is to deposit, on behalf of the accused and with or without his knowledge, the amount laid down by the courts when bail has been determined in respect of an accused. The accused, who is only too pleased to find that he has been released, is then instructed to pay the amount to the depositor within a relatively short time or else be delivered over to the court and the bail withdrawn. Subsequently heaven and earth are moved to acquire the money by some means or other and pay it to the bureau, because the persons concerned are for the most part ignorant of the fact that there is no statutory provision to the effect that they can be delivered up in this way. When the case in question has been finalized, the person who deposited bail with the magistrate gets his money back and subsequently takes the money paid to him by the accused, or a large part thereof, as compensation for the so-called services which he rendered in regard to the release of the accused. There have been cases where only R30 of a bail amount of R60 paid in by a Bantu was paid back to him. This exploitation of people who have found themselves in unfortunate circumstances can no longer be tolerated and steps are therefore being taken now to put an end to it. By way of information I can just say that we know who the people are who are committing these malpractices.</p>

<p>As far as clause 10 is concerned, I think that it is sufficient to say that it is quite illogical for the presence of an accused at the hearing of a serious matter to be excused, whereas this cannot be done in less serious cases. In addition there seems to be no good reason why regional courts should be able to apply the provisions of section 156 bis whereas ordinary magistrates&#x2019; courts are not empowered to do so. In any case there are sufficient statutory provisions which ensure that an accused whose presence at a hearing has been excused will not be prejudiced as a result. In cases where a large number of accused are charged simultaneously, fellow-accused are, however, caused considerable inconvenience if a trial has to be stopped temporarily because one of the accused has become ill.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 15, I just want to draw attention in passing to clause 21. The effect of the amendments which are being envisaged in the latter clause, is to make the acceptance of so-called admissions of guilt without appearance in court possible in those cases where there is reason to suppose that a court will not impose a fine of more than R50. This amount has stood at R30 for more than half a century, and is being increased with a view to the decrease in the value of the monetary unit. Actually the amendment in clauses 15 and 18 are therefore merely consequential amendments arising out of the amendments envisaged in clause 21.</p>

<p><span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_0191"/>Sir, I believe that clause 20, where we are now allowing a court which is required to impose compulsory penalties such as imprisonment for corrective training or imprisonment with a view to preventing a crime, or to declare a person to be a habitual criminal, the discretion of imposing a lighter penalty in certain circumstances, will be welcomed by all. By way of information I can only mention that the envisaged amendment has the support of the judiciary.</p>

<p>Hon. members who are in the legal profession, are undoubtedly aware of the problems raised by the Appeal Court in the case <i>R.</i> v. <i>Limbada and Another</i> in 1961. The position is that if a trial court refuses permission to appeal to the Appeal Court, the accused can turn to the Chief Justice for alleviation. If, however, his application for permission to appeal is not submitted to the trial court within the prescribed period and he subsequently applies for his negligence to be condoned, but the application for condonation is refused, then he cannot appeal to the Chief Justice, no matter how favourable the possibility that his appeal may succeed appears to be, because the Appeal Court does not have the jurisdiction to consider such an application for condonation. We are now trying to eliminate this anomaly by means of clauses 24 and 25. At the same time we are also going a step further. As the jurists amongst us know, the Appeal Court may receive additional evidence at the hearing of an appeal and may, for this purpose, appoint someone to hear the evidence, or the case may be referred back to the trial court for the evidence to be heard. The conditions which according to the judgments, obtain for the receipt of such evidence are:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) that the additional evidence submitted will apparently be accepted as true;</li>

<li>(b) that the evidence is strictly relevant to the result of the trial; and</li>

<li>(c) that there is a reasonably acceptable explanation for failing to submit the evidence at the trial.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Law Revision Committee is of the opinion that the procedure whereby further evidence may be received is cumbersome and that a trial court considering an application to appeal ought to be empowered to consider at the same time an application for the receipt of additional evidence. If the court finds that the requirements of the latter application have been complied with, it must receive the additional evidence, including such evidence which the court or public attorney then submits whereupon that evidence, for the purposes of an appeal, is deemed to be evidence which was heard or allowed at the trial of the accused. I subscribe to this idea and I am convinced that it will facilitate matters considerably for all concerned, but particularly the accused.</p>

<p>I refer lastly to clause 26. Whenever a person is being tried for committing an immoral act against another person, or for blackmail the publication of any information in regard to the trial in question or what is revealed at the trial, is prohibited, unless the court agrees to its publication. Actually the provisions in question are intended for the protection of the complainant in such a case and it is quite fortuitous that the accused is also protected. As you know, a trial begins when the accused is called upon to plead, and it continues until judgment is given. Apparently the prohibition on publication does not apply during the period from the date on which the deed was committed and the date on which the trial commenced. If information in regard to such a case may be published freely during that period the whole purpose of the provisions in question i.e. that the complainant be protected against undesirable publicity is thwarted. The loophole which exists in this connection is now, as hon. members can see, being done away with.</p>

<p>With that, Mr. Speaker. I have explained the more important aspects of the Bill.</p>

<p>This Bill is designed to improve and facilitate the administration of justice and we will support it. The hon. the Minister has dealt with certain clauses. He has particularly mentioned that it is now being made easier for accused persons to obtain bail and I quite agree with his statement that it should always have been done this way. Sir, we are also pleased to see that the Minister is now giving a discretion to the courts to impose lighter sentences than the penalties prescribed by certain Acts. We on this side have continuously opposed minimum sentences and we welcome that provision.

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p><span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_0192"/>This Bill contains only two provisions. The first provision provides that Escom may sell again any commission stock purchased by it out of its redemption fund. The reason why this is considered advisable is that by doing this, Escom stock will more easily be made available to those persons who are interested in them. Some people are interested in long-term investments, others are interested in short-term investments, and if Escom were in a position to sell its own stock it would then to a greater extent be able to meet the need for long or short-term stock, according to the demand. It will also help Escom in the sense that it will then be able to meet its redemption obligations more easily in view of the fact that, if this legislation is agreed to, it will be in a position to dispose of stock owned by the redemption fund when it has to pay off loans.</p>

<p>The second provision of the Bill simply makes provision for the coming into operation of the 1964 Act. In 1964 Parliament passed legislation which empowered Escom to supply electricity outside the borders of the Republic of South Africa as well. Mr. Speaker, you will recall that by and large that was intended for the South-West Africa Water and Electricity Supply Scheme. In this 1964 Bill provision was made for the Act to come into operation on a date to be announced by the State President by way of proclamation. In the meantime and particularly since 1966 Escom has entered into certain obligations in terms of the 1964 Act. Unfortunately Escom itself as well as the then Department of Trade and Industries overlooked the fact that the 1964 Act had not yet been put into operation, and for that reason, since it is no longer possible for us to make the Act of retrospective effect by way of proclamation we are now making provision for the 1964 Act to be deemed to have come into operation on 1st January, 1966.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The aim of this Bill to amend the Land Bank Act is. in the first place, to make provision for the introduction of a gratuity scheme for members of the Land Bank Board, a scheme similar to those which already exist for members of other full-time statutory boards.</p>

<p>Another amendment which takes up a large part of the contents of this amending Bill, is the repeal of the remaining provisions of the existing dipping tank laws of 1911 and 1913, and the incorporation in the Land Bank Act of those parts thereof which under present-day circumstances are still of importance. Originally these laws granted the then Department of Agriculture certain powers for granting dipping tank loans, but as long ago as 1921 those functions were taken over by the Land Bank by legislation. Since then the position has been that such dipping tank loans are granted by the Land Bank in terms of the provisions of the existing dipping tank laws. However, as the dipping tank laws themselves serve no other purpose as substantive laws, the necessary enabling provisions for granting the loans concerned are now being incorporated in the Land Bank Act.</p>

<p>One of the types of loans the Land Bank may grant to farmers, is an advance in the form of a cash credit account which enables the farmers to defray any costs incurred in connection with the production, cultivation, gathering, processing or marketing of his crop. The security for this sort of loan consists of a prohibition on the transfer or alienation of that farmer&#x2019;s land until such time as he has repaid the debt and a pledge held by the Bank in respect of the crops and of articles and substances purchased by the farmer with the aid of such a loan.</p>

<p>At the moment the Act provides that in cases of non-payment of instalments or in other warranted circumstances, the Bank may, without recourse to a court of law, seize and sell the crops which were produced with the aid of such a loan and which are subject to a pledge held by the Bank for the purpose of recovering the loan. Although the Act also grants the Bank a similar right of pledge in respect of articles and substances purchased with the aid of such a loan, such goods can, however, not be sold for the purpose of recovering the debt without a judgment being passed by a court of law. That means that the Bank must inevitably incur the additional costs of such a judgment, which may in certain cases defeat the object of the sale. It is for that reason that this amending Bill contains a provision which empowers the Bank to seize and sell, without recourse to a court of law, articles and substances purchased with the aid of such a loan, under the same circumstances and in the same way as the crops themselves.</p>

<p>In the Land Bank Act there are at the moment two shortcomings that are connected with certain provisions contained in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1966. As hon. members most probably know the Land Bank grants mortgage loans to farmers for the purchase of livestock or farming implements at security of a pledge on the goods purchased. The Bill provides <i>inter alia,</i>that when such a mortgagor&#x2019;s <span class="col_347-348" refersTo="page_0193"/>estate is declared insolvent, the hypothecated property does not vest in the trustee of his estate. By virtue of its statutory powers the Bank itself may either seize or sell such property, or it may hand it over to the trustee to he sold by him. However, it is not only in the case of insolvency that a person&#x2019;s assets are according to law vested in a trustee. When in certain circumstances a compromise is effected with a farmer&#x2019;s creditors in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act, his assets vest in an appointed liquidator. Similarly, in cases where a farmer&#x2019;s creditors have acquired a proposal for a compromise in terms of agricultural credit law and where in the process the farmer prefers to surrender his assets in favour of his creditors, his assets vest in a trustee to be sold by him. If a farmer whose assets vest in a liquidator or trustee in one of these ways, is a mortagagor of the Land Bank, the consequences thereof are, as far as the Bank is concerned, essentially the same as when such a farmer has been declared insolvent. In such cases, too, such a mortgagor&#x2019;s property which has been pledged to the Bank, ought therefore not to vest in the liquidator or trustee in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act, and in order to protect its interests the Bank ought to be vested with the same powers as it has in the case of a farmer&#x2019;s insolvency. Provision is therefore being made for this in this amending Bill.</p>

<p>The second shortcoming in the Land Bank Act is also connected with liquidators and trustees who have been appointed in the circumstances I have already mentioned, in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act. The Land Bank Act prescribes to the Bank to whom, in specific circumstances, a surplus which arose out of the sale of land pledged to the Bank, has to be paid over. In this way, for instance, in the event of the death of the debtor, the surplus is paid to the executor of his Estate, and where he is insolvent, to his trustee.</p>

<p>However, in cases where in terms of the Agricultural Credit Act a liquidator or trustee was appointed for the debtor, the Act does not contain the necessary provision for such a surplus to be paid over to that liquidator or trustee. Therefore this gap is also being filled now.</p>

<p>In regard to the provisions of the Land Bank Act which grant the Bank its special powers for seizing and selling land pledged to it in specific circumstances, there are certain shortcomings which are now being set right. In the first place, at present references are still being made in the Act to the Administration of Estates Act of 1913 and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act of 1935. However, both of them have already been replaced by the new Administration of Estates Act of 1965 and the Agricultural Credit Act of 1966. Although the references to these Acts will for yet another while have to remain in the Land Bank Act, it is also necessary in this Act to refer to the two new Acts. This is being done.</p>

<p>Then, as regards the procedure to be followed by the Bank so as to seize and sell immovable property that has been pledged to it, the Act provides, in the first place, that the Bank may enter upon and take possession of such property without recourse to a court of law. In the light of legal advice taken by the Bank, there is doubt as to whether an attachment executed by the Bank in the ordinary way, by notice to the debtor and the registrar of deeds, is valid if it does not involve some physical act or other in compliance with the present requirement laid down in the Act, namely that the land should in fact be entered upon as well. To remove this doubt and to clarify the exact effect of such an attachment, an appropriate amendment is now being effected in the Act.</p>

<p>After the attachment has been executed, and before the sale can take place, it is required in the Act at present that at least 14 days before the sale is to be held, the Bank is to publish in the <i>Gazette</i> and in a newspaper in circulation in the district where the property is situated, a notice stating the date, the hour, the place and the conditions of the sale. In the past it was customary only to publish the basic conditions of sale in that notice, but according to a recent judgment of the Supreme Court, this particular requirement laid down in the Act is interpreted to mean that the Bank is obliged to state in the notice all of the conditions which may eventually have a bearing on the sale of the property. In many cases it is impracticable to comply strictly with these requirements, because the existence of leases in regard to the property that has to be sold, claims for fencing contributions from adjoining owners, claims laid by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure to the proprietary rights of crops grown on the land and traders&#x2019; pledges in respect of pumping and other equipment, often come to the knowledge of the Bank only after the publication of the notice. For this very reason it has always been customary in the past to announce all the conditions of sale immediately before the start of the auction. In order to obviate this problem with which the Bank has been confronted as a result of the court&#x2019;s judgment, the Act is now being amended in such a way that the Bank is only required to publish in the notice the terms of payment of the purchase price, whereas all the other conditions of sale have to be announced immediately before the auction commences. Whereas in the past the Act did not require any description of the property that is being sold to be stated in the notice, any misunderstanding that may arise in this respect is now being obviated by the insertion of a provision to the effect that the notice must contain a description of the property according to the title deed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Act provides that the Bank may sell the whole or part of the security for its mortgage debt. The interpretation that has been attached to this in the past, was that it granted the Bank a discretion to decide whether all the properties pledged to it collectively <span class="col_349-350" refersTo="page_0194"/>in the form of a mortgage should be sold, or whether only some of them should be sold. Although it has always been the policy of the Bank, if possible, not to sell more than is necessary to cover the debts under its mortgage, the Bank has nevertheless in its sales tried not only to sell a part of its security if that in itself did not form an economic unit, nor to leave a part of it unsold if that, too, did not form an economic unit. This is of course in accordance with the Government&#x2019;s policy which is opposed to the uneconomic subdivision of land.</p>

<p>In the court judgment which I have already mentioned earlier on, it was found, however, that the Bank did not have a discretion to sell more of the pledged property than was necessary to cover the debts under the mortgage. That means that in certain cases the Bank is now obliged to sell uneconomic units or to leave uneconomic units unsold, and in order to obviate that the Act is now being amended so as to grant the Bank a specific discretion in this respect.</p>

<p>As the Minister has said in his lengthy and detailed explanation, this Bill modifies the present Act, and it is generally agreed to by the farming community. We support the Second Reading of the Bill. It contains a number of improvements which allow the Land Bank to hold property instead of summarily realizing it, and generally speaking it is an administrative measure which is intended to bring the Act up to date.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill deals with the amendment of two relatively old Acts. The principal Act was passed 57 years ago. Consequently one can understand, seeing that circumstances have changed considerably since that time, that some of the provisions have become outdated and obsolete and therefore no longer serve any purpose. In other cases it is necessary to modernize the provisions and to adapt them to present-day circumstances and requirements for practical purposes. By doing that, we want to make provision for the fine and important work done to date by the Public Debt Commissioners to be continued even more efficiently. I may just mention that we intend to consolidate all the provisions relating to the Public Debt Commissioners at an early opportunity.</p>

<p>In the light of what I have already said, some of the proposed amendments are of an obviously administrative nature which in my opinion need no explanation. Consequently I shall just explain some of the more important amendments.</p>

<p>In the first place I therefore want to refer you to clause 3. Under the existing provisions the Commissioners may invest funds deposited with them in terms of section 9 of the principal Act only in local Government stock or in securities having not more than five years to run of the United Kingdom or the Government of India or of any British Colonial Government. For many years, however, the investments have been restricted to local Government stock only.</p>

<p>In the first place this amendment therefore proposes the extension of the field of investment of the Commissioners for funds held by them in terms of section 9 of the principal Act so as to include investments by them in stock of, for instance, the Land Bank, local authorities, the Rand Water Board, ESCOM, or otherwise in any securities of the institutions listed in the proposed new section 10. You will notice, however, that certain restrictions are imposed, that investments in securities of some institutions will in addition be subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>The following, <i>inter alia,</i> are the reasons why the Commissioners feel that it would be in the public interest if they were to be allowed to invest in stock of municipalities or other public utility undertakings as well.</p>

<p>Firstly, owing to the Commissioners&#x2019; participation, there is a reasonably lively market in gilt-edged securities, in other words, safe Government stock. Unfortunately, the semi-gilt-edged market, that is, stock of, for example, municipalities and public utility undertakings, is stagnant and holders of such stock find it very difficult to sell. The difference in return between gilt-edged and semi-gilt-edged investments is &#x00BE; per cent in the case of long-term securities, and as much as 1&#x00BC; per cent or more in the case of short-term securities. Without more effective support the difference in return may become even larger. If the Commissioners were to be allowed to buy more stock of municipalities and public utility undertakings, they would be able to create a more lively market in semi-gilt-edged securities, which would generally have a favourable effect on the capital market.</p>

<p>Secondly, the Commissioners are already allowed to invest certain provincial pension funds and funds which they hold in terms of section 16 of the principal Act, in stock of municipalities and utility undertakings which yield a better return, but pension funds of the Central Government and other funds which they hold in terms of section 9, must be invested in Government securities which yield &#x00BE; per cent less per annum. This anomaly will be removed if the Commissioners are allowed to buy more stock of municipalities and utility undertakings.</p>

<p><span class="col_351-352" refersTo="page_0195"/>Thirdly, ESCOM, for example, is experiencing problems in financing its loan programme which has a detrimental effect on the capital market. If the Commissioners were to be allowed to buy more ESCOM stock, it would be possible to lessen the discouraging effects ESCOM&#x2019;s loan requirements have on the capital market, and ESCOM would find it easier to satisfy its loan requirements. I do want to issue a warning, however, that the State will retain its first claim on the Commissioners&#x2019; funds. If this clause is passed, the municipalities and utility corporations must not expect that an unlimited source of funds will be available. Subject to the requirements of the State, however, I am sure that the Commissioners will try their best to help these institutions.</p>

<p>The Commissioners, therefore, recommend that the Act be amended in such a way that they will be allowed to invest up to a maximum of 15 per cent of the deposits in question which they have under their control on the preceding 31st day of March of each year in any of the securities proposed in the new section.</p>

<p>In the second place, the existing provisions relating to foreign investment are being amended. Although the Commissioners seldom invest in securities of foreign governments or of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, there are occasions when this is necessary. Therefore, provision for such eventualities is being made, but where the existing provisions restrict the Commissioners as far as securities of foreign governments are concerned to the United Kingdom, India or a British Colonial Government, this is now being amended and provision is now being made for securities of any foreign government. We do not at present have any such foreign investments in mind, but these will in any case be subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>The proviso to the existing section 10 falls away, because officials are no longer allowed to convert part of their pensions into a cash payment.</p>

<p>Clauses 5 and 6 do not actually contain anything new. These are existing provisions and procedures which are merely being included in a more specified and clearer form; or, where something had previously been the practice over the years, it is now being embodied in the Act.</p>

<p>You will find another important amendment in clause 11. At present the Commissioners can see no sound reasons why stock purchased for the Sinking Fund must, as the Act at present provides, be retained by them until the expiry date of the stock. In the case of other funds under the control of the Commissioners a watchful eye is being kept over the investment portfolio of a fund and where it is in the interests of a fund to sell the stock and make a more profitable investment, this is done. Such conversion of stock not only benefits the fund concerned, but the resultant buying and selling of stock also help to create a market in Government securities which is so essential for a country&#x2019;s economy.</p>

<p>By obliging the Commissioners to retain the investments of the Sinking Fund up to the expiry date, that Fund&#x2019;s investment portfolio of more than R85 million is being frozen and it can be of little value to the money and capital market in general. What is more, the Sinking Fund is also being deprived of the advantages which can be gained from such a judicious and periodical revision of its investment portfolio. It will, therefore, be in the ublic interest to allow the Commissioners more freedom as envisaged by the amendment.</p>

<p>Clause 12 does not contain any new provisions and the proposed amendment is merely consequential upon the repeal of sections 7 and 8 of the principal Act. Section 4 provides that any funds which may become available for the redemption of debt shall be paid to the Commissioners for the credit of the General Sinking Fund and shall be applied by the Commissioners to the purchase of stock or debentures of the Government which shall thereupon be cancelled.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side support the second reading of this Bill with certain reservations. As the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, the whole object of this Bill is to make the task of investment by the Public Debt Commissioners more flexible. It gives them a more open market and greater opportunity to invest funds in various organizations. During the Committee Stage we will go into the matter in greater detail, but I think it is only right that we should at this stage point out to the Deputy Miniser those items with which we on this side do not entirely agree. I refer particularly to clause 3 on page 5 which provides for two classes of investments, namely &#x201C;securities issued by a body owned or controlled by the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa Limited&#x201D;, or &#x201C;securities issued by any other body established by or in terms of any law&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister refers to investments in companies controlled by the Industrial Development Corporation. We do not quarrel with investment in the I.D.C., but when it goes further than that and deals with companies controlled by that body, then we feel that the definition is too wide because it does not contemplate what may happen if amounts are invested in securities of companies which subsequently are not controlled by the I.D.C. The I.D.C. makes investments in various companies and we have at times queried some of the investments they have made. In fact, it is often very difficult indeed to obtain full particulars as to the investments made by this body. We know that some of its investments in certain companies are not as profitable as the companies first promised and in some cases the I.D.C. is having great difficulty in pulling these companies straight. Having regard to the nature of the funds invested by the Public Debt Commissioners and the necessity for ensuring <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0196"/>that these funds are securely invested, it seems to be inadvisable to give them such wide powers to invest in companies which are controlled by these companies because it may be that stock in those companies may show a loss on realization. The price of stock invested in companies depends upon the prospects of early realizability which depends upon the prosperity of the company concerned. It also depends upon the history of their profitability. For those reasons one must question in some cases investments by this body. The funds of the I.D.C. are of course guaranteed by the Government, but it does not necessarily follow that when it initially obtains control of a company, it will continue to maintain such control. For example, the I.D.C. may invest in a company and subsequently the minority shareholders in that company may get an offer from another organization and may decide to buy the majority shares from the I.D.C. They then approach the I.D.C. and say that they have reached the stage where they feel that they would sooner have control of the company themselves and come to an arrangement with another company. They then make an offer to the I.D.C. to buy its stock. In this case the Public Debt Commissioners are in this position, namely that they are holding investments in that company while the I.D.C. has relinquished control because it has sold the controlling interest and the Public Debt Commissioners find that they are holding stock which is no longer controlled by the I.D.C. When they want to put these shares on the market they may find that they are not in such an advantageous position. I submit that it is not advisable for funds of this kind to be placed in investments of this kind.</p>

<p>I come now to paragraph (i) which states &#x201C;securities issued by any other body established by or in terms of any law&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, I submit that that provision is far too wide altogether. I think that there is ample cover under the various heads of investment already given in this clause. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will during the Committee Stage give us reasons for making the field of investment so wide. Mr. Speaker, we support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, where the Bill provides for consolidation, we will naturally support it, but the hon. the Minister himself has put his finger on the vulnerable part of this Bill, namely clause 3. I do not, however, intend to discuss clause 3 at this stage. The time to do that will be during the Committee Stage. It seems to me that the Public Debt Commissioners are now going into the market. They are conservative and invest Government funds. Anyone who is familiar with investment knows how they operate, but now they are broadening their scope and going into commercial investment. They are spreading their wings and are going to fly in a different direction. I think it is a matter which we will have to consider very seriously. We shall naturally consider it when clause 3 is under examination during the Committee Stage.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pinetown and the hon. member for Kensington referred to clause 3. The hon. member for Kensington spoke in very general terms and said that the Commissioners were now going into business and that the field which they may enter may perhaps have been made somewhat wide. I do not think that the hon. members have objections to the principle involved, namely, the opening of a slightly wider field to the Commissioners. I think the question the hon. members are concerned about, is this: Where should the line now be drawn, how far may they go and where must they stop. These things we may discuss and I have no objections to such a discussion. I should like to refer to paragraph (h) to which the hon. member for Pinetown also referred, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">securities issued by a body owned or controlled by the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa, Limited.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I admit that this clause opens the door rather wide. I think I may say at this stage that it is not the intention that the Commissioners are to utilize the stock of these companies to such a large extent, or that that is what they envisage. In the first instance hon. members must remember that such investment will in any case be subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance. If this carries no weight with them, I will proceed to the next argument. Actually the only thing envisaged in paragraph (h) is to make provision for investments in the industrial undertakings which the Industrial Development Corporation may establish and conduct in terms of section 3 (a). The undertakings established and conducted in terms of section 3 (a) are those which may in terms of the said section be established and conducted with the approval of the State President. There are only two at present, namely Sasol and Foskor. That is what the Commissioners envisage. I am aware that the clause opens the door wider than actually envisaged by the Commissioners. If the hon. members are concerned about this provision I shall consider moving an amendment during the Committee Stage to make this applicable only to the undertakings established in terms of section 3 (a) of the Industrial Development Act. Under present circumstances that would provide for purchases from Sasol and Foskor only. Then the field will not be as wide open as now visualized by the hon. members.</p>

<p>The next provision to which the hon. member for Pinetown has objected in particular, is paragraph (i), namely:</p>

<block name="quote">securities issued by any other body established by or in terms of any law.</block>

<p>This is not so wide. These are bodies established in terms of laws passed by this Parliament. <span class="col_355-356" refersTo="page_0197"/>In other words, these are Iscor, the Rand Water Board, the Broadcasting Corporation, and Escom. It includes only these few. I think that when the bon. member for Pinetown looks into the clause more closely, he will not have such a material objection to that paragraph. It is not just any company for which application for registration is made to the Registrar of Companies; they are bodies established by laws passed by this Parliament. It refers only to those few bodies. There may perhaps be one or two more. I think the objections which the hon. members have and which deserve my consideration, are those which relate to paragraph (h), and I shall consider moving a suitable amendment to that paragraph during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the present temporary basis on which subsidies are paid to the provinces is laid down in section 2 of the Financial Relations Amendment Act, 1957 (Act No. 38 of 1957). When this temporary arrangement was proposed as an interim measure for a provisional period of three years, it was explained why subsidies could not continue to be paid to the provinces on the basis laid down in the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, 1945. I do not intend elaborating on that. The then Minister of Finance also explained, however, that, since it was extremely difficult to find a formula which could continue to work satisfactorily for both the Government and the provinces, the Government would have the whole matter investigated by a commission or committee. When the temporary formula was extended for a further period of three years in 1959, it was explained to hon. members that, for various reasons, it had not yet been possible to appoint a commission of inquiry. This commission of inquiry into the financial relations between the Central Government and the provinces under the chairmanship of Professor Schumann &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; was able to commence its business only by the middle of 1960, and its final report was received during 1964, after it had first brought out an interim report on the take-over of Coloured education. That is my reply to the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall, however, that in the meantime another committee, namely the Borckenhagen Committee, was carrying out an inquiry into the financial relations among the Central Government, the provinces and local authorities. Although this committee was dealing more specifically with the inquiry into the finances of local authorities and arising from that, the financial relations with the provincial authorities, it gradually became clear from the interim reports brought out on various matters by the Committee that the reports of the Schumann Commission and the Borckenhagen Committee would have to be dealt with jointly and simultaneously in considering them finally. The final report of the Borckenhagen Committee, that is to say, the report on Divisional councils, was received about a year ago.</p>

<p>Attention has been given to the reports in the meantime, but hon. members will appreciate that, owing to the complicated nature, implications and extent of the whole matter, it will not be possible to complete the correlation, study and consideration of the reports and proposals regarding a different formula of subsidization before the end of this financial year. The existing legislation provides for the payment of subsidies to the provinces up to 31st March, 1968, only it is necessary, therefore, for the present temporary basis of subsidization to be extended for another year.</p>

<p>The matter is being tackled in earnest at the moment, and we are determined to try and reach finality this year.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may point out that in cases where a province found it impossible during the past few years to balance its finances during any financial year, its statutory subsidy was supplemented by the Government by way of a special extra-statutory grant voted by Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support the Second Reading of this Bill. It is patchwork legislation, because we are still waiting to receive the Schumann Commission&#x2019;s report. The Minister made reference to it, but what is the great secret about it&#x003F; Why cannot it be published&#x003F; Why can we not all see it&#x003F; Or are they finding the Schumann Commission&#x2019;s report so damaging to the Government that they want to keep it a secret&#x003F; Will the Schumann Commission report embarrass them&#x003F;</p>

<p>As far as the Borckenhagen Commission&#x2019;s report is concerned it looks to us as if it is going to exceed the Press commission in length of time. &#x201C;This year, next year, sometime, never!&#x201D; Surely, as a matter of finance, and having regard to the urgency of the matter, it is necessary that the relation between the provincial finance and that of the Central Government should be put on a sound basis. That is common cause on both sides of this House. The Government has accepted that and appointed the Commission of Inquiry. But here, <span class="col_357-358" refersTo="page_0198"/>Mr. Speaker, the Minister has just said &#x201C;Nog &#x2019;n jaar&#x201D;, another hand-out. It is very unsatisfactory. It is time that the Borckenhagen Commission finished its work. It is time that we have their report. It is time that the Schumann Commission&#x2019;s report is tabled in this House, so that we may see and read its conclusions for our own edification and get an opportunity of seeing this vexed question of provincial financial relations put on a much sounder basis than it is to-day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just have to reply to what the hon. gentleman said. As far as these reports are concerned, I stated explicitly that the Government regarded it as necessary&#x2014;and the hon. member for Pinetown would agree with that if he was better informed&#x2014;to consider the reports, namely the report of the Schumann Commission and that of the Borckenhagen Commission, jointly when determining the new formula. [Interjections.] I shall come to that in a moment if hon. members will just be patient. Five parts of the report of the Borckenhagen Commission have been made available. There are ten parts. The first five parts have already been made available, while the next two parts have been made available to the municipal associations as being confidential. I am afraid these parts are no longer as confidential to-day as they were intended to be. In any case, three parts are still outstanding. A White Paper will be prepared in due course. [Interjections.] Well. Mr. Speaker, we have asked for an extension of one year. I will have to do one of two things. I will either have to finalize the matter this year or ask for another year next year. I would not have asked for one year if I thought that I needed two more years. Since it is our intention to finalize the matter within a year if it is at all humanly possible to do so, we are asking for an extension of only one more year, and we intend submitting a White Paper to you before the end of that year, on which occasion the reports of the Schumann Commission and the Borckenhagen Commission will probably be submitted as well. For the purposes of the studying and assimilation of these reports by the Government it is not considered desirable to make the remaining reports available at this stage. I think that is sufficient promise to the hon. gentleman opposite.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House go into Committee on the Estimates of the Additional Expenditure of the South African Railways and Harbours to be defrayed from Revenue Funds during the year ending 31st March, 1968 [R.P. 3&#x2014; &#x2019;68], and on the Estimates of Additional Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works during the same period [R.P. 4&#x2014;&#x2019;68].</block>

<p>Hon. members will have observed from the documents already tabled, that the Estimates of Additional Expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue Funds for the financial year ending 31st March, 1968, require a further amount of R763.800 to be voted.</p>

<p>As is customary, I shall not comment at this stage on the revenue prospects. When the main Estimates are presented to this House on 13th March, 1968, details of the working results for the current financial year will be furnished.</p>

<p>I do want to mention, however, that it is expected that it will now be possible to cut the original Estimates of Expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue Funds by approximately R12 million so that the original amount to be voted may be decreased from R730,493,000 to R718,665,800. There are only a few smaller items for which specific provision has to be made.</p>

<p>Of the R596,000 required under Railways&#x2014; Head No. 17&#x2014;approximately R591,000 is in respect of the write-off of assets, mainly rolling stock, which exceeded the provisions originally made in this respect.</p>

<p>Under Harbours&#x2014;Head No. 25&#x2014;approximately R20,000 is required as a result of stock adjustments and R48,000 for assets withdrawn from service.</p>

<p>Under Airways&#x2014;Head No. 30&#x2014;provision was originally made for the payment of an amount of R330,000 as compensation for rights in respect of international traffic to and from Rhodesia and surrounding areas, which, in terms of the pool agreement had to be paid by B.O.A.C. to Central African Airways, but as a result of the establishment of Air Rhodesia, arrangements were made for direct payments by S.A. Airways to Air Rhodesia as from 1st September, 1967. Consequently it is necessary to vote specifically an estimated amount of R100,000 in respect of compensation to Air Rhodesia up to 31st March, 1968, and to decrease the original amount voted by the same amount.</p>

<p>As regards the Additional Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works, an additional amount of approximately R230,000 is required under Head No. 1&#x2014;Construction of Railways &#x2014;because more work than initially anticipated was done during the year on the avoiding line between Chiselhurst and East London Harbour and on the new single line between Kensington (Cape) and Montague aGrdens. An amount of approximately R5&#x00BD; million requires to be voted under Head No. 2&#x2014;New Works on Open Lines.</p>

<p>It is now the intention to finance certain expenditure on cartage service equipment, which would initially have been covered by the Renewals Fund, from Loan Funds. As <span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0199"/>a result of this and the earlier delivery of vehicles, an amount of just over R1 million requires to be voted for cartage services. A good deal more progress than originally anticipated was made during the year in connection with works relating to the elimination of level crossings and an additional amount of R1.1 million is required in this respect. Similarly the more rapid progress in relaying and deviation works on the Belfast&#x2014;Steelpoort, Komatipoort&#x2014;Soekmekaar, Pretoria&#x2014;Messina, Glencoe&#x2014;Hlobane and Hoedspruit&#x2014;Metsi sections necessitates an additional amount of R1 million to be made available. On the conclusion of various relaying works an amount of approximately R216,000, originally charged to the Renewal Fund, has to be reallocated to the Betterment Fund, and this requires Parliamentary appropriation. An amount of approximately R1.6 million in respect of the defraying of belated debits has to be sanctioned by Parliament in terms of a resolution of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours. Under Head No. 3&#x2014;Rolling Stock&#x2014;sanction also has to be obtained for an amount of R215,000 in respect of belated debits. On account of the acute shortage of third class passenger coaches the delivery of this type of vehicle was expedited during the year with the result that this already heavily taxed section of the Renewals Fund will not be able to meet the demand. Consequently it has been decided to finance portion of these costs from Loan Funds, which requires a cash provision of nearly R3.9 million.</p>

<p>Under Head No. 5&#x2014;Harbours&#x2014;<i>inter alia,</i>an additional amount of R450,000 is required as a result of the fact that 28 wharf cranes for Durban Harbour were delivered earlier than anticipated, while approximately R222,000 is required to cover belated debits. Earlier delivery is also the cause of an additional amount of R70,000 in respect of test equipment and approximately R461,000 for workship machinery and equipment having to be provided under Head No. 6&#x2014;Airways. As it is anticipated that the expenditure against the Airways head of the Renewals Fund will exceed contributions during the current year, it has been decided rather to finance a further amount of R&#x00BD; million of the purchase costs of the two Boeing-707-320 aircraft from Loan Funds and to cover the costs of the flight simulator for Boeing-737 aircraft from capital funds as well. This requires an additional amount of R406,000.</p>

<p>With regard to Head No. 7&#x2014;Pipelines&#x2014;a decision has been taken, as hon. members are now aware, to construct a second pipeline and it is estimated that an amount of R4 million will be spent on that during the current financial year. Under Head No. 8&#x2014;Working Capital&#x2014;R2 million is required in respect of additional spare parts and engines which have to be acquired at rising prices for the growing Boeing fleet as well as for the larger number of electric locomotives and motor coaches.</p>

<p>An additional appropriation totalling R18,110,800 is required for Capital and Betterment Works. Savings totalling R11.7 million under the existing appropriation may, however, be utilized in defraying that expenditure, while R1.1 million will be provided from the Level Crossings Elimination Fund and nearly R1.8 million from the Betterment Fund. Consequently only an amount of R31 million in additional loan funds is required. Therefore the total appropriation for Capital and Betterment Works for the current financial year now amounts to R164,027,600.</p>

<p>It is clear that the Opposition is not opposing this motion at this stage, because from the nature of things one is able to discuss these matters better in Committee. But I should like to avail myself of this opportunity&#x2014;I do not often get the opportunity to do so&#x2014;to say that we on this side of the House should like to vote money for the harbours of South Africa at the present time. I think every South African is proud of the achievement of the South African harbour organization in having succeeded to cope with the enormous amount of work thrust on them by occurrences in the Middle East. In this we are not only rendering South Africa a service but also the Western world. Then we also want to avail ourselves of this opportunity to welcome the statement by the hon. the Minister that the elimination of level crossings is being expedited. This is something about which all of us are concerned and we are glad to see that this progress is being made.</p>

<p>In the course of his remarks the hon. the Minister referred to the fact that certain amounts which are now being voted have been transferred from the Renewals Fund to the Betterment Fund and that certain amounts have to be voted in terms of a recent resolution of the Select Committee. I notice, however, that there are more than 120 items on the capital programme for which we have to vote money and which did not appear at all on the main Estimates for this year. I just want to know whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s remarks explain all of these 123&#x2014;I quickly counted them&#x2014;items, because if that is not so it seems to us that something is amiss somewhere, that we have to sanction capital works in a main Estimates at the beginning of a year to find that 123 works are commenced in the course of the year, works which we do not know about and works about which the Administration apparently does not know when the main Estimates are presented to this House.</p>

<p><i>Estimates of Additional Expenditure from Railways and Harbours Revenue Funds:</i></p>

<p>Head 25,&#x2014;Miscellaneous Expenditure&#x2014;Harbours, R67,800:</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from><span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0200"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister how it is that an item, which was originally estimated at R2,000, has now suddenly become R50,000, which is 25 times as much. I refer to item 742 (a), &#x201C;Assets withdrawn from service and written out of Capital Account&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The additional amount provides for adjustments relating to assets withdrawn at Table Bay harbour as a result of the restoration of the eastern mole. The hon. member knows, of course, that when assets are withdrawn, an amount similar to the amount, after depreciation has been deducted, which is still debited to Capital Account, must be credited to Capital Account out of Revenue. For instance, if you withdraw five or six locomotives from service and there is still, say, 50 per cent of the original cost standing as a debit in your Capital Account, then you must get the necessary credit by way of Revenue to write that amount out of the books.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I appreciate the procedure; there is no query about that. My query is that the Estimates for 1967-&#x2019;68 should have foreseen an item of R2,000 which has now suddenly jumped to R50,000, particularly where the item is a harbour item where it should have been foreseen that there was a likelihood of writing off the item. One would have expected that the amount would have been foreseen in the Estimates. What concerns me is the percentage of error, namely 2,500 per cent, in foreseeing the amount to be written off. The procedure to be followed is laid down; that is clear, but what concerns me is the extent of error in an increase of R48,000 on an item of R2,000.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I will get the desired information and give it to the hon. member. You can never estimate what assets are going to be withdrawn. You make provision for more or less a nominal amount. You might have an accident to five or six electric locomotives which are smashed beyond repair. That is something which cannot be foreseen at the beginning of the year. Consequently it is impossible to estimate accurately which assets and what number of assets are going to be withdrawn.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Here we have an opposite error in calculation in that there is a saving of R5 million on an original estimate of R10.9 million, or in other words, a 50 per cent error the other way. The note at the bottom states that the additional expenditure is R229,600.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I can give the hon. member all the information in regard to the increase, but in regard to the savings there will have to be another opportunity to debate that. That is not permitted now under our Rules of Procedure. In regard to the actual reasons for the increase, it is first of all to facilitate the movement of traffic for the new grain elevator. The work was speeded up, but apart from that an additional amount was required for an increase in basic wages, material prices and higher tender prices. I might inform the hon. member that it is virtually impossible to make an accurate estimate of what the cost of an asset is going to be, with these continually rising prices and wages. As regards the Kensington-Montague-Gardens railway, the work was completed much sooner than we originally expected, and there were also increases in prices of materials and basic wages, etc.</p>

<p>Head put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Head 2,&#x2014;New Works on Open Lines, R5,456,800:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>As regards Item 81 on page 13, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would give us an idea as to what arrangements we have with Lesotho in regard to the new goods office. I am discussing this new item of R39,000 which is to be spent. That is at Maseru. Do we lose that asset, or does it remain our property, and if any losses are incurred on this particular line, will the Lesotho Government reimburse us&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then there is Item 95 on page 14 which provides for an additional amount of R295,600. This was previously included in Item 722, but the note at the back states that it is an additional amount which was not foreseen. Is this for additional accommodation again at Langa, and do we also lose the value of the assets in Langa&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, may I draw your attention to Item 722, in which it is stated that this item replaces an item included in the original Estimates. Item 722 in the original Estimates relates to the 1967-&#x2019;68 allotment for new quarters, improvements and the replacement of quarters for non-white staff. I submit that this Item 95 does not relate to quarters; this is for accommodation in the Langa Bantu township. Therefore it is not simply a replacement of an item.</p>

Now the Minister is requesting an additional amount of R21,800.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River wants information in regard to Item 81. For some years the passenger trains have terminated at Marsailles. After discussions with the Lesotho Government, it was decided to allow the passenger trains to go right through to Maseru. That is why this item is provided for, because the facilities for handling passengers and goods were inadequate. The work was started during the current financial year under the Unforeseen Works Allotment, as a matter of urgency. It remains our asset, of course. We do not hand it over to the Lesotho Government and they do not guarantee any losses. There have been no such arrangements in the past, nor will there by any such arrangements in future. The whole thing belongs to us.</p>

<p>In regard to Item 95, there is a very acute shortage of Coloured labour in the Peninsula. The hon. member knows it is the policy to replace Native labour with Coloured labour as far as practicable. Of course, where no Coloured labour is available we have to use Bantu labour. We do not terminate the services of the Bantu. It is when they leave the service or ask for transfer that we, if possible, replace them with Coloured labour. If Coloured labour is not available we use Bantu labour. It was necessary to provide accommodation for 1,000 Bantu in order to prevent a serious dislocation of essential services in the harbour area. That is why this accommodation was provided in Langa. [Interjection.] I think the hon. member should discuss that <span class="col_365-366" refersTo="page_0202"/>under the Vote of my colleagues, and not under mine.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) wanted information about Item 97. This is to provide departmental housing for Whites throughout the Republic and South West Africa. The decision to retain four houses with out-buildings and garages at Dannhauser, originally intended to be disposed of, involved a revised allocation and accounting adjustments from Renewals to Capital Fund.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi referred to Item 71. More efficient and speedy handling of goods and cargo is the purpose in providing for these mechanical appliances. The decision to transfer four fork trucks originally intended for scrapping necessitates the revised allocation and accounting adjustments from Renewals to Capital Account. As regards Item 84, &#x201C;Durban Harbour, Roads Drainage Tracks and Lighting on Reclaimed Sites at Fynnland:&#x201D;, the additional amount is required as the Durban Corporation, taking possible future development in the area into consideration, insisted on a very high standard of drainage, and the additional amount is necessary to complete the drainage.</p>

<p>I am sorry, but the explanation the hon. the Minister gave on Item 97 is not quite clear to me. That is a 1962-&#x2019;63 allotment for white housing. In the Brown Book there are allotments for white housing, but none of them going back as far as 1962-&#x2019;63. The earliest one is in 1964-&#x2019;65.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Item 142 is in respect of the investigation of the nature of the sea bed in the area covered by the proposed Outer Harbour Scheme. The late delivery of equipment required for preliminary investigation work delayed completion. That is the preliminary work for the Outer Harbour Scheme. The hon. member knows that I have appointed a committee to go into the whole matter. Before any further allocations are made the committee will have to report. In regard to Item 143, owing to the high spots in the approach channel the depth is insufficient to accommodate vessels with loaded draughts of approximately 38 feet, especially at neap tide. Work started during the current financial year under the Unforeseen Works Allotment as a matter of urgency. The project under Item 144 is bound up with the development of the Durban harbour as the ship-repair &#x201C;L&#x201D; berth is no longer available for ship repairs. The decision to retain the hangar, originally intended to be demolished, has resulted in a revision of allocation and accounting adjustments from Renewals to Capital. The additional amount is in respect of increased costs. The work has since been completed.</p>

<p>The first pipeline will not be able to carry the additional crude oil. As soon as the refinery at Sasolburg comes into production, a very large quantity of oil will be required. In addition a large quantity of oil is required for the storage campaign on which we are engaged. The present pipeline will not be able to carry all this. A new pipeline must be constructed. As I have said, this is really a matter of Government policy. These additional funds which are required, do not come from the ordinary funds voted for Railway capital works. They are in addition to those funds.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The provisions of this Bill amend various Railways Acts and the implications of each clause are fully explained in the explanatory memorandum <span class="col_369-370" refersTo="page_0204"/>which has been tabled. The matters dealt with are not contentious and my remarks will consequently be brief.</p>

<p>Clause 1 is of a consequential nature and arises from the amendment proposed in clause 4 concerning the payment of pension moneys in respect of the month in which a beneficiary dies. The amendment contains no new principles.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 2 the position is that Act No. 32 of 1895 which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the payment of pension benefits to certain Railway pensioners and widows of ex-servants who receive benefits under the Act, is to be repealed following upon a review of pre-Union legislation. In order to ensure the continued payment of these annuities it is necessary that suitable provision be made therefor in other legislation.</p>

<p>The purpose of clause 3 is to enable the Railway Administration to extend the sale of Bantu beer to all departmental compounds where beer is not sold at present, as well as to departmental non-White cafeterias which actually form part of compounds and are managed and controlled by compound staff.</p>

<p>In terms of extant legislation, Bantu beer sold by the Railway Administration to its Bantu servants must be consumed in the building or room of the compound in which it is sold; Bantu beer cannot, therefore, be sold in compounds where there are no mess halls or where mess halls are too small. This restriction prevents residents from taking liquor to their quarters. Furthermore, the Act provides that Bantu beer is to be sold only in departmental compounds, with the result that servants who are not accommodated in compounds, but who purchase their food from departmental cafeterias, are precluded from enjoying beer with their meals according to Bantu custom.</p>

<p>Clause 4 provides for Railway pension moneys to be paid up to the end of the month in which a retired servant or widow of a deceased servant or annuitant dies.</p>

<p>The present arrangement whereby the pensions and allowances of certain beneficiaries are paid into their accounts at commercial banking institutions and building societies, was introduced in September, 1967. At present pension moneys and. where applicable, allowances, are paid to beneficiaries up to the date of their death. As pensions and allowances are paid into accounts at financial institutions in respect of a full month, the amount paid to a beneficiary for the remaining portion of the month in which he dies, has to be recovered. This procedure necessitates considerable administrative work and Parliamentary approval is consequently sought for the payment of the pension benefits to all Railway beneficiaries up to the end of the month of their death. This is, of course, to their benefit. Provision for the payment of the relevant allowances on a similar basis will be made by means of departmental instructions.</p>

<p>The purpose of clause 5 is to permit of increased payment in lieu of leave being made to those Railway servants who can elect to retire at the lower age limit but who prefer to remain in the Service for an extended period of up to three years&#x2014;five years in the case of S.A. Airways pilots.</p>

<p>The present policy regarding payment in lieu of leave to servants who retire from the Service, has been reviewed at the request of the staff. The proposed procedure will place Railway servants on an equal footing with their colleagues in the Public Service and will also encourage staff to remain in the Service after reaching the lower age limit, so that the services of experienced staff will be retained.</p>

<p>In terms of extant legislation a servant who is to retire on the grounds of superannuation, ill-health, reduction in or reorganization of staff, or on account of certain other factors, is entitled to payment of his emoluments in respect of a period of vacation leave due to him at the date of his retirement not exceeding six months; any leave in excess of three months granted within the last 12 months of service is. however deducted from the period in respect of which payment is made.</p>

<p>In accordance with the proposed procedure servants who elect not to retire at the lower age limit will, apart from the maximum period of six months leave payable at present, subject to certain limitations, be entitled to payment in respect of a maximum additional period of three months&#x2019; leave&#x2014;a <i>pro rata</i> proportion for each completed year&#x2019;s service after reaching the lower age limit&#x2014;provided they have sufficient leave to their credit.</p>

<p>The proposed procedure is also to be applied to widows. If a servant dies before reaching the lower age limit, the maximum period of leave in respect of which payment may be made to his widow, is six months; if, however, he dies after reaching the lower age limit, his widow will be entitled to additional payment depending on the servant&#x2019;s period of service subsequent to attaining the lower age limit and provided he had sufficient leave standing to his credit.</p>

<p>Clause 6 provides for the granting, in certain instances of an award based on the actual pecuniary loss in the case of accidental injury or death on duty of a servant.</p>

<p>Extant legislation provides for the payment of benefits in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act of 1941 to Railway servants whose earnings are in excess of the amount of R5,460 per annum and who, because of their high earnings, are not automatically covered by the provisions of that Act. Such servants, or in the event of their death, their dependants, are, however, precluded from claiming common law damages from the Department.</p>

<p>Compensation under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act to a servant who, as a result of his high income, is not normally entitled to such compensation can, however, from a financial point of view, be an inadequate substitute for the right to claim common law damages. This is so, since compensation under the Act is calculated to meet the needs of lower paid workers and is not necessarily related to the pecuniary loss caused by the accident, whereas <span class="col_371-372" refersTo="page_0205"/>the basic purpose of common law damages is to reimburse the person concerned in respect of pecuniary loss.</p>

<p>In order to ensure a more realistic approach to the matter, the relevant Act is being amended to permit of an award being made by the Railway Administration equivalent to the pecuniary loss caused by an accident on duty which is due to the negligence of the Administration or of a servant of the Administration acting in the course of his employment.</p>

<p>Clause 7 is consequential upon the proposed amendment in clause 4 and contains no new principles.</p>

<p>Clause 8 determines the commutation factor to be applied to flight engineer officers on their retirement.</p>

<p>When the question of the lower retiring age for this group of staff was submitted to Parliament last year, it was inadvertently overlooked to make the necessary provision for the commutation factor applicable to the lower retiring age, to be applied to them on their retirement.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, approval is now being sought with retrospective effect from 8th March, 1967, viz. the date from which the lower retiring age for flight engineer officers became operative, to apply the correct commutation factor to them on their retirement.</p>

<p>Clause 9 makes provision for increased annual contributions to the Level Crossings Elimination Fund.</p>

<p>In terms of the Level Crossings Act, 1960, a sum of R500,000 is annually paid into the Fund from each of the following funds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Consolidated Revenue Fund;</block>

<block name="quote">Railway and Harbour Fund; and</block>

<block name="quote">National Road Fund.</block>

<p>The total annual contribution thus amounts to R1,500,000.</p>

<p>When the Fund was initiated the rate of contributions was considered sufficient to eliminate approximately 20 level crossings per annum. However, owing to the subsequent rise in building costs, it is not possible to achieve this object and at present only about eight level crossings can be eliminated annually with available funds.</p>

<p>Having regard to the high incidence of fatal level crossing accidents, it is in the national interest that as many level crossings as possible be eliminated and it is, therefore, necessary to make available more funds for this purpose.</p>

<p>Clause 10 provides for the validation of certain changes in the service conditions of the staff that were introduced with retrospective effect, or in respect of which approval of amended regulations was not obtained within the prescribed period.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, discussing this Bill has been greatly facilitated for us as a result of the fact that the hon. the Minister and his Administration have placed the White Paper at our disposal. We should like to express our appreciation for that, because this Bill deals with quite a number of matters which are not closely related to one another, and it would have taken hon. members a long time to do all the research themselves. We are grateful for this assistance.</p>

<p>Most of the provisions in this Bill are for the benefit of the staff, and consequently we shall support it and not draw out the discussion. Naturally there are matters that we want to discuss further, but it will be more appropriate to do so during the Committee Stage. There is, for example, clause 10, about which we are not quite satisfied. Certain members of this Committee have had experience of the provision concerned and would like to raise the matter with the hon. the Minister, both now and at the Committee Stage. Subject to that, however we are glad to be able to support the measure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise one point at this stage, and that is a matter which arises in clause 10&#x2014;&#x201C;Validation of certain changes in conditions of employment&#x201D;. We can appreciate the difficulty in regulations having always to be approved in the statutory three months, which used to be the position. We make no objection to that change. However, I am concerned with the fact that this also applies to retrospective regulations. A Railway servant is working under certain regulations. Those are his conditions of service. He acts under them, and he acts entirely legally as long as he is carrying out those regulations. Now, in terms of this clause, those regulations could be amended The servant need not be told about the amendment, but they are then brought into effect retrospectively to a date prior to the date on which they first came to the servant&#x2019;s notice. The effect of this is that a servant can now technically commit the crime of breaching a regulation when he was not aware of the change, when it was not yet in force. He then becomes liable for punishment for something which he did perfectly legally in terms of the regulations. We believe that no person should be punished retrospectively, and similarly, that no regulation should be applied without the person to whom it is applicable knowing about it. Assume a person does something. It is his right in terms of the regulations. They are changed. New regulations are introduced with effect from a month previously. That means that a person who, when he claimed the right, had every legal claim to it, suddenly finds that taken away from him. We would like to suggest that the retrospective part, as far as notification of Railway servants is concerned, should receive consideration and that no servant should be made subject to a regulation unless he has been notified that that is now a new regulation. These are regulations governing their daily work, their conditions of service, how they must act, etc. I would plead with the Minister that no person should be subject to a rule unless he has been notified that that is the position from a fixed date, either on that date or in the future.</p>

<p><span class="col_373-374" refersTo="page_0206"/>I should like to raise one other point. As we said earlier, we welcome very much the increase in the contribution towards the elimination of level crossings. But in the past the position has been that the money in the fund could not be spent. When the fund&#x2019;s income was R1&#x00BD; million per year there were surpluses of R3,182,000, R3.3 million, R3.1 million and R2.2 million, according to the latest report of the Controller and Auditor General. In other words, the money could not be spent, and I hope the Minister can tell us to-day that not only are we increasing the amount, but that the machinery for spending that money has been improved to such an extent that it will in fact be possible to spend what is available.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I am in full agreement with the hon. member. It would be most unfair to promulgate regulations of which the staff is unaware and that they should be subject to disciplinary steps if they break those regulations. I can give the assurance that the only regulations that are validated, are regulations that are really in the interests of the staff. No regulations that can possibly result in disciplinary steps being taken against the members of the staff if those regulations are contravened, are validated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is only to their benefit. Now I will give the hon. member some indication of this. This happens almost every year.</p>

<p>The first one is an amendment to Staff Regulation 99, arising out of changes to the sick pay conditions affecting employees. Before anything is done in regard to the Sick Fund, agreement must be obtained from the staff, because, as hon. members know, the Sick Fund is controlled by the staff. The staff and the Management are represented on the Central Sick Fund Board. It is only at the request of the Board that any changes are brought about. In this particular case regulations are being promulgated arising out of changes in the Sick Fund pay conditions affecting employees. It was necessary to amend the Staff Regulations with effect from the 16th December, 1964. It was, however, omitted to amend in Regulation No. 99 (2) the reference to Regulation No. 119 (5), which had been cancelled and replaced by Regulation No. 117 (3).</p>

<p>The second one was in regard to the Superannuation Fund Regulations. When the Superannuation Fund Regulations were reprinted in 1960, the grade of Flying Instructor was not included therein, as it had been abolished. The grade was, however, reintroduced with effect from 1st December, 1960. Provision should, therefore, have been made for it to be reinserted in the regulations concerned as from that date and to cover subsequent amendments, but this was inadvertently overlooked.</p>

<p>The third one being validated is that approval was granted for an increase in the Sick Fund contributions with retrospective effect from the January, 1966 pay month. It was consequently not practicable to notify the staff thereof on or before the operative date. I give the hon. member the assurance, as I have said, that usually regulations which benefit the staff and which are of retrospective effect are validated in this, a Bill which comes before Parliament yearly.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, they will not. The hon. member can rest assured that he will hear from the staff very soon if we take away rights and then validate it afterwards.</p>

<p>In regard to the machinery for the elimination of level crossings, I think I have explained to the House on a previous occasion that it is not due to inability on the part of the Administration that the money is not fully spent every year. Negotiations have to take place between the local authorities and the Administration in regard to the sharing of the costs. That takes time. Calling for tenders takes time. The planning takes time. Very often it does happen that all the money in a particular financial year is not spent.</p>

<p>Yes. In other words, the money is not repaid into the Railway and Harbour Fund. It remains in the Level Crossings Elimination Fund. Everything possible is being done to speed up the elimination of level crossings. The additional amount required, as I said in my opening remarks, is as a result of the increased costs, mainly building costs. As a matter of fact, even by having an additional amount of R1&#x00BD; million, less than 20 level crossings per year-&#x2014;the number we had originally envisaged&#x2014;will be eliminated. But everything possible is being done to speed up the elimination of level crossings.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill will replace the existing War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Act, 1962. As hon. members will see in the long title of this Bill, its main object is to consolidate all the measures relating to war veterans&#x2019; pensions. Section 4 of the existing War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Act, 1962, makes all those provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act relating to the appointment and powers of a district pension officer, the functions and powers of the Secretary in regard <span class="col_375-376" refersTo="page_0207"/>to pensions, and the determination of the amount of any pension, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> applicable to war veterans&#x2019; pensions. So, for example, the provisions of sections 3 to 6 inclusive, 8, 10 to 18 inclusive and 20 of the Old Age Pensions Act are made applicable to war veterans&#x2019; pensions.</p>

<p>The Old Age Pensions Act, however, was repealed in 1967 and replaced by the Aged Persons Act, 1967. It goes without saying that provision must first be made for those provisions in the Old Age Pensions Act which are applicable to war veterans&#x2019; pensions, before the Aged Persons Act can be put into operation. All these provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act are now being re-enacted in this Bill, and hon. members will find them in clauses 4 to 12 inclusive.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the amendments appearing in this Bill. Firstly, clause 3 (5) is a new provision in terms of which the payment of a war veterans&#x2019; pension is suspended after such a pensioner has been absent from the Republic for a period of more than six months. If, however, such a pensioner resided in the Republic for not less than 15 of the 20 years immediately preceding his application for a pension, the Secretary may permit payment of the pension to be continued under certain circumstances. The Aged Persons Act, which was passed by the House last year, contains a similar provision and the reason for this is that we want to prevent a person from coming to live in this country for only a very short time, for example five years, then leaving the country and receiving a pension from this country for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Secondly, another important object of this Bill is in future to have the amounts of pensions, as well as the means to be taken into account in determining the amounts of pensions, determined in terms of regulations under the Act. Similar provisions already exist in the Aged Persons Act in respect of old age pensions and in the Children&#x2019;s Act in respect of maintenance and family allowances. During the past number of years concessions have been granted to social pensioners virtually every year. Before these concessions could be put into effect, all the relevant Acts first had to be amended. This not only took up much of the time of this House, but also created administrative problems. All concessions are announced by my colleague the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech, and hon. members therefore have sufficient opportunity to consider such concessions during the Budget debate and during the discussion on my Vote.</p>

<p>Clause 15 (2) also provides that the maximum amount of a war veterans&#x2019; pension shall not be reduced without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Consequently the rights of the war veteran pensioners will still be adequately protected. That covers virtually everything in connection with this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support this Bill at its second reading. We realize that the amendments to the War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Act is a direct consequence of amendments which were passed last year in terms of the Aged Persons Act of 1967. We realize too that there has been a considerable amount of research following the report of the working group on legislation for the protection of the aged, where they made a similar recommendation that, following the amendment to the Old Age Pensions Act, similar amendments should be made to the other Acts concerning social pensions. At this stage, at the second reading, there are certain comments we should like to make in regard to the principle that is involved in this Bill.</p>

<p>Firstly, Sir, we foresee that considerable advantages might be gained by amendments to the various Acts, following upon a Budget speech in regard to which in the past amending legislation was necessary. The hon. the Minister has indicated that one of the purposes of this Bill is to eliminate certain administrative difficulties so that those amendments can be carried out by regulation. It does mean that we will not have an opportunity of discussing those amendments in any great detail in this House. Consequently, when the Aged Persons Act of 1962 was amended last year, we did express certain reservations in regard to that procedure. It is hoped that if a Bill of that nature is finally passed by both Houses and becomes an Act, and when alterations are to be made to the means test, which will then be made by regulation, the hon. the Minister will timeously table a memorandum setting forth the alterations that will take place. We have, as I have said, previously had the opportunity of discussing the amending legislation. In terms of this Bill, where an alteration is made in regard to the means test, this matter can be dealt with and will be dealt with, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, by regulation. The War Veterans Pensions Bill makes provision for the recognition of the services of those persons who performed active service for their country. As you know, Sir, in terms of existing provisions war veterans are entitled to receive a higher allowance than old-age pensioners. This obviously has certain advantages. There is a different means test applicable to war veterans who are over 70 years of age. The pension payable to a war veteran in terms of this Bill is R8 per month more than the pension payable in terms of the Old Age Pensions Act. It becomes important therefore to study the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; so as to be able to assess which persons are entitled to receive benefits in terms of this Bill. The definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; as it appears in this Bill, is the same as the definition which appeared in the Pension Laws Amendment Act of 1967, which created new groups under the definition clause. One of the groups that was brought in was the Chinese. The Bill which is now before us is only applicable to Europeans, Coloureds, Chinese and Indians. We on this side of the House would like to express our great disappointment at the <span class="col_377-378" refersTo="page_0208"/>Minister&#x2019;s attitude in precluding one section of the population, namely the Bantu. Strong representations have been made to the Government to include this group of people in this Bill. This legislation which is before us to-day presented the hon. the Minister with an ideal opportunity to include this particular group of persons. We realize that such a proposal will involve additional expenditure and therefore we on this side are precluded from moving an instruction to the Committee at a later stage, an instruction which would have the effect of including the Bantu. It does seem most unfair and unjust that that particular group of persons who also rendered war service should be precluded from the advantages which will flow from the provisions of this Bill. We know that the Government&#x2019;s attitude is that the Bantu served in non-combatant units. We feel, however, that that is no justification for excluding these people who performed a service for which they had volunteered in the interests of their country. It is a pity therefore that this particular group has been excluded from the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D; and that the Minister has not yet seen fit to allow them the benefits which will flow from this legislation.</p>

<p>Sir, the other points which arise from this Bill are of a minor nature. We shall therefore deal with a them in the Committee Stage. In principle we believe that this is an important piece of legislation, which provides for a slight deviation from the manner in which pensions have previously been dealt with in this House. Although we have certain reservations with regard to the application of the means test by way of regulation to a great extent, we feel in principle that the enactment of this measure is important so as to give recognition to those persons who performed full-time military service.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to add one or two words to what has been said by the last speaker with regard to this Bill. In the first place I want to say that one welcomes this legislation which will now bring the provisions of the law applying to war veterans into line with the legislation passed last year. Sir, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that for a number of years before entering this House I had contacts with Ministers from time to time who were concerned with war pensions. Over the years they have evolved for this country a pattern, so far as war pensions are concerned, which is equal to, if not better than, any other similar legislation that exists. But, Sir, this Bill perpetuates one anomaly so far as South Africa is concerned, and that is the exclusion of the Bantu. One appreciates the reason why this has been done over the years and why it was done originally. There were grave difficulties in tracing the individual Bantu who were entitled to pensions. There were grave difficulties in certain cases in following them up and assisting them to obtain their pensions. That difficulty, however, was overcome with regard to the ordinary war disability pension and I think the Bantu in this country have been fairly satisfactorily dealt with. But in 1941 when the War Veterans&#x2019; Pension Bill was introduced, it was introduced originally to provide for Europeans, Coloureds and Indians. It was subsequently extended to include Chinese, but the Bantu were omitted. In the Bill now before us the Minister proposes that the Bantu should continue to be omitted. Sir, Bantu ex-servicemen have been accepted for pension purposes generally on the ratio &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! I cannot allow the hon. member to proceed on those lines. The inclusion of the Bantu will entail additional expenditure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, perhaps the hon. the Minister may be able to explain to me, if I may be permitted to ask the question, why there has been this exclusion so far as the Bill before us is concerned. They are ex-servicemen; they are war veterans except that the name &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; does not appear in the definition. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain why they are being omitted. I believe that the hon. the Minister has been supplied with cost estimates which I believe are fairly accurate. I understand that the cost would be something in the nature of R&#x00BC; million so far as the Bantu are concerned. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister is concerned about the amount involved or whether he is not satisfied with the schedules submitted to him.</p>

<p>Then I want to raise another matter in regard to the Bill and that is the question of translation. In the Afrikaans text of this Bill reference is made to &#x201C;Blankes, Kleurlinge, Indi&#x00EB;rs&#x201D; but in the English text the word &#x201C;European&#x201D; is used instead of &#x201C;white person&#x201D;. The word &#x201C;European&#x201D; is used throughout the Bill. There is no definition of it and I presume that &#x201C;European&#x201D; in this case means a &#x201C;white person&#x201D; under the Population Registration Act. It would seem to me in the first place that the term &#x201C;white person&#x201D; should be used and, secondly, that a white person should also be defined in just the same way as other persons are defined in this Bill. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will be good enough to give his attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The other point to which I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention is that we are dealing here basically with war veterans and I see no reason and the Minister has not suggested any reason why certain of these provisions should apply to one class of war veteran only. For instance, there are certain privileges which apply to European or white war veterans who are resident in or have been resident in Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland or South West Africa. I refer particularly to Clause 3 (2) of the Bill. It seems to me that there should not be exclusions as far as the question of residence is concerned and that the whole class of war veterans should have the benefits or the penalties which apply to residents in these three territories. Perhaps the hon. the Minister <span class="col_379-380" refersTo="page_0209"/>could give some thought to that particular aspect of the measure before us.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to refer to an aspect of this Bill which is another sign of an ever-growing tendency in our legislation and that is to provide in a Bill that the effective aspect of the Bill, the teeth of the law, shall be determined not by this House, where it should properly be debated and decided, but by the Minister. Clause 3 of this Bill defines which war veterans are entitled to a pension. It is provided that the person concerned must have attained a certain age, that he must be resident in the Republic, that he must be a South African citizen or that he must have been ordinarily resident here for a certain period, etc., but it does say &#x201C;subject to the provisions of this Act&#x201D;. Then one turns to clause 15 and one finds that provision is made there that the Minister may, subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), make regulations &#x201C;as to the requirements or conditions, in addition to any specified in section 3, to be complied with by a war veteran in order to qualify for a veteran&#x2019;s pension or for an allowance&#x201D;, and the circumstances in which he shall cease to qualify. Sir, the function of this House surely is to determine who should have a pension and in what circumstances he should have it. The conditions under which pensions are given to people are laid down here in clause 3. Those conditions refer to his residence, his citizenship and his age. In addition to that, some other provision can be made by the Minister by regulation.</p>

<p>I am indebted to you, Sir. Surely if one is going to grant pensions to war veterans under certain circumstances, those circumstances should be clearly stated when we pass the law here. Clause 15 provides that the Minister can make additional provisions to those provided for already in clause 3. They can only be more onerous and we would like to know from the hon. the Minister why he wants the power and what sort of conditions he is going to impose. These conditions are going to be imposed by the Minister on the advice, no doubt, of members of his Department. The decision will be promulgated by regulation; it will be made in a back room somewhere in Pretoria; it will never see the light of day, it will never be subject to public debate or public scrutiny. Sir, this is part of the process of legislation; you debate it in this House and the public is then informed through the Press what is going on and members of the public are then able to make their representations to those persons who are properly charged with the legislative processes, that is to say, hon. members sitting in this House. I hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to give us a good reason as to why he wants this power and that he will give us an assurance that he is not going to make it more onerous or will give us an assurance that at the appropriate time in the Committee Stage he will consider amending his powers with regard to the making of regulations so as not to abridge in any way the conditions which are stated in clause 3 to be the conditions under which persons are entitled as of right and as of law, as determined by us here in this House, to have a pension.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that the broad principles of this Bill have received general support, because it is necessary to get this legislation through quickly so that the Aged Persons Act can be promulgated to enable us to act in terms thereof. With regard to the various questions I want to say this: Firstly, there is the matter referred to by the hon. member for Umbilo, namely the question of whether a memorandum will be made available to hon. members when changes are introduced in, for example, the means test, etc. Yes, just as in the case of old-age pensions, it will be done where it is at all worth while. If it is a very minor amendment which does not justify a memorandum, one can explain it and bring it to the notice of hon. members by simply making an announcement. When material changes are introduced, we shall follow the same practice as in the past and supply hon. members with proper memoranda giving a proper explanation of such changes. I also consider it necessary that, when changes are made in the means test, hon. members should be fully informed of such changes so that they may have an opportunity of discussing them properly during the debates in this House. I think they have a right to that and I shall see to it that they will be able to exercise that right properly by providing full particulars on my part. As regards the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;, to which various hon. members have referred, and the fact that, in the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;, &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; was omitted and reference was only made to the other race groups, I can only repeat what has already been said on previous occasions in this connection, and that is that in the original war veterans&#x2019; legislation, especially the legislation of 1941, the Bantu were purposely omitted by the then Minister responsible for it, the late Mr. J. H. Hofmeyr. I think hon. members will agree with me that if it was at all possible to include <span class="col_381-382" refersTo="page_0210"/>Bantu war veterans, he of all people would have been most willing to do so.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Why not&#x003F; What is the difference between that stage and now&#x003F; But they were omitted, not for reasons of race or colour, but for other considerations, namely that the Bantu in fact did not serve in fighting units, according to a statement by the then Government, the Government which employed them. They said so. In addition, it was done because it is difficult to trace the addresses of such persons, because they more frequently change their address, and so forth. These were the various reasons given at the time. But I must point out to hon. members that since then up to the present Bantu persons who have performed auxiliary services during wars, have always been granted additional pensions administratively by way of gratuities, and that is still being done to-day. In other words, inclusion of the word &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; will in actual fact not entail additional expenditure; it will perhaps only cause the expenditure to be incurred in a different way. But any Bantu person who has performed war service or auxiliary services and who can furnish the necessary proof, will receive the equivalent of a war veterans&#x2019; pension through the Department of Bantu Administration by way of a gratuity. [Interjection.] Just as old-age pensions for Whites and Bantu differ, so there is a difference between what the white war veteran gets and what the Bantu who has rendered auxiliary services gets. They must inevitably differ. I do not know whether the hon. member is advocating that we should make them equal in every respect. Surely we cannot do that. [Interjection.] This is a matter which the hon. member must discuss with the Minister of Bantu Administration, because it is not relevant here. I am dealing here with the practice which has been followed since 1941 and which was introduced by the old United Party Government of that time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point also referred to the definition of the word &#x201C;blanke&#x201D; in the Afrikaans version and &#x201C;European&#x201D; in the English version. I have been informed that the word &#x201C;European&#x201D; is used in the English version in order to include Whites not resident in the Republic. I must honestly confess that I do not understand it. It is the reason given by the law advisors; the definition of &#x201C;white person&#x201D; would in fact only be valid for the Republic, according to the Population Registration Act, and exclude other persons. Personally I cannot agree with this and I am quite willing to examine it further in the Committee Stage to see what we can do about it. I am informed that in the War Veterans&#x2019; Pensions Act the term &#x201C;white person&#x201D; is not used because such pensions are also paid to persons outside the Republic. They are persons not classified under the Population Registration Act, and the same definition of a white person as is used in, for example, the Aged Persons Act cannot be used here. But I shall look at this matter again. [Interjection.] It is for that very reason, because only white persons in Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland and South-West Africa qualify, but not the non-Whites. According to this the non-Whites cannot get it. This has always been the case, also under the old existing Act which we are now amending and consolidating. It has been the case ever since 1941.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) also referred to the powers under clause 15 to make regulations, and he refers particularly to the powers under clause 15 (1) (b). These powers are merely a clear definition which makes it possible to give the regulations the force of law, but as the hon. member can see, the requirements and conditions imposed under paragraph (b) are laid down &#x201C;subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3)&#x201D;. Therefore they must not be in conflict with the provisions of subsections (2) and (3).</p>

<p>Also the residential qualifications, etc., laid down in terms of this Act. All the basic principles laid down in this Act cannot be amended by way of regulation. This is only to make it possible to add to the regulations. But in such a case the regulations will still be tabled here and will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. There is nothing which prevents Parliament, in the case of a regulation already made, from deciding against it by way of a substantive motion or whatever; it can happen and then it can be rectified. There is an opportunity to debate the matter. In other words, Parliament remains the highest authority, because it can review all regulations issued under all Acts. I therefore see no problem in this and I do not think the hon. member need be concerned about it. We shall never use these powers to the detriment of pensioners; we shall only use them for their benefit. In dealing with pensioners of whatever kind, all parties have at all times tried to act in their interests when making regulations, and with a view to improving their circumstances. All powers that can be exercised in terms of this can therefore only mean an improvement in the circumstances of those persons. It is also provided specifically that existing privileges cannot be reduced by way of regulation without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Consequently this can only mean additional benefits; it cannot mean the withdrawal of benefits. I therefore do not know why the hon. member is so concerned.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p><span class="col_383-384" refersTo="page_0211"/>This Bill will replace the existing Blind Persons Act, 1962. As indicated in the long title of the Bill, it is to a Large extent a consolidation of the existing laws relating to blind persons, with a few necessary amendments.</p>

<p>Section 8 of the existing Blind Persons Act, 1962 (Act No. 39 of 1962), makes the provisions of sections 3 (2) and (3), sections 4 to 6 inclusive and sections 10 to 20 inclusive of the Old Age Pensions Act, 1962, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>applicable to pensions payable in terms of the Blind Persons Act.</p>

<p>The Old Age Pensions Act, however, was repealed in 1967 and replaced by the Aged Persons Act (Act No. 81 of 1967), but this Act cannot be put into operation before the Blind Persons Act is amended to make provision for the measures concerned, and the necessary provision is now being made in this legislation.</p>

<p>Hon. members will find that clause 7 to 14 inclusive are consequently only a re-enactment of those measures in the Old Age Pensions Act, 1962, that were applicable to pensions payable to blind persons.</p>

<p>It is envisaged to have the amounts of pensions for blind persons and of attendants&#x2019; and other allowances payable to such persons, as well as the means to be taken into account in determining the amount of such pensions, prescribed by regulation in terms of the Act. Hon. members will find this in clause 17 (1).</p>

<p>It is being done to facilitate the administration of the Act. All concessions in respect of social pensions and allowances are announced by my colleague the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech and hon. members therefore have sufficient opportunity during the Budget debate and during the discussion on my Vote to discuss this aspect in detail.</p>

<p>In the past number of years concessions were made to social pensioners virtually every year and it was found that continual amendments to make provision for these concessions interfered considerably with the administration of the Acts concerned.</p>

<p>This amendment will also bring the provisions concerned into line with legislation authorizing the payment of old-age pensions and maintenance and family allowances.</p>

<p>Clause 17 (2) provides that the maximum amount of any pension shall not be reduced without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Adequate provision is therefore being made to protect the rights of the pensioners.</p>

<p>Section 12 of the existing Blind Persons Act provides that the Secretary for Social Welfare and Pensions shall register all welfare organizations which have as their object or one of their objects the promotion of the welfare of persons who are totally or partially blind.</p>

<p>This provision resulted in unnecessary overlapping of work and also conflicted with the spirit of the National Welfare Act, 1965. For example, that Act makes it compulsory for all welfare organizations to register as such with the National Welfare Board. Organizations seeking to promote the welfare of blind persons therefore had to be registered by the National Welfare Board as well as by the Department. In order to eliminate this double registration the provision concerned is not being re-enacted, with the result that henceforth such organizations, like all other welfare organizations, will only have to be registered by the National Welfare Board.</p>

<p>Clause 5 (5) contains a new provision in terms of which the payment of a pension must be suspended after the recipient has been absent from the Republic for more than six months. The Aged Persons Act contains a similar provision, the purpose of which is to prevent persons from residing in the Republic for a very short while, for example five years, and then, after settling in another country, continuing to draw a pension from this country for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>In terms of the proviso a pension may under certain circumstances be continued in respect of persons who resided in the Republic for not less than ten out of the fifteen years immediately preceding the application for a pension,</p>

<p>Clause 5 (6) provides that the Secretary may pay the pensions to persons who had already left the country at the date of commencement of the Act, after they have been absent from the Republic for longer than six months. Such persons are therefore not affected by the restrictions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support the second reading of this Bill. As the hon. the Minister indicated, a considerable number of the matters provided for in this Bill are also provided for in other legislation which makes provision for social pensions. However, there are one or two points in regard to which the Minister may give some further information. There is a provision in the Bill whereby the pension is terminated or suspended after a period of six months. The Minister referred to this aspect when he introduced the Bill. Now, it might conceivably happen that certain blind persons may of necessity have to travel overseas and remain there for a long time, perhaps to receive medical attention. It is honed that this provision relating to the suspension of the pension after a period of six months will be applied in a lenient manner. I concede that in terms of clause 5 of this measure it is possible for that term to be further extended but the extension is limited to persons who had been in the Republic for not less than ten of the preceding fifteen years. As I say. instances might occur where people have to be outside the Republic to receive urgent medical attention, and they might have to remain overseas for a very long period. It is hoped that the hon. the Minister will assure this House that regarding the suspension of pensions provided for in clause 5 deserving cases <span class="col_385-386" refersTo="page_0212"/>will receive sympathetic consideration. We on this side support this Bill in principle.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I sympathize with what the hon. member for Umbilo has said in connection with the provisions of clause 5. The object of the clause is to prevent persons from residing in the country for a short time, then leaving it for a relatively long time, and returning only to qualify for the pension, only to leave the country again. In a <i>bona fide</i> case, where, for example, a person has to be absent from the country for longer than six months for medical treatment, I shall see what we can do. I think the hon. member has made out a case in that respect.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bili be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill will replace the existing Disability Grants Act.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the long title, the object of this Bill is to consolidate all the various provisions relating to disability grants, and to make a few amendments that are necessary.</p>

<p>The amendments are in the main that the amount of disability grants as well as the means taken into account in determining the amount of the grants will no longer be determined by the Act, but by regulations under the Act.</p>

<p>These provisions already exist in the Aged Persons Act in respect of old-age pensions, and in the Children&#x2019;s Act in respect of maintenance and family allowances. In order to facilitate the administration of the Acts concerned, it has been decided to follow this procedure in respect of all the various social pensions and allowances.</p>

<p>Hon. members will therefore find that sections 11 and 12 of the existing Act are not being re-enacted in this Bill, but that in clause 15 provision is being made for those provisions to be laid down by way of regulation.</p>

<p>Clause 15 (2) provides that any maximum amount prescribed by way of such a regulation shall not be reduced without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. The rights of the drawers of allowances are therefore being adequately protected.</p>

<p>In the past number of years social pensions and allowances were reviewed virtually every year and concessions were made. Such concessions are announced by my colleague the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech. Sufficient opportunity therefore exists to take all concessions into thorough review in this House during the budget debate as well as during the discussion on my Vote. In any case I cannot make concessions by way of regulation before the expenditure in connection therewith has been approved by Parliament.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This measure arises from a decision taken by the Government in 1963 that every Department must review all pre-Union legislation relating to it with a view to its repeal, the incorporation of necessary portions thereof in post-Union legislation, or the re-enactment of necessary portions thereof.</p>

<p>As hon. members will remember, a large number of those statutes which had already become obsolete were repealed by the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act which was introduced by my colleague the Minister of Justice last year.</p>

<p>Cape Act No. 32 of 1895, the only remaining pre-Union statute relating to the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, provides <i>inter alia</i> for the establishment of a pension fund for widows of Cape public servants, and since the Cape Widows&#x2019; Pension Fund still exists and may continue functioning for some considerable time, it is necessary to ensure its survival by re-enacting the relevant portions. Chapter II of the Bill provides for this, while Chapter I deals with the repeal of the Act and any subsequent amendments thereto.</p>

<p>I therefore want to emphasize that this measure in no way alters the present position of Cape public servants, all of whom have retired by now, and their widows.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support this Bill. It is obvious that it deals with an old Act which is being repealed, dating from 1895. I feel though, that the hon. the Minister might have given a little more information in regard to the <span class="col_387-388" refersTo="page_0213"/>Cape Widows&#x2019; Pension Fund. Chapter II of this Bill deals with the manner in which the continuation of the public service section of the Cape Widows&#x2019; Pension Fund should be administered, investment of moneys of the Fund, additional contributions and other matters pertaining to the Cape Widows&#x2019; Pension Fund. The administration of this Fund has, from time to time, caused a little concern in that the administration of the Fund is unique. During the 1964 session I asked the then Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions certain questions relating to the position of the Fund. It would appear that the actuarial calculations that are made from time to time are certainly a most important part of the administration of this Fund. Perhaps the Minister can give the House some indication as to what the future of the Fund is to be, because obviously if no further people require membership of the Fund, a situation will eventually arise where a decision will have to be made regarding the continued existence of the Fund. Perhaps at this stage, where the old Act is being amended and certain Cape pension laws are being repealed, the Minister could indicate what the future of the Fund will be in the light of legislation which has now been placed before this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I have no information as to the actuarial position of that fund before me at the moment. I shall go into the matter and furnish the particulars required to the hon. member at a later opportunity. I may give the assurance, however, that there is no reason for concern in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This measure has already been published for general information in a <i>Government Gazette Extraordinary,</i> on 22nd December, 1967. No objections to or comments on it have been received by either my Department or myself.</p>

<p>The amendments which are being proposed have arisen from the suggestions received by my Department after all interested political parties and other bodies had been invited to submit proposals in regard to amendments to the Electoral Laws.</p>

<p>The comprehensive amendments which are perhaps generally expected&#x2014;and can justifiably be expected&#x2014;are not being introduced in this measure. Those amendments will be introduced when all the data have been correlated and summarized. This measure contains the essential amendments which are regarded as being absolutely essential at this stage.</p>

<p>The amendments included in this Bill, are principally aimed at ensuring that when an election or elections are to take place, voters&#x2019; rolls, rolls which are up to date as far as possible, are available, as well as to ensure that when elections take place the machinery functions smoothly and matters are facilitated for all concerned.</p>

<p>No principles contained in the principal Act are being amended, and the amendments which are now being envisaged, are consequently not contentious. In fact, I am convinced that they will meet with general approval and support.</p>

<p>Sir, kindly grant me the opportunity now of explaining the envisaged amendments briefly to hon. members. For the sake of convenience I shall deal with the clauses one by one. I shall deal first with clause 1. In terms of the present provisions of section 8 (1) of the Electoral Laws the position at present is that a general registration of voters must take place at intervals of not more than five years. The last general registration commenced on 5th August, 1963. That means that the next general registration must commence not later than 3rd August of this year. The next general election of members of the Provincial Councils is to take place during 1970, and if a general registration has still to take place during this year and new voters&#x2019; rolls are drawn up, they will by that time have become rather obsolete. If the next general election of members of the House of Assembly is to take place in 1971, the voters&#x2019; rolls would at that stage be approximately three years old already. It is of no use therefore having new voters&#x2019; rolls drawn up this year and only using them in two years&#x2019; time. In order to rectify this state of affairs, subsection (1) of section 8 of the principal Act is now being substituted by a new subsection (1) in which it is being provided that the next general registration of voters should take place during 1969, and subsequently at intervals of not more than six years. Consequently reasonably up-to-date voters&#x2019; rolls will be available for the general Provincial Council election, as a result of which there will be an expected decrease in the number of post and special votes and problems which usually occur in the tracing of voters who have moved. In addition the amendment will entail that my Department will be allowed more scope to fix the dates of future general registrations, taking into consideration the general elections which are to follow. The drawbacks which have originated as a result of the present five-year period will to a large extent be eliminated if it is increased to six years because, as I have said, it will afford us more scope.</p>

<p>I come now to clause 2. This clause must be read in conjunction with clause 4 since it has a bearing on that clause and since clause 4 contains only consequential amendments which arise out of the amendments as proposed in <span class="col_389-390" refersTo="page_0214"/>clause 2. In terms of the present provisions of section 71 <i>bis</i>of the Principal Act, a blank ballot paper has to be completed by every person wishing to vote as a special voter&#x2014;the name of the candidate, constituency, etc., has to be filled in. The writing out of the ballot paper takes up a great deal of time. During the recent general election of members of the House of Assembly it was found however that many voters voted as special voters in the constituencies in which they were registered. These special voters in particular could actually have made use of specially printed ballot papers, which only differed in a minor respect from the ordinary ballot papers, but the section in question did not allow this to be done. Therefore it is being proposed that a new subsection(1) be substituted for the existing subsection(1) of section 71 <i>bis</i> of the Principal Act, in terms of which presiding officers will be allowed, where it is practicable, to make use of printed ballot papers. By this means a great deal of time will be saved and it will be possible to deal more rapidly with voters. These amendments will be of particular importance at the coming general election of members of the Representative Coloured Council. In cases where fewer than 50 voters have been registered in an electoral district, such voters may vote as absent or as special voters. In all such cases it will subsequently be possible to make use of the special printed ballot papers. Consequently it is necessary to substitute a new subsection for the existing subsection (1) of subsection 71 <i>sept.</i></p>

<p>I come now to clause 3, Section 71 <i>quat</i> of the principal Act provides that at all times during the hours from 7 o&#x2019;clock in the forenoon to 9 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon during the period from the 21st day before polling day up to and including the second day immediately preceding polling day not less than one presiding officer and his assistants shall be on duty at the office of every electoral officer and every returning officer in order to enable special voters to vote. Experience has shown that during the last general election of members to the House of Assembly there were many instances of presiding officers and their assistants who remained on duty, particularly those in the isolated country districts, without a special voter ever turning up. The result was that the spare time of many officers was taken up unnecessarily. In addition it resulted in a very considerable expenditure of allowances, allowances which had to be paid to the officials. The new subsection (1) of section 71 <i>quat</i> which is now being proposed, envisages that presiding officers for special voters should only render service after normal office hours in essential cases. The hours during which after-hour service has to be rendered, will be determined after consultation between the chief electoral officer or an electoral officer, the presiding officer and the political parties in question. This will not prejudice the special vote system in any way. The special voter still has every opportunity to vote which he is entitled to.</p>

<p>This amendment will be of great importance particularly at the coming general election of members of the Representative Coloured Council where there will be almost no Coloured voters in many parts of the Republic but where officers will still have to be on duty after hours if the Act is not amended. However, all presiding officers will still have to act as such during their normal office hours.</p>

<p>As far as clause 4 is concerned, I have already said that it must be dealt with in conjunction with clause 2, and consequently I do not want to elaborate any further on it, except perhaps merely to mention that the main purpose of the proposed amendment is to eliminate delays in the completion of ballot papers.</p>

<p>Clause 5 contains the short title of the Act and it is not likely that anybody is interested in that. Sir, I trust that I have now explained this amending Bill to the satisfaction of all bon. members. I may perhaps just mention in passing that other proposals in regard to certain amendments to the Electoral Laws have also been received. I referred to these proposals at the beginning of my speech. However, they are not urgent and my Department is still subjecting them to thorough examination and consideration.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have no objection in principle to this legislation, but as the hon. the Minister quite rightly expected, we are disappointed that this Bill does not have the full scope we expected it to have, particularly after the various representations which have been made to the Department. I hope that the hon. the Minister will, in his reply, be able to tell us more or less when he expects to introduce the promised more comprehensive Amendment Bill. I am talking about the one in respect of which he promised that it would be referred to a Select Committee so that all parties could try in good time to discuss and, if possible, to eliminate the various problems before the next election. It will not help to wait until a few months before the next elections before tackling such a discussion. The last Select Committee sat for many months. Subsequently it had to be converted into a commission which had to sit during almost the entire recess. I hope that we can be presented with the draft bill during this session still so that we can give proper attention to it.</p>

<p>As far as this particular bill is concerned there are three points I want to raise. We accept of course that it is in the interests of all that the date of the general registration should be amended to be as close as possible to that of the election, and we support that. But it must not be too close to the election. The date mentioned by the hon. the Minister namely the 3rd or 5th August, means that if the registration should take place then, it would take a month and the voters&#x2019; roll would still have to be drawn up. Then the <span class="col_391-392" refersTo="page_0215"/>voters&#x2019; rolls would have to be under scrutiny by the parties for a month and only after that would they come into effect. That means that it would be impossible to furnish that August voters&#x2019; roll to the parties for actual organization purposes before the beginning of 1970. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider holding the 1969 general registration somewhere in the middle or just a little before the middle of the year so that we can have at least one supplementary registration before that voters&#x2019; roll has to be used in an election. The hon. the Minister is aware of the problems of obtaining pollsters and the poor registration which is carried out in many areas owing to the difficulty of finding the right people to do that work; therefore it is still necessary for parties to do quite a good deal of hard work after the registration in order to supply those deficiencies. I am therefore requesting the Minister to give consideration to a reasonably early registration which will at least furnish us with one or perhaps two supplementary rolls before the election which is to take place round about April, 1970.</p>

<p>The second point I want to put is that the next election which is going to be held is a provincial election. In Natal and the Free State it is customary, after a registration, to draw up the voters&#x2019; rolls on a Parliamentary basis first. Then all those cards have to be converted for the provincial constituencies. Now this is a very big task, a task which takes up a great deal of time, and I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister considers having the general registration in Natal and the Free State undertaken on a provincial basis right from the start. Let the registration take place on a provincial basis, and then it can be converted again for the Parliamentary constituencies. If this is not done, those provinces will have to lag at least two or three months behind the Transvaal and the Cape before their voters&#x2019; rolls are available. There is nothing to prevent that. The Act does not provide that it should be done on a Parliamentary basis; it merely states that voters should be arranged in constituencies. All that has to be done is to arrange administratively that the constituency shall then be a provincial constituency.</p>

<p>We are all in agreement as regards the amendment to the special voters&#x2019; system which makes it possible for the printed ballot paper to be used. Where ordinary ballot papers are available it is unnecessary to have to fill in all those details, and we support that provision. There are problems, however, as far as clause 3 is concerned, which deals with the question of the hours of service of the presiding officers. We accept that it is unreasonable to expect that every officer for special votes should remain in his office from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. if he has no work to do. It is unreasonable and we are quite prepared to support an amendment in this regard. But what is in fact necessary. is that the voters should know where he stands. As this clause stands at present, the Chief Electoral Officer may stipulate that a person should work only his normal hours. In the first instance those hours are not laid down by law. It varies in various offices and various areas. I feel that the normal working hours should be laid down from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. so that there is clarity in regard to the normal working hours of the officers. There may in fact be exceptional circumstances where certain normal working hours are different from those in other areas. We feel therefore that the question of working hours does not require an important change but that it will ensure clarity in respect of what those working hours should be.</p>

<p>Subsection (2) makes provision for various additional times at different offices. In the interests of the voter who wants to vote, there should be a notification informing him where and when he can vote. I agree wholeheartedly that in a city, for example Durban, where one has the electoral officer as well as the magistrate offices, it is absolutely unnecessary to keep both in service. It is sufficient if there is at least one place where a voter can go and vote. The voter is entitled to know that he will be afforded the opportunity of voting in any city or at any magistrate&#x2019;s office between certain minimum hours. I do not think that much use was ever made of the period from 7 to 8 a.m. Neither do I believe that the last few hours up to 9 p.m. are necessary. They are perhaps necessary at the major offices, but not at the smaller ones. I hope the hon. the Minister can give us some indication of what his ideas in this regard are. and how it is intended that this discretion which is now being granted in practice to the Chief Electoral Officer is to be exercised. Will arrangements be made to ensure that the voters will at least know when they can vote at the various places&#x003F; A notice can for example be issued before an election to inform people that the normal hours will apply at every magistrate&#x2019;s office plus a minimum of one or two hours after the normal closing time. In the large cities the offices can remain open for a further two to three hours.</p>

<p>The Minister also referred to consultation with the parties but no mention is made of that in the Bill. The only thing mentioned there is the notification to parties. No provision is made for consultation. The Minister said that there would in fact be consultation and it is possible that he will consider including it in this clause as well.</p>

<p>With the exception of those three points which have caused us a little concern, we accept the Bill in principle and we hope that at the Committee Stage we will be able to support the Bill in its particulars as well.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member for Durban (Point) raised those three points. I want to give him the assurance that, considering the changes which we are now making. <span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0216"/>particularly in so far as the Act now provides that a period of at least five years should elapse before a general registration of voters, the Act does not therefore stipulate that it must be six years. It states, &#x201C;not more than six years&#x201D;. Consequently I think I can give him the assurance that it is the intention to arrange that general registration in such a way that it will in fact take place early enough so that there will at least be an opportunity for one supplementary registration to take place before an election. I think that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself complained last year when my Vote was under discussion, that it was not desirable to submit old or meaningless voters&#x2019; rolls. In the urban constituencies in particular there is so much movement of the people that the tracing of various people presents great problems to the parties.</p>

<p>What about the idea of a central registration office&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>When my Vote is being discussed, I may perhaps have something to say about that. We are working in that direction.</p>

<p>He has requested firstly that we should undertake the registration for Natal and the Free State on a provincial constituency basis and not on a Parliamentary constituency basis because the provincial elections are to take place sooner than the Parliamentary elections. I shall go into that idea and determine whether it is practicable, since it is surely also the intention with re-registration to ensure that all one&#x2019;s voters get onto the voters&#x2019; roll, and to make it as easy as possible for political parties to trace voters. That is why I have no basic faults to find with the principle behind that idea. In respect of the hours worked by the presiding officers, it follows naturally that proper notifications will be issued. The public and the political parties must know where they can take their voters who want to vote as special voters to after hours in cases where, for example, there will only be one place for this to be done and the times for doing so will be laid down, as compared to other places where such times will not be laid down because it will not be necessary to do so. The electoral officers and the chief electoral officers have already had a great deal of experience with the introduction of this new system of voting. In my opinion the responsibility can be conferred upon them, because of the experience which they have at their disposal, to determine whether there should, in Oudtshoorn for example, be more places available where votes may be cast by means of special ballot papers, i.e. throughout the night, or perhaps just for one night, or whether or not after-hour voting ought to take place. I want to mention the example of De Rust, the town nearest to the place where I was born and raised. There it is not necessary for people to remain after hours, because we vote early there, we vote for the National Party, and we get over with it.</p>

<p>I shall go into the necessity for including an amendment in respect of consultation with political parties, with the purpose of introducing that amendment, possibly in the Committee Stage. I feel very strongly about this matter because I do not think it is sound, seen from the point of view of general principles, not to hold thorough consultations with one&#x2019;s political parties in such a matter. If we consult them with the appointment of certain electoral officers. then why not do so in these cases as well&#x003F; The hon. member need not feel any doubts about the matter. I shall go into it.</p>
