<question by="#thompson" to="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<num>*II.</num>

<from>Mr. THOMPSON</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) How many border industries have been established for the benefit of the Transkei, (b) what industries are they, (c) when were they established and (d) how far is each from the nearest point of the Transkei border;</li>

<li>(2) how many (a) Bantu and (b) Whites are employed in these industries;</li>

<li>(3) what has been the total cost to the State of the aid, benefits, incentives, remissions and other assistance given to these industries.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#thompson">

<from>The MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</from>

<p>(for the Minister of Economic Affairs):</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) As I explained on 28 April 1964 in this House in reply to a question by the hon. member all border area industries located in the Ciskei area are established for the joint benefit of both the Ciskei and the Transkei. On the same occasion I also mentioned that there is no compulsory registration of industries in South Africa and exact particulars of industries established in the areas referred to cannot, therefore, be furnished.</li>

</ol>

<p>Having regard to this explanation the required information is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="col_2725-2726" refersTo="page_1378"/>In addition the Permanent Committee is aware of extensions to 20 existing undertakings in this area which have been carried out partly with the assistance of the Government&#x2019;s special incentive measures. Particulars in respect of 15 of them I have already furnished in my reply of 28 April 1964. Of the further five undertakings which have been extended four are situated in the accepted border area at East London, approximately 35 miles from the Transkei border, and one is situated at Queenstown, approximately four miles from the Ciskei.</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) The estimated total employment by the six new undertakings is (a) 2,780 and (b) 550, while the total additional number of Bantu employees at the 20 existing undertakings is estimated at 2,000.</li>

<li>(3) Non-recoverable assistance estimated as follows:</li>

</table>

<p>In addition a railage rebate of 10 per cent has been instituted on all goods manufactured in the Ciskei/Transkei border area for distribution elsewhere in the Republic. Thus far R179,335 has been voted by Parliament for this purpose.</p>

<p>It is not possible at this stage to give an indication of the cost in regard to the Bantu textile training school which is being erected at M&#x2019;Dantzane for the benefit of all textile industries in the Ciskei/Transkei border area. This expenditure will, however, be debited against the Bantu Trust Account.</p>

<li>(2) No. Investigations have thus far proved that complaints of alleged exploitation were in most cases based on the fact that the complainants did not feel inclined or were unable to pay small justified increases in rentals. Pensioners and other persons in the lower income group in general insisted on rentals which they considered reasonable. The increases against which most objections were lodged, proved to be only adjustments of rentals on the level on which rentals were before the measure of recession which was experienced a few years ago, set in.<br/>In general it thus appears as if the many allegations of exploitation are largely unfounded and that the amendment of the Rents Act last year to a great extent had the desired restrictive effect on the increase of rentals.</li>

<heading>Telegram by Prime Minister to S.A. Postal Association</heading>

<from>Mr. E. G. MALAN</from>

<p>asked the Prime Minister:</p>

<block name="quote">What was the full text of the telegram reported to have been sent by him on 4 March 1965, to the South African Postal and Telegraph Association.</block>

</question>

<answer by="#prime_minister" to="#malan">

<from>The PRIME MINISTER:</from>

<p>The text of the telegram reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">To: President, Postal and Telegraph Association, Gordon&#x2019;s Bay.</block>

<block name="quote">Cabinet appreciates goodwill displayed in your telegram on staff problems of Post Office and also appreciates important services which Post Office personnel render with so much efficiency and devotion in difficult circumstances and staff shortages. Since Cabinet desires everybody to be treated fairly, also in these times when dangers of inflation call for caution, it has instituted a comparative inquiry into alleged unfavourable position. It stands to reason that such an inquiry will take up much time. The Cabinet will consider the report immediately after it has been submitted. Your reference to an alleged possibility that salaries could be pegged before matters could reach that stage, is totally wrong, since no intention exists. No more has been announced than that sensible action is required both by salary and wage earners in their own interest in respect of demands for increases, as well as by those who must decide on general increases.</block>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to seriously consider appealing to linguistic and literary bodies and persons to inquire into and report upon the deterioration and degeneration of (a) the Afrikaans language and (b) the English language in South Africa, and to suggest ways and means of combating this alarming state of affairs.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, here one immediately sees the hand of the officials</p>

<p>Where I wrote &#x201C;middels&#x201D; they changed it to &#x201C;middele&#x201D;. &#x201C;Middels&#x201D; denotes means but not in the pecuniary sense; &#x201C;middele&#x201D; denotes money&#x2014;the monetary means to do something. To begin with, I should like to say what I do not intend doing. In the first place, I do not wish to enter at all into the merits or demerits of any literary works. My motion is confined exclusively to the philological aspects of Afrikaans and English in South Africa. In the second place, I do not wish to create the impression that I am excessively puristic as far as language is concerned. For example, I have no objection to the taking over of certain useful words from English or from any other language. We have already done this in the case of &#x201C;keeps&#x201D; as against &#x201C;pet&#x201D;, &#x201C;jellie&#x201D; as against &#x201C;dril&#x201D;, &#x201C;tenk&#x201D; and other similar words. Likewise, English has taken over Afrikaans words such as &#x201C;veld&#x201D;, &#x201C;spoor&#x201D;, &#x201C;krans&#x201D;, &#x201C;kraal&#x201D; and many others. Such judicious borrowings enrich a language. In my view, however, the genius of the Afrikaans language has already gone too far in its endeavour to coin new words, sometimes with great success, but sometimes with much resultant confusion and waste of time. Just think of the notorious case we had when we translated the English word &#x201C;taxi&#x201D; as &#x201C;huurmotor&#x201D;, until after many years we found that in fact it was not a &#x201C;huurmotor&#x201D; but a &#x201C;taxi&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member would only consult his Latin dictionary, he would soon find out.</p>

<p>For example, I would have no objection if we took over the English word &#x201C;flat&#x201D; to replace the equally meaningless &#x201C;woonstel&#x201D; or &#x201C;deelhuis&#x201D;. I would have no objection if we took over a word such as &#x201C;lift&#x201D; to replace the confusing &#x201C;hyser&#x201D; or &#x201C;hysbak&#x201D;. I am told&#x2014;I cannot vouch for this, because I did not have an opportunity to verify it&#x2014;that the instrument we translate as a &#x201C;bobbejaanklou&#x201D; in actual fact has no connection with a &#x201C;bobbejaan&#x201D; (monkey). It is a wrench that is believed to have been invented and marketed by a man named &#x201C;Monkey&#x201D;. Persons requiring this particular type of wrench then asked for a &#x201C;monkey wrench&#x201D;. We then translated it as &#x201C;bobbejaanklou&#x201D;. I cannot vouch for the truth of this, but what I can vouch for is that we translated a word such as &#x201C;sandwich&#x201D; as &#x201C;toebroodjie&#x201D;, which is a silly word. &#x201C;Sandwich&#x201D; is derived from the Earl of Sandwich. I believe that he sometimes played cards for 24 hours on end, and in order not to have his cardplaying interrupted he had slices of bread filled with cheese or meat or something like that prepared for him. I wonder what an &#x201C;oopbroodjie&#x201D; would be!</p>

<p>What about a&#x201C;boterhap&#x201D;?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, a &#x201C;boterhap&#x201D;, and then you have meat or bacon in it. Then one could rather talk of &#x201C;spekenham&#x201D;. Such borrowings of words do not affect the peculiarity of a language, because its peculiarity lies in the construction, in the turn of phrase and the mode of expression and, last but not least, in the verb and in the preposition.</p>

<p>In the third place, I do not wish to concern myself with slight departures from good Afrikaans idiom, although it would be very useful to pay more attention to these departures in the right place and at the right time. I do not wish to dwell on the fact, for example, that the correct expression is &#x201C;&#x2019;n wet op een lyn met &#x2019;n ander bring&#x201D; and not &#x201C;&#x2019;n wet in lyn met &#x2019;n ander&#x201D;, nor do I wish to dwell on what has now become common, viz., &#x201C;Jan is verloof aan Annie&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;&#x2026; met Annie&#x201D;. I do not wish either to devote a great deal of attention to the incorrect use of words as in the case of &#x201C;verbete&#x201D;. &#x201C;Verbete&#x201D; is derived from the verb &#x201C;verbyt&#x201D;, which means &#x201C;to stifle or to suppress&#x201D; (terugbyt, onderdruk). One may therefore speak of &#x201C;verbete liefde&#x201D; or &#x201C;verbete haat&#x201D;. It refers particularly to emotions. But one cannot possibly speak of &#x201C;&#x2019;n verbete stryd&#x201D; or &#x201C;verbete vyande&#x201D;. &#x201C;Verbete&#x201D;, however, has become common in Afrikaans, and I leave it at that.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, I do not wish to express any particular opinion on the deterioration in the usage of English as a language in South Africa. I do not regard myself as an authority in that field and I should like to leave it to my English-speaking friends in this House to deal with it. I merely want to say that various university professors, such as Prof. Guy Butler, and several lecturers at the University of Cape Town, the Society for the Preservation of Pure English in South Africa, universities such as Rhodes and others have expressed their deep concern in the past over the deterioration in the usage of English in South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_2757-2758" refersTo="page_1394"/> What I have to do, Mr. Speaker, in the first place is to point out horrible linguistic monstrosities, anglicism in particular, which are once again corroding the Afrikaans language and causing the language to degenerate and to become impoverished, just as in the late twenties and the early thirties when, first at Stellenbosch and subsequently with the assistance of periodicals such as the <i>Huisgenoot,</i> we counteracted this degradation and to a large extent put a stop to it. We are back at the stage where people are beginning to think that if they simply translate an English expression into Afrikaans words they are speaking good Afrikaans. The example I have in mind&#x2014;and I will be forgiven for mentioning it; it is the only example I want to mention that refers to something that happened in this House&#x2014;is that of an hon. member who, some years ago, speaking after an opponent, became very upset and very angry with the man and said: &#x201C;Mnr. die Speaker, daardie man het dit en dat gedoen en het sus en so gepraat, en nou het hy die senuwee om hier te kom se dat hy dit of dat bedoel het.&#x201D; This is no exaggeration. We are back at the stage where people say, as a friend said to me: &#x201C;Hy wil nou gou na die winkel gaan want dit is verskriklik hoe hy deesdae uit sy hemde hardloop,&#x201D; or, as the chemist said to the student who had been swotting too hard: &#x201C;Man, jou hele sisteem is afgehardloop. Jy het &#x2019;n tel-my-op nodig. Ek sal dit vir jou rondstuur.&#x201D; They simply render a literal translation of the English expression and then they think they are speaking good Afrikaans. Sir, if anyone thinks I am exaggerating, I could spend hours here mentioning examples to you from our best daily papers, periodicals, radio broadcasts, books and even books prescribed at school, examples of these linguistic monstrosities that are commonly used in Afrikaans. The other day, for example, I read in a very well-known periodical of ours the story of how the late Jan Wilkens, after getting into some difficulty in his maiden speech in this House because his notes had become disarranged, looked up at the gallery, where his wife sat listening anxiously and, according to the writer of this article, &#x201C;Hy het haar oog gevang&#x201D;. Sir, in Afrikaans one cannot &#x201C;catch a person&#x2019;s eye&#x201D; as one would catch a piece of sausage that is flung at one. One catches a person&#x2019;s attention (jy trek iemand se aandag), or your eyes meet (jul blikke ontmoet mekaar), or something like that, but for heaven&#x2019;s sake we cannot tolerate the expression, &#x201C;to catch a person&#x2019;s eye&#x201D; as though one is catching a piece of sausage flung at one!</p>

<p>About a month ago I read in one of our newspapers that while playing golf an hon. Minister was experiencing some difficulty with his game. He probably made a few mistakes&#x2014;I know nothing about the game, but that is what I inferred. And then the columnist said: &#x201C;Maar dit sal uitgestryk word soos die Sitting vorder en namate hy sy oog in kry.&#x201D; What does this mean? If it means anything in Afrikaans, it can only mean that from time to time someone has to set to work on the hon. Minister with a flat-iron, preferably a hot one, and pass the flat-iron over his joints and those parts of his body that he uses most when playing golf, as one does when ironing out the creases in a newly-washed and dried sheet. And then he still has &#x201C;to get his eye in&#x201D; (Sy oog in kry). In some way or other he has to get his eye, or an artificial eye, into his eyesocket. I would recommend that, instead of doing it himself, he should rather get a surgeon to do it. What the writer wanted to say was the following: &#x201C;Namate die Sitting vorder sal die Minister sy foute meester raak&#x201D; or &#x201C;hy sal sy gebreke te bowe kom namate sy oog meer geoefen raak.&#x201D; That is all he wanted to say. But he simply went along and made a literal translation of the English and used it as Afrikaans. I do not wish to weary the House with a long list of anglicisms such as these, anglicisms that I have collected during the past months. I have them here, but it would take a very long time to read them out. I just want to mention a few to you. One reads in the newspapers: &#x201C;Iemand het &#x2019;n vergadering opgebreek.&#x201D; One can use the expression, &#x201C;&#x2019;n wind opbreek&#x201D; but not &#x201C;&#x2019;n vergadering opbreek&#x201D;. The correct expression is &#x201C;&#x2019;n vergadering verongeluk&#x201D;. In saying that our Blacks are &#x201C;better off&#x201D; economically than the Blacks in the rest of Africa, they use the phrase &#x201C;beter af&#x201D; in Afrikaans, instead of using the phrase &#x201C;beter daaraan toe&#x201D;. I read &#x201C;hy het &#x2019;n byl te slyp&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;hy soek sy eie belang&#x201D; or &#x201C;hy handel in eie belang&#x201D; or &#x201C;hy het byoogmerke of bybedoelings&#x201D;. A literal translation of the English. The variety of ways in which this expression can be rendered in Afrikaans is an indication of the extent to which the language is being impoverished through the intrusion of anglicisms. But I will come back to this at a later stage. Let me give some further examples &#x2018;that we come across in the newspapers almost every day: &#x201C;Jou rug op iemand draai&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;iemand die rug toe te keer&#x201D; or &#x201C;iemand met die nek aan te kyk&#x201D;; &#x201C;laste jaar&#x201D; and &#x201C;laaste vergadering&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;verlede jaar&#x201D; and &#x201C;die vorige vergadering&#x201D;; &#x201C;die laaste aantal jare&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;die afgelope aantal jare&#x201D;. Three times in one article I came across the phrase that &#x201C;&#x2019;n vrou geboorte gegee het aan &#x2019;n kind&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;die lewe aan &#x2019;n kind geskenk het&#x201D;. I have even read that &#x201C;iemand geboorte aan &#x2019;n gedagte gegee het&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Sy skenk die lewe aan &#x2019;n kind.&#x201D; If the hon. member wants to argue with me about it, we can talk about it later on, but I say that the correct Afrikaans expression is &#x201C;die lewe aan &#x2019;n kind skenk&#x201D;. The other day in a literary column, of all places, the writer asked: &#x201C;Trek hy nie weer ons been nie?&#x201D;, instead of: &#x201C;Skeer hy nie weer met ons die gek nie?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Hou hy ons nie vir die gek nie?&#x201D; <span class="col_2759-2760" refersTo="page_1395"/>or &#x201C;Spot hy nie met ons nie?&#x201D;. I have also come across the expression &#x201C;die land se ekonomie is lamgele&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;verlam&#x201D;. Other expressions that I have come across are the following, that a Minister of ours who visited Holland had the experience &#x201C;dat hulle hom die koue skouer gegee het&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;hom die rug toegekeer het&#x201D;; &#x201C;iemand op die verkeerde voet vang&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;iemand onverhoeds te betrap&#x201D;; &#x201C;die skuld daarvan aan die deur van die Regering le&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;dit die Regering ten laste l&#x00EA;&#x201D;, or &#x201C;die Regering dit te verwyt&#x201D;. Sir, I could go on giving an endless series of examples such as &#x201C;met iets wegkom&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;iet slinks gedoen kry&#x201D;, &#x201C;iet klaarspeel&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, to prove how the language is being impoverished through this intrusion of anglicisms, this slovenly use of words, I just want to mention two series of examples to you, the first in connection with a verb and the other in connection with a noun. The first concerns the way in which we are inclined, both in our written and in our spoken language, to use the English expression &#x201C;to do&#x201D;; simply to take it over literally and to use it in Afrikaans. Then we read: &#x201C;Die vrou het haar hare laat doen&#x201D;, instead of saying in Afrikaans what precisely she had done to her hair: &#x201C;Sy het haar hare laat kap&#x201D;, or &#x201C;sy het haar hare laat krul&#x201D;, &#x201C;sy het haar hare laat kleur&#x201D;, or &#x201C;sy het haar hare laat afsny&#x201D;. But now we simply say: &#x201C;Sy het haar hare laat doen&#x201D;. Another expression I have come across is, &#x201C;Die student doen regte&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;hy student in die regte&#x201D;, or &#x201C;hy le &#x2019;n kursus in die regte af&#x201D;. Then they say: &#x201C;Die nuwe pad na die Kaap is so lekker, jy kan dit nou in tien minute doen&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;die afstand in tien minute afl&#x00EA;&#x201D;, or &#x201C;daarheen in tien minute ry&#x201D;. It is the English word &#x201C;do&#x201D; which, translated literally, destroys all the wealth and variety of the Afrikaans language: &#x201C;Sy het haar lesse gedoen&#x201D;, instead of, if they happen to be music lessons, &#x201C;sy het geoefen&#x201D;, or, if they happen to relate to prescribed works, &#x201C;sy leer&#x201D;, and so forth.</p>

<p>I want to deal now with the example in connection with a noun, and to show how by making a direct translation of the English word we sacrifice the rich variety of Afrikaans. I take the word &#x201C;punt&#x201D;. &#x201C;Daar het jy &#x2019;n punt&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;daar het jy iets&#x201D;, or &#x201C;dit is &#x2019;n argument&#x201D;. &#x201C;Daar is geen punt daaraan nie&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;dit het geen sin nie&#x201D;. Just recently I came across &#x201C;besit is nege punt van die wet&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;salig is die besitter&#x201D;; &#x201C;as dit tot die punt kom&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;as dit daarop aankom&#x201D;; &#x201C;dit is sy sterk punt&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;sy krag l&#x00EA; daarin&#x201D;, or &#x201C;hy munt daarin uit&#x201D;; &#x201C;dit is nou net die punt&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;dit is juis waarop dit aankom&#x201D;, or &#x201C;dit is juis waarom dit gaan&#x201D;; &#x201C;tot die punt kom&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;ter sake kom&#x201D;; &#x201C;&#x2019;n punt maak&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;&#x2019;n argument stel&#x201D;, or &#x201C;&#x2019;n punt beredeneer&#x201D;. In Afrikaans the expression &#x201C;&#x2019;n punt maak&#x201D; can only be used to denote what you do when you take a writing-instrument, a piece of paper, and make on it the punctuation-mark that we know as a fullstop. That is the only meaning of the expression &#x201C;&#x2019;n punt maak&#x201D;. &#x201C;Jy moet &#x2019;n punt daarvan maak&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;jy moet werk daarvan maak&#x201D;, or &#x201C;jy moet jou dit ten doel stel&#x201D;, or &#x201C;jy moet jou daarop toespits&#x201D;, or &#x201C;&#x2026; daarop toel&#x00EA;&#x201D;, or &#x201C;jy moet daarop aandring&#x201D;. We discard a whole rich variety of possibilities in translating the English expression literally. People talk about, &#x201C;Jou punt maak&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;jou stelling te bewys&#x201D; of &#x201C;jou bewering te staaf&#x201D;; &#x201C;op alle punte&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;in elke opsig&#x201D;; &#x201C;die punt mis&#x201D; or &#x201C;die punt nie sien nie&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;die saak nie snap nie&#x201D; or &#x201C;dit miskyk&#x201D;&#x2014;thus I could mention a whole series of &#x201C;punte&#x201D;. Another expression that I have come across is, &#x201C;op tot &#x2019;n punt met iemand saamstem&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;tot op sekere hoogte&#x201D; or &#x201C;in sekere mate met iemand saamstem&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I think, Mr. Speaker, I have adduced sufficient proof of the way in which we are improving the Afrikaans language through the intrusion of anglicisms, the way in which we are destroying its individuality and allowing it to degenerate into what virtually amounts to gibberish.</p>

<p>Sir, you may ask me, &#x201C;Why must we keep Afrikaans pure? Why must we keep English pure?&#x201D; People ask me, &#x201C;Why cannot we allow the two languages to fuse and form one common language?&#x201D; When I raise the objection that in Belgium the Flemings speak Flemish and the Walloons speak French, and that in Switzerland in the various cantons they speak either French or Italian or German, and that in Canada they speak either English or French, the usual reply is: &#x201C;Yes, but there the people are territorially separated, whereas here we live in a mixed community, and in the Eastern Province particularly and other parts English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking people live amongst one another. Why should we not just allow the two languages to fuse and make one common language out of the two?&#x201D; Let me tell you, Sir, what my objection is to such a mixed language. My first argument applies to both English and Afrikaans. When you love a person you prefer to regard that person as pure and unsullied. When you love your language you prefer to have it used in its pure, unadulterated form; you prefer to see it in the unsullied glory of its own individuality, you prefer to have it &#x201C;by foreign taint unsullied&#x201D;. No-one can love a mixed jargon. Language is not merely a means of communicating ideas in a limited circle. The highest and the noblest sentiments of a nation are expressed in its language, and for sentiments to be noble and pure the language in which they are expressed must be noble and pure and unsullied. &#x201C;Taal is gans die volk&#x201D; (Language is the soul of the nation). A nation&#x2019;s identity, its tradition, its past, its present and its future are all contained in its language. I should like to put this in the words of a German poet, who unlike many people to-day, expressed himself lucidly. He was forthright in saying <span class="col_2761-2762" refersTo="page_1396"/> what he had in mind. He was not handicapped by the present-day obscurity of expression. Before we had the abracadabra of Dadaism, the only man who occasionally wrote with such terrible obscurity was Robert Browning, who when someone once showed him a few lines of verse and asked him: &#x201C;What did you mean when you wrote this?&#x201D;, replied: &#x201C;When I wrote that, only the Lord and I know what it meant, and I have since forgotten.&#x201D; This old German poet said that he know many languages, that he had full command of many languages, but he declared&#x2014;</p>

Mr. Speaker, I wish all hon. members and all Afrikaans-speaking people would repeat the following words after me: &#x201C;My language is my love. My language to me is a passion, a catharsis, a means of unbosoming myself. I want to love my language in the full glory of its dazzling purity. My language is the essence of my soul, and I want to keep the essence of my soul pure from the stinking fumes of language corruption.&#x201D; As Lodewijk van Deyssel, the Dutch poet of the Eighties said: &#x201C;Give me prose to adore, give me language to love.&#x201D; This is my first argument as to why we should keep our language pure.</p>

<p>My second argument is a much more practical one and it is this: If we mix English with Afrikaans and turn the two into an amalgamate jargon, we would lose the key to the door of one of the richest literatures in the world, the English one. Mr. Speaker whatever may become of the English people, whatever their future may be, or wherever they may go, one thing will remain forever and that is the English literature, which, seen as one literature of one people is perhaps the greatest and richest in the world. And if we are going to debase English in South Africa to the level of a jargon and a mixed language, we are going to allow the key to that door to slip out of our hands.</p>

<p>I quite agree.</p>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>Then there is a third argument, and this applies to us Afrikaners. In large measure English to-day is and will probably remain for a very long time to come, the commercial language of the world. If in this country we allow English and Afrikaans to become a mixed language, we shall be handicapping ourselves in world trade and we shall be unable to participate in it fully.</p>

<p>Sir, in the light of this I should like you to consider how we are making the task of the language teacher and of the lecturer in language more difficult. The language teacher comes along and says to the students: &#x201C;Look, it is wrong&#x201D;&#x2014;as I said to my hon. friend&#x2014;&#x201C;to say &#x2018;geboorte gee&#x2019;.&#x201D; The next day the pupil comes along with some newspaper or periodical or even with a book in which the expression is used. As an ex-newspaperman I want to concede that many errors do creep into newspapers. You cannot avoid them, because you have to work against the clock. But the pupil comes along with a periodical or even with his prescribed book and says: &#x201C;But, Sir, here it stands.&#x201D; If you then say, &#x201C;But it is wrong,&#x201D; he replies, &#x201C;But surely this book was prescribed by clever people; surely they would not prescribe a book if it contained errors such as these.&#x201D; We are making the work of the lecturer in language and the language teacher infinitely difficult.</p>

<p>I have mentioned prescribed books. Here I have a book in my hand. I shall not mention the name of the author and the title of the book, but this book was prescribed for Afrikaans B in matriculation this year, i.e. mainly for English-speaking children. This book has been reprinted times without number. Explanatory notes and an introduction were subsequently added by someone else, and in this form there have already been 13 or 14 impressions of it. I started reading this book from the beginning; after a while I skipped a few pages and read a few more that I chose at random, until I had read 20 pages, and in these 20 pages there were no fewer than 85 linguistic monstrosities, mainly anglicisms, i.e. more than four to a page, and this, Sir, is a book that has been prescribed for our schools.</p>

<p>What means can we employ to combat this state of affairs? In the first place we can see to it that every newspaper has a language editor. He cannot prevent the sub-editor or the reporter from committing certain errors because they work under pressure. What he can do, however, is what I did when I was editor, and that is to read through my newspaper from the first to the last page in the evenings, the advertisements as well; to make a list of all the language errors in it; to write the correct expression next to each; to have these typed in the morning and displayed in the staff room for everyone to read. The second thing we can do is that all publishers, when accepting manuscripts, should see to it that the manuscript is sub-edited by a properly qualified linguist and is not published full of linguistic monstrosities. In the third place commissions and agencies that prescribe books should have regard not only to the literary quality of a work, but also to the language used in the book, and if the language is not pure, they should refuse to prescribe such a book, because this is where we blunt the child&#x2019;s sense of language at school. In the fourth place we should all make it our daily endeavour to write and to speak our language, whether it be Afrikaans or English, correctly and in its purest form. <span class="col_2763-2764" refersTo="page_1397"/>One can easily do this by consulting good dictionaries when one is in any doubt. By so doing we will be sharpening our sense of language and feeling for pure language to such an extent that after a while we will come to spot the impurities quite automatically.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I wish to say that we should read more Dutch, not the Dutch of to-day, which is also riddled with English expressions, but the Dutch classics. I believe, and I believe it with all my heart, that the degeneration of our language and the blunting of our sense of language is in large measure attributable to the fact that Dutch has become a foreign language to us and to the fact that we no longer read Dutch.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to put forward the plea that our Department of Education, Arts and Science should be extended and enlarged so that in the fullest sense it will embrace and encourage everything that is concerned with education and culture, so that it will become a portfolio for cultural matters so as to include all groups of the population; and then it should not simply be tagged on to another department; we should make it an independent ministry, for the task is such a major one and involves such a great deal, and so much depends upon it for our people, for both sections of the people, that it will be doubly worth the trouble and the cost, and there will be more than enough work for a Minister of Cultural Affairs.</p>

<from>*Dr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place, I should like to congratulate the hon. member on his scientific approach to this very important motion before the House. I would rather not refer to all the examples he gave as being anglicisms and say that they must be expunged from our language. As I will indicate in the course of my speech, many of these sentences or phrases or words which he mentioned have already been generally accepted in Afrikaans, just as many expressions from other languages have become accepted in the English and the Germanic languages. I should have liked to have gone into this matter in greater detail, because it is essential for us to use our language in as pure a form as possible, but in the short time available to me that is of course impossible and we cannot really do justice to this very important matter. I shall therefore be compelled, in the few minutes at my disposal, to confine myself to certain definite aspects and to confine myself more particularly to this House. There is no doubt that there has been a marked deterioration in recent years in regard to the use of language, in so far as both English and Afrikaans are concerned, as the mother tongue, as the home language, and also as the second language. My hon. friend confined himself particularly to the home language. The faulty use of language is a fact we cannot deny, particularly we who sit in this House (Huis).</p>

<p>Hon. members are mistaken. The word &#x201C;Huis&#x201D; has already been accepted. We talk about the Higher House and the Lower House. Hon. members should first think before they speak! In this House we daily hear examples of the great injustice being done either to English or Afrikaans as our mother tongue or home language and, one might almost say, where the official languages, both English and Afrikaans, are sometimes &#x201C;murdered&#x201D;. In most cases it is not done because we know no better. We do know better; our faulty use of language is mainly due to the fact that we are too lazy or too careless to use the correct word or phrase, or to ensure that the syntax is correct and is not mangled; and in so far as Afrikaans is concerned&#x2014;and I confine myself mainly to Afrikaans&#x2014;to ensure that we do not use an anglicism or a Hollandism or a Germanism or a Gallicism. Afrikaans was and is still being influenced by many other languages, and they have all left their mark on our language. Therefore we should not point to anglicisms only, but also to the influence of other languages on our language.</p>

<p>Then what remains?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asks what remains. He should just listen to his own speeches in order to realize that little remains which we have not borrowed from other languages.</p>

<p>Perhaps our faulty language in this House is due to the fact that we are busy people and simply do not have the time to pay attention to the correct use of our languages, or perhaps we are too lazy, in so far as Afrikaans is concerned, to use pure language. We are also very inclined to use the first word which comes to mind out of the English, French or German languages. Our Afrikaans teems with anglicisms on both sides of the House, and they come from the lips of people who ought to know better. Perhaps we may be forgiven for using faulty language when speaking, but I think I should make an appeal to all of us, when we read through our Hansard reports, to correct our mistakes so that linguists outside will not have reason for criticizing us as they do to-day. I believe that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) has rendered a service to English and Afrikaans, both as the home languages and as second languages, by introducing this motion, and therefore I want to support him in principle.</p>

<p>Like the hon. member, I am no purist, but I am opposed to the slovenly use of language. We cannot, however, condemn without further ado the use of words or phrases borrowed from other languages. Many English or French or German or Greek or Latin words have already become part of the Afrikaans language, such as jingo, whisky, gentleman, poeding and <span class="col_2765-2766" refersTo="page_1398"/>pennie, and from French the words garage (motorhuis is not a good Afrikaans word, in my opinion) and trousseau. All these words have already become part of our language; they have become &#x201C;naturalized&#x201D;. Many words, also from Latin, have become part of our language through another language, such as kerk, skrywe, pen, brief, roos. Many words From the Greek have entered our language through Latin, such as priester, evangelie, aalmoes, all words which have enriched our language and have become &#x201C;naturalized&#x201D; and should be welcomed in our language. Words life telefoon, telegraaf, bioskoop, aspirien, are no longer strange words or anglicisms. They have become part of our language. They have been adopted by us from the Greek language through English. In this way I can continue to point out that it would not be wrong to use certain words or phrases from German or French or Nederlands, but it should not be overdone, and therefore we should expunge the following words from our language before we can say in this House that we talk pure Afrikaans. All the examples I am now going to mention, some of hundreds which I have jotted down in recent years, are still used in this House practically every day. And then I am not even referring to expressions such as I heard only yesterday from one of our leading members: &#x201C;Het jy dit opge-check?&#x201D; I do not even wish to refer to that sort of barbarous use of language. But in this House we so often hear about &#x201C;stappe neem&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;stappe doen&#x201D;. That is a slovenliness which should be avoided. We speak about &#x201C;die man wie&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;die man wat&#x201D;; &#x201C;hy was gebore&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;hy is gebore&#x201D;; &#x201C;groot somme geld word gestem&#x201D;. It should be &#x201C;groot bedrae word gestem&#x201D;. &#x201C;De Regering spandeer sy geld&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;bestee sy geld&#x201D;. &#x201C;Meer of min&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;min of meer&#x201D;; &#x201C;siende dat&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;aangesien&#x201D;. In the Transvaal our hon. friends opposite very often say &#x201C;groei ons baie mielies&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;kweek ons baie mielies&#x201D;. The hon. member for Cradock &#x201C;groei wol&#x201D;; he belongs to the &#x201C;Wolgroeiersvereniging&#x201D;! We talk about &#x201C;Marksgeboue&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Marksgebou&#x201D;; &#x201C;die kat uit die sak laat&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;die aap uit die mou laat&#x201D;; &#x201C;jy sal my nie afsit nie&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;van stryk bring&#x201D;. &#x201C;Ek sal jou &#x2019;n drankie staan.&#x201D; I hear that every day just before 1 o&#x2019;clock, instead of &#x201C;Ek sal jou op &#x2019;n drankie trakteer&#x201D;. &#x201C;Ek sal myself bedwing&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Ek sal my bedwing&#x201D;. &#x201C;Ek is jammer&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Ek het jammer&#x201D;; &#x201C;Hy dra brille&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Hy dra &#x2019;n bril&#x201D;; &#x201C;Hy is &#x2019;n brawe soldaat&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;Hy is &#x2019;n dapper soldaat&#x201D;; &#x201C;tot &#x2019;n sekere mate&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;in &#x2019;n sekere mate&#x201D;; &#x201C;by hierdie tyd behoort julle te weet&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;teen hierdie tyd behoort julle te weet&#x201D;; &#x201C;hy is op vakansie&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;hy is met vakansie&#x201D;. &#x201C;Die Opposisie slaan die verkeerde houding in&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;neem die verkeerde houding aan&#x201D;. The hon. member for Cradock says &#x201C;hy veg vir die belange van die boere&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;hy behartig die belange van die boere&#x201D;. &#x201C;Die Regering sal al die hinderpale oorwin&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;dit uit de weg ruim&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, this faulty use of our language is only a repetition of what happens outside. We do not improve on what is said outside, and the question now arises as to what we should do to prevent the faulty use of language.</p>

<p>The hon. member made a few suggestions. I think we in this House should prepare our speeches more carefully before we get up to speak here; we should also direct an appeal to the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie van Wetenskap en Kuns, to the Saamwerk-unie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings as well as to the English cultural associations, to continue with their good work and to see to it that the use of Afrikaans or English does not deteriorate; we must ensure that language teachers receive proper training; and, most important in my opinion, we should devote more attention to language education and put less emphasis on examination results.</p>

<p>This is of course an extremely difficult matter because the wrong use of language slips in so easily. I am glad the hon. member has corrected his linguistic mistake, &#x201C;wee en middele&#x201D;, but it still stands in our votes and proceedings. One of the most highly educated men in this House uses such an ugly anglicism!</p>

<p>I am not blaming anybody, but if it is a mistake made by the officials then they made that mistake without the hon. member correcting it. If we get this faulty use of language from our most learned men, from older people, what can we expect from the young ones? I sometimes make the same mistakes.</p>

<p>However, in principle I support what the hon. member has submitted to us here and I trust that this brief discussion to-day will fall on fertile soil. But although I support the object of this motion, I nevertheless do not think that making an appeal to the literary bodies will be very fruitful. I think that as a House we should be more positive and we ourselves should suggest something more practical. Therefore I want to suggest that the Minister appoint a commission to investigate this matter, although this is only one aspect of it. This commission should not confine itself to the faulty use of the mother tongue alone. I also ask that it should consider the use of the second language and investigate why the standard of the second language is deteriorating to such an extent. I think that our people are in fact willing to learn the second language, but nevertheless we find that its use is increasingly deteriorating. For this I personally blame the single medium schools throughout the country, and therefore I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to say that it is a genuine pleasure to me to discover this motion on the Order Paper today and I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) on the sentiments it contains. I think it warrants the support of members on both sides of the House. On the other hand, I am afraid I am not able to congratulate the hon. member upon his use of the English language as far as the text of his motion is concerned. I concede that it may be that the original draft was in Afrikaans and not in English.</p>

<from>Mrs.<person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>If that is the case, the fault lies with the translator, but that does not improve the English, and since the whole purpose of this motion is to draw attention to the deterioration in the standards of the two official languages in South Africa, the hon. member will not take it amiss if I say that we are justified in expecting the terms of the motion itself at least to be linguistically correct. I do not want to make too much fuss about it, but I would like to point out, first, that there is a split infinitive in the first line of the motion where it says that this House requests the Government &#x201C;to seriously consider&#x201D; a perfect example of bad English. And then both the words &#x201C;deteriorate&#x201D; and &#x201C;degenerate&#x201D; are used, and they have an almost identical meaning in English. So the mover of the motion, wittingly or otherwise, or through his translator, has in fact given us an example of what is known as a tautolgy, in other words, saying the same thing twice over in different words. We are talking about the maintenance of the standards of English and Afrikaans, and I am perfectly entitled to make my point. The word &#x201C;deteriorate&#x201D; means to grow worse, and the word &#x201C;degenerate&#x201D; means to sink from former excellence, and in the context of this motion they both mean the same thing. So whereas we support the sentiments contained in this motion, it is a matter of regret to us that the hon. member, who is a Doctor of Education, should have failed to check the motion, even the translation of it, since the motion itself pleads that the standard of our languages should be upheld. [Interjection.] If the hon. member never saw the translation I would say that it was his duty to do so. In any case it remains bad English.</p>

<p>We are faced with a very real problem in regard to this language question in the Republic, the problem of maintaining a second official language, either English or Afrikaans, taught as a school subject, and we have to try&#x2014;and we do try&#x2014;to maintain that second language in our schools as a living subject and not a dead one. But that is not easy. Hon. members know that only too well. We have to see to it, if we can, that both languages remain a dynamic means of communication within a group itself and between certain groups of people whose background, behaviour patterns and traditions are in many ways entirely different, and that goes for the Whites in this country as well as for the non-Whites.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most fascinating thing about any language is the idiomatic expressions, which reflect a great deal more of the character of a people than anything else. It is sad to find the use of these idiomatic expressions so often abused for various reasons by both English and Afrikaans-speaking people in South Africa. I must say that to me the greatest fascination of the Afrikaans language lies in its extensive use of idiomatic expressions which have been evolved throughout the history of the Afrikaans people and which give it both the colour and the life it has. That is its greatest fascination to me as an English-speaking person. Now the irony of the present situation in South Africa is this, that whereas more people are bilingual, superficially, in South Africa to-day than at any other time in our history, the teaching standards of the two official languages have continued to decline over the years. There seems to me to be two reasons for this.</p>

<p>First of all, let me deal with the English language. The majority of children in this country are to-day Afrikaans-speaking, and they receive their education through the medium of Afrikaans. There are not enough teachers of English, who have English as their home language, to go round. The result is that countless numbers of children, both English and Afrikaans-speaking, in our schools to-day receive instruction in English from teachers whose home language is Afrikaans. Now that is just a question of numbers and, unfortunately, because of it, the standard of the English language is declining. If you read the reports of the school inspectors in the Cape Province&#x2014;and I served on the Provincial Council for many years and am familiar with them&#x2014;you will see that those reports reflect that position year after year. Hon. members will <span class="col_2769-2770" refersTo="page_1400"/>agree with me that any language is best taught as a subject by those whose home language it is. Let me here pay tribute in passing to the many hundreds of Afrikaans-speaking teachers in South Africa to-day who devote their lives to teaching English to English-speaking children because there are not enough English-speaking teachers to go round. We appreciate that, but with the best will in the world it is almost impossible to expect someone who is reared and trained in the atmosphere of one language to communicate the thought-patterns and the atmosphere as well as the traditions and the formal grammatical structure of another language to a class of pupils and to give that foreign language, as it were, the same life and to maintain quite the same standards. We have a very real difficulty and we are quite aware of it, and I think it is a very good thing that from time to time we should discuss this matter quite objectively in this House. Having said that, let me make it quite clear that the English-speaking element in our South African population represents about 35 per cent of the total. Now we are often accused of failing to encourage our young people to go into the teaching profession and so contribute a higher quota of teachers to the country&#x2019;s schools. I would like to emphasize in defence of the English-speaking South Africans, that even if our quota of teachers were very much higher that it is at present, 35 per cent of the total population can hardly be expected to provide qualified teachers of English both for themselves and for the remaining 65 per cent, whose home language is Afrikaans. So the question of standards remains with us and it is not an easy one to solve.</p>

<p>Now, where the Afrikaans language is concerned&#x2014;and here I speak as an English-speaking person&#x2014;let me say at once that the old Anglo-Saxon, from whom most of us stem, seldom, if ever, made a good linguist. With English as a world language, as my hon. friend said, the language is unlikely to die out, and I think we tend to become a little lazy and apathetic in mastering another language. What our children need to-day is encouragement, and that can only be given to children in regard to the teaching of the second language if it is made a living thing. How do we make it a living thing? I would say that one of the things most sorely needed in South Africa is the opportunity for our children to obtain at least part of their schooling in close contact with their Afrikaans-speaking fellow-citizens, and the reverse. I think, also, there is a grave need, in the field of higher education, for opportunities for an unceasing debate on all manner of things and issues between our young people across the language barrier. I would say that that has become even more necessary now that many of the old fears and prejudices, which used to surround this subject, are slowly dying a natural death, and if they are not dying a natural death they certainly ought to be. I have no intention of reverting to the old tired arguments of the past because that is just a waste of time, but there is no doubt whatsoever that, at whatever level we choose to arrange it, the young Afrikaner and the young English-speaking South African would rapidly improve their knowledge of the other official language if there was a little less official segregation in this field.</p>

<p>Now, to revert to the standards of English in South Africa, I am naturally concerned with it and I say that we ourselves do not take sufficient care about these things. We are not sufficiently alert to correct mistakes, both written and spoken, wherever we find them. In fact, there is a sense in which it can almost be said, with regret, that the majority of English-speaking South Africans have been content to see the precious heritage of their language almost abandoned in some respects. With the exception of a few devoted organizations and a handful of university pundits, I think that is the case to-day.</p>

<p>I want to give hon. members very briefly a few examples of the extent to which the English language is abused right here in this Parliament, and I wonder how many people, when they read this report, will even bother to protest about it. I want to refer to the report of the Department of Labour for the year ended December 1963, which was published in December 1964 and was Tabled in the House this Session. In this report the English language is absolutely murdered&#x2014;nothing less. There are countless examples of words like &#x201C;workseekers&#x201D;, &#x201C;work-seeking&#x201D;, &#x201C;school-leavers&#x201D;, &#x201C;road-making&#x201D;, &#x201C;wood-working&#x201D;, all put together as one word. Fancy school-leavers being written as one word throughout the report! Where there should be hyphens there are none. There are countless examples of bad grammar and sentence after sentence which contain too much in parenthesis, and there are endless and horrible examples of what we call officialese, like &#x201C;a report awaiting finalization&#x201D;, instead of &#x201C;a report to be finalized&#x201D;. But I want to give the hon. members some really fantastic examples. This Government report is absolutely riddled with mistakes and I want to give only a few in the time at my disposal. On page 1 there is the statement: &#x201C;The average number of handicapped persons who was employed.&#x201D; I do not have to tell hon. members how wrong that is. On page 6 we read: &#x201C;Avenues of employment: The placement of juveniles presented no particular problem except those with low educational qualifications and especially girls who insisted upon placement in clerical directions.&#x201D; It does not mean a thing, Sir. It should of course be the &#x201C;placing of juveniles&#x201D; and the &#x201C;placing of young girls in clerical posts&#x201D;. How do you place a person in direction? Then just on the other side of the page we find&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;In order to assess their adjustment in the open labour market follow-up work was undertaken.&#x201D;</block>

<p><span class="col_2771-2772" refersTo="page_1401"/>what is follow-up work? They were kept under observation. Then there is another one: &#x201C;In order to ensure their placement in clothing factories, the Transvaal Education Department instituted a special training course to promote their suitability for such placement.&#x201D; It should read: &#x201C;In order to ensure their employment in clothing factories, the Transvaal Education Department instituted a special training course to promote their suitability for such posts.&#x201D; Sir, when I read this report, I was supposed to be watching my husband playing cricket, but I never watched him the whole afternoon because I discovered so many mistakes in this report. But listen to this one, Sir&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Vocationally maladjusted persons: During 1963, 469 males and 86 females were psychologically and otherwise examined.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is a most unsatisfactory sentence. It should read &#x201C;for vocational purposes&#x201D;, of course. Then the report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The persons receive intensive vocational guidance, personal counselling &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>Can hon. members tell me what &#x201C;personal counselling&#x201D; means? It should read &#x201C;personal advice&#x201D;. In terms of the English language &#x201C;personal counselling&#x201D; is absolute rubbish. Then further down this page we find this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;My Career&#x201D; &#x2026;</block>

<p>that is the name of the magazine issued by the Department&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which is still the most important source of vocational information is supplied free of charge to schools with school-leaving standards.</block>

<p>Why not &#x201C;secondary&#x201D; schools? That is all you need. Then further down the same paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Seventy-two occupational descriptions, general and photo-articles appeared in the four issues of the magazine during the year.</block>

<p>What are &#x201C;photo-articles&#x201D;? Surely it should read, &#x201C;illustrated articles&#x201D;. Sir, one could go on forever pointing out mistakes in this report but there are only two more examples I want to give hon. members. Sir, this one is almost unbelievable. The heading is, &#x201C;The Industrial Tribunal&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One new direction was issued to the Industrial Tribunal in terms of Section 77 of the Act during the year, while five such directions were carried forward from the previous year.</block>

<p>What is a &#x201C;direction&#x201D;? Has anybody ever heard of it? &#x201C;One new directive was issued&#x201D; yes, but what is a &#x201C;direction&#x201D;? Sir, this is an official publication. Then in the same paragraph we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the close of the year five of these investigations were in an advanced stage of completion &#x2026;</block>

<p>Why not &#x201C;nearing completion&#x201D;? That would be the better way to put it. Then there is this lovely sentence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All the wage board recommendations submitted during the year also contained consolidated wages.</block>

<p>What does it mean, Sir? It is absolutely meaningless. Then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And the number of men was increased to 14 in accordance with the Amendment Act.</block>

<p>&#x201C;The Amendment Act&#x201D; instead of the amended Act, is referred to throughout the report. Sir, before I sit down there are two more gems&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Trade testing of prisoners: In order to enable long-term prisoners to mend their ways and become useful citizens upon their discharge from confinement &#x2026; !</block>

<p>Sir, I am perfectly aware that this report has to do with labour, but clearly the word should be &#x201C;upon their discharge from prison&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Finally, on the last page&#x2014;and this is a word which whoever translated this report simply invented&#x2014;we find this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The total loss of man-days (working days) as a result of compensable accidents during the year &#x2026;</block>

<p>There was no need to use both terms, either &#x201C;man-days&#x201D; or &#x201C;working-days&#x201D; would have done. Moreover, Sir, what is a &#x201C;compensable&#x201D; accident? A &#x201C;compensatable&#x201D; accident, yes, but there is no such word in the whole of the English language as a &#x201C;compensable&#x201D; accident. Sir, this is a shocking document. It is an example, I regret to say, of the standard of English teaching in our schools. These are the people who come up through the service and become translators later on in the Republic. I would say that after that little lot from the Department of Labour&#x2014;I am sorry the hon. the Minister is not here&#x2014;there can surely be no-one on that side of the House or on this side who is not prepared to support this motion moved by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort this morning. We should have this business of the standard of our languages investigated. The sooner we get on with the job the better.</p>

<from>*The<person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p><span class="col_2773-2774" refersTo="page_1402"/>I rise with a good deal of fear and trepidation to take part in this debate, for the simple reason that I have listened here to a number of experts, with the word &#x201C;expert&#x201D; not in inverted commas but underlined. I wish to extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to the hon. members, particularly the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker), who introduced this motion. I think it is high time some attention was paid to this particular matter. I said that I was rising with a certain amount of fear and trepidation, and I said so because I realize only too well that every word and every phrase that I use here will be examined under a magnifying-glass. When this motion was submitted to me, however, I felt that since I myself was not an expert, I should consult a few authoritative philologists in our country, and it seems to me that these people are not in agreement either. They disagree on the question as to whether the Afrikaans language is in fact degenerating. The first question, with a big question-mark behind it, that was put to the philologists was whether the Afrikaans language was in fact degenerating. The second question in regard to which they expressed some doubt was this: Is it degeneration, or is it merely the dynamic development of language that leads to differences between the language of the older generation and that of the younger generation, differences which perturb the older generation? The older generation always fears that what it has or what it has inherited will be neglected by the younger generation. The third question or the third consideration of these philologists to whom I put this question&#x2014;and I put it to quite a number&#x2014;is this: In what fields is degeneration taking place? Hon. members who spoke here gave us some fine examples. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort and the hon. members for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) and Hilbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) gave us certain examples but there are many more that we could add. I just want to express my disappointment at the fact that one has so little time at one&#x2019;s disposal to discuss an important matter such as this, but the question that was posed here was the following: Is it in the spoken language of educated people, is it in the language of the Press, is it in the language of broadcasting, is it in the language of pupils and students that this degeneration is to be found, or do we find it in all these fields? The above questions and considerations have given me the feeling that they are all questions which should be examined in due course. In the first place they should be examined by the philologists themselves because apparently they hold confidential views. If one wants to iron out &#x201C;uitstryk&#x201D; these things&#x2014;the hon. member for Fort Beaufort says that I should not use the word &#x201C;uitstryk&#x201D; but I disagree with him; I should like to iron them out&#x2014;one should have them investigated by persons who really are experts. I have a feeling, however, that to a reasonable extent we can do it very successfully through the agency of our existing National Advisory Education Council. As I see the position, the National Advisory Education Council, for example, can make recommendations in regard to the following, if we as a Parliament request them to do so. The first is to carry out an investigation into syllabuses that could improve the position, for even if we do not accept the proposition that there is in fact a degeneration in language usage, effective syllabuses can always lead to improvements in the use of language. This point is a very important one to me, because I feel that we have weakened our syllabuses to a large extent. I was very glad to hear from the hon. member for Hillbrow that he was opposed to the examination system. I feel that the National Advisory Education Council can do useful work in this regard, by devising an effective examination system that will have regard both to the practical use of language and the theoretical knowledge of language. And, thirdly, this Advisory Council can investigate the training of language teachers; fourthly, improved methods of language teaching, and, fifthly, greater co-ordination between the language work done by teachers teaching Afrikaans and students who merely use the language as a medium of instruction. I feel that this is a major task that we can assign to the National Advisory Education Council, and I hope that in this regard I will have the support of the whole House. But in regard to this question of the teaching of languages and the problems we have mentioned here to-day, the so-called manpower shortage, of course, also plays a very important part. At present there is a shortage of properly trained language teachers with the result that very often the services of less suitable teachers have to be used. In this technological age of ours we usually complain only about the shortage of expert science teachers. This brings me to my main objection, an objection that was also mentioned by the hon. member for Wynberg: It is an excellent thing to do the one thing, but it is a very bad thing to fail to do the other. In this technological age of ours we find ourselves on a one-way track where we sadly neglect our spiritual possessions and our mental and moral sciences, to the serious detriment of the nation. The second problem we are faced with is that the present trend is increasing more and more and that the best and ablest students are turning to the natural sciences, with the result that a very meagre potential remains for language work.</p>

<p>What I have said here applies to Afrikaans, but it applies equally to English. In this regard I, as one whose mother-tongue is Afrikaans, put myself in the accused&#x2019;s dock together with my fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about literature. In this regard we, the older generation, see clear signs of degeneration and, in terms of the civilized standards that are accepted by the conservative section of our community, we also see evidence of serious deterioration. This, however, applies not only <span class="col_2775-2776" refersTo="page_1403"/>to Afrikaans and English in the Republic of South Africa. It is a modern world phenomenon. It is the same everywhere; one finds tremendous deterioration everywhere. Some people regard this phenomenon as an expression of the confusion of the present generation, and it is for this reason that this motion is welcomed, because it is of absolutely vital importance to us in South Africa that our literature should help to equip us spiritually and morally instead of undermining our moral fibre. Here I disagree with the hon. member for Hillbrow. For the reasons I have mentioned I feel that the mover of the motion is right in not asking for a Government commission of enquiry because we will achieve nothing along those lines. It is not a mathematical problem that has to be investigated, nor is it an imaginary problem; it is a real problem that cannot be measured in terms of ordinary mathematical equations. I agree with the hon. member for Fort Beaufort that a serious appeal should be made to bodies and persons, as has in fact been done here to-day first to put their own houses in order. The hon. member for Wynberg referred to an official publication in which there is a large number of language errors. Just look what happened to that report! I feel that this serious appeal to carry out this investigation should be made to the bodies and persons directly concerned in the matter. An investigation should be instituted, but it must be instituted by the people who are directly concerned in this matter. If we feel that to some extent we are also concerned, then we must also be prepared to make our contribution and to put our language under a magnifying-glass with a view to eliminating impurities. It is obvious that the bodies concerned in this matter&#x2014;I cannot mention all of them&#x2014;are, <i>inter alia,</i>the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie, the English Academy, the universities, the Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations and the Federal Council of School Inspectors. One can mention a long list and make a serious appeal to these bodies and persons, always starting with the individual, of course, to see to it that they themselves also do justice to our language. It is disturbing to hear from the hon. member for Fort Beaufort what book is being used to teach Afrikaans to English-speaking children; the errors which occur in this book are alarming. It does seem to me, however, that the hon. member is rather a strict purist; I do not want to say that I agree with everything he said here because I am also one of those people who believe in enriching a language. A young and growing language such as Afrikaans enriches itself; it is in a privileged position to enrich itself by drawing upon other established languages which are much older. I am also afraid of &#x201C;-isms&#x201D;, but I am not afraid of using fine phrases and fine new words in a new, growing language such as Afrikaans, particularly when they have become recognized through usage.</p>

<p>We are not talking about a mixture and a jargon. We know, of course, that some of the bodies and persons I have mentioned here are already devoting serious attention to this matter. They are devoting serious attention to it in an unselfish way, because they are not compensated for their pains as they would be if they were members of a commission; they are working very hard. I welcome what is already being done by them, and I also wish to express a sincere word of thanks to these bodies and persons. I do believe that the motion moved here may produce good results. Even though we may be unable to see it through to the end, and although we could still discuss this matter here for days on end, I do not think there is any disagreement amongst us. I wish to associate myself wholeheartedly with what has been said in regard to this matter by the three hon. members who have spoken so far. We in South Africa can co-exist in harmony as two language groups only if we show mutual respect for both languages. I agree that we should make use of our mother-tongue, even here in the House, if we feel that it better enables us to put across our real thoughts to all concerned, rather than to pose as persons who are so bilingual that we can make speeches in Afrikaans and English alternately. Fortunately this approach is now being adopted by both sections, and I welcome it, because in a bilingual country we should at least reach the stage where the one can understand the other properly, no matter what subject is under discussion. I welcome this progress, but then we must see to it on both sides that we are always on our guard against language impurities. When we are compelled to use the other language&#x2014;even we, as members of the Cabinet, have to do so quite frequently; we very often have to use both languages&#x2014;then we must see to it that we use that particular language, whether it be English or Afrikaans, properly and correctly, otherwise we should rather refrain from using the other language. We must not use the other language in an undignified way or in a mutilated form.</p>

<p>I just want to point out that we, the Afrikaans-speaking section, are in a much better position to keep our language pure. Both the English literature and the English language in South Africa, or course, are influenced by Afrikaans to a large extent but by no means to the same extent that Afrikaans is influenced by English. English is such an international language that it is influenced by other parts of the world as well. The English language in this country is not only influenced, but also nourished, by English in other parts of the world. Afrikaans is an indigenous language; <span class="col_2777-2778" refersTo="page_1404"/>Afrikaans is limited to South Africa. The task which which we as the Afrikaans-speaking section are faced is perhaps a much more difficult and a much greater one than that facing the English-speaking section, and I hope that this motion will help to send out a message from Parliament to-day to the whole of South Africa that we are concerned about our own language, that we are concerned about what is happening in our schools and in our universities and elsewhere. We must tell our public servants that we are concerned about what is happening in the Public Service, and we must all make up our minds to make a point not only of honouring both our official languages but of using them in their purest form.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>It is a very great pleasure and privilege to take part in this debate. I should like to join with the hon. the Minister and my colleague in congratulating the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) and thanking him for the manner in which he has introduced this motion to-day. He has set a very high tone, and I think the tone he has set has been maintained. He has done a great deal for us in the discussion on language. We have been so accustomed in the past to the eternal wrangle about equal language rights and equal language privileges when we have really meant equal rights for the people who speak those languages. I think the time has arrived when we can say that we have left those days behind. The hon. the Minister puts his finger on the spot when he says that this debate applies particularly to Afrikaans. Our Afrikaans language and our English language can never be rivals. There is no rivalry between them; they are complementary. The Afrikaans language is a language which has its roots deep, far down in the history and tradition of South Africa; the English language is a world language. We who are English speaking in South Africa are less than 1 per cent of the English speaking world, not people who speak English, but people who speak English as their first language. Among people who speak English as their second language, we South Africans form a much lower percentage. Hon. members know that in Central Europe the prevailing language is German. In the years following the war, this is the position in Russian schools when they teach their second language, not their third; 35 per cent learn German as their second language; 20 per cent learn French; but 45 per cent learn English as their second language. English is rapidly becoming the world language, and we here in South Africa who are English speaking, are members of a world family. If there is any deterioration or degeneration in South Africa in our English, it does not matter a great deal because there is always a corrective coming from the great English speaking family throughout the world. Here I support the hon. the Minister. That is why when we were asked to vote R100,000 as a contribution towards the production of the Groot Afrikaanse Woordeboek we did it willingly two years ago; that is why last year we voted R56,000 willingly and will vote as much money as they require. We do not require grants for English because we can draw on the great supply of English throughout the world. But I would say this to my Afrikaans-speaking friends. We have in South Africa what we call a free democracy. It is not really a free democracy, it is a free oligarchy. We control the whole of the country. We, the White people, are the oligarchy. But in this free democracy, as we call it, Afrikaans-speaking people predominate; we who are English-speaking are in the minority. What we need is freedom and tolerance when we talk about the languages. The right to rule is the right of the majority in a democratic state, but more important than the right to rule is forbearance; to consider the other section when you have the power to do so.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I should like to come to the motion of my hon. friend, the member for Fort Beaufort. The hon. member speaks of the degeneration and the deterioration of the English language. My difficulty is this: How can I obtain an objective test; how can I obtain an objective measure to say whether there has been deterioration or degeneration over the years? When we speak about language we are concerned with language as a means of communication. Publishers overseas, publishers in London and New York, say that South Africans are voracious readers. The language we read, the language we write, the language we use in speech, in debate in this Chamber, in our discussions, or, as the Elizabethans called it, the language of conference, has been described by one of the greatest Elizabethans, Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, in his crisp, terse, sparkling English: &#x201C;Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.&#x201D; We who speak English have to consider those three aspects. I intend to speak specially about English. I have had some experience of teaching English and reading a little English. I think it is necessary to consider the three.</p>

<p>Has there been a deterioration over the last 25 or 50 years? The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department says &#x201C;yes&#x201D; in one respect, in translation. It was referred to by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor). She spoke of the report of the Department of Labour. The Minister&#x2019;s Department writes very good English, or translates into fairly good English. But you see, Sir, the Department of Labour has an English-speaking Minister. No wonder its English is deteriorating. The obvious lesson to be learnt from that is to find an Afrikaans-speaking Minister of Labour. He would be more careful about the use of the language. I do not know why the Minister of Labour does not sit down himself and write or revise the report. The Department of the Minister of Education is much concerned about the position and I <span class="col_2779-2780" refersTo="page_1405"/>pay tribute to the Minister for that. I refer to page 20 of the report which says this about English&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">English is becoming a translation language.</block>

<p>And they give statistics to show how it is becoming a translation language. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If this development should continue in the same direction English in South Africa may, so far as official publications are concerned become a translation language as Afrikaans was in the past &#x2026; Serious efforts are being made to obtain translators.</block>

<p>At last they recognize that there are two classes of translators. There is the man who knows English but likes to translate into his own Afrikaans. Then there is the man who knows Afrikaans, has a feeling for language, but likes to translate into his own English. It is the second class that the Department is finding difficulty in obtaining. I want to say to the Minister that there is one report that must maintain a standard, that must be the best, and that is the Department of Education&#x2019;s report. They should set the standard for all the other departments.</p>

<p>When I ask &#x201C;Has English deteriorated?&#x201D; I look at the position in the country as I see it to-day. Our journalism, our newspapers and so forth, maintain a very high standard in English. Papers like the <i>Cape Times</i> and the Johannesburg <i>Star</i> are papers which one can compare very favourably with the great national dailies in England, the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> the <i>Yorkshire Post,</i> the <i>Scotsman,</i> the <i>Guardian</i> and so on. They maintain a very high standard; I have no doubt about that. Then in addition English culture in this country is flourishing. A few days ago when looking through the paper to see where I could find entertainment I found that three live theatres were offering plays. We have had a Shakespearian season and there are two other theatres. They are always full. At the same time a private company had another English-language company visiting Wellington, Paarl, Somerset West and Bellville&#x2014;one night at each. In other words, there is a great demand for English theatre. There are men in this country who have devoted themselves to it, men of the quality of Leonard Schach, Brian Brooke, David Bloomberg and several others. They are mentioned in the report of the Department of Education. I congratulate the Department on having gone into the matter in this way. They have done well.</p>

<p>All that is being done. While the standard of English has been maintained, while people are reading and are enthusiastic about English culture, they are also becoming bilingual. Nothing has helped more to make them bilingual, the cultured English-speaking people, than this new movement of the &#x201C;Sestigers&#x201D;&#x2014;Etienne le Roux, Jan Rabie and the other men we know so well&#x2014;Uys Krige and so on. There are half a dozen of them and they are writing very fine prose and verse in Afrikaans. That helps. English-speaking people are becoming bilingual.</p>

<p>But I should like to say a word about what the Government is doing&#x2014;the Nationalist Party Government, the State Government&#x2014;and in the Transvaal that I know so well. My hon. friend from Wynberg has referred to English-speaking teachers. There need not be a scarcity of English-speaking teachers in the primary schools. We have the teachers but we won&#x2019;t let them teach. We say:&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t teach when you are married.&#x201D; We say to a woman: &#x201C;We will train you for three or four years at State expense; you will become a teacher, but, mark you, if you marry you will have to leave the service. We might take you back in an inferior position but on marriage you must leave the service.&#x201D; The sooner we say that a married woman can continue her profession as a teacher, as she can as a doctor or a dentist or a lawyer or any other profession, the better. I am not alone in this. Let me quote the authority on this subject. I quote from the <i>Staatsamptenaar,</i> the publication of our Public Service. In discussing this subject three years ago they had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The acute shortage of manpower in the Public Service should constitute one of the most cogent and compelling reasons why the services of women should not be dispensed with automatically on their marriage.</block>

<p>There you have it. Therefore we cannot get English-speaking teachers in the Transvaal. I speak of the province I know. We get young teachers drafted to the schools who speak Afrikaans as their home language, who have gone to an Afrikaans primary school, an Afrikaans-medium secondary school and an Afrikaans-medium training college. Thereafter they are put before an English-medium class. What do you expect? I am sorry for these young people. We need something better. I take another class of teacher. For some years, for many years, I was chairman of the training college in Johannesburg, the only English-language training college in the Transvaal. It is now called the College of Education. At the same time I was a member of the governing body of a large boys&#x2019; high school. We saw years in advance that there was going to be difficulty in getting English-speaking teachers so we sent for them overseas. We had men who were prepared to advance money to advertise posts in London and in the provinces overseas to get teachers. We got some. And what did the Transvaal Administration do? They placed every difficulty they could in our way. They said the teachers were not bilingual, they were not South African citizens! Why should a teacher of English or Latin be bilingual? Why should a teacher of Afrikaans and Geskiedenis know English, excepting to read for research? Our scheme broke down <span class="col_2781-2782" refersTo="page_1406"/>therefore. We could not get the teachers. What is happening to-day? We have a scheme in the Transvaal for promotion to the university without matriculation and it is in danger of breaking down, not because we have insufficient mathematics and science teachers, but because we have not sufficient teachers of English in the high schools! The hon. the Minister will know that. It is a desperate situation, so desperate that the Administration of the Transvaal is sending a delegation overseas to get the teachers we tried to get 15 years ago. It is a shocking situation. Take the position of English literature. We are always banning books in South Africa. The Government never helps there. And worse than that, the hon. the Minister of Finance came to this House and in a Budget taxed English literature when it comes in a paper back. We said to him: &#x201C;But you are taxing culture; you are taxing our language.&#x201D; But this had no effect. The Government is not helping; it is not doing anything to assist us.</p>

<p>Nothing would help more than television and yet I have heard the view expressed in this House that we cannot have television because we cannot give the Afrikaans-speaking people the same facilities as the English-speaking people. What does it matter? It is going to assist us. Why can&#x2019;t we have it?</p>

<p>I come to something else which is very serious. I paid a tribute to the live theatre. We have the cinema as well and the cinema has great influence in this country. When one looks at the list one finds that some very good films are being shown. There is &#x201C;My Fair Lady&#x201D;. I hope every member has been to see &#x201C;My Fair Lady&#x201D;. We have all these influences but the greatest is the live theatre. To-day we are being boycotted. We are the only country in the world which is being boycotted and it is the only boycott against us which has been successful. Playwrights will not give their plays to be produced in South Africa because we can&#x2019;t have a mixed audience now and again. How foolish can we be? How far can we go? We are clamouring for culture; the people want culture, but man, proud man, dressed in a little brief authority, most ignorant of what he&#x2019;s most assured, plays such fantastic tricks before high Heaven as make the angels weep! The White angels, Mr. Speaker, not the Coloured ones. They have given up weeping; they have dried their eyes: they have gone back to their celestial heaven; they have gone back to their own celestial group area. Why can&#x2019;t we have these plays in South Africa? Fifty playwrights have refused to give us their plays. One of our finest producers, Brian Brooke, has been overseas to obtain ten plays for his year&#x2019;s season. He could get only two. What is he doing? Offering his theatre for sale. We have frozen him out. Sir. The Government has frozen him out. It is about time we did something to remedy this.</p>

<p>I should like to say a word about the schools. What is happening in the schools? The hon. the Minister has spoken about that. In the English-medium schools Afrikaans is being well taught because we have always insisted on getting good Afrikaans-speaking teachers to teach Afrikaans in our English-medium schools. English in the English-medium high school is not so well taught. I want to say a word about English in the Afrikaans-medium high school. This is a report on research we have carried out with the co-operation of teachers in Afrikaans-medium schools. They are anxious to co-operate. These are the teachers of English in Afrikaans-medium high schools: 77 per cent of the teachers of English have Afrikaans as their home language. The remainder are mostly bilingual or foreign; 26 per cent, i.e. about a quarter, or just one in four, say they rarely use English in their daily lives. It is not part of their ordinary life.

<heading>NON-CONTRIBUTORY STATE PENSION SCHEMES FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS</heading>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The motion standing in my name and which I now move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in the opinion of this House, State pension schemes for public servants and other Government employees should be noncontributory.</block>

<p>comes briefly to this, that I should like to see State servants, Public Servants, Government employees, have a non-contributory pension scheme instead of the present contributory one. In introducing this motion I should like to explain that last year I introduced a similar motion but the motion was not clearly stated, with the result that some of the officials in the Department of Pensions seemed to think that the motion contained an implied criticism of the administration of the Pensions Department. Nothing was further from my mind. But there was some ambiguity I admit, and, therefore, because of that ambiguity I withdrew the motion. That is the first explanation I should like to make. I should also like to thank the Minister <span class="col_2783-2784" refersTo="page_1407"/>for the assistance I have had from his Department in checking the facts about this pension scheme.</p>

<p>The second point I should like to make clear is that my motion must not be confused with the United Party policy which we have adumbrated on many occasions, that we should have a national contributory scheme for everybody. That is our policy. I subscribe to that policy wholeheartedly. This motion of mine has nothing whatever to do with that. This motion refers to the State as an employer. It is the attitude of the State towards its own employees.</p>

<p>That is the United Party policy. I do not wish to discuss the national pension scheme at all. I am now referring to the State as an employer and to its servants as employees. We in South Africa have a Pensions Act No. 58 of 1955. This Act contains our pension schemes for the three sections of Government employees. The first is our Public Servants; the second is our South African Permanent Force; and the third is the Police and Prisons Department. Those are the three sections.</p>

<p>What about the Railways?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The Railways is a separate undertaking. I am confining myself to-day to the Government employees to whom I have referred. I am not discussing the Railways at this stage. I shall be willing to do that later, if necessary, but it is not necessary at this juncture.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>But they are State employees.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I regard the Railways as a separate undertaking. As the hon. the Minister of Railways has frequently pointed out, he controls the policy of the Railways. They have their own Railway Board and so on. I am now speaking of the servants who are controlled under the Act of 1955. I am not discussing the Railways. And the narrower we make the field to establish the principle the better.</p>

<p>There are three sections and the scheme for the three sections is generally contributory. They contribute towards their pensions with the exception in Section 69 where Coloured employees are dealt with. Coloured employees receive an annuity or, a pension. It is very difficult to make a distinction between the two. But they receive an annuity or a pension without any contributions. Theirs is a noncontributory scheme. On an occasion in this House the hon. the Minister of Railways gave me the information that he had a similar provision in the Railways where, after a number of years of service non-White employees could receive an annuity in the same way; a non-contributory annuity.</p>

<p>The first thing I should like to do is to explain the difference between a contributory pension scheme and a non-contributory scheme. A contributory pension scheme is a scheme where the employee receives his cheque at the end of the month after a deduction has been made from his pay as a contribution towards a pension fund. Say it is five per cent and he has a salary of R1,200 per annum, i.e. R100 per month. Therefore he receives a cheque for R95 after R5 has been deducted. He makes that contribution towards his pension. It is customary, as it is in our case, for the Government to add five per cent. So the position is that ten per cent of his pay goes into the pension fund and that pension fund is his security for the day of retirement. That is the contributory pension fund.</p>

<p>A non-contributory pension fund is one in which the employer says to the employee: &#x201C;You can work for me for a number of years and at the end of the period I will pay you a pension; I will be responsible for your pension; I do not want any contribution from you.&#x201D; That is a non-contributory pension. And there is a distinction between the two. In South Africa we have several cases of noncontributory and of contributory pension schemes&#x2014;more contributory than non-contributory. It is an old custom that has grown up in South Africa. For example, our Government service, the three sections to which I have referred, have a contributory scheme. We have an interesting position in the case of banks. I know of three of the big commercial banks where they have a non-contributory scheme. I know of one bank, also one of our big banks, where they have a contributory scheme. So there seems to be a process of changing over. In the case of small businesses one usually has a contributory scheme but in a big business it is quite easy to have a noncontributory scheme because there is security in the business itself. And where is there greater security than in the State? The State has security. I know of a business where they have a non-contributory scheme and in addition they have free medical services so that their employees have no concern about the future.</p>

<p>Our system in the Government service is a contributory pension scheme and I am only concerned with the three sections to which I have referred. Having said that, I wish to refer to notable cases in South Africa where we have non-contributory schemes. The pensions of judges are paid on a non-contributory basis; our staff in Parliament have a non-contributory pension scheme; and there are certain non-White employees who have a non-contributory pension scheme. But I should like to take the cases of other countries from which we can learn something. I want to take the <span class="col_2785-2786" refersTo="page_1408"/>case of Great Britain first of all; the case of the British Civil Servant. I have the usual pamphlet here of the British Civil Service. Their pension schemes are non-contributory throughout and they have been so for many many years. I want to read to hon. members of how their scheme works&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On retirement, after not less than ten years reckonable service, the Civil Servant is eligible to receive an annual pension of 1/80th of his average salary over the last three years of service for each complete year of service subject to a maximum of 45/80ths together with a lump sum of three times that amount. No contribution is made by the officer towards his pension.</block>

<p>But I wish to explain that they have, in addition, made provision for dependants and widows if the officer wishes to contribute. That is the system they have in the British Service. Let us see how it works. A man goes into the Civil Service in England and retires after 30 years&#x2019; service, for example. Let us say he has a salary, after 30 years&#x2019; service, of R4,000 per annum. What will his pension be? Take the average of his last three years. That is R4,000. He has 30 years&#x2019; service, so we take 30/80ths. In other words, three-eights of R4,000 which is R1,500. He receives a pension of R1,500 per annum on retirement. In addition he receives a gift of three times that amount namely R4,500.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I will not go into detail. I have not got all the details. I am giving the House the outline of normal retirement in the British Civil Service. That is their Civil Service, our Public Service in South Africa. I made enquiries regarding the Services as they call them in England i.e. the Army, Navy and Air Force. There they are all non-contributory. They would never dream of saying to a sailor at sea in a ship: &#x201C;This is your salary; so much has been taken off for your pension.&#x201D; They don&#x2019;t say that. They say: &#x201C;You will serve the navy for 20 or 25 years and we will pay you a pension.&#x201D; That is the case in both the Army and the Air Force. They do not say to a soldier fighting in Malaya: &#x201C;We have taken something off for your pension.&#x201D; He does not understand about a pension fund; the Government sees to that.</p>

<p>I now come to the United States. The position in the United States is very interesting. There you have a combination of the two. In the case of the Civil Service in the U.S.A. pension is on a contributory basis. But the Forces, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are on a non-contributory basis. They are treated in the same way as the soldiers, sailors and airmen in Britain are treated. Those are the two systems.</p>

<p>I should like to say what happens to our pension funds. Our men are given the security of a pension fund for their pensions. At regular intervals there are actuarial valuations to see that the fund is financially sound. From the time of Union in 1910 up to the last valuation of the pension funds R36 million had been paid into these funds by the Government because there was not sufficient money to pay the pensions. And the position in South Africa at the last valuation was this, that the Public Service Pension Fund had a deficiency of R8,000,000 and the South African Permanent Force&#x2019;s Pension Fund had a deficiency of R3,620,000. In other words there was not sufficient money there. But there is a worse case than that. One hesitates to mention it to the other side seeing that there is a provincial election pending. But in the Transvaal there is a Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Pension Fund and the latest information I have is that they have a deficiency of approximately R8,000,000. They are insolvent. There is no money to pay the teachers&#x2019; pensions. I did not wait for a pension, Mr. Speaker, I got out. There is a deficiency of almost R8,000,000, namely R7.800,000. What can one do about it? The Government says they will put money in.</p>

<p>When you find a government that is so hopelessly incompetent, and this government in the Transvaal is completely incompetent to deal with the situation, then you are accused of making propaganda.</p>

<p>What do I advocate? I am not optimistic enough to think that the Government will put up a speaker and say &#x201C;We accept your proposal immediately.&#x201D; I don&#x2019;t expect that. They did not do that in connection with the decimal coinage. They thought about it three or four weeks and then they said: We will accept the principle and appoint a commission to see how such a new system could be introduced. I am hoping that the hon. the Minister will give an assurance that we are going to have a serious investigation of the position. Now some people say: &#x201C;What is this proposal you are giving us, what is the advantage of it?&#x201D; It is purely a question of accounting, of <span class="col_2787-2788" refersTo="page_1409"/>how we can run the pension funds in a more efficient way. Why do we need all these accountants to take five per cent off a man&#x2019;s salary and add five per cent, and so on? Every year when we get our Estimates we are told, as we were last year, that R18,000,000 has been paid by the Government in subscriptions to pension funds. Why should the Government not pay the whole pension? Why do we want to establish a fund to put money in, invest it in government funds, as we do through the public debt commissioners, and then take it out again? Because that is what we are doing. Therefore I would ask the hon. Minister to investigate my proposal. Such an investigation would naturally include public servants to be members of any committee or commission, members of the Minister&#x2019;s own department, his experts and so on, and actuarial advice. I think the matter is worth going into. I am not going to discuss the details of how you will carry out each step in the change-over. We could not do that with decimal coinage. We had to go into the details. But I now make this request, that the hon. the Minister should make this investigation which will be in the interest not only of our civil servants but in the interest of the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member tried to raise an issue which I do not think is relevant at all. I just want to react to a few points made by him. He has explained to us what a contributory pension scheme is. I think we all know that. And he also explained what a non-contributory pension scheme was. He then told us that certain businesses in South Africa had a noncontributory pension scheme, that they were big and sound businesses and that the people were sure of getting their money. Well, Mr. Speaker, I would rather not work for a firm which says I shall get a pension one day. The day I go on pension that firm may perhaps long since have gone insolvent in which case I shall get nothing of what I had depended on for my old age.</p>

<p>No, the hon. member knows very well what the position is in connection with the State. In any case if the position of the State weakens its officials are always covered by what they themselves own in the Pension fund. There is a formula whereby the public servant can withdraw his share at any time when he retires on pension or when he resigns before the time. He knows what his widow and heirs will get if he dies before the time. It is his own money he is getting back, money he has saved while he was working.</p>

<p>I wish the hon. member would keep his nose out of these matters. He does not understand the first thing about them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has told us about the scheme in Great Britain but when I put a cardinal question to him he refused to answer. That cardinal question is this: If a British Civil Servant leaves the service before he reaches the pensionable age, what does he get? The reply is that he gets nothing. The hon. member talked of two banks in South Africa which operated according to the British Civil Service system. Their officials also receive a pension the day they retire on pension but if they resign six months before the time they do not get a penny</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>*Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>That is not so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>They get nothing because that official has not built up anything for himself according to a formula as part of his contract with his employer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An<person refersTo="hansard_za">HON MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What about their agreement?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The agreement does not say what he will get if he resigns. Many people have already left and they have received nothing while others complain that they are tied down there. They can never leave because if they leave before they reach the retiring age they lose all their pension benefits.</p>

<p>I take strong exception to the fact that the hon. member for Kensington tried to score a point by alleging that there was a deficit of R8,000,000 in the Transvaal Education Pension Fund. While he was talking I asked him how much was still in the fund. He avoided that. If the hon. member knows what the deficit is he ought to know how strong the fund is. I do not know what the amount is but I may perhaps be able to give it to the hon. member when the House resumes after luncheon. I can, however, tell him that there is enough money in that fund to pay ten times this amount of R8,000,000. I am almost sure that the fund has a capital of more than R80,000,000. This amount of R8,000,000 is a small percentage, therefore, and in any case every pension fund in which the State is concerned, either on a provincial or republican basis, is guaranteed as far as the actuarial position is concerned. I do not know why the hon. member avoids this cardinal point in a debate of this nature. The cardinal point, in connection with a pension scheme is this: Is money put away for a person while he is working or is money not being put away for him? Can he change his employment at any time and take with him what has been put away on his behalf, yes or no? The hon. member cannot reply &#x201C;yes&#x201D; to either of these questions because that scheme of his has <span class="col_2789-2790" refersTo="page_1410"/>nothing in it for the officials. I want to say this to him: I do not think the officials will thank the United Party for what has been proposed here. Public servants, like all other people, want to have security for the future. What does the hon. member want to do? He wants to pin every public servant down in that if the public servant leaves the service by resigning before reaching the pensionable age he will not receive a penny. That is what the hon. member wants to do.</p>

<from>*Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>But this is his motion, not mine. The hon. member talks about a business in South Africa which operates on the same basis as the British Government and I am telling him that if an official resigns from that business before he is entitled to a pension he does not receive a penny. The hon. member gave that as an example to advocate his scheme. In such a case he only receives his salary to date. The hon. member was the person who made the comparison not I and he must not run away from it now.</p>

<p>I have not yet heard a public servant say that there should not be a pension fund for them. On the contrary the very reason why people join the Public Service is because they know their future is safe and that one day when they are old and can no longer work they will have sufficient income to live on until they die and that when they die those they leave behind will have sufficient income to live on until they die or are provided for in some other way. The officials know that. The basic principle in a modern society is this&#x2014;and this is something the hon. member should really try to assimilate&#x2014;that money must be put away for a person while he works to live on when he is old. In South Africa Government officials pay 8&#x00BD; per cent of their salaries into a pension fund and the Government on its part pays in a similar amount. The official can resign at any time and go and work elsewhere and his money is refunded plus interest. But under the scheme proposed by the hon. member he will receive nothing when he resigns. The pension of an official is calculated on his salary over the last seven years of service. The small amounts he paid in at the beginning of his service are not added to his larger contributions in later years in order to get the average. His last seven years are taken and that makes the pension fund all the more attractive.</p>

<p>The important thing however is that people want security and this idea has also infiltrated into the private sector to such an extent that when people seek work with a private firm they ask whether there is a pension fund and if the reply is &#x201C;no&#x201D; they say: &#x201C;I am sorry, I am going to look for work with a firm which does have a pension scheme because I want to make provision for my old age&#x201D;. To want to provide for your old age is a sound principle. It is a sound principle not only for yourself as an individual but a sound principle for the country as a whole. Because what is the position in actual fact? The position is this that more and more people grow old before they die and the people who work cannot be expected to work for their own living as well as for the living of those who can no longer work. That is the general principle. Because if you accept in principle that the working person must look after those who do not work as yet as well as those who no longer work at all, without creating some reserve for those people, the standard of living must of necessity decline. The hon. member cannot get away from that. As a person who moves in society he ought to know that what he is pleading for here is a general principle. I am not only talking about the Public Servant but in general. It is a general principle which must lead to a decline in the standard of living. The idea of a pension scheme which is actuarially sound has taken root in South Africa not only in the services but also in the private sector. Sir, you will remember how we have had regular debates on the subject of pensions and pension schemes over the last 17 years or more and the principle has been accepted over and over that actuarially sound pension funds must be created for the workers in South Africa.</p>

<p>When business was suspended I was discussing the pension funds which have become popular in the private sector. But before I deal further with that I just want to return to the hon. member for Kensington. I told him I would try to ascertain what the position was in regard to the Transvaal Education Pension Fund during the lunch hour. Unfortunately I could not get the exact figures as to how strong the fund is at the moment but there is an actuarial deficit in the fund of R8,000,000. That does not mean a thing, however. It is only due to the fact that teachers&#x2019; salaries who also participate in pension benefits have been increased. It is a fixed rule that with the first actuarial calculation after such an increase the position is rectified <span class="col_2791-2792" refersTo="page_1411"/>annually by the province, or in the case of the central government, by Parliament, voting the additional amount required to make the fund actuarially sound. The process that fund is undergoing is simply a natural process.</p>

<p>What is so astonishing about the hon. member&#x2019;s motion is that he wants to relieve the the Public Service of contributory pensions schemes but not the railwaymen. The hon. member said he was only referring to those people who fell under the 1955 Act. I would have imagined that your real yardstick would be everybody whose money is deposited with the Public Debt Commissioners and that includes the railwaymen. The globular fund of the officials of State is with the Public Debt Commissioners and not only of those who are covered by a particular Act. I cannot understand the motion of the hon. member. I can tell the hon. member that his motion clashes with the accepted policy of this House which is to create actuarially sound funds. I go further and I say it clashes with the policy of the United Party. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) introduced a motion a month ago in which he pleaded for contributory pension schemes for the entire nation.</p>

<p>I said so. I quite agree with that.</p>

<p>How can you agree with it on the one hand and abolish it on the other hand? There you see the lack of logic in the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. Sir, he wants to abolish the one which is in existence. Surely one does not argue in that childish illogical way. The trouble with the hon. member is that he has not yet thought about the practical implications of what he is suggesting because had he done so he would have realized how ridiculous it was. In the first place pensions funds play an extremely important role in the economy of the whole country. The principle that that you accumulate capital while you work, capital which is earmarked for the workers who are on pension, so that those who are active in the labour market do not have to work for those who are not, is a generally accepted sound principle. I say that to link up with what I want to say further. The most important factor in that regard is the capital formation factor. The hon. member ought to know that as the world becomes more developed and as taxation structures throughout the world are getting higher and higher individuals can no longer save much and that the entire Western World is practically dependent on group savings for the capital formation in that country and without capital formation there can be no progress. Mr. Speaker, the most important sources of income in the case of life insurance companies are pension funds. If the hon. member would study the literature of America and Western Europe and see what an important role these two factors play in their economic structure and economic development he will not come forward with a motion to abolish a capital formation instrument which already exists in the country. You know that our pension funds and life insurance companies in South Africa have a capital of considerably more than R1,000,000,000. It grows considerably every year. Pension funds relating to Government undertakings alone, the Railways and the Public Service, have already built up a capital of approximately R800,000,000 and it is increasing very rapidly. The private sector has also built up a capital of R800,000,000 or more. We are dealing with something involving a few thousand million rands and that amount is continually increasing. This is one of the soundest and most stable sources of capital formation you can get, sources which expand and strengthen your capital structure to such an extent that you can withstand economic set-backs. The Public Service Fund alone, excluding the education pensions and the like, amount to R416,000,000; two years ago the Railway fund amounted to R363,000,000 and it is probably R380,000,000 or R400,000,000 to-day. That means that over R800,000,000 is involved in the hon. member&#x2019;s motion apart from the education pension fund and the like.</p>

<p>Where this is practically the most important source of income of the Public Debt Commissioners, and where these funds play an important role every year when the Minister of Finance introduces his Budget and has to tell us what the capital structure is for the ensuing year and what burdens will be placed on Loan Account, what the position of the Loan Account is and what automatic income can be expected, you realize what a tremendously important role they play in the economy of the country. The hon. member ignores all that. I want to ask him this question: Surely the idea is that if his policy is accepted the funds in existence should be liquidated. I want to know from the hon. member how he wishes to liquidate those funds. From a practical point of view that is the most important question. How is he going to liquidate this amount of R416,000,000 plus the provincial funds because he included the Education fund although it does not fall under the 1955 Act. He himself went beyond the scope of this Act and then took me to task for wanting to go beyond it. But I want to know from him how he is going to liquidate these funds and if he does liquidate them what is he going to give to the Public Debt Commissioners in return; what is he going to give in substitution to cover the public debt of the country? Or does he want to levy a tax which will pay all our debts in one year? I want to tell the hon. member that from a practical point of view you cannot do it. Where you have a source of capital formation which also protects the public, a sound source which is applauded throughout the world, you cannot substitute it with something else without doing tremendous damage to your country.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to emphasize this point that what the hon. member has proposed amounts to nothing else than to nullify the <span class="col_2793-2794" refersTo="page_1412"/>good example the State is setting to the private sector in the economic field. The hon. member does not want to build anything, he wants to break down what has already been built up and if that is his policy South Africa will not be grateful to him. If that is the policy of the United Party South Africa will not be grateful to him either. South Africa will accuse them of being the people who want to destroy the capital formation structure in South Africa, something which will lead to unstability in our economic life where there is stability to-day. If we have to submit this matter to the public and if it were to become a plank in the political platform in an election very few of the hon. members of the Opposition who are to-day sitting in this House will come back.</p>

<from>Mr.<person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I listened with interest to the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) and it is quite obvious that that hon. member is desirous of obtaining more information in regard to the motion and the suggestion put forward by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore). I must say that it seems to be the normal practice, particularly during this Session of Parliament, that Government members and Cabinet Ministers seem to close their minds entirely to any suggestions coming from this side of the House. I believe that they are adopting an attitude, prior to hearing the case being put, that they are not prepared to investigate any suggestions. In participating in the debate to-day I want to say at the very outset that in moving his motion the hon. member for Kensington said that he was putting forward this motion as an idea and that he asked for further investigation into the plea he made. I myself am not convinced that in principle it might be a good idea to have a non-contributory pension scheme for our public servants, but what I am convinced of is that this motion and the principles underlying it deserve serious consideration. I think the number of questions put by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) indicated the need for having an investigation into this matter. There are many questions one could ask, but I believe it is worthwhile for the Government to seriously consider this matter and not merely to close its mind to the suggestion and do as the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) did, who said that he believed no case at all had been made out for introducing such a motion. I believe a case has been made out to show that there is a degree of merit in the suggestion put forward, and that the mover has put forward a case which is at least worthy of consideration by the Government.</p>

<p>There are certain other points that the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) covered. His main object was to obtain more details and I think the mover indicated that he was not in a position to supply all the details necessary. Only an investigation could unravel that. He also made a point in regard to the person who resigns from employment, and should he have belonged to a fund to which no contributions are made he would receive nothing. There is one interesting point here, and that is the suggestion put forward by the hon. member for Kensington which shows that those people do receive some recognition; that they receive a proportion of the benefits provided they have service in excess of ten years, and those on the temporary staff who have had continuous service for a period of five years. I do not think it was the intention of the mover to put forward a motion which moves that a person after being in employment would receive no recognition whatsoever in regard to the services he rendered, subject of course to a reasonable minimum time limit applying. Now, the interesting point is to ask whether the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, who has been overseas and studied various schemes and has made all sorts of investigations into our present system of pensions, has given consideration to this particular point in the past, i.e. in regard to the non-contributory basis of State pensions for public servants. The hon. member for Kensington has raised this matter, but I do not think the Minister has replied on a previous occasion to give us an indication of what investigations have taken place in regard to having a noncontributory basis for our civil pension. If such an investigation has taken place I am sure the House would be interested to know what was the extent of the investigation and what were the conclusions arrived at, and what the attitude of the Government is to those findings. I hope that at a later stage, if the Minister participates in the debate, he will be good enough to reply to those questions regarding a step which could be taken, which I agree is a radical step in regard to our civil pensions.</p>

<p>The points that have been raised by the mover and also by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) show that this particular aspect of a pension scheme, either a contributory or a non-contributory scheme, is one which has received consideration in various parts of the world including South Africa. I would like to mention also that the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) asked how one could support a contributory pension scheme as put forward earlier this Session and try to relate it to the proposal now before the House. The answer to that of course is that the national contributory pension scheme has been put forward in this House to cover all those persons who did not belong to any pension scheme, the idea being to cover everyone by some pension scheme. In this particular instance we are dealing with the employees of the State. The Government must see that their servants receive adequate compensation for their services.</p>

<p>There is one aspect which I believe is important&#x2014;the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) also mentioned it&#x2014;and that is the security in the minds of the employees of the Public Service. That is a vitally important <span class="col_2795-2796" refersTo="page_1413"/>matter. In competing with private enterprise, the State is to a certain extent at a disadvantage. They have to operate on a set scale of salaries which they must abide by. One of the most important factors that I have found in so far as a person who is choosing a career is concerned, is that in regard to State employees they have the idea of security uppermost in their minds. So that is a very important factor and I am quite sure that the purpose of this motion will in no way interfere with the security of mind that public servants must have. That security is an important thing and it contributes to some extent in the recruitment of public servants. However, we know that various progressive steps have been taken in recent times in regard to systems of pensions and how those pension schemes should be administered and at present the State servants who enjoy the coverage of pension schemes under the four main pension funds and the Government Employees Provident Fund naturally look forward to the time when they can derive benefits. I am sure that the Government will admit that in the scheme they have at present there are certain failings and there is room for improvement. We know that almost every year when the Pension Laws Amendment Bill is introduced, not only does it embody the various proposals made in the Budget but there are always a number of alterations and improvements to the present Government pension funds, in an attempt to rectify certain defects. But this afternoon we have to consider whether it is advisable to investigate the suggestion put forward that State pensions should be on a non-contributory basis. Various steps have been taken in other countries and when we look at a book which was recently published, in January 1965, we find that this question of having contributory or non-contributory schemes has been exercising the minds of persons who have made an exhaustive study of various pension schemes. The book is entitled &#x201C;New Trends in Pensions&#x201D;, written by Michael Pilch and Victor Wood, who are pension consultants, and they deal in the main with pensions in the private sector, but at the same time they show the relationship between those pensions and the pension schemes existing in Great Britain, and in addition they cover a large section dealing with overseas schemes, including South Africa. What is interesting to note is that in Chapter V, Employee Contributions, they carried out a survey of the various pension schemes in the private sector and found that non-contributory schemes totalled some 16 per cent, whereas contributory schemes totaled 84 per cent. After drawing conclusions from those figures, they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The analysis of schemes by reference to the original date of commencement bore out part of this impression by showing that the non-contributory schemes represented a steadily increasing proportion of the total established in each period, rising from seven per cent of the total for the period prior to 1948 to 32 per cent of the total for 1958 and after. It seems clear from this that while non-contributory schemes have been steadily gaining adherence, their growth has not been quite as rapid as expected. There is, however, no indication that the graduated State pension scheme has imposed any serious check on this trend towards non-contributory schemes.</block>

<p>The point I am making here is that this book indicates that there has been a trend towards the non-contributory basis of pensions. In the private sector, particularly in S.A. at present, there is keen competition for labour and it has been found that some of these organizations are now prepared to put forward schemes which are non-contributory. They have a pension scheme but the business itself takes responsibility for looking after its employees. The position here also indicates, according to this book, that those persons who have contributory schemes at present or who are intending to embark on a pension scheme, should consider a pension scheme on a non-contributory basis. This shows that the new trend in pensions in the private sector appears to be towards non-contributory schemes.</p>

<p>The mover of the motion has mentioned non-contributory schemes for State employees. The State, being responsible for its employees, must first assure those employees that their security is not affected and at the same time they must be able to compete with private enterprise in regard to the recruitment of staff. I know also that the various pension schemes that come into existence are complicated as far as legislation is concerned and those persons who have had experience in the drafting of legislation or who have a constructive, critical approach to pension schemes find that they are indeed complicated and require a great deal of study. I mention this because I believe that a study of our present system of schemes will warrant further investigation being made, and that is all I think the Government should do at this stage. I am certainly not advocating immediately that the State employees should be on a non-contributory basis but I believe a case has been put forward to show that this matter should receive careful investigation by the Department and the Government. I have mentioned amending legislation. Here, too, many of the older employees are put at a great disadvantage. When an improvement is made to the legislation governing one of the funds, naturally it can only be applicable as from a certain date and it can only apply to certain groups. Consequently we have cases where the older servants are at a decided disadvantage when it comes to the application of the laws amending their pension funds. They find that they are perhaps receiving a lower rate of pension and that other difficulties arise which place the newer employees at an advantage, but that does not <span class="col_2797-2798" refersTo="page_1414"/>apply to them when they go on pension. I know that the Government has recognized that fact and in 1964 they introduced a graduated system of supplementary allowances for the older pensioners. But these administrative difficulties do arise and many of the people who are on pension are not benefited. We know that the Select Committee on Pensions has to deal every year with numerous petitions from former employees of the State who are faced with difficulties due to not qualifying and complying with the administrative details governing those pension funds. So the Select Committee must make decisions on those important matters where public servants are often placed at a disadvantage due to amendments to the fund.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) mentioned the fact that many public servants look upon the pension fund as being their savings. That is true, but there are also disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that you may have an employee contributing to the fund for several years and he might then be faced with some financial difficulties and he then sees fit to resign and he draws the contributions to which he is entitled, and after a break in his service he rejoins the service and has to start on another rung of the ladder where he qualifies for a much smaller pension than he would have had, had he not had that break in service. That defeats the object of a pension fund, which is that a person will pay contributions to the fund which will entitle him to certain benefits. But unfortunately this is one of the difficulties encountered. It is a matter which has drawn comment from the Registrar of Pension Funds. A few years ago this aspect was brought to the notice of the Government which was asked to take steps to discourage this practice.</p>

<p>The transfer of pension rights is another important matter. Amendments are made which give the members the right of election whether to remain on the previous basis or to go on to the new basis and pay a higher contribution. A wrong decision made at a younger age would possibly be very much regretted at a later age, although at the time he may have to pay smaller contributions, but later he finds that he gets a disappointingly low pension. Pensioners sometimes have to decide whether their pension should be on an average of the last seven years&#x2019; earnings or whether it should be taken over a period of 25 years. These are all difficulties which arise from time to time, particularly if the scheme is a contributory scheme for State employees. The other difficulties we have experienced are in regard to the temporary allowances, the supplementary allowances allowed to certain public servants. I mentioned this point during the debate on the budget of the Minister of Transport earlier this Session. Here the same conditions exist whereby the payment of an allowance to a person is limited by the means test, which means that those persons who take employment and exceed the means test no longer qualify for that allowance. I have here a case I received only a few weeks ago of a public servant who was drawing R116 a month plus R34 as a temporary allowance, making a total of R150 a month&#x2014;this was a married man with dependants&#x2014;and who was then offered part-time employment in the mornings only at R40 per month, but he was informed that with this R40 a month he would lose his R34 allowance, so he would in fact only be earning R156. So he was being asked to work for R6 a month. These are all administrative difficulties that arise. The Minister of Transport brushed it aside. He was not prepared to consider raising these limits. These matters can be dealt with administratively, but it is an important point which affects past servants of the State. I feel that many of these difficulties could be overcome if we had a non-contributory scheme for State officials.</p>

<p>Another important factor is the devaluation in the purchasing power of money. When you take into account the pensions paid to many of these people, we can see how difficult it is for those persons to keep pace with the decrease in the purchasing power of money. This matter is also dealt with in the book I quoted from. It also brings into account the various means of assessing what form of pension a person should receive at the end of his service and the steps that can be taken to protect the recipient against the decrease in the purchasing power of money, and how they can keep pace with the increase in the cost of living. As far as our own system is concerned, the cost of living is a very important factor. These people pay contributions sometimes over a period of 40 years. At the time they start paying their contributions are R4 a month, but that is worth much less in today&#x2019;s valuation of money when they come to retire after 40 years. Forty years ago that R4 a month was a much larger sum of money than it is to-day, so they are at a decided disadvantage as the result of the inflation that takes place over such a long period.</p>

<p>There are other aspects of pension benefits and the basis of assessment, whether it should be 50 per cent of the final salary, or the average for the last seven years of service, or two-thirds of the salary, etc. These are all matters which require adjustment from time to time. These are all matters which affect contributory and non-contributory pension schemes. But I believe that on the basis of our present system all these aspects must be taken into account so as to try and bring up to date and to perfect as nearly as possible our system of pensions. I believe that the State which is suffering from a manpower shortage should take any steps possible which might attract more people to the Public Service, and that all such possible steps should at least be investigated. Therefore I feel that a case has been made out by the hon. member for Kensington to see whether the Government, <span class="col_2799-2800" refersTo="page_1415"/>firstly, has carried out such an investigation, and if not, that they should do so to see whether this is perhaps a wise step that should be taken, to see whether this will in any way assist in bringing about a more satisfactory state of affairs in regard to the pensions of our public servants.</p>

<from>*The<person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank all hon. members who took part in this debate for the way in which they approached this matter, and particularly the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) for the fact that he gave up his plan to introduce the motion that he wanted to introduce here last year. He realized that it would not work, and I am glad that he did so, because it would not have worked. We have again had evidence adduced here to-day on all sides of the House as to the way in which the Department of Pensions administers this Department for the good of the workers, and particularly in the interests of the employees of the State. What makes things very difficult for me is the following. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) comes along and says in the first sentence of his speech that it seems to him that the Government no longer wants to accept any suggestion made by the Opposition. The difficulty we have with hon. members, however, is that they are not consistent in their suggestions. What they say to-day they contradict to-morrow. One moment they plead for one thing and the next moment for another, and heaven help the poor Government that has to take note of these suggestions and follow up and investigate everything. [Interjections.] I remained quiet while the hon. member was speaking but he is already smarting. I want to tell the House what my difficulty is in regard to the accusation made by him that we are not prepared to accept suggestions made by the other side. I come to the first point. Last year the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) introduced a motion in which the Government was asked to appoint a commission to investigate ways and means of encouraging private pension funds. These hon. members have a certain idea about pensions. I take it that the idea that they put forward here to-day is the same idea they had last year, or did they not have this idea last year? They must surely be consistent. They are the people who want to govern the country. They are the alternative Government. [Interjections.] In dealing with a motion such as that moved by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) one would have expected the Opposition to move an amendment requesting the Government to appoint a commission to investigate the whole system of pensions in South Africa. That is what one would have expected, but they did not do so. They put forward an alternative by means of an amendment which says, &#x201C;The Government is requested to consider the advisability of instituting a national contributory pension scheme.&#x201D; Anyone reading this amendment would interpret it as meaning that the suggestion made by the hon. members is that basically a comprehensive national contributory pension scheme is the best thing for the country. One can interpret it no other way. This was their argument, and this argument is inconsistent with what is being suggested here to-day. Let me explain. In its amendment last year the Opposition proposed a comprehensive contributory pension scheme. This idea which they had last year was subsequently followed up. This year, on 29 January, the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield), introduced his motion and in doing so he used these words: &#x201C;I believe that we do not have an adequate social security programme in this country.&#x201D; What makes him think we have not got it? Because what lacks from our present system is a contributory pension scheme!</p>

<from>*The<person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>But it is the principle. Mr. Speaker, one should be able to differentiate and if anybody in this House cannot differentiate in principle between what is good and what is bad he continually makes mistakes as hon. members opposite are continually making mistakes. The hon. member took the matter a little further and I want to follow the analogy a little further. He said: The amount paid out to social pensioners can be increased considerably if augmented from a contributory pension fund. If this principle applies in the case of social pensioners why cannot the same principle apply in the case of civil pensioners? Why can&#x2019;t their pensions be likewise augmented? I am talking about the principle that they be augmented from a contributory pension fund. Hon. members know that it is a system which has been in operation for years and years in South Africa but they come along at this stage and during one short afternoon they throw a few stones in a bush to see what will jump out from behind that bush. My charge against those hon. members is this, but before I come to that I just want to quote what the hon. member for von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Van der Walt advanced arguments against a national contributory pension scheme knowing full well that that is the policy of this side of the House; it is a national pension scheme.</block>

<p>Without the proviso referred to by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield). It is the chief whip of the hon. member for Umbilo talking here. It is his chief whip who is stating the policy on behalf of his party. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Van der Walt advanced arguments against a national contributory pension <span class="col_2801-2802" refersTo="page_1416"/>scheme, knowing full well that it is the policy of this side of the House, a national pension scheme. Sir, that still remains our policy.</block>

<p>There was no proviso. Our system in South Africa is a system which is years old, a system which has been tested and which has appeared to be sound over the years as far as Public Servants are concerned. As far as other pensioners are concerned I have on dozens of occasions explained the system we have in this country and defended and compared it with the system they have in Europe. I have said that our pension system, as far as both civil and social pensioners are concerned, compares very favourably with the best systems in the world to-day. If hon. members were to come with a specific motion we would welcome it but you never know where you are with them, Sir, as I have again proved by giving chapter and verse. The hon. member for Umbilo says they merely want an enquiry. It was announced last year that there would be an enquiry. After the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) had introduced his motion the hon. the Minister of Finance undertook to appoint a commission of enquiry. A commission of enquiry was requested and here I have the terms of reference of that commission. The terms of reference of the commission actually go beyond the ambit of that motion in order to cover other matters as well, matters which we consider important and which they have to enquire into. One of the terms of reference of the commission is to enquire into the question of transferring somebody&#x2019;s rights from one pension fund to another and to promote the obligations of pension funds. The next term of reference is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To prevent a person, in any way whatsoever from acquiring his accumulated pension savings before he has reached the pensionable age.</block>

<p>That is in conformity with the attitude of hon. members that people should be given an opportunity to save for their old age. The next term of reference is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the execution of the above to take into account pension funds introduced in terms of industrial agreements or which are subject to a measure of control by a State Department, including the South African Railways and Harbour Administration, a Provincial Administration and the South West African Administration.</block>

<p>The committee commenced its work in January. I merely mention this because the hon. member made the accusation which he did make. What I find peculiar is this: If it is right that a non-contributory pension scheme be introduced for the Public Service what in Heaven&#x2019;s name is wrong with having it for the Railway service as well? Surely it cannot be right in respect of one and wrong in respect of the other. Surely it is childish to argue like that. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said the Railways was a different matter. Does he want to sow confusion amongst the pensioners, between the civil pensioners on the one hand who have had one system for all the years and with which they are satisfied and the Railway pensioners? My charge against the hon. member is that he is totally inconsistent in his basic argument if he says he wants a non-contributory pension scheme for public servants while he wants a contributory pension scheme for railwaymen although they are also public servants. They have to remain on one side.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) asked him this question: What about Railway officials? And his reply was: &#x201C;No, leave them aside. He wants to sow discord. It is very clear what he wants to do but he will not succeed. I want to ask him whether he or any other member on that side raised the matter of a non-contributory pension scheme for railway officials when the Minister of Transport&#x2019;s vote was under discussion during the last few days? No, not one of them referred to it but now suddenly those two schemes must be separated. I also want to ask them what the position is of officials in the service of the Provincial Administration? On what basis should they be treated?</p>

<p>There is another aspect. I maintain that to abolish this contributory pension scheme for the Public Service you would set in motion a chain reaction in respect of private schemes. That is an absolutely logical conclusion to come to. Members of private schemes will say: If the State can introduce a non-contributory scheme why can&#x2019;t private institutions do likewise? We are busy extending this contributory pension scheme as far as possible; we encourage these schemes. At the moment there are between 2,000 and 3,000 such schemes. Must we at this stage set in motion a chain reaction in respect of those schemes we have built up over the years? Must we create dissatisfaction amongst the members of those private pension schemes which we have been encouraging over the years? I now come to the final question: Who have asked for it? The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) represents a constituency in which there are many public servants. I know his constituency. Have the public servants asked the hon. member for Kensington or the United Party to advocate the idea set out in their motion on their behalf?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, every scheme in every country has its advantages and is disadvantages. It is a matter which is continually being discussed and investigated by all Governments. I did not come across a single system in Europe which we can take over just like that and apply it here to the satisfaction of everybody. I did not come across one scheme in Europe with which the Government concerned was 100 per cent satisfied. They are continually effecting changes. The system we have in operation today has already been in operation for years and nobody outside has asked for the scheme asked for in this motion, because this is a private motion as the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) has rightly pointed out. The associations of the public servants have not asked for it. If they wanted it I think they would surely have approached the Minister of the Interior or me and said: We think it would be a good thing to introduce a noncontributory scheme.&#x201D; The public servants have not asked for it.

<from>*The<person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to mention a few of the benefits of the present scheme. There is sound co-operation between the State and its officials under the system which has been in operation for years. A second advantage is that it offers security to the public servants. The hon. member for Umbilo has said that security is a very important factor. In the third place the pension of the official is guaranteed and is not dependent on any fluctuations which may set in. The present system offers protection to employer and employee. The financial position of the fund remain stable. The rate of contributions as well as the structure of the fund is continually investigated in order to protect both employer and employee, particularly in the interests of the employee and he knows that is the position. Salary scales are often changed and the employee knows exactly how every increase affects his pension benefits and the State also knows that additional expenditure it will have to incur in respect of pensions. Consequently both can do their own planning much better. I do not want to give the House a summary of the disadvantages but I do want to say this afternoon that any department of pensions will immediately be able to point out the impracticability of a suggestion such as the one contained in this motion. If such a motion were to be accepted the first question that would arise would be what should be done with the contributions already made by the employees and the State. Must those contributions be refunded to the contributors or must the existing scheme remain in operation in respect of those who have already made contributions? What is more the existing contributory scheme would have to be maintained for a long period. You cannot suddenly wreck this scheme which has been in operation for years. That would be a terrible injustice to the public servants who have contributed to the scheme. You now introduce a new scheme for new officials and that new scheme would inevitably mean that you would have to maintain a dual scheme. Such a dual scheme would make things very difficult from an administrative point of view.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude. If you introduce such a new scheme as you suggested out of the blue in this motion you would have to give employers a choice whether they want to retain the old system or whether they want to come in under the new scheme. The hon. member knows that is so. You will antagonize the one employer against the other and by confronting them with this choice you will create dual administration.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Government&#x2019;s policy is a positive one and that is to encourage private pension funds. The policy of the Government&#x2014;and this Parliament has approved of it&#x2014;is to encourage private pension funds and Parliament has placed the Government in a position where it can exercise control. The Government will continue to exercise that control. We are not prepared to relinquish that control. Mr. Speaker, members are beginning to get impatient and at this stage I therefore want to move&#x2014;</p>
