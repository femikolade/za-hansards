<heading>Removal of Persons from Group Areas</heading>

<question by="#barnett" to="#minister_of_community_development">

<num>*III.</num>

<from>Mr. BARNETT (for Mr. Holland)</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Community Development:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any cases occurred during the period 1 January 1960 to 31 December 1964. where unqualified persons occupying dwellings in proclaimed group areas were compelled to move without alternative accommodation being made available to them; if so, how many cases;</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_community_development" to="#barnett">

<from>The MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No.</li>

<li><p>(2) I am aware that it was again surmised in newspaper reports that persons may <span class="col_8583-8584" refersTo="page_1490"/>as a result of the proclamation of group areas in the central part of Cape Town, find themselves in an invidious position. I find it extremely objectionable that this rousing of suspicion and inspiration of fear is again being resorted to since I have repeatedly in and outside of Parliament given the unequivocal assurance that no person who is not able to provide for himself will be required to move before alternative accommodation is provided.</p>

<p>As regards the resettlement of Coloureds and Indians who will have to be resettled as a result of the proclamation of Cape Town Central, I wish to point out that large Coloured and Indian areas have been proclaimed in different parts of Cape Town and if circumstances warrant it, more will be proclaimed. Before the issue of a proclamation is recommended, it is in every case required in terms of Section 5 (7) of the Group Areas Act, 1957 (Act No. 77 of 1957) that the Group Areas Board take into account whether suitable alternative accommodation will be available for the persons who will become disqualified by the proclamation and a suggestion that a proclamation will render persons homeless, is unfounded.</p>

<p>Many members of the racial groups who have become disqualified as a result of the proclamation of group areas in Cape Town Central, for instance those who reside in Upper Waterkant Street, live in the very worst unhygienic slum conditions so that it was in any event imperative for alternative accommodation to be provided for them.</p>

<p>As far as businesses are concerned, it must be pointed out that a year&#x2019;s notice to vacate must be given. Disqualified persons will in each case, as has always been the policy, be treated sympathetically and in accordance with the Government&#x2019;s repeated assurances, as far as businesses are concerned, not be deprived of their livelihood.</p>

<p>It is also known that non-Whites use certain sportsfields at Green Point. This privilege will not be denied them until reasonable alternative facilities are made available to them. In this connection I wish to state that the Department of Coloured Affairs administers a subsidy scheme on a rand for rand basis whereby funds are made available to properly constituted organizations for the provision of sport or other educational facilities. In addition the local authority also contributes substantially in this respect.</p>

<p>It is necessary that each racial group carry on its activities such as businesses, recreation, hospitalization and so forth in its own area and that the necessary steps are taken to assist them to achieve this. There must, however, in a case like Cape Town Central, be a transition stage and the proclamation does not mean that sportfields and businesses as, for instance, the flower market will be moved before it is expedient and desirable to do so and before the alternatives have been provided. In meritorius cases the necessary permits will be granted during the transition stage.</p>

<p>I wish to state, however, that as soon as the group character of an area is known, it is wise for everybody to take cognizance thereof and that especially the public bodies, such as the city council, should take the necessary steps to adjust itself in accordance therewith and to replace the facilities which are being used by disqualified persons in an area in which they are so disqualified, with such facilities in their own areas.</p></li>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing" to="#moolman">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING:</from>

<p>No direct steps have been taken or are envisaged as it was found after thorough consideration that a prohibition on the slaughter of breeding stock is not practically feasible and furthermore that special legislative power will have to be taken. For obvious reasons a prohibition will have to be applied throughout the country and it is foreseen that many problems will arise. Of the indirect steps taken the following may be mentioned:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) The institution of a fodder subsidy scheme to retain breeding stock in the recognized cattle regions of the country;</li>

<li>(2) the rebates and subsidies on the cost of transporting drought-stricken stock and fodder; and</li>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) and (b). When an export quota for 5,000 units (20 lb) crayfish was first granted to the Coloured Development Corporation Ltd. in 1963, it could, owing to the lack of time and experience, itself not exploit the quota and sold its right to use the Corporation&#x2019;s quota at an average price per unit of R2.15 net. The Corporation itself has since operated the export quota and, during 1964 allowed 620 units to be exported against its quota as live crayfish at a net payment of R7.00 per unit, which is much higher than the net return on exported crayfish tails.</li>

<li>(2) Yes. The Corporation receives the normal export price for crayfish exported by it.</li>

<li>(3) No, but the Corporation will itself continue to exploit the quota for the benefit of the Coloured community.</li>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>On this the last day of the Session, we have the opportunity, at the third-reading stage of the Appropriation Bill, to look back a little on the past Session and to see what has become clear to us as members of this House and to the public. I think that the most interesting occurrence of this Session has been the increasing extent to which the Government has been inclined to associate itself with South Africa, the manner in which the Government has claimed that its transitory, temporary, views, prejudices and trvialities should actually be regarded as the South African thought and the South African image in the world. It is striking that a Government which associates itself with South Africa in this way and which makes itself out to be South Africa herself, is at the same time engaged in some or other masochistic process of doing immeasurable harm to South Africa, as though it has a grudge against South Africa and against the people of South Africa. It was particularly interesting for this reason to see the reaction of the hon. the Minister of Transport yesterday to a speech made by my hon. friend, the member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). I am very sorry that the hon. the Minister of Transport is not here at the moment but I think it is necessary for me to refer to this matter. During the course of his speech the hon. member for Bezuidenhout mentioned the feeling which exists that the Cape Coloured should have equal citizenship in South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Transport reacted immediately to this statement. He went so far as to say that this would mean that the Nationalist Party would win the next election with an even greater majority <span class="col_8611-8612" refersTo="page_1504"/>than ever before, and he took great delight in saying this; it was the Nationalist Party at its best when he was able to exploit the colour question in this way. The hon. the Minister said that he did not accuse the hon. member for Bezuidenhout of it but that he had referred to hypocrisy and hypocritical actions time and again. Far be it from me to use such expressions in regard to the Government or the Nationalist Party but what I do want to say is that what we experienced yesterday was an example of the cruel exploitation of colour feeling and colour prejudice and the fear on the part of some Whites, for the political gain of the Nationalist Party and to the detriment of the Republic of South Africa. This was a blatant case in which the shortsighted and transient interests of the Nationalist Party were put before the interests of the Republic of South Africa. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister is now back in the Chamber. I want to ask him whether members of the Cabinet have never made the same suggestion as that made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout yesterday.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No. You see, Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister was in such a hurry to make political capital out of what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout had said that he did not stop for a moment to determine the policy of his own party and his colleagues in the Cabinet. On 18 September 1960 the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who is greatly interested in the colour policy of the Nationalist Party, made the following statement at Potchefstroom&#x2014;this report comes from <i>Dagbreek</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As they (the Coloureds) increase in number and political maturity, additional White representation ought to be given them in Parliament.</block>

<p>Did the hon. the Minister of Transport not know that this statement had been made by one of his colleagues? l&#x2019;Interjection.] Does the hon. the Minister want the law to be amended? The law makes provision whereby the number of Coloured representatives can be increased as the number of White representatives in this House increases, and not according to the extent to which the Coloureds develop. It is a question of policy, not a question of legislation. Is the hon. the Minister not aware of the statements made by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs abroad, statements putting matters far more strongly than they were put yesterday by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout? The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs stated in Paris on 8 October last year that South Africa&#x2019;s aim&#x2014;the aim, of course, of the Government&#x2014;was a commonwealth of nations in Southern Africa in which no single nation would prevail over another. He went on to say: &#x201C;There is nothing which we as a White nation claim for ourselves which we do not go out of our way to place within the reach of the non-White groups&#x201D;. Nothing! Mr. Speaker, we demand representation by our own people in this Parliament. That is what we demand for ourselves. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs went to Paris. He spoke in Paris&#x2014;but he does not whisper in South Africa&#x2014;and he said that there was nothing which we claimed for ourselves which we would not grant to the non-Whites. Will he make an appeal now for Coloureds to be elected to the House of Assembly? Let us see what the hon. the Minister had to say at Cologne on 1 Ocober 1964 according to the <i>Burger</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the South African Government&#x2019;s aim to end racial discrimination in South Africa. The full implementation of our policy will create a position in which discrimination will disappear.</block>

<p>The full implementation of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy will mean that the Coloureds will again be able to attend the Luxurama Theatre with the Whites. The full implementation of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy will mean that Negroes will be able to land at Yesterplaat and other aerodromes. It will mean that there will be no discrimination. The hon. the Minister talks of hypocrisy, and then he looks at us!</p>

<p>That is not all. I have here an official document of the Department of Information. In it appears a speech made by the hon. the Minister of Defence at a parade of the new Coloured Corps on 23 February 1965. What does the hon. the Minister have to say? He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African Coloured Corps which is being trained to fulfil a very important task is now an integral part of the South African Permanent Force. I want to give you the assurance that we welcome all members of the Corps as full-fledged members of the Permanent Force.</block>

<p>No discrimination! But that is not all either. The hon. the Prime Minister addressed the South Africa Club at the Savoy Hotel in 1961 or 1962 when he was in England to try to keep South Africa in the Commonwealth. What did he say? He told a British audience&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And yet we do not only seek and fight for a solution which will mean our survival but seek one which will grant survival and full development, economically, politically, to each of the other racial groups as well.</block>

<p>But that is still not all. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs addressed UN on 21 December 1954. I should like to quote a few sentences from that important and interesting speech. He told UN&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is our objective to provide to every individual . . .</block>

<p>Not nations or groups but&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">. . . every individual the fullest chance of development within his own nation and, where possible, within his own national homeland.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This policy will result in the recognition of all concerned of the quality in status in human dignity and in political autonomy and independence of the various nations in South Africa.</block>

<p>He stated further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, it is thus that we are striving to eliminate all forms of political inequality.</block>

<p>He stated in fact, all forms of political inequality between the nations living in South Africa. What are the Coloured people? Are they not a nation? What are the Coloureds of the Cape in the view of the Nationalist Party?</p>

<p>I do not begrudge hon. members opposite all the satisfaction they can derive from that, but I say to them that this South Africa of ours, the country which we are all trying to serve, will derive no satisfaction from the fact that the Government speaks in two voices in this way. They speak with one voice in Paris, they sing with one voice in the Savoy Hotel but they do not whisper it in Florisbad; this may not be said in South Africa. Another image must be created in South Africa, the image of the forceful suppression of other races, the image of brutal supremacy! And then we are maligned because we have the courage to say in South Africa what they say outside South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that I have to spend so much time on this matter but the hon. the Minister of Transport makes it impossible for one to ignore these things as one ought to do&#x2014;to deal contemptuously with these things. But I do not treat the hon. the Minister of Transport with contempt. I think that he is capable of better things.</p>

<p>My difficulty with the Government is this: They associate themselves with South Africa. They want the whole world to regard their policy as the policy of South Africa. They want the whole world to regard what they did yesterday as being the South African way of life over the centuries.</p>

<p>I want to put this question to the Government: If they want themselves to be associated with South Africa, why do they do South Africa and its people so much harm; why do they hurt South Africa so? Why is it necessary to hurt the Cape Coloured to such an extent as an individual and as a person? Forget about equal citizenship, about equality and about a separate nation which must have all the rights which the Whites have. What has the Cape Coloured done, Mr. Speaker, to be hurt and humiliated in this bitter way? To mention only one example, why may the Cape Coloureds no longer go to the Cape Town City Hall to listen to the symphony concerts? Why not? Since when has it been the traditional policy of South Africa to repudiate them? Since when has it been the traditional way of life in Cape Town that such people can only attend these concerts by way of permit? Why is this advanced, culture-conscious, music-loving group selected to be hurt?</p>

<p>If the Nationalist Party policy has now reduced them to that level, to those cubicles, then I do not know where this discussion is going to lead us. The fact remains that the Cape Town City Hall has been in existence now for 40 or 50 years. It was built in the days of Queen Victoria and we have now, to-day, to hear this story from the hon. the Minister. Where does our traditional way of life come into it? This is something quite new which has been cooked up by the hon. the Prime Minister. It is not something which is peculiar to Cape Town; it is not something which is peculiar to the South African nation.</p>

<p>If the Government wants us to associate South Africa with them why do they hurt the farmers of South Africa to such an extent? What have the arguments during this Session been? Hon. members opposite quoted figures to show that if one divides the number of farmers into the income of the farmers, one obtanis a slightly larger amount than the average income per farmer. But everyone who used that argument did not mention the fact that as a result of the policy of this Government, the number of farmers in South Africa is decreasing at the rate of 2,500 per annum. If that process continues long enough and if the Government&#x2019;s attitude is successful, one will eventually have the position in which ten farmers will be responsible for the total income from agriculture in the country. Then they will come and tell us: Just see how the farmers in the country are flourishing because here we have ten farmers with a great income!</p>

<p>If the Government want the people of South Africa to associate them with South Africa why are they so inimically disposed towards the interests of salary-earners and people with a fixed income? The hon. the Prime Minister tried yesterday to defend what he had said during the no-confidence debate. At the time he stated in the clearest possible terms that because of the great prosperity in South Africa, the level of income of the people had risen generally and that they accordingly did not need more but that they simply desired more. Does he really believe this? Does the hon. the Prime Minister actually want to tell us that there are not thousands of White people in South Africa&#x2014; and many more non-Whites but for the sake of his outlook on life I want to confine myself to the Whites&#x2014;who need more money?</p>

During the discussion of the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Labour we were told time and again that the Government could not interfere, that this was a question of agreement between organized labour and organized employers; we were told that it was a question for the Wage Board. But when it comes to increases then the State can very quickly say that these are exorbitant and they are going to put a stop to this practice. Why when his Vote was discussed did the hon. the Minister of Labour not even know of the threat which councillor Eben Cuyler uttered against the City Council of Johannesburg, on behalf of the Nationalist Party, towards the end of May? The City Council of Johannesburg obtained the services of an expert from the U.S.A. to investigate the wage structure of that city council.</p>

<p>What the United Party in the City Council of Johannesburg want to do is to see that fair salaries and wages are paid for fair work. That is our policy. The point is that by his question the hon. the Prime Minister wants to suggest that the salary structure in the 19 representative industries in Johannesburg is exorbitant and ridiculous [Interjections.] That is his attitude; that is his point of view and so I ask again: Why is the Government hostile towards the salary-earner and the wage-earner in South Africa?</p>

<p>Why are they so unsympathetically disposed towards the old people in South Africa? For how many years now have we not been advocating the introduction of a contributory pension fund for our old people? The old Economic Planning Council estimated that as soon as the national income reached the R2,000,000,000 per annum mark it would be possible to introduce a contributory pension scheme for our old people. Our national income already exceeds R5,000,000,000 and where is that scheme? The Government is hostile to it. But that is not all. The other day I spoke to an expert in the sphere of old age problems and he told me that the biggest problem of old people, particularly widows&#x2014;most old people are widows &#x2014;is loneliness. He told me that the greatest blessing for old people in every country in the world, even in countries which are less advanced than South Africa, is television. But this mighty consolation for our old people is refused the old people in South Africa because the Government is not sympathetically disposed towards the old people of South Africa. Why cannot we have television here? Is it because television will compete with the newspapers with the lowest circulation in South Africa for advertising, the Nationalist Party newspapers? Does the Government want to protect those newspapers against competition on the part of television? There can be no other reason than that the Government is inimically disposed towards the interests of the people who find consolation and entertainment in this wonderful new development of human ingenuity.</p>

<p>I also want to ask this question: Why is the Government doing so much harm to South Africa itself? The hon. the Prime Minister has reason to be grateful to South Africa. Does he hate South Africa? In his speech he said that our foreign envoys make use of every opportunity to defend South Africa&#x2019;s policy to foreign bodies. He mentioned the example of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Kingdom of the Netherlands which is fully informed in regard to our policy. When he discussed the <i>Independence</i> incident he said that friendly countries were welcome to come here, that they could also come here with their military staff, but that they should respect the South African way of life.</p>

If it is so important that Whites and non-Whites should not mix at an aerodrome, if they should not mix at a football match, if they should not mix at symphony concerts, why is it then that on each occasion when I go to Johannesburg and stay in a leading hotel there that hotel is packed with non-Whites? Yes, it is packed with Asiatics and Japanese. They are not White people; they may be very good people but they are honorary Whites. Since when has it been part of the traditional way of life of South Africa to elevate millions and millions of non-Whites to the status of honorary Whites? [Interjections.] If non-Whites buy pig-iron from South Africa, they become honorary Whites, but if non-Whites arrive here <i>en route</i> for Vietnam to shed their blood against the communist enemy, they cannot land at a South African aerodrome! They are not honorary Whites. Where does the traditional way of life come into it? How did Mr. Buks Fouch&#x00E9; explain this to the Netherlands Foreign Minister?

<p>I think that it is a good thing that we are promoting our trade with Japan. I think that the Government has under the circumstances done the right thing by declaring the Japanese to be honorary Whites in South Africa, but I want to put a very simple question to the hon. the Prime Minister. Hon. members opposite are very fond of putting catch questions to us, but my question is not a catch question; it merely seeks clarity: If Japan were to send a trade mission to South Africa to-morrow to promote trade with us, to buy more of our pig-iron and to sell more transistor radios to South Africa, and they want to land at the D. F. Malan Airport with a Japanese pilot, what will the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s answer be? Will that pilot be an honorary White person and be able to land? And there are Negroes in America who have less pigmentation in their skins than the Japanese have. It is these contradictions, this fickleness, this shortsightedness, this blind prejudice which is not even applied consistently which makes us ask what this Government has against South Africa? We are all fond of our traditions in this country but this does not mean that a Prime Minister or a Government has the right to elevate temporary prejudices, unjustifiable prejudices to the status of high principles in a capricious manner from day to day, and then to break them once again. It is a high principle that the colours may not mix, but this is broken in the case of the Japanese. It is an elevated principle that non-Whites may not become traffic constables to regulate White traffic. That principle has for years been maintained against the protest of the Cape Town City Council, but the hon. the Minister of Labour has told us during this Session; &#x201C;That is nonsense&#x201D;. Now the Coloureds can once again regulate the traffic in Cape Town ! Where is the <span class="col_8619-8620" refersTo="page_1508"/>principle? That is capriciousness. These are the things which hurt South Africa unnecessarily. The Government does not have the right to bandy the interests of South Africa about in this way.</p>

<p>The hon. member complains because this Government identifies itself with South Africa and that statements have been made outside South Africa about the meaning of our policy towards the non-White groups and that those statements about the meaning of our policy have not been fully borne out at this stage. And in connection with those statements the attack is concentrated pre-eminently on the Coloured population, because, logically speaking, our policy is unassailable as far as the Bantu are concerned. But as regards the Coloured group, a group which is in a special and difficult position, and which is not specifically included when one puts the Government&#x2019;s policy in general terms, it is sometimes possible to criticize the logic of our arguments. It is against that that the hon. member&#x2019;s attack is directed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what is the real substance of the hon. member&#x2019;s attack? He bases his attack on the contention that we are false when we say that it is our aim to place no privilege beyond the reach of the non-White groups. His accusation is that it is not our aim to put an end to racial discrimination. His attack is that it is not our aim to grant every individual in South Africa equality of status. But, Mr. Speaker, equality of human status does not mean similarity of all rights. Surely the Bantu, who, for example, have certain economic possibilities and certain political rights, have economic opportunities and political rights which are different from those of the Whites? [Interjections.] But it does not necessarily mean that because those things are different the status of the Bantu as an individual is impaired in any way. And yet the hon. member comes along and says that we dare not whisper these things, we dare not advocate them, we dare not whisper them in Florisbad. But the hon. member is hopelessly wrong. We have advocated that national standpoint of non-discrimination and the establishment of the Bantu homelands from the Soutpansberg to Cape Point, and the United Party are the people who made it their election cry that we were advocating the policy of separate freedom for the White man and the Black man. They tried to stir up suspicion against the National Party amongst the voters and tried to throw us out of office because we had the courage to advocate separate freedom. And yet they adopt the role of accusers and have the temerity to accuse us here of not having the courage to put our point of view to South Africa.</p>

<p>That brings me back to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson), to whose protection the hon. member for Yeoville rushed. In one of the expressions used by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout he displayed that typical hostility towards South Africa. He discussed our problems in terms which inevitably pour oil on the flame of our enemies. The hon. member said that he objected to compulsory apartheid in South Africa, but that the opposite of compulsory apartheid was not compulsory integration. The United Party was opposed to compulsory apartheid and was also opposed to compulsory integration, said the member for Bezuidenhout. Mr. Speaker, on the surface those words sound like a good epigram, but in actual fact they are bereft of all logic. Let us test the hon. member&#x2019;s statements in respect of compulsory apartheid and compulsory integration by referring to a few practical things. What is the position as far as residential separation is concerned? If we had compulsory integration, it would mean that the various races would be compelled to live amongst one another. But if compulsory apartheid&#x2014; something which is rejected by the United Party&#x2014;were not applied, the members of the various races would be free to live wherever they liked. The Coloured person and the Bantu could then buy a house next to mine and move in there, and I could go and live next to the Coloured person and the Bantu. Is that not nonsense? If we did not have compulsory apartheid, it would mean that separate communities would cease to exist. The logical point in that connection is this, that if one wants to achieve separation between different communities, if one wants to apply any rule within a society, it should be possible to enforce that rule&#x2014;there should be a sanction in order to ensure that the rule is observed.</p>

<p>Let us test the hon. member&#x2019;s epigram for foreign consumption in the sphere of education. What he stands for, is that there should be no compulsory apartheid and&#x2014;as is the case in America&#x2014;that there should be no compulsory integration either. He wants no school to be compelled to accept non-White pupils, but at the same time no one should <span class="col_8621-8622" refersTo="page_1509"/>be prohibited to do that. What sort of situation would then exist? What would be the position if there were no compulsory apartheid in the schools? Coloured children would go to White schools, and perhaps there would be Whites who would not be satisfied with that. On the other hand there might be Coloured persons who would not put up with White children going to Coloured schools. Then we would have an interference with the choice of the people. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, we cannot want apartheid if we do not at the same time have a sanction for enforcing it.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question? Has the hon. member never heard of the free organization of groups, for example, language groups, cultural groups, etc., groups which organize themselves without any compulsion being exerted by the State?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are thoroughly aware of the right of groups to organize themselves. I am also convinced that if the evil day should come that that side&#x2019;s concept of the abolition of compulsory apartheid in our schools were applied, we would be obliged as groups, at our own expense and after having paid our taxes, to pay again for the establishment and organization of our own schools. But we do not want that. We want the State to treat the various communities with justice. We do not want the various communities to have to shoulder the burden of working out their own salvation in a State which is careless of the rights of individuals.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also said that there were many people in South Africa who were favourably disposed towards the federation plan of the United Party. He stated* inter alia, that I was one of the members of the National Party who was favourably disposed towards that concept. Well, I want to try and explain once again where the ideological conflict between this side of the House and that side occurs. It lies in the fact that, politically speaking, we are not prepared to share the sovereignty over the White part of South Africa with the other races. In other words, Mr. Speaker, we are not agreeable to establishing any constitutional system&#x2014;as would be the position in the case of the federation plan&#x2014;in terms of which the sovereignty over the White part of the country would be shared with the non-White groups.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion I spoke of a confederation of South Africa instead of a commonwealth of South Africa. The hon. member built on that, of course, but I want to remind him that the concept of confederation is linked up with the concept that all the constituent parts will be sovereign. Webster&#x2019;s Dictionary gives the following definition of a confederation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An alliance as of nations and states permanently united by a treaty or alliance for joint action.</block>

<p>They are sovereign states, just as the concept of a commonwealth entails the co-operation of sovereign states. I want to agree wholeheartedly that if one is so easily misquoted, and if one&#x2019;s words are so easily misused, then it is safer in this Parliament and in South Africa to speak of a commonwealth rather than of a confederation. Then no false implication can be attached to one&#x2019;s words. But the essence of the matter is that the policy of the National Party and its view of South Africa have always been this, that separate freedom will be achieved for the separate communities, and that they will co-operate with South Africa as the key state of Southern Africa. But they will not interfere with the sovereignty exercised over White South Africa by us as Whites.</p>

<p>I come now to the problematical question, a question which is asked ever so frequently. We are asked: But what about the realization of the Coloured people&#x2019;s citizenship rights? The hon. member for Bezuidenhout let the cat out of the bag&#x2014;and we need not go into the matter any further, because the hon. the Minister of Transport has disposed of it&#x2014;when he said that fundamentally the United Party saw the solution of the Coloured people&#x2019;s problem as being that they should get the same citizenship rights as the Whites. [Interjections.] According to that side our concept of a state within a state and of the development of community rights is quite ridiculous. I want to deal with that for a moment. Where does the expression &#x201C;a state within a state&#x201D; come from? It comes from a negative concept. It was a valid concept in our language that where one had, for example, a criminal or an insurgent or a group organization which administered its own justice and applied its own penalties, the legitimate State would say that such a state within a state could not be tolerated. Consequently such an independent organization, a body which had its own laws in respect of a certain community and had particular functions connected with that community, would be prohibited. That is where the concept of &#x201C;a state within a state&#x201D; arose in our language. Now, Mr. Speaker, what is so inherently illogical about it if we want to convert this negative concept into a positive one? Why cannot a certain community within <span class="col_8623-8624" refersTo="page_1510"/>a state have a certain say as far as the interests of that community are concerned? If we look at the political history of the West, we find that the existence and recognition of our Churches and our corporate life are nothing but examples of a state within a state, because the Western states acknowledge that certain organized communities which deal with particular matters have a certain jurisdiction, a discipline of their own and a legislation of their own. Thus we have companies and sporting clubs. In the case of a tennis club, for example, the State acknowledges that a certain community can organize and regulate itself within the limits of its own community rules.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time in the Western world, this concept has been expanded and employed in respect of our Coloured population in order to grant more rights to a community which is in a difficult position. We say that the Coloured people have certain specific, recognizable community interests and that the management and control of those community interests should be placed under their own direction by means of their own elected representatives and their own executive authority.</p>

</speech>

<p>Must they have their own courts too?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I asked myself whether a community court would be the right thing, whether it would form a division of our ordinary magistrates&#x2019; courts. In view of the establishment and the nature of our Bantu courts I do not find it so far-fetched that the Coloured people will eventually have their own courts in which they will have their own administration of justice in respect of the limited field of their specific community interests. We are of course dealing with the application of laws relating to that particular community now. There will, of course, be many laws which do not affect that community only, and in that respect their own body will have no say. However, their representatives here will have a joint say. But these legalistic issues are not all that is involved as far as the interests of the Coloured community and the realization of citizenship rights and the dignity of the individual in the Coloured community are concerned. The constitutional position is not all that is involved. What are also involved, are the opportunities which the individual has in life. And now the Government has put forward the concept of creating for them a geographic urban community of their own in which they would have full opportunities and all the amenities of life. Is it not far more important to provide the individual and the community with opportunities and the amenities of life, the chance of enjoyment of life, instead of a perhaps more acceptable political right in terms of the international idiom? And is it not more appropriate for the South African patriot&#x2014;or the person who professes to be a patriot, or even the man who is ashamed of being branded internationally as an anti-patriot&#x2014;not to draw international attention to the fact that the rights of our Coloured people are not absolutely in accordance with the international concept of constitutional rights? Would it not be better if, together with us, they were witnesses to the outside world of the fact that the substantial and substantive human rights of the Coloured people were being pursued and attained as never before?</p>

<p>The hon. member referred incorrectly to the non-attendance by our Coloured people of the symphony concerts in Cape Town. I want to point out to the hon. member that the Government is not to blame for that, because the Government granted permission for their attendance, subject to certain conditions, which were not complied with by the City Council. However, that is not something that we should proclaim to the world. Surely it is much more important that our Coloured people have received educational opportunities, economic opportunities, opportunities in life? Surely that is much more important than the fact that eight or ten or 100 Coloured persons may perhaps have to forgo a cultural enjoyment temporarily? If we want to submit evidence before the international community, surely it is our duty to draw attention to what is good and what has already been achieved since this Government took over?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville further stated that this Government identified itself with South Africa as such. He then mentioned one interest group after another which was alleged to be neglected and prejudiced. But all his attacks were merely superficial. For example, when the hon. member discussed salary structures, he made an oblique reference to the Johannesburg situation. There an annual salary of R14.000 is recommended for the Town Clerk. But surely that cannot be set as a standard when wages in general are being discussed! Surely the hon. member knows that the National Party&#x2019;s record since 1948 in respect of the largest lower-paid group in our society, the railwaymen, shows a rising curve which is an outstanding one? Surely the hon. member knows that under this regime the old-age pensioners have received constantly increasing benefits? Surely the hon. member knows that the farming community has been assisted by the State&#x2014;to the extent that the State can concern itself with economic and production processes? Mr. Speaker, that part of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech was nothing but a summary of the detailed oral exposition by the Leader of the Opposition of their next election manifesto.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring to certain things which were said in the course of yesterday&#x2019;s debate. I am referring to the tragic and unfortunate things which were said here by two hon. members of the Opposition, namely, the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) and the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst). They expressed strong criticism of the appointment of the new Commandant-General of our Defence Force. Mr. Speaker, I want to make an appeal to hon. members on that side of the House. Cannot we now, after 20 years, begin to understand one another and respect one another&#x2019;s views? I held the view at that time, as I still do to-day, <span class="col_8625-8626" refersTo="page_1511"/>that there were three main groups in our national life. There were the people who belonged to the English-speaking tradition, whose honour demanded that they enter the struggle at once as allies of their mother country, Britain. I had every respect for them. But there were other people&#x2014;people like myself&#x2014;who belonged to a Republican tradition and to whom it was as objectionable in 1939 as it was in 1914 to consider the possibility of fighting side by side with the power which had raped their country not so long before. And anyone who had that tradition behind him but nevertheless took part in the war, only met with contempt from me. There were other people who did not have such a strong Republican tradition, who were influenced by rational considerations, who felt strongly opposed to Nazism and Fascism. There were people who, on account of certain considerations, nevertheless took part in the war. We respect those people. They made an honest and sincere choice at the time. Let us not try to belittle one another now after all these years. Let us have no more of the accusation on the part of the Opposition that men who felt as I did were cowards because we did not go and fight. After all, they know that is not the truth. Let them show us the same respect as we show them. Let us now, after 25 years, stop making reproaches about a war which is long past. Let us rather join one another in looking to a future which we are going to share, whether voluntarily or otherwise. We cannot achieve unity on all those levels on which we so frequently differ with one another, on which we so frequently spoil South Africa&#x2019;s case in the outside world in a reckless and irresponsible way. But we can nevertheless achieve unity on the level of our country&#x2019;s defence. If we then want to introduce a new period in South Africa, let us begin by agreeing about a subject such as defence, so that we can achieve unity on that level at any rate. Let us not again exchange reproaches about policy in future which possibly arise from differences which existed 20 or 25 years ago.</p>

This Government wants to unite the whole of the White population, the whole of the population of South Africa, in a desire to make this country safe.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think I shall find it possible to give the hon. member a reply which he will appreciate and understand. I want to conclude by saying that the attack on this party&#x2019;s policy may be summed up as follows: The United Party concentrates on details of imperfection. They are concerned about the fact that here and there the Coloured policy of the Government is not in accordance with the normal Western conception of democracy. They complain because the wage structure of all groups has allegedly not followed evenly upon the flood of prosperity which we are experiencing. They complain about problems being experienced by our farmers. In other words, they come down upon every little imperfection in the National Party&#x2019;s policy. Mr. Speaker, so long as the National Party is only subjected to attacks on minor imperfections in its policy, so long will the National Party govern this country. And until such time as the United Party, instead of attacking the imperfections in our policy, can come forward with a message of their own for South Africa, their own message of salvation for South Africa, so long will they remain in the desert.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kemp-ton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn), who just sat down, started his speech off by accusing the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) that if he made the type of speech he made in this House this morning, overseas, it would comfort the enemies of South Africa. The trouble, however, is that if one publicizes the racial policies of this Government overseas you always harm South Africa. So must we wherever we find ourselves refrain from talking about the racial policies of the National Party on account of the fact that if we do we must inevitably harm South Africa?</p>

<p>Of all members, the hon. member for Kemp-ton Park accused the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) of using nothing but words without meaning. But let me say that during this whole Session I have seldom heard a speech which contained so many words without meaning as is the case with the speech of the hon. member on this occasion. He referred, for instance, to &#x201C;dwang-apartheid&#x201D; and asked what it meant. He said it was a word without meaning. Immediately afterwards, however, the hon. member <span class="col_8627-8628" refersTo="page_1512"/>used the phrase &#x201C;andersoortige ekonomiese geleentheid&#x201D; in reference to the Coloureds. But what does that mean? If the Coloureds live in the same country as the Whites what is meant by saying that they have &#x201C;andersoortige ekonomiese geleenthede&#x201D;? They are, after all, tied to the same economic system as that of the Whites, and the same economic laws apply to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member went on to talk about a &#x201C;Staat binne &#x2019;n Staat&#x201D; . . .</p>

<p>Yes, like a tennis club. He compared the sovereign power of the State with the power of a committee of a tennis club. What, Mr. Speaker, is that but words and words? No wonder that nowhere else will you find such a concept as &#x201C;Staat binne &#x2019;n Staat&#x201D; except in the minds of the Nationalists. There is no such concept in the minds of constitutional lawyers anywhere else in the world. If we accept that the prerequisite of a State is sovereign power, then how can you have a State with sovereign power within another State with sovereign power? But what these hon. members really mean by State in this context is a measure of local government. Therefore they should not, like the hon. member for Yeoville pointed out, make the claim overseas that individual groups in this country can develop to its maximum, but then they must say that the non-White groups can only develop to their maximum within the sphere of local government. Then they must be honest and not make the claim, like the hon. the Minister of Finance and other Ministers when they go overseas, that as far as the development of the non-White groups in South Africa is concerned, the sky is the limit. That is also the type of advert which in recent months have been published in America. It simply is misleading. What they should really say is that a ceiling has been placed on the development of these people within certain circumscribed local government spheres.</p>

<p>We constantly hear the accusation from the other side that this side of the House has no principles of policy. We are opportunistic, they say. The hon. member for Yeoville has by his speech this morning rebutted that accusation to a certain extent. As far as I am concerned, I like to take people at their word. Consequently I have in the last couple of days endeavoured to ascertain what the motives are behind the actions of this Government. Coming to the field of racial policies, the only basis for the policies of the Government in this regard seems to be, if one goes by recent statements of the Prime Minister, one of numbers. If I understand the latest statement by the Prime Minister in this regard correctly, then it means that in a multi-racial society the largest group has the inherent right to rule the other groups. It seems to me that the policies of the National Party can be based on something as simple as that, e.g. that the dominant group possesses sovereign power and that the minority groups must be satisfied with local government only in the management of their own affairs, in so far as each group can be said to have its own affairs in a multi-racial society. So because the majority group according to hon. members on the other side consist of Whites, hence this Parliament must remain a White Parliament. They manage first of all to declare the Whites to be the majority group by declaring the real majority group, i.e. the Bantu, as being foreigners. In that way they dispose of the true majority group and having done that they say that the Whites now form the dominant group and as such has the God-given right to govern all the other groups.</p>

<p>What the hon. the Prime Minister and hon. members of his party overlook is that every person making population forecasts in this country has calculated that it is only a question of time before the Whites will be exceeded by the Coloureds and Indians of the country. The Prime Minister said yesterday that he was planning 40 or 50 years ahead. But he must know that 40 or 50 years ahead the majority group of this country will be the Coloured group, according to all population forecasts. The Prime Minister always tells us that according to our colour policy, it will only be a question of time before we have 20 to 50 Coloured Members of Parliament sitting here. On the logic of their latest policy, must we then assume that the moment when the Coloured numbers exceed the White numbers this Parliament will automatically become a Coloured Parliament, and the Whites being in the minority they will only have White councils, and those councils will then consult with the Coloured Prime Minister of this Parliament, and we will have four Coloureds representing the Whites here? That is the ridiculous logic, the kind of <i>reductio ad absurdum,</i> that they always try to apply to our policy. If our policy will lead to this Parliament becoming multi-racial in the sense that there will be large numbers of Coloureds, then I can only say the logical development of their policy will be that this Parliament will become entirely a Coloured Parliament, with the Whites only having certain councils to look after their own affairs, and in the words of the hon. member, the Whites will have &#x201C;andersoortige ekonomiese geleenthede&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I also try to discern what the economic principles are that the Minister of Finance abides by, and I must say that the principle he holds is that everything that is good in the economy is due to Government policy, but everything that is bad is beyond his control. It appears to be as simple as that, although sometimes he appears to have a rather odd sense of philosophy and he can sometimes see good in bad, like for instance, he says the shortage of skilled workers in this country is just as well, otherwise, had we had more skilled workers. <span class="col_8629-8630" refersTo="page_1513"/>we would have had a worse balance of payments problem. This Minister must have a very strange view of economic life. Does he not realize that if we had far more skilled workers we would be able to produce far more and export far more? In fact, if the Minister would study what has happened in recent years, the countries with the great export performances are those in which the number of skilled workers increased fastest and their production therefore increased faster, which increased their exports. If the Minister is really logical, we should stop immigration, because according to him the more skilled workers we have the greater the balance of payments problem becomes.</p>

<p>I should like to say to the Minister that if he claims that this wonderful prosperity the country had enjoyed for the last three years is entirely due to Government policy, he should also take responsibility for the hangovers and the headaches which flowed from it, the headache of the balance of trade and the sharp rise in prices during the past year, which result in the fact that large numbers of people with fixed incomes have missed the boom but are now catching the inflation. There is a rapid increase in the cost of living. The Minister this Session has to a large extent blamed the situation in which we find ourselves to-day on the fact that bank credit was increased so tremendously in one year, between 40 and 50 per cent. But surely if the Minister really planned this boom and really has the control over the economy which he claims he has, he should never have allowed bank credits to increase by that amount, because we see the consequences of that now. Because bank credits increased so suddenly during the course of a year, the Government has had to take counter measures to try to restrict the credit very suddenly. In a relatively short period, as the Minister himself pointed out, he has required the banks to increase their liquid holdings. I therefore think that the accusation my leader made that this Minister has very much of a go-stop policy as far as economic affairs are concerned is fairly true, because they allowed the bank credit to be extended by 40 per cent and within a relatively short period they had to take very stringent deflamatory measures. If there is one country in the world that should have been able to have sustained growth, or even a very rapid rate, it is South Africa, because I do not think that in all the world there is a country which in the post-war period was better placed and had so many favourable factors for steady and even rapid economic growth. The post-war period has been one of rapid economic growth in the Western world and in Japan, and there are ever-increasing export markets. South Africa had the additional advantage of a rapidly-increasing gold production, the value of which trebled in this period. In addition, South Africa was in a particularly advantageous position in that it had enormous natural resources and, unlike most countries in the Western world, it had large reserves of labour. The only limiting factor to rapid economic growth was the scarcity of investment capital and skilled manpower. Now South Africa enjoyed a vast capital inflow when this Government came into power, but slowly and surely Government policies so isolated us from the Western world that since 1955 we have had, on balance, a capital outflow which has necessarily slowed down our rate of development. One should imagine, if we had a capital inflow to-day, that the Minister would not find himself in the balance of payments difficulties he is in fact in. If he simply had the normal inflow of capital which a country with our potentialities under present world conditions justifies, he would have been better off, but the outside world has no confidence in the policies of this Government, and that is why we are partially in this difficulty. There is still a capital inflow to Canada and Australia, but why is there no capital inflow to South Africa? The quickest way, of course, for South Africa to increase its skilled manpower was by way of immigration from Europe, but here again the Government, immediately they came into power, put an end to the large-scale immigration scheme, and only in recent years has the Government relented, and the immigration during the past three years, of which hon. members opposite are justifiably proud, is to a large extent due to the fact that they have relented their immigration policy. We have been telling them for decades that far from immigration causing unemployment, it causes rapid economic growth, but that was rejected and only in the last couple of years have they had immigration again. The Government having precluded itself from obtaining large numbers of skilled workers from Europe because it stopped immigration, one would at least have expected that it would have followed educational policies to develop the skills of our population as rapidly as possible. But unfortunately the Minister&#x2019;s Budgets do not reflect it. Hon. members opposite will point to the greatly increased amounts for education, but in a dynamic society in the modern world the test should surely be whether the percentage of the nation&#x2019;s income spent on education is increasing or not. In a modern technological society, it is surely essential that the percentage of the national income spent on education should increase year by year. I think the Minister accepts that. It is certainly happening in all countries that are growing very rapidly, like Japan, America and Germany. If we look at South Africa we find that although the total sums spent on education have increased, as a percentage of the national income, they have decreased. That is really a most alarming state of affairs, because, as the Minister must be aware, for economic growth one does not need only physical investments, <span class="col_8631-8632" refersTo="page_1514"/>in goods and things, but one also needs investment in human beings to improve their skill, and I can only quote to the Minister, if he is not aware of this, what was published in the <i>Economic Journal</i> of September 1964, where they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has now become quite fashionable in America where they realize that economic growth is dependent on investment in things but also on investment in human beings.</block>

<p>It was put rather well by Professor Salour, who says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Less than half the increase in the productivity <i>per capita</i> and in real wages can be accounted for by the increase in capital itself&#x201D;.</block>

<p>He spoke about the increase in real income in America in recent years&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Considerably more than half of the increase in productivity seems to be attributable to technical change, scientific and engineering advance, to industrial improvements and to know-how and management methods and the educational training of labour.&#x201D;</block>

<p>In other words, capital intensification in a country&#x2019;s economy is not entirely responsible for the real wealth but you must also improve the skills of the people and you must educate them better. According to Professor Horwood&#x2019;s calculation in the same journal, although the total of central and provincial Government expenditure on education has increased from R66,500,000 in 1950 to R 162,900,000 in 1963, if these amounts are expressed as a percentage of the net geographical income of the country, there has actually been a decrease of from 3.25 per cent to 3 per cent in this period. Again, according to Maasdyk, &#x201C;Public Expenditure in South Africa&#x201D;, on page 226, it is calculated that the provincial Government expenditure on education between 1950 and 1963 has dropped from 2.4 per cent to 1.9 per cent of the gross national product. Here again we find that despite the fact that the country is getting richer and richer, under the policy of this Government the amount spent on education is declining as a percentage of the national income, and I say that the very reverse should happen. This explains why we are running into this skilled manpower crisis. That surely is not good enough for the times in which we live. If we only want to keep our economic place in the world, we shall have in future to spend vastly greater amounts on education. If we are to achieve the possible target set in our development programme, I go so far as to say that we will have to increase expenditure on the education of all the races very considerably. This is the way I think we should tackle our problem, but what is the Government&#x2019;s reaction to the present problems we have, the balance of payments problems and the rapid rise in the cost of living? I am afraid it is very largely a negative one. In effect, they say that the people have too much purchasing power and therefore they buy too many goods produced overseas, causing a balance of payments problem, and they are also buying too many South African goods causing prices to rise too rapidly. Therefore the Minister&#x2019;s policy is that we must reduce the purchasing power by deflationary policies, so that people will have less purchasing power. Having allowed the position to get out of hand, we readily admit on this side that some degree of deflation is necessary, but part of the excessive demand, as the hon. member for Constantia has pointed out, is due to the Government&#x2019;s own rapidly increasing expenditure. It is not only the private man who has too much purchasing power, but also the Government. After all, the Government is today responsible for very nearly one-quarter of all outlays in this country and we find that whilst the Minister is following a policy to decrease expenditure in the hands of the private sector of the economy he does nothing in his Budget to dampen down Government expenditure, which is rising all the time.</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>It is not quite as simple as that. The Minister and other speakers opposite always ask us what expenditure the Government must cut, but when they come to the private sector they do not ask us what expenditure must be cut. They just say you must cut it by so much per cent. It is not for the Opposition to say what work the Government must cut. They must cut their coat according to their cloth, and it is for the Government to decide what to do. After all, the Minister is the tailor. He says there is too much purchasing power in the country, but he is not going to cut the purchasing power of the Government, but only of the private sector. He does not ask us what must be cut as far as the private sector is concerned, but when it comes to the public sector, which is within the knowledge of the Government itself, they say they cannot cut that, and we must tell them what they must cut. Why I say this is a negative approach is because this problem need not only be tackled from the angle of demand. Surely the Minister can follow more active policies to make sure that the people produce more goods for local consumption and for export. He need not just say that we must cut down the demand; we can also approach it from the other angle and say that we must increase production. But there is very little in his policy to bring this about. Although they are the Government, they always ask us what they must do in a case like this, and I should like to tell the Minister. The immediate remedy would of course be for the Government to ease the restrictions on the better use of labour. By now they should have learned that this does not lead to unemployment <span class="col_8633-8634" refersTo="page_1515"/> among White workers but to better jobs and higher wages for them. But Government propaganda has so conditioned White workers to believe the opposite that I have no doubt they will have great difficulty in doing this. But I promise him, on behalf of this side, that we will not embarrass the Government as they always did when we were in Opposition, by ascertaining among White workers, when you try to advance non-White workers, that it is a threat to the White workers. And, further, I would suggest to the Minister what my leader suggested last year already. What this country needs more than anything else is a crash programme to train more skilled workers. It can be done. It was done in the war, and countries all over the world do it. There are new techniques of increasing skilled workers far more rapidly than by the traditional means.</p>

<p>Yes, but it is not done on a sufficient scale. Moreover, rather than deflate the economy too much, the Government should endeavour to raise greater amounts of capital overseas. Lastly, the Government should surely be more selective in its deflationary policies. Many of the people hit by it are the ones who gained least from the boom. The Minister argued yesterday that that was not true and that everyone has shared in this boom, including salaried workers and the farmers, but apparently the farmers are not aware of it themselves because they are leaving the land in their tens of thousands.</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>But does the Minister not realize that public salaries must bear some relation to private salaries? If he is going to keep them down for all time, what is going to happen? In this so-called White State our public servants will become Coloured; that is what will happen. The White public servants will leave, and inevitably the Government will have to replace them by Coloureds. It is silly to argue that the Government cannot raise wages. The Government is fighting inflation by credit restrictions and by resisting demands for increased wages in the public sector. To sum up, no attempt has been made to reduce Government expenditure. They simply claim it is impossible, although they say it is possible for the private sector to cut down. Furthermore, the Minister is not making sufficient attempts to increase production. The Minister should know that the country has been growing fast in the last decade. I am not glad that he went in for the stop-and-go policy, but one can also fight inflation by increasing production, as was done in countries like America and Japan. When the hon. member for Constantia read from the U.S.A. Budget to indicate what sort of policies they follow there, the Minister interjected and said that of course they have high unemployment in America and therefore they could follow these policies in order to try to increase production rather than dampening down demand, by cutting taxes. But of course our unemployment figure only compares well with America if we exclude three-quarters of our population and we do not take into account the large reserves of non-White labour that we have here. The Minister is always comparing the 5 per cent unemployment in America with our 1 per cent or li per cent, but does he not realize that our l| per cent only measures the registered unemployed and only really includes the Coloureds, Indians and Whites, whereas in America it is 5 per cent of the whole population? This country has as much scope for increasing employment as America has. Our unemployment figures are simply not comparable with those of America.</p>

<p>If the Minister realizes that our employment figure is not as serious as he thought, then he should think more of increasing production, rather than to cut down the demand. That is the point I am trying to make. I believe that policies such as those we on this side have outlined will again restore confidence in South Africa and then South Africa will again attract overseas capital as it did in the past. After all, our <span class="col_8635-8636" refersTo="page_1516"/>natural resources and the opportunities in South Africa in the year 1947-8 still drew R357,000,000, and those possibilities are still there.

<p>One feels sorry when one hears a person like the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), who is known outside this House as a good businessman and economist, make an extremely poor speech, such as that which he made to-day. I wonder whether the hon. member will concentrate more in the future upon advocating the same economic theories in this House which he advocates outside it? Let us take one of these points he raised, the flow of capital to this country. He said that as a result of the policy of this Government, there was no capital flowing into the country. The hon. member must not tell me that he wants South Africa always to remain a virtually underdeveloped country which has always to obtain its capital from outside. Why cannot we obtain sufficient capital here to become a capital-exporting country like Switzerland? Why cannot we invest capital abroad and obtain dividends thereon?. The hon. member knows very well that when foreign countries invest here they walk away with the cream and we are left with the skimmed milk. They enjoy all the dividends and the profits. The hon. member spoke about immigration. He wants to allow a large number of immigrants to enter the country. But South Africa is proud of her nation and of her own people. We must not lose our identity as a nation. We do not simply want to allow everyone to enter the country, the good and the bad, as they said at the time should be done. We want sufficient skilled workers who will assimilate with the people in this country.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question in regard to something which actually falls under the Provincial Council because the hospitals are their responsibility. I ask that in the future the various provinces follow the policy of providing free maternity facilities. It is actually the young people starting their families who in the initial stages find it difficult to pay expensive doctors&#x2019; and hospital accounts. Because the Government subsidizes the Provincial Council to such a large extent I feel that it is quite in order to ask that the provinces give attention to this matter.

<p>If we can apply this policy, we shall have a far stronger nation composed of people with a love for what is their own, people who will put South Africa first.</p>

<p>There is another point which I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister and this is in pursuance of representations made by the Financial Chamber of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut in regard to businessmen in the drought-stricken areas. It saddens us that certain areas are stricken by drought. The Opposition may accuse the Government of doing too little for certain sections of the population but they cannot blame us for not being able to make rain. The Government has brought great relief to the farmers in those areas by helping them with loans. The Government even went so far as to ask the banks to assist those farmers by not curtailing their credit. But we must also think of the farmers as consumers, and it is mainly the retailer in the rural areas who has to supply those farmers with credit. The assistance which the State gives the farmers is not something which they can use to pay their shop debts, to obtain the necessities of life and to pay off their arrear debts at the shops. That is why I want to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister, with a view to the fact that we now fortunately have a further surplus of R13,000,000, to consider some or other form of assistance for these retailers in these areas. We are quite sure that something will have to be done in this regard if the hon. the Minister gives his attention to the matter. Those people do not ask for something which cannot be justified and I am quite sure that both the Opposition and this side of the House will support me in this request. If we can give those dealers this assistance they in their turn will be able to help to ensure that the farmer remains on the farm. If the farmer remains on the farm and continues to produce, those of us who live in the cities will all benefit by this fact.</p>

<p>That is all I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister and I hope that something can be done in this connection.</p>

<p>We have had a number of interesting speeches this morning, particularly that by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). I am sorry that he is not here. He is somebody who usually delves fairly deeply into the political philosophy of the Nationalist Party. As I understood him this morning I think we can certainly expect the Nationalist Party shortly to bring about a radical change in their colour policy. I listened to the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister yesterday and I fitted it in with that of the hon. member for Kempton Park this morning. I came to the conclusion that the Nationalist Party, the Government, was stealing (if I may use this word not in its ugly meaning) the communal idea which the United Party has thought out and given to public opinion, without being prepared to accept all its implications. They are too scared, as far as public opinion is concerned, to carry that policy through to its logical conclusion.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that hon. member and his &#x201C;wishful thinking&#x201D; in a moment. Yesterday the hon. the Prime Minister said to us: &#x201C;I am going to give to the Coloureds as much as they can possibly expect as a minority group; I am going to give them their own Parliament and Cabinet and I am going to give them their first or chief Minister.&#x201D; The hon. the Prime Minister then stated the crux of the policy of the Nationalist Party; he said the first Minister of the Coloured Parliament would periodically&#x2014;say once a year for the sake of argument&#x2014;have the privilege of consulting the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs. In the absence of the hon. the Prime Minister I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance this morning whether he can put me right in regard to a small matter. In connection with what matters are they going to consult with the Coloureds? Are they going to have consultations in regard to defence? Are they going to be consulted in regard to foreign affairs; are they going to be consulted in regard to the question of national taxation? Are they going to consult the first Minister of the Coloureds in connection with job reservation which is hitting the Coloureds so hard? And if they are going to consult him are they going to listen to the Prime Minister of the Coloureds? Will the Prime Minister of the Coloureds have any influence over the Prime Minister of South Africa? If hon. members opposite say &#x201C;no&#x201D; what does the whole system mean? Over whose eyes is the Nationalist Party trying to pull wool with this so-called constitutional system which is nothing else than an administrative system which the hon. the Prime Minister is selling us as a new policy? The simple fact of the matter is this: The Nationalist Party has stolen a portion of United Party policy. They are not prepared to accept the consequences of it&#x2014;and that is the crucial point&#x2014;because I expect the Nationalist Party within the next five years to go to the country with the same kind of negrophilist propaganda we had ten and 20 years ago in South Africa, with this difference that the Coloureds of South Africa will be substituted for the Bantu in that propaganda. I think that will be one of the most reprehensible things ever to happen in South African politics.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants to know what I am moaning about. I will tell him: I am moaning about the fact that South Africa is in the hands of a Government party such as the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>I want to come to another matter. Against the background of the needs of my own constituency I think this parliamentary Session has been one of the most disappointing I have ever experienced. Mr. Speaker, my constituency is not the only one of its kind in South Africa. I have thousands of workers in my constituency. I know their circumstances and I know how they are living. Bearing the needs of those people in mind and bearing in mind the legislation that has gone through this House this Session, I say this has been one of the most disappointing sessions I have ever experienced.</p>

<p>Sir, if you go through your constituency and not sit here in a vacuum, it soon becomes clear to you what worries these people to-day. They are not worried about the Bantu or Coloured problem or about international affairs. The ordinary worker of South Africa, the railway worker, the post office worker, are worried about how he and his family are going to live. That is particularly the problem of the housewife. She puts the problem very simply: She simply says: &#x201C;Sir, how can I keep the pot boiling on the wage my husband earns; how can I pay the doctors&#x2019; bills; how can I pay my food account, my grocery account? How can I even think of sending my family on holiday?&#x201D; Those ordinary things which make a family happy no longer exist because the people do not have the money. Mr. Speaker, a great amount of economics has been dragged into this debate; numbers of problems have been raised and the economy of South Africa has been discussed at high level but let us return for a moment to the man in the street. How does he regard the position? The fundamental fact is this that during the past 12 months the cost of living has shot up to unprecedented heights in South Africa. By the way, it is quite interesting to note the intense interest of members on the Government side <span class="col_8639-8640" refersTo="page_1518"/>in the Bill which is before the House this morning, this Bill which fixed the tax which will be demanded from the people of South Africa during the next 12 months. Only a few Government members are present. Their absence indicates clearly to me to what extent they are interested in the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>But let us return to the housewife. What does she tell you? She says: &#x201C;Sir, I simply cannot make ends meet.&#x201D; A few weeks ago figures were quoted in this House which confirmed 100 per cent what I have just said. Figures were quoted that were confirmed by the Minister of Labour. I again want to place those figures on record this morning because I think they are of the utmost importance. Those figures reveal what I have already said, namely, that during the past 12 months the cost of living has reached unprecedented heights in South Africa and that neither the Government nor any other body has done anything to adjust salaries and wages to that cost of living. I maintain that they have done nothing about the present position. Let us look at the index figures, the adjusted average consumer price index figures. Bearing in mind that that figure was 100 in 1958 there has been an average annual increase over a period of six years, from 1958 to 1964, of 1.6 points. It is true that as far as food is concerned the rise has been less; that has only been 1.2 points per year. But what has happened during the past 12 months?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Are those points or percentages?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Points. What has happened over the past 12 months? I am now referring to consumer figures. Every item has increased from 107.9 points in March, 1964 to 112.1 points in March, 1965; in other words, there has been an increase of 4.2 points during this one year; and where the food index figure has been lower over the period of six years, the food index figures has risen by 8.2 points during the past 12 months. I repeat that these figures have been accepted by the Minister of Labour.</p>

<p>We talk about &#x201C;points&#x201D; but let us convert that into money. It is calculated that every point by which the cost of living rises during a year means R26; and calculated on the basis of a year, as things are going at the moment, it means that the purchasing power of the rand has decreased by R9 per month. I say again that this figure has been accepted as correct by the hon. the Minister of Labour. I ask any hon. member opposite to mention any group of people&#x2014;railway workers, post office workers, any group for that matter&#x2014;who has received a salary increase over the past 12 months in keeping with this increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the hon. Minister of Finance. He says that when the State increases the wages or salaries of public servants the private sector simply increase their salaries and you are exactly where you were. The hon. the Minister of Labour, on the other hand, says there is nothing the State can do and he wants to know why the private sector does not give the lead. The position is just the reverse. Sir, while we are listening to clever stories about the economy of South Africa in this House there are numbers of constituencies in South Africa in which the working people find it extremely difficult to make ends meet, working people who can never even think of taking a one-day holiday because they have not even got the money even to live decently.</p>

<p>When we on this side get up and talk about the working man in South Africa the other side of the House asks us why we are talking about the working man because there is no election in the offing. I challenge any member on that side of the House to tell me that there are not thousands of people in South Africa who are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet. If that is correct why do we never hear a single word from that side? Is it not the Nationalist Party who, over a period of 20 years, have been telling the people that they are the friend of the workers? What are they doing? They are sitting dead quiet. They talk in a bombastic way about Coloured affairs and about Bantu policy but when it comes to the real needs of the people of South Africa they sit dead quiet because they are afraid they may perhaps by accident utter some word of criticism which will confirm the attitude of the Opposition. That is their difficulty.</p>

<p>When we turn to the Government and ask them what they are doing when the people say to them &#x201C;our table is bare&#x201D; they fill that table with Coloured affairs; then they dish up Bantustans into the plates of the people and satisfy the people in that way. When the people ask for bread they are given a stone in the form of Coloured affairs. To take the analogy further <span class="col_8641-8642" refersTo="page_1519"/>when the people ask for fish they are given a snake.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, nobody can refute the statement that we are dealing with a matter of the utmost seriousness and that nothing is being done about it. The tragedy of the matter is that while thousands are living in this way there are numbers of people on that side of the House who are getting richer and richer. Numbers of workers are getting poorer and poorer and while that process is going on there are people in South Africa who are becoming millionaires . . .</p>

I repeat, that when we raise these matters the people are given a number of Bantustans or a little bit of colour policy and that is the end of the matter.</p>

<p>While we are on the subject let us examine for a moment the Bantustan policy of the Government. What has happened during the past number of years? The Nationalist Party has offered the people a policy which must keep them White; that is the guarantee which has been given to the people over the years. The policy they have formulated is based on two approaches: Firstly, history has played South Africa a dirty trick; instead of giving it only one White race it has given it a Coloured race as well as a Bantu race. The second approach of the Nationalist Party is this that no system has yet been evolved in the world under which those races can live in peace and harmony under one form of government. And that being the case the Nationalist Party say: We are going to reverse history. We are going to undo that which history has woven over the years in South Africa; we are going to unpick the blanket which has been woven from black, white and brown wool; we are going to pull out the brown threads and the black threads and we are still going to sell that blanket to the people of South Africa as a blanket. Even the hon. member for Kempton Park, who eloquently tells us about the philosophy of the Nationalist Party, even he. with his highly developed brain, sees fit to talk in this House about White South Africa as though that is something which really exists in South Africa. Surely that does not exist, Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>We now say this to the Nationalist Party: &#x201C;You have formulated your policy very well; you want to put history into reverse gear; you want to separate the nations, the races. You must now do three things: You must, firstly, prove to us that you are really separating those races.&#x201D; Sir, surely it is not necessary for me to reply to that question. Surely we know that the races are not being separated. Surely we know that there is less apartheid in Sonth Africa than ever before. Surely we know that even here in the Western Province, which was to have been the testing ground, the Bantu are still flowing in whereas the Tomlinson Report stated, as long ago as 1954, that the Bantu had to be removed. Surely we know what the position is throughout South Africa. We have had figures during the past few days to indicate how the numbers of Bantu are increasing in agriculture and in the urban areas. Facts prove that the Nationalist Party is not removing the Bantu from the so-called White areas. They are, therefore, not complying with the first requirement.</p>

<p>The second question is whether they can remove the Bantu? Again the reply is &#x201C;no&#x201D;, but I may be prejudiced. Let us look at the facts. Let us look at the percentage of Bantu employed in every industry in South Africa, from agriculture to secondary industry. The percentage of Bantu labourers in South Africa is such that I challenge anybody to prove to me, on the basis of reality, that it will ever be possible to reduce the number of Bantu in South Africa to fewer than the number of Whites in so-called White South Africa. And unless the Nationalist Party can do that its policy must fail. But even if I were to accept that the Nationalist Party can reduce the number of Bantu . . .</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member cannot answer the questions his policy poses; that is his difficulty. Even if we were to accept that the Government could remove the Bantu I still want to know whether they will be making South Africa safe by removing the Bantu from the so-called White areas. My reply to the Nationalist Party is &#x201C;no&#x201D;, because theirs is the first Government in South Africa which has deliberately, on purpose, and at the expense of the Whites, gone out of its way to cultivate Black nationalism amongst the Bantu. This is a Government which does not expect the Bantu to be loyal to South Africa; oh no, he must first be loyal to the Bantu. I predict that the day will arrive when the Bantu will weigh his loyalty to himself against his loyalty to South Africa and I predict that the day will arrive when he will stand by himself and leave South Africa in <span class="col_8643-8644" refersTo="page_1520"/>the lurch and that will mean the end of White South Africa. In my humble opinion the Government is playing with fire by cultivating a race consciousness amongst the Bantu and if anything should go wrong in future as a result of the development of the Bantustan idea, the Nationalist Party will be 100 per cent to blame; the Nationalist Party who is asking us to vote millions of rand in these Estimates, not to do anything good to the Bantu, but to carry out the Bantustan policy by cultivating Black nationalism and everything that it entails. I say one of the most dangerous things in South Africa is to vote money for that purpose.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite do not have to take this Bill to the Other Place this afternoon. If hon. members had stopped speaking at 12 o&#x2019;clock and had given me an opportunity to reply, I would have finished my reply at 20 minutes to one. But I think it is just as well for the hon. members for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) and Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) that I have limited time at my disposal. But even in this short time at my disposal it will not be difficult to expose the fallacies in the arguments advanced by those two hon. members. I cannot give all the examples but I will give specific examples to show how they misrepresent the facts. The hon. member for Jeppes said that a larger labour force would lead to larger production and larger exports, and he pointed out that I had said that even if we had unlimited manpower, we would have run into balance of payments difficulties. In theory that is perfectly true . . .</p>

<p>In theory that is perfectly true but it is more likely in practice that an increased labour force would lead in the short-term to a relatively greater demand for imports and greater expenditure on consumer and capital goods.

<p>The hon. member apparently criticized me for having tried to stimulate industry when it was in the doldrums in 1962 and 1963. He apparently finds fault with the fact that in 1964 I said that no further stimulation was necessary but that it was not necessary yet to apply the brake, and apparently he finds fault in 1965 with the fact that I have said that the emphasis must now fall on a policy of stability rather than growth. Apparently that is all wrong; he says that is &#x201C;stop-go&#x201D;, but unless we are based on an economy which is state-controlled, the Government cannot do more than we have done to create the necessary climate, where necessary, for economic expansion and, where necessary, for a policy of neutralism and, if necessary, a policy of applying the brake, Sir, the hon. member has given me some advice. I can only say that if this side had followed the advice given by the hon. member and his colleagues in the past few years, I wonder where South Africa would have been to-day. Only last year they asked us to pump an additional R50,000,000 into the spending stream; now they claim that there is excessive credit and that we ought to have stopped it earlier. This year, in spite of the fact that they say that there is excessive credit, they have again asked that we pump an additional R22,500,000 into the spending stream. If the United Party had been in power, or if I had followed the advice coming from that side of the House, we would have been in the throes of a balance of payments crisis; our reserves would have dropped very much lower than they were in 1961 and we would have been in the grip of an inflationary pressure from which it would have been very difficult to escape.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland made a speech here which was typical of the tactics of the United Party over the past number of years. Their desire has been to exploit grievances, to create grievances; that policy of theirs has had disastrous effects for them but apparently they have not yet learnt their lesson. Sir, I just want to repeat that this Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to wages and salaries is that adjustments have taken place and will have to take place from <span class="col_8645-8646" refersTo="page_1521"/>time to time, but what we are against is excessive increases in salaries or wages, because the result of that would be self-destructive. All the advantages which would accrue to the wage-earner from a rise in wages would be counteracted and wiped out completely by the rise in prices. If we want to encourage inflation, that is the way to go about it. That does not mean, however, that reasonable demands will not be met. We have never been able to compete with private enterprise. We have always said, and we say to-day, that if, in order to compete with the private sector, you increase salaries, the private sector will simply raise them higher. That is not the way in which you retain the services of your employees. Sir, I do not want to deal further with these two points. I want to come back to the general pattern which has been revealed clearly in this debate, particularly by the hon. member for Yeoville who, whenever the other side has virtually been slaughtered in the debate, has to come and pick up the bits and pieces and try to put Humpty-Dumpty together again. Sir, it came out very clearly in the course of his speech that the hon. member and his Party are so obsessed with the desire to find fault with the Government, with the desire to criticize everything that the Government does, that it has no time and makes no attempt to find a consistent policy of its own, to frame a message which will be an inspiration to the people of South Africa, a message with which they can go to the country with better results than they have had in the past. Sir, the results of the provincial elections shook the United Party temporarily out of its self-complacence I think it created a certain amount of doubt in their minds about the efficacy of their political philosophy that they must always find fault and criticize; that that is the sole role of an Opposition. They have nothing positive to put to the country. They think that their sole function is to criticize and to find fault that is what we have again had here to-day. These provincial elections results caused some concern, a kind of awareness, in the United Party ranks that something was rotten in the State of the United Party. But unfortunately that was only a temporary realization of realities. All that was done to try to improve the position was a kind of mild purge of some old stalwarts. But that was not sufficient; what was necessary&#x2014;had the United Party had the courage to carry it out&#x2014;was not a mild purge of personnel but a major surgical operation on their policy. If they wanted to improve their image they would have had to make a deep incision into their policy and cut out all the cancerous growth inside, all that rottenness, and graft on it some healthy policy, a policy which would appeal to the people of South Africa. When they were faced with this last test they thought a little superficial dressing would be sufficient to meet the demands to stop this political gangrene in the United Party. This is the political gangrene: Let me just give the figures: In 1948 the United Party had 65 representatives in the House of Assembly; in 1953 they had 57; in 1958 they had 53; in 1961 they had 49. They have fallen from 65 to 49 and the National Party has grown from 70 to 105. The hon. member talked about the depreciation of our currency but I think the depreciation in the United Party, when we also take the recent Provincial Council election into account, has been much more.</p>

<p>Let us just for a moment ponder this interesting thought: What is the United Party&#x2019;s political future if it shirks this major surgical operation? What is it going to be? When I look at hon. members opposite, it is obvious that, in this respect, they are like Micawber waiting for something to turn up, some <i>Deus ex machina,</i> which will transpose them to the Government seats. The ordinary way they have tried since 1948 has not succeeded. It has brought them defeat after defeat. Now they have to sit back and hope&#x2014;it is their only hope&#x2014;that something will turn up, something like manna from Heaven, to remove them from that side and transpose them to this side. The interesting thing is this&#x2014;I was talking of Micawber&#x2014;that when they are dealing with the Government they are not a Micawber but an inverted Micawber&#x2014;always waiting for something to turn down. They are always trying to criticize; they think that is the sole function of an Opposition. Here are the results of that policy over the last 17 years. I tell them again that, if they want to get other results, they have to see to it that a major surgical operation is performed, and that the gangrene in their policy is out out.</p>

I may say that Hansard is even more important to the Opposition than to the Government. For the Government they record what has been decided; for us they record the mistakes the Government has made. I may say that over the years our admiration has been unbounded for the accuracy with which Hansard has contrived to report what has been said and the most remarkable manner in which they have made into grammatical sentences some of the things that have been said here. I believe that any successors of Hansard will have a very high standard to live up to and a very high tradition to maintain.
