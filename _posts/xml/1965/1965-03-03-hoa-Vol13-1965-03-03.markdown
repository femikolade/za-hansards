<debateSection name="#introduction">

<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>

<p>After three years of continued expansion at a relatively rapid tempo, the national economy is still thriving. The growth rate during 1964 remained high but did not reach the ceiling of the previous year. The cumulative effect of this sustained upsurge was prominently reflected in the unprecedented transport demands which, at times, severely taxed the resources of the country&#x2019;s national transport undertaking.</p>

<p>The volume of traffic offered for conveyance by rail, road and air during 1964 surpassed all previous records and fully justified the heavy expenditure incurred during recent years in modernizing and expanding railway equipment and facilities. Nevertheless, the year under review was a testing one. The Administration had to labour under limitations imposed by factors beyond its control. There were adverse weather conditions, a long and severe winter and exceptional snowfalls in wide areas which disrupted communications and brought some services to a standstill for days. In addition, the Administration has had to contend with a growing decline in the ranks of its professional men and other staff in certain key posts.</p>

<p>Despite the handicaps I have mentioned, the achievements of the Railways and its associated services have been substantial, and from an economic and financial point of view, the South African Railways has had one of the best years in its history.</p>

<heading>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</heading>

<p>The economic outlook augurs well for the future. The sustained activity in the industrial and commercial sectors bears testimony to unwavering confidence in the country&#x2019;s economic future.</p>

<p>In its report on a survey in which private enterprise participated, the Bureau of Economic Research of Stellenbosch University indicates that while business conditions in South Africa are still buoyant, last year&#x2019;s rate of expansion is not likely to be maintained. The growing shortage of skilled labour, rising labour costs, the high utilization of plant capacity and lengthening periods required for the delivery of manufactured goods, are regarded as visible restraining factors.</p>

<p>The present private, public and Government development programmes are, however, bound to continue to act as powerful stimuli in all sectors producing consumer and capital goods.</p>

<p>Exports generally are expected to continue the upward trend in keeping with the active efforts to explore overseas markets. Imports, on the contrary, are expected to show a gradual tapering off in sympathy with the <span class="col_2111-2112" refersTo="page_1070"/>anticipated slow-down in the economic growth rate.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#forward_planning">

<heading>FORWARD PLANNING</heading>

<p>I should now like to inform the House of the Administration&#x2019;s plans for the future.</p>

<p>The expansion of Amcor and the commencement of pig-iron exports to Japan, the steep rise in imports, the phenomenal increase in export fruit, the record sales of motor vehicles which proved a feature of the year, and the overall expansion in the country&#x2019;s economy, created unprecedented transport demands. These could not have been met by the Railways had it not been for the Administration&#x2019;s vigilance in planning for the future.</p>

<p>I know that there has been criticism, but the critics are apt to forget that when it comes to planning for future railway requirements, the Administration cannot wave the magic wand. Planning must be on a realistic basis, with full regard to projected developments and accurately-assessed trends. Future requirements have to be calculated on the basis of average demands and cannot be planned to satisfy traffic peaks without regard to valley periods. Major projects take time to complete and the shortage of skilled manpower and certain types of material retard manufacturing and construction programmes, irrespective of whether they are undertaken departmentally or given out on contract. In many cases the rate of progress is dictated by the rate of supply from private enterprise.</p>

<p>I shall not burden the House with details of all major improvements already sanctioned. Hon. members know that these include a heavy programme of electrification extensions, the most important of which are from Klerksdorp to Kimberley and Witbank to Komatipoort, the building of the pipeline from Durban to Johannesburg, the construction of six new railway lines, the doubling of sections of the Cape and Natal main lines, the lengthening of loops, the opening of a number of new stations, the building of a new grain elevator at East London to be completed by March, 1966, the construction of a tanker harbour at Cape Town and certain improvements and extensions to Durban harbour. Several of these schemes have been completed and the remainder are progressing according to schedule.</p>

<p>In regard to the future, Parliament recently approved the construction of two new railway lines, viz. the one from Chiselhurst to East London harbour, <i>inter alia</i>, to facilitate the transport of export maize and a guaranteed line from Kensington to the new Fisons project at Montague Gardens. Several new projects are proposed. The section of line between Cambridge outside East London and Blaney where the Cookhouse line branches off, a distance of 26 miles, requires to be doubled to cater for maize exports and Parliament will also be asked to sanction funds to electrify the line from Glencoe through Vryheid to Hlobane to serve the expanding coal, coke and anthracite fields in that area.</p>

<p>A survey is being made of a new electrified line from Vryheid to a point near Empangeni on the Natal North Coast line to serve as a much-needed alternative route for the Natal main line. This line will facilitate the transport of coal and anthracite to Durban and provide a through line for timber and other traffic from the Eastern Transvaal.</p>

<p>Increased sugar and timber traffic on the North Coast line now justifies the extension of electrification from Duff&#x2019;s Road to Mandini, and later to the junction of the proposed new Vryheid line, which I have already mentioned, to coincide with the link-up of that line with the North Coast line.</p>

<p>The capacity of the Selati line in the Eastern Transvaal will also be inadequate to meet future requirements arising from developments at Phalaborwa, and it is proposed to deviate this line to bypass the Game Reserve and to connect with the main line between Nelspruit and Komatipoort. Until this deviation is completed use is to be made of diesel traction.</p>

<p>Increased line capacity will also be required between De Dooms and Touws River, and it is now appropriate to recommence the Hex River tunnel project. This scheme incorporates a new single electrified line which will be used in conjunction with the existing electrified line. The very important line between Kamfersdam and Postmasburg is being electrified to cater for the increasing ore traffic. The electrified section of the main line between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom is reaching maximum capacity, particularly on account of increased ore traffic destined for Amcor and Iscor, and is to be doubled.</p>

<p>On the Natal South Coast the traffic growth and potential have also necessitated a review of the present form of traction, and Parliament is being asked to sanction the electrification of the section from Reunion to Kelso junction.</p>

<p>In addition to these specific projects, provision is being made for the carrying capacity of various other sections of line to be increased by the remodelling of station yards, the opening of additional stations, the provision of new crossing facilities, the improvement of gradients and the easing of curves.</p>

<p>With the country&#x2019;s huge reserves of coal and the relatively low pit-head costs, available steam traction will continue over certain sections for many years. Where the traffic density is high, however, electric traction, although involving higher capital cost on overhead and associated equipment, has proved more efficient and economic. Diesel traction is an effective substitute for steam because of the versatility and higher tractive effort of diesel locomotives when used in series, with the added advantage that single unit crews only are required. The oil position in this country, however, makes the general use of diesel traction inadvisable.</p>

<p>By the end of 1964, 22 per cent of the total rail network had been electrified, but 36 per cent of goods and 53 per cent of passenger and mixed train mileage was already being <span class="col_2113-2114" refersTo="page_1071"/>operated by means of electric traction. With the present electrification programme it will not be long before this form of traction will be employed for more than half of the total ton miles.</p>

<p>Hon. Members, and particularly those from Natal, will be interested to know that a coordinating committee consisting of representatives of the Railways and the Corporation of Durban has been appointed to facilitate the planning of a new station to be built at Durban.</p>

<p>In regard to the harbours, construction works are in progress at Luderitz and major improvements have been planned for Cape Town and Durban. At Table Bay Harbour the berthage on the western side of the Collier Jetty is to be deepened to facilitate the loading of maize, and the Elbow Berth is to be widened and equipped with a new cargo shed and rail facilities to cater for the increase in coaster traffic.</p>

<p>Apart from these immediate improvements, the indications are that additional commercial berthage will be required at Table Bay Harbour. Lack of space for railway lines and shunting yards precludes further extensions in the Duncan Basin, but a new layout on the seaward side of the tanker harbour comprising several piers with shed and rail connections is being planned on a long-term basis. The scheme will be carried out in stages, and provision is being made in the estimates of expenditure on capital and betterment works for 1965-6 for a commencement with the preliminary investigation work.</p>

<p>At Durban harbour four new piers are to be provided in the central area of the bay. The work will be commenced this year and the project will be carried out in co-ordinated stages to permit of the new facilities being taken into use as the work progresses. The first new berth and cargo shed are expected to be in use during the second half of 1967, and by the end of 1970 the first new pier, providing seven berths with four cargo sheds, will be fully operational.</p>

<p>Tractive power and rolling-stock requirements are continually reviewed. Altogether 200 electric locomotives are on order of which 41 are already in service. The balance will be in service by the end of next year. In addition, 65 diesel-electric locomotives are being acquired and will be in service by the end of 1965. Provision is also being made for a further 225 electric locomotives, five narrow-gauge steam locomotives, and 20 additional diesel-electric locomotives. The latter are required for the anticipated increase in traffic on the Eastern Transvaal System, mainly as a result of the development at Phalaborwa.</p>

<p>Goods-wagon stock has been increased by the equivalent of almost 19,000 short trucks during the past three years. A total of 9,493 bogie and 5,020 short trucks is at present on order, and of these 3,847 bogies and 1,720 shorts are expected to be in service by the end of this month. The remainder will be in service by September 1966. Orders for a further 600 bogies and 100 shorts will be placed shortly. The estimates of expenditure for 1965-6 make provision for a further 6,816 bogie trucks, of which 1,000 are already on order, 1,100 short trucks and 500 narrow-gauge trucks.</p>

<p>As regards passenger vehicles, main-line stock has been augmented by 96 and suburban electric stock by 400 vehicles during the past three years. A total of 200 main-line passenger parcels vans and 20 passenger and baggage vans, plus 393 suburban electric vehicles, are currently on order. Of the latter, 117 are already in service and the remainder, plus the main-line stock, will be in service by September 1966. Orders will be placed during the course of the next few months for 10 air-conditioned dining saloons, 10 kitchen and staff saloons, 85 suburban electric motor coaches, 22 electric driving trailers and 205 plain trailers. In addition, provision is being made for a further 293 suburban electric vehicles of various types, 50 second-class mainline saloons and 30 air-conditioned main-line saloons comprising two sets of 15 each for a new Blue Train.</p>

<heading>THE PAST YEAR&#x2019;S PERFORMANCE</heading>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall now give a brief account of the past year&#x2019;s performance. I do not wish to go into great detail and shall confine my remarks to goods, passenger, harbour, road transport and air services and the activities of the Stores Department where these are of general interest from a transport and commercial point of view. Thereafter I shall briefly comment on the report of the Schumann Committee, report progress on the pipeline project, outline the position regarding manpower and productivity, and finally I shall deal with the financial position.</p>

<p><i>Goods traffic</i></p>

<p>Concerning goods traffic, the sustained economic expansion was clearly reflected in the overall increase in this type of traffic during the year. Revenue-earning goods traffic conveyed during the first eight months of the year amounted to 61,600,000 tons, representing an advance of 4.3 per cent over the figure for the same period of the previous year. By the end of this month the gross tonnage of revenue-earning and free-hauled traffic is expected to eclipse the previous year&#x2019;s record of 99,200,000 tons by approximately 5,000,000 tons of which 3,500,000 tons will be revenue-earning goods and the balance coal and livestock.</p>

<p>Owing to drought conditions, the tonnages of maize handled during the first eight months of the current financial year declined considerably. This decrease was, however, more than offset by notable increases in the volume of industrial and mineral products. The overall increase in the volume of goods traffic handled during the period April-December of the current financial year, expressed in short-truck loads, amounted to almost 321,000 units, <span class="col_2115-2116" refersTo="page_1072"/>or 5.9 per cent more than during the same period in 1963.</p>

<p>The outstanding feature of the year has been the steep rise in the tonnage of fruit, sugar and building materials transported during the first eight months. Compared with the same period in 1963, fruit traffic increased by 12 per cent, sugar by 8 per cent and building materials by 15 per cent.</p>

<p>Petrol and fuel-oil traffic conveyed during the period April-December 1964 showed an increase of nearly 12 per cent compared with the same period in 1963. At times the demand for tank trucks has called for special measures to ensure equitable distribution and optimum utilization.</p>

<p>The rising demand for manganese, chrome and iron ore, both for local consumption and for export, has resulted in an appreciable increase in the flow of ore traffic from the mines to local consumption points and to Port Elizabeth, the export harbour.</p>

<p>The volume of livestock traffic remained more or less on the same level during the first eight months of the year. The total ton-miles in respect of this class of traffic, however, decreased by 9 per cent, due mainly to the conveyance of drought-stricken stock over relatively short distances.</p>

<p>Coal traffic increased by almost 5 per cent and proved the bugbear of the year, particularly during July last year when extreme weather conditions retarded the flow of rail traffic and the unprecedented demand exceeded the available supplies at some centres.</p>

<p>It is pertinent at this stage to mention that material concessions have been made to private hauliers, who have long clamoured for a bigger share in the country&#x2019;s transport business. The restriction on the movement by road of a wide range of commodities, including coal, coke, sugar cane and fresh fruit and vegetables, has been lifted altogether as a permanent measure, and the areas within which many other commodities may be hauled by road have been extended. Private enterprise has been advised to make use of private road hauliers to satisfy some of its transport needs, and, if the timeous advice given during October last year is heeded in regard to coal, there should be no reason for anxiety over the coming winter.</p>

<p><i>Parcels and express-goods traffic</i></p>

<p>The upward trend in the volume of parcels traffic is still continuing and express goods increased by 44 per cent. Express-goods services have now also been introduced between Cape Town and Windhoek and Cape Town and Bloemfontein.</p>

<p><i>Passenger services</i></p>

<p>In so far as passenger services are concerned, long-distance passenger journeys increased, but the figures in respect of first- and second-class passengers still show a downward tendency. During the period April-November 1964 suburban journeys increased by almost 13 percent to 265,300,000, long-distance journeys by 7 per cent to 16,200,000 and the gross total by 12 per cent to 281,500,000. These increases were mainly due to the growth in the number of third-class passengers.</p>

<p>The usual seasonal demand for long-distance accommodation was particularly heavy last year. The end of the first school term in the Cape, Natal, Transvaal and South West Africa coincided with the Easter week-end and. in order to accommodate the scholars as well as the ordinary passengers, 135 special passenger trains were run, compared with 102 during the previous Easter week-end. Passenger traffic during the December/January holidays exceeded all previous records and necessitated the running of no less than 362 special trains during December and 271 during January.</p>

<p><i>Harbours</i></p>

<p>As in the case of rail traffic, the volume of cargo handled in the harbours reached record proportions during the year. Cargo landed during the period April to December 1964 increased by 2,700,000 tons, or almost 30 per cent, over the tonnage for the corresponding period last year. Cargo shipped advanced by 6 per cent, notwithstanding the sharp decline in maize exports. The density of shipping traffic which called at the harbours of the Republic and South West Africa during the first seven months of the current financial year is clearly illustrated by the fact that the number of foreign-going vessels and coasters increased by 450 to 5,636.</p>

<p>A high level of performance in harbour working was maintained throughout the year, but unfortunately delays to shipping did occur owing to congestion at certain harbours, particularly at Durban and to a lesser extent at Table Bay Harbour. This was due to a variety of factors such as staff shortages, exceptionally adverse weather conditions which, at times, made it necessary to suspend landing and shipping operations, the dislocation of harbours on the East Coast which led to the transhipment of cargo at Durban, and the influx of foreign trawlers which occupied considerable commercial berthage in Table Bay Harbour to discharge catches.</p>

<p>Special measures to alleviate the position at Durban included the secondment of staff from other centres, the diversion of ships to harbours in the Republic where spare capacity is available, and the restriction of entry into the harbour of ships carrying tranship cargo only.</p>

<p><i>Road Transport Service</i></p>

<p>The Road Transport Services shared in the general prosperity and had a successful year. During the first eight months of the financial year these services carried 2.5 per cent more goods and 6 per cent more passengers than during the corresponding period last year. The increase in passengers, particularly those travelling first class, is encouraging and in contrast to the decline in previous years.</p>

<p><span class="col_2117-2118" refersTo="page_1073"/>Cartage services have been hard pressed to handle the increasing volume of traffic. The severe shortage of drivers, particularly at Kaserne, and skilled manpower for plant maintenance is proving a problem, and the possibility of allowing private enterprise to take over some of these services is being considered.</p>

<p>The efficacy of the cartage services should not be judged by the difficulties experienced at large centres such as Johannesburg. Rail services operate round the clock seven days a week, but commercial houses mostly observe a five-day week and accept cartage deliveries only during normal business hours. In addition, cartage deliveries are subject to various restrictions imposed by local authorities, and, like other vehicles using public streets and highways, cartage vehicles suffer delays from traffic congestion and parking restrictions.</p>

<p>As I intimated last year, a commission is being appointed to investigate the desirability of a thorough study of the machinery and measures required to ensure the efficient coordination of transport in South Africa. I expect to announce the names of the members and the terms of reference of the commission shortly.</p>

<p><i>South African Airways</i></p>

<p>The high quality and efficiency which have always been the hallmark of the South African Airways have been maintained and the operating results of this service again provided one of the highlights of the year. Any doubts that may have existed about passenger reaction to the switch to the West Coast route were dispelled by the results of the first year of flying round the bulge. The second year on the western route has been even more successful.</p>

<p>During the first nine months of the present financial year passengers carried by South African Airways to destinations in Europe advanced by 23.4 per cent, while in the reverse direction the increase of 35.7 per cent was even more spectacular. The reason for the large increase in southbound traffic is, of course, partly due to the number of immigrants who travelled by air.</p>

<p>South Africans are becoming progressively more air-minded as is indicated by the density of domestic air traffic. For the second successive year South African Airways will carry more than 500,000 passengers in a 12-month period. All the routes operated reflect passenger increases. Even on the regional service the development is highly satisfactory. Between the Republic and Rhodesia the increase this year is 17.2 per cent, while on the Mozambique run the advance is no less than 20.8 per cent.</p>

<p>The healthy economic position of the country is reflected in the growth by 21.7 per cent in passenger traffic on standard-class services during the first nine months of the current financial year. Skycoach traffic has advanced by 10.7 per cent.</p>

<p>In the year ahead there will be a substantial change in the pattern of air travel in South Africa. The first of the new Boeing 727 jet aircraft will be delivered in June, and as soon as the necessary air-crew training has been completed these new aircraft will be placed in service. The first of these is likely to be in the air in August, 1965. The Viscounts, which have given such reliable service during the past ten years, will then be used on the Skycoach services in the Republic and South West Africa.</p>

<p>The high growth rate in air traffic on the routes operated by South African Airways has led to the decision to purchase a fifth Boeing 707 at an approximate cost of R5,000,000.</p>

<p><i>Stores</i></p>

<p>The importance of the South African Railways to the commercial community, not only as a carrier but also as a customer, is underlined by the high turnover of the Stores Department. There has been a steady upward trend in consumption by departments, and the first nine months of the financial year saw a steep rise of R14,200,000 in the value of total stores issues, which advanced from R120,600,000 in respect of the same period in 1963 to R134,800,000. This large increase is due to higher consumption as the result of the expansion of practically all services and to the increased cost of many commodities.</p>

<p>The Administration is persisting with its policy of buying in South Africa wherever practicable and, under the direct encouragement of railway buying, new enterprises have been founded in the Republic and many existing ones have been expanded.</p>

<p>As an indication of what railway buying means to South African business, I may mention that the value of materials actually produced in the Republic and purchased during the financial year 1963-4 increased by nearly R30,000,000 to R138,000,000. The total value of all stores purchased during 1963-4 was R165,500,000.</p>

<p><i>Schumann Committee&#x2019;s Report</i></p>

<p>Regarding the Schumann Committee&#x2019;s report, I have already mentioned that a commission is being appointed to investigate the co-ordination of the various forms of transport in the Republic and South West Africa as recommended by that committee. In so far as the other recommendations are concerned, organized commerce and industry urged that the Administration&#x2019;s decision be held in abeyance until they have had an opportunity of analyzing the report and submitting their views. Extensions were permitted until December 1964 and the observations received are now being studied.</p>

<p><i>Oil pipeline</i></p>

<p>In terms of my undertaking to keep the House informed of the progress with the construction of the pipeline from Durban to the Witwatersrand. I wish to inform hon. members <span class="col_2119-2120" refersTo="page_1074"/>that most of the contracts for the supply of the materials and equipment for and the construction of the pipeline and its adjuncts have been let. By the end of this month approximately 75 per cent of the piping will have been delivered and about 40 per cent of the pipe-laying completed. Good progress is being made and the pipeline is expected to be fully operational by January 1966.</p>

<p><i>Manpower and productivity</i></p>

<p>In so far as manpower is concerned, the Administration&#x2019;s staff position deteriorated during the past year, but it was possible to maintain a reasonable balance as a result of increased productivity. The state of almost full employment which has existed for several years, and the continuing industrial expansion, have created a highly competitive labour market and it is understandable, therefore, that less congenial jobs will go abegging. The shortage of staff in the less-popular grades such as shunter, motor driver, steward, checker, station foreman, guard, fireman and certain artisan grades is assuming embarrassing proportions. Had it not been for the cushioning effect of increased productivity as a result of the modernization of equipment and facilities, mechanization, and improved and more intensive staff training, the position would have been more serious.</p>

<p>The authorized establishment for European staff includes 101,200 graded posts for adults, and in this category alone there are at present 7,500 vacancies. The fact that it was nevertheless possible to move more traffic than ever before is irrefutable proof of a high level of productivity and a sustained effort on the part of the staff. This is also clearly illustrated by the fact that the total staff complement increased by only 2.6 per cent during the past three years while the tonnage of traffic handled has advanced by almost 15 per cent.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, a matter of great satisfaction that it was possible during the year to make concessions to the value of almost R12,000,000 per annum to the staff. These included a holiday bonus to European and Coloured staff, a wage increase for Coloured servants, higher commencing rates for Indian and Bantu servants, and improved overtime and Sunday time rates for White staff. As in private enterprise and in other State Departments, however, certain sections of the staff are pressing for further concessions and a review of their grading.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#financial_review">

<heading>FINANCIAL REVIEW</heading>

<p>I come now to the financial review.</p>

<p>Throughout 1963-4 revenue from low-rated traffic exceeded high-rated earnings, and at the close of that year I stated in my Budget speech that in view of this trend the estimate for goods revenue for 1964-5 was being framed conservatively.</p>

<p>As a direct result of the large increase in both fixed capital outlays and consumer spending, however, imports have risen strongly, and by the end of December 1964 the total value exceeded the previous year&#x2019;s figure by more than 25 per cent. Imports comprise a large proportion of high-rated commodities, and this feature, aided by the phenomenal growth in building activity and the high tempo of industrial production internally, has increased goods revenue for the year considerably.</p>

<p>Against this, the agricultural sector suffered from the effects of abnormally bad weather conditions. The anticipated bumper maize crop did not eventuate, and drought seriously affected cattle and sheep farming areas and lowered the wool clip. Frosts also inflicted much damage on the vegetable output of the Eastern Transvaal lowveld area. These conditions influenced railway earnings as a whole, but the most significant feature has been the lower percentage of revenue contributed by low-rated goods traffic.</p>

<p>Overall, the total volume of revenue-earning goods traffic has exceeded our expectations, so that despite all our operating problems the target of an additional 3,500,000 tons has been more than achieved. Due to the predominance of high-rated traffic, however, actual revenue receipts are substantially higher than the estimate.</p>

<p>The proportions which freight is now assuming has rendered it possible thus far to operate economically on a reduced margin of profitability per unit of goods conveyed. This is borne out by the fact that the revenue per ton mile for practically every high-rated class of commodity, and indeed most low-rated classes also, has each successive month shown a reduction on the previous year&#x2019;s figure. At the same time the average distance conveyed is lengthening in the case of many classes of goods, and the obvious inference is that a steadily increasing proportion of short-distance traffic is being conveyed other than by rail.</p>

<p>There are definite limits to the extent that the Railways can afford to lose profitable traffic to the road. The heavy tonnages the Railways are now being called upon to carry are clearly increasing the cost of making good the wear and tear of both rolling-stock and fixed assets, and expenditure on maintenance has risen more steeply than operating and traffic costs. We have managed meanwhile to keep the increase in expenditure below the increase in revenue, but in the face of rising costs any unfavourable turn in revenue trends assumes particular significance.</p>

<p>Even though the rate of growth has not been maintained at the same level as 1963-4, revenue from all services, viz., Railways, Harbours and Airways, nevertheless exceeded the respective estimates throughout the year now drawing to a close.</p>

<p><i>Goods</i></p>

<p>Of the R12,000,000 (6.09 per cent) increase in goods revenue during the period April-November 1964, merchandise showed the greatest advance on the previous year&#x2019;s figure, viz., R7,600,000, or nearly 10 per cent. Ores <span class="col_2121-2122" refersTo="page_1075"/>and minerals rose by over R2,900,000 (12 per cent) and building materials by nearly R1,800,000 (19 per cent). We expect that by the time the year ends, goods revenue will be R16,800,000 higher than the originally budgetted figure of R294,000,000. Revenue from coal traffic exceeds the estimate by R871,000 as at the end of December 1964, and we expect that this will improve still further by the end of the 1964-5 financial year.</p>

<p><i>Passengers</i></p>

<p>With regard to passenger traffic, suburban rail travel has maintained its vigorous growth. The revenue from 1st and 2nd class for the period April-November has increased by 6.9 per cent and earnings from the non-White lines by over 12 per cent.</p>

<p>Whilst the revenue from 1st and 2nd class main-line passengers during the first eight months of the year was slightly higher than in the period April-November 1963, the trend indicates that the earnings from that source for the full 12 months will be below the total for 1963-4. Main-line passenger revenue as a whole, however, should exceed the figure for the previous year by 2 per cent.</p>

<p>It is significant that the average revenue, and thus the average distance, per main-line journey, both for 1st and 2nd class, has exhibited a consistent rise over the past five years, which is also an indication that over the shorter distances rail travel, other than commuter traffic, is yielding to the motor.</p>

<p>Total revenue from passengers is now estimated at R55,859,000 or R2,830,000 more than in 1963-4.</p>

<p><i>Road Transport</i></p>

<p>Except for livestock and cream, which were adversely affected by the severe drought, there has been an increase in all classes of road transport traffic, and despite increased costs, the service is expected to show a loss of only R42,000 in comparison with the deficit of over R693,000 last year. This is the best achievement of the past five years.</p>

<p><i>Harbours</i></p>

<p>The most striking feature of harbour revenue has been the increase in respect of petroleum products received and despatched. The quantity discharged from tankers rose from 3,700,000 tons in April-December 1963, to 5,900,000 tons this year, whilst shipments increased from 700,000 to 1,900,00 tons. Imports generally have been particularly heavy, and as a result harbour earnings are nearly R3,500,000 higher than for the corresponding period of 1963-4.</p>

<p><i>Airways</i></p>

<p>S.A. Airways continue to be well patronized on the internal, regional and overseas services, and have thus also fared well. Up to the end of December 1964, revenue had exceeded last year&#x2019;s figure by nearly R1,900,000. The anticipated deficit of R326,000 is now expected to be converted into a surplus of over R2,000,000.</p>

<debateSection name="#forecast_for_1965-6">

<heading>FORECAST FOR 1965-6</heading>

<p></p>

<p><i>Revenue</i></p>

<p>Dealing now with the prospects for the year 1965-6, whilst the South African economy is enjoying great prosperity and is still in an expansion phase of the business cycle, the rate of increase of certain national economic indicators during the concluding months of the year has tended to decline; the Bureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch, in its annual survey of economic conditions and prospects, indicates that the increase in the net domestic product of the country which was approximately 10.6 per cent for the year ended 30 June 1964, is estimated at 7.7 per cent for the year ending 30 June 1965.</p>

<p>This trend is also evident in goods earnings. Throughout the year 1963-4 the increase over the figure for corresponding periods of the previous year was of the order of 13 per cent, but during the current financial year it has averaged about 6 per cent, with a slight tendency to fall.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that, whilst no setback is expected, the tempo of development will not continue at the present level.</p>

<p><i>Goods</i></p>

<p>In the agricultural sector, the maize crop&#x2014;subject again to the uncertainties of the weather&#x2014;holds out the prospect of heavy railings for internal and export purposes. The present indications of a sustained demand for ores, and the existing contracts for the export of both low-grade ores and pig-iron, promise increased revenue throughout the year, whilst reports from commerce and industry generally indicate that a continued, although slight, <span class="col_2123-2124" refersTo="page_1076"/>increase may be expected in the activities which constitute the Administration&#x2019;s main sources of profitable traffic.</p>

<p>Having regard, however, to commitments in respect of heavy consignments of bulk traffic, including the probable shipments of record quantities of maize, the budget is predicted on an increase of 4,000,000 tons of goods in the coming year.</p>

<p>Coal traffic is expected to show a rise of about 600,000 tons on the current year&#x2019;s figure.</p>

<p><i>Passengers</i></p>

<p>With regard to passengers, provision is made for a continuance of the present trend in the growth of suburban traffic, whilst main-line travel is being estimated at more or less the same level as in the current year.</p>

<p>Total passenger revenue for next year, inclusive of the contribution by Treasury for non-White suburban services, is estimated at R57,271,000 as against R55,859,000 for 1964-5.</p>

<p><i>Livestock</i></p>

<p>It is expected that the setback to cattle farming, particularly in South West Africa, this past year will continue to have an effect on livestock earnings in the coming year, and the revenue estimate has been determined accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Road transport</i></p>

<p>Various areas are still suffering from drought, and in addition a certain amount of traffic is being lost to private transport. Also, much of the traffic previously conveyed by road transport service from Swaziland is now being diverted to the new rail link.</p>

<p>Earnings from goods on the road transport service are therefore expected to show only a moderate rise, but the indications are that there will be a further increase in passenger revenue.</p>

<p><i>Pre-cooling</i></p>

<p>Taking into account current assessments of the prospects for marketing both citrus and deciduous fruits overseas in the coming year, revenue from pre-cooling is estimated at R3,558,000, or R158,000 more than in the year 1964-5.</p>

<p><i>Interest on investments</i></p>

<p>The Administration&#x2019;s investments, which cover the various funds, tend to rise, and it is expected that in 1965-6 the current year&#x2019;s estimated return from investments will be exceeded by R905,000. This is partly due also to the increase of &#x00BC; per cent per annum in the rate of interest applicable to Government stock issues as from 15 January 1965.</p>

<p><i>Harbours</i></p>

<p>As regards Harbour earnings, the current flow of exports is expected at least to be maintained, and in view of the high level of imports, allowance is being made for an in crease during 1965-6 of R684,000 on the revised figure of R28,000,000 for the current year.</p>

<p><i>Airways</i></p>

<p>With the advent of the new Boeing 727 aircraft, and the decision to increase our long-range jet fleet by a fourth Boeing 707 later in the year, Airways earnings are expected to continue to rise, and an increase of R4,200,000 on this year&#x2019;s earnings is expected.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the rapid growth in the magnitude of Airways finances. If a comparison is made with railway passenger revenue figures (excluding Treasury&#x2019;s guarantee payments on the non-White resettlement lines) it will be seen that whereas railway passenger revenue reflects a rise from R42,000,000 in 1962-3 to the anticipated R49,800,000 in 1965-6, Airways earnings during the corresponding period rose from R28,000,000 to R39,000,000, and within a few years are likely to overtake the revenue from rail fares. Furthermore, Airways show a small profit, whilst passenger travel on the Railways has to be subsidized by earnings under other heads.</p>

<p><i>Pipeline</i></p>

<p>The Pipeline Service figures for the first time in the Revenue Estimates, and although it is difficult to arrive at a reliable estimate of revenue at the present stage, for the reason that much will depend on the exact date on which the service can be brought into operation, working on the anticipation that the line will come into service in January 1966 provision has been made for an estimated revenue of R4,000,000.</p>

<p><i>All Services</i></p>

<heading>EXPENDITURE: 1965-6</heading>

<p><i>Railways&#x2014;fixed charges</i></p>

<p>With regard to railway expenditure, whereas fixed charges reflect a rise of 9.14 per cent during 1964-5, it is estimated that they will advance by 7.71 per cent during the coming year. Interest on capital is expected to reflect an increase of R5,000,000 (on R67,600,000), and depreciation will be higher by R2,900,000 (on R43,400,00).</p>

<p><i>Operational and maintenance expenses</i></p>

<p>Operational and maintenance expenditure is estimated at R318,900,000, or R12,200,000 more than the current year.</p>

<p><span class="col_2125-2126" refersTo="page_1077"/><i>Harbours</i></p>

<p>Harbour expenditure is estimated at R19,400,000, representing an increase of R1,100,000 over last year&#x2019;s figure.</p>

<p><i>Airways</i></p>

<p>With the acquisition of additional Boeing aircraft, provision must be made for additional interest and depreciation charges, and the total Airways expenditure is thus estimated at R37,200,000, which is R4,700,000 more than for 1964-5.</p>

<p><i>Pipeline</i></p>

<p>In view of the fact that the pipeline is expected to come into operation during the last quarter of the 1965-6 financial year, provision is made for an appropriation to meet expenditure from this source.</p>

<p><i>Net revenue appropriations</i></p>

<p>In accordance with normal practice, provision is made for expenditure expected to be incurred during the year as a charge to the Betterment Fund, totalling R10,000,000.</p>

<p>The Actuaries&#x2019; quinquennial valuation of the New Superannuation and Old Pension Funds has been received. As regards the latter, the Administration has accepted the Actuaries&#x2019; recommendation that the amount payable towards the deficit in the Pension Fund be reduced from R67,200 to R21,600, and provision is made accordingly.</p>

<p>In my Budget Speech last year I mentioned that, in anticipation of the quinquennial valuation of the Superannuation Fund&#x2019;s reflecting a deficit, the Administration had decided to commence payments into the fund towards a reduction of the actuarial deficiency. The actuaries, in their recent report, have shown that the position is better than had been anticipated but that the deficiency was still in excess of R57,000,000. They indicated that provided no wage increases were contemplated it would be safe to discontinue the present contribution of R100,000 per month. The Administration has, nevertheless, decided to continue with the contribution towards the elimination of the deficiency.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for the usual contribution of R500,000 to the Level Crossings Elimination Fund.</p>

<p><i>Result of working: 1965-6</i></p>

<p>Expenditure for the year, including the net revenue appropriations, is expected to total R598,773,000, which would leave a net surplus of R7,871,000.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the Schumann Committee&#x2019;s report and the views of organized commerce and industry are being examined. Preliminary calculations would indicate that tariff concessions to the value of approximately R6,000,000 would be involved in acceding to certain of the short-term concessions. It is not possible to say when these recommendations will be implemented, but it is my intention to finalize the matter within the next few months.</p>

<p>Allowing for these concessions, the net surplus for the year is estimated to be approximately R1,750,000.</p>

<p><i>New works</i></p>

<p>With regard to New Works, loan fund expenditure for the current year, including the provision made in the Additional Estimates, is expected to total R119,500,000, and the Brown Book provides for a further R120,000,000 of loan funds to be spent in 1965-6. By March 1966 total interest-bearing capital will be over R1,800,000,000, and the total interest burden approximately R79,000,000 per annum. Members will also be interested to know that some R438,000,000 of interest-bearing capital will have been spent on railway development since April 1961.</p>

<p>These large outlays of new capital enable the Administration to keep abreast of requirements and in turn foster the country&#x2019;s economic development.</p>

<p>As regards expenditure from the Renewals and Betterment Funds, I should like to draw attention to the extent to which these funds, maintained from revenue sources, have been used to defray the cost of improving and replacing the Administration&#x2019;s assets. By March 1966 no less an amount than R294,000,000 will have been spent from these Funds in a period of five years.</p>

<p>Very considerable sums are being spent on rolling stock. In 1963-4 the estimates provided for a total expenditure of over R44,000,000 on locomotives, coaches and trucks. Together with the provision in the Additional Estimates this year&#x2019;s total is R65,750,000, and the Brown Book for 1965-6 provides for yet further expenditure of R78,000,000, a total outlay of over R187,000,000 within the space of three years.</p>

<debateSection name="#appreciation">

<heading>APPRECIATION</heading>

<p>I have referred to the growth in traffic and to the depletion of our staff complement. The burden on all railwaymen has been great, but they have not failed in meeting the increased demands that followed upon the country&#x2019;s prosperity. I want to express my appreciation and thanks to them all, irrespective of colour, from the most senior to those occupying the most humble positions, for their dedication to duty during the year.</p>

<p><i>TABLING</i></p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister, throughout his speech to-day, had to refer again and again to the tremendous strain that has been placed on the personnel of the S.A. Railways and Harbours, firstly because of the increase in the working of the Railways resulting from economic expansion, and secondly, because of the fact that there is a shortage of manpower. We want to say at once that it is quite a remarkable achievement by the personnel of the S.A. Railways to have given the services to the public of South Africa that they have done in the past year. We on this side of the House would also like to express our appreciation for the work they have done. They have performed their work even beyond the call of duty, and I think that every South African is not only grateful but admires them for the sacrifices they have made. We are very sorry indeed that only the Minister has the power to express his gratitude and appreciation in a more concrete form. That is beyond us; we have to be satisfied by expressing our gratitude, and we can only hope that the Minister in the course of time will seek to express his gratitude in a more tangible form.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Budget proposals of the Minister, we immediately find ourselves in serious difficulties because it is quite clear that what the Minister has proposed here is an interim Budget, a standstill Budget, and it does not reflect the real intentions and plans of the Minister for the next year. The Schumann Commission&#x2019;s report was published in April of last year when Parliament was still in session. Commerce and industries were given until December of last year to make their representations, but Parliament does not know what the Minister intends doing about those very important recommendations, and we will not know until after the discussions on Railway matters in this House have been completed, as the Minister has told us. I think that is the completely wrong attitude to adopt towards Parliament. Surely, if we have to discuss the Budget for the coming year, we are entitled to know what exactly we are discussing, and we should not be left with vague suggestions from the Minister about concessions, short-term concessions, amounting to R6,000,000, which may reduce his surplus from R7,750,000 to R1,750,000. Surely Parliament and the people are entitled to know and to discuss the Minister&#x2019;s plans, and particularly whether the concessions he apparently plans to give will have the effect of alleviating the burden resting on the ordinary consumer to-day. We do not know, and yet that is the most important thing we want to know. What is going to be done by the Railways to bring relief from the growing burden of costs resting on the consumers, the public, the ordinary housewives and the families of South Africa? We cannot estimate those because full information on Minister&#x2019;s plans for the coming year has not been revealed to us. You will recall, Sir, that last year we of the Opposition made our major point of criticism of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget the fact that there was no planning of the transport system of South Africa as a whole, but merely a limited approach to the S.A. Railways and Harbours.</p>

<p>The Minister then as the result of our criticism stated that he would appoint a commission to investigate the co-ordination of transport services in South Africa and their full and efficient use in the interest of the people of South Africa. But the surprising thing is that this undertaking was given a year ago, and to-day we have to hear from the hon. the Minister that he is still considering the personnel and, I take it, the terms of reference of such a commission, which has not been appointed yet. This we find most distressing and disappointing. Yet the Minister indicates&#x2014;not in so many words&#x2014;that he is planning very extensively the future of the S.A. Railways in anticipation of whatever such a commission may report. He may find that the commission will report to him in terms which will make the plans he is undertaking at the moment unwise, not appropriate to the general plans for the transport system of South Africa as a whole. There are many other things of a similar nature which we find distressing in the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech to-day, but as I think these matters should be considered further before we go into details I should like to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House go into Committee on the Second Estimates of Additional Expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue, Bantu Education and Loan Accounts during the year ending 31 March 1965.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, Parliament is asked to appropriate an amount of R78,392,364 over and above the amounts made available in the Appropriation Act, 1964, and the First Additional Appropriation Act, 1965, for the administration of the country. In the First Additional Appropriation Act, 1965, an amount of approximately R10,100,000 was authorized. The total additional requirements for 1964-5 are, therefore, just over R88,500,000. This represents an increase of 6.26 per cent on the appropriation authorized in the Appropriation Act, 1964.</p>

<p>On Loan Vote A&#x2014;Miscellaneous Loans and Services, an additional amount of R51,642,000 <span class="col_2129-2130" refersTo="page_1079"/>is required. The amount of R30,000,000 included under sub-head 1 of this Vote is for transfer to the South African Railway and Harbour Fund to cover increased expenditure on capital works by the Railways Administration. The increased expenditure has already been approved by this House and Parliament is merely asked to approve the transfer of the money to that Fund.</p>

<p>I also wish to say a few words about the additional amount of R17,700,000 requested under sub-head 7 of the same Vote.</p>

<p>In the past, as a matter of administrative convenience it was the practice to treat the Redemption Fund for Assisted National Housing Loans as part of the Local Loans Fund. It has now been decided, however, to treat the Redemption Fund as a trust fund, altogether divorced from the Local Loans Fund. The moneys in the Fund will be invested in Government Stock and Treasury Bills. An amount of R16,200,000 is required for reimbursing the Local Loans Fund for the loss of the Redemption Fund, but a contra credit will accrue to loan receipts via the Public Debt Commissioners. The balance of R1,500,000 required, is to augment the capital of the Fund to meet increased demands from the smaller municipalities for loans.</p>

<p>Hon. members will note that under subhead 9 provision is made for a loan of R5,000,000 to the Government of Rhodesia. It is the intention to make this loan available for specific projects, such as the Chiredzi dam, the Mbezi-Chiredzi railway, the Kyle dam canals, electric power supply, and an airport at Chiredzi. Our exporters have some interest in most of these projects and from the more general point of view it would also be to our advantage if these schemes are proceeded with. The loan will be for a period of 15 years and will carry interest at the rate charged by the Government on loans to the Provincial Administrations. I am sure this House will wish us to show goodwill and co-operation to our northern neighbour where its Government is experiencing some difficulty in the financing of essential development work.</p>

<p>If we deduct these exceptional items, totalling just over R51,000,000, we find that the additional requirements in the First and Second Additional Estimates together amount to only R37,500,000 which is an increase of about 2.6 per cent over the amount voted in the Appropriation Act, 1964.</p>

<p>If the expansion in all spheres is taken into account, hon. members will agree that this increase is very reasonable. I may add that during the years 1943-4 to 1947-8 the amounts voted in Appropriation Acts, had to be supplemented, on average, to the extent of 6.98 per cent. For the period 1959-60 to 1963-4, the percentage averaged 2.54. This year the percentage is slightly higher on that basis.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not consider it necessary to give further details of the various services included in the Estimates now before the House. As in the past, my colleagues will be prepared to furnish hon. members with the information they require. I wish, however, to assure members that I am satisfied that the additional expenditure is fully justified.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish once again to explain to the House the purpose of the inclusion of nominal provision against certain items.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the inclusion of these nominal amounts is not to obtain an appropriation. The object is to bring the specific item to the notice of Parliament and thereby obtain the necessary covering parliamentary approval for a new service, the expenditure on which can be met from savings on the Vote as a whole. This procedure is also followed in cases where the increase in the total approved cost of an approved service is of such magnitude that it is deemed advisable to bring it to the attention of Parliament, notwithstanding the fact that the appropriation for the relative financial year does not require supplementation.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_forestry">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>This <i>ex gratia</i> remission to Mr. Raubenheimer is really the outcome of a disastrous fire. In June 1962 there was a very big forest fire in the plantations near George. The total damage caused by the fire, after making use of the trees to the best possible advantage, was R840,431; that was the total damage caused to State plantations as a result of this fire. After the fire the police investigated the causes of the fire and it was established that the fire had started on Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s farm. Mr. Raubenheimer was then charged in the magistrate&#x2019;s court, was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of R20. Immediately thereafter the Department of Forestry instituted a claim against Mr. Raubenheimer for the sum of R840,431, which was the estimated damage, but the Department of Forestry was not the only one that suffered damage; there was also a private firm, Springbok Farm and Feeding Station (Pty.) Ltd., which also suffered damage to the extent of R35,000 according to their claim; the State and this private firm then jointly claimed R875,431 from Mr. Raubenheimer. Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s assets, however, taking everything into consideration, only amounted, in round figures, to R130,000. After negotiations between the claimants and Mr. Raubenheimer it was eventually decided to settle for an amount of R15,000 to be paid to each of the two claimants, that is to say, a total of R30,000 which Mr. Raubenheimer therefore had to pay. That means that Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s assets then stood at R100,042; in other words, a sum of R725,000 had to be regarded as irrecoverable damage; that amount could not be recovered because the joint claim exceeded Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s total assets by that amount. But the acceptance by the Department of Forestry of this sum of R15,000 meant that there was an amount of R100,042 which could be recovered from Mr. Raubenheimer if the State pressed its full claim. That would have meant, however, that Mr. Raubenheimer would have been entirely ruined financially and it was consequently decided, after consultation between the Department of Forestry, the Treasury and the State Attorney, having due regard also to the question as to whether the Court would allow the full claim for damages, to accept the offer made by Mr. Raubenheimer. That means that Parliament is now being asked to vote the amount which would have been recoverable if the full claim for damages, which Mr. Raubenheimer could pay on the basis of his assets, were awarded by the Court. If this amount is voted by Parliament it will be deposited into the Loan Account of the State; it will not be paid to Mr. Raubenheimer. It will be paid over to Loan Account so that the claim can be written off by that amount. In actual fact therefore this is not an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to Mr. Raubenheimer; he will not get a cent of it. This is purely a book entry in order to make it possible to write off this amount against the claim against Mr. Raubenheimer.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_forestry">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>No, the R700,000 is irrecoverable because Mr. Raubenheimer simply has not got it. The R100,000 would have been recoverable if the court had awarded the full claim for damages, but bearing in mind the fact that the magistrate only sentenced him to a fine of R20 it would seem that Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s degree of negligence was not very great, and one is not sure therefore whether the Court would have awarded the full amount. It was generally accepted that the best course in the circumstances would be to settle the claim, and the claim was then settled by the payment of R15,000 by Mr. Raubenheimer to the State. Having arrived at this settlement the State then had to write off the recoverable amount of its claim, namely R100,000, and in order to be able to write it off it is necessary to vote the amount asked for here. I find this highly technical and I do not really understand it but the matter is being dealt with in this way in terms of a Treasury ruling.</p>

<p>As far as the other item is concerned, the grant-in-aid to the University of Stellenbosch for research, the position is that an agreement was arrived at the previous year&#x2014;and it was also approved of by Parliament&#x2014;that the forestry research institution of the University of Stellenbosch would be subsidized on a firm basis, calculated according to the number of lecturers and research assistants who would be needed in the department of forestry at the University of Stellenbosch to handle the necessary research projects. In estimating the amount, however, a mistake was made in connection with the average salary scales of the incumbents of certain research posts, and in the meanwhile the salary scales at universities have also been increased. This meant that an additional amount of R8,190 would have had to be paid in respect of the past year on the total strength of the University&#x2019;s staff, but because of the fact that the research assistants&#x2019; posts were not all filled throughout the year, an amount of R7,800, will be sufficient to compensate the University in respect of research posts which <i>have</i> been filled in the course of the current year.</p>

I think we are entitled to ask him to tell us with complete frankness whether in the opinion of the legal advisers of the Department the State would have succeeded if it had proceeded with its claim. Sir, he has indicated that one does not know whether the State had a strong case in view of the fact that Mr. Raubenheimer was fined only R20. I think the Minister must tell us whether he agrees that in the circumstances of the case a fine such as that was adequate. Obviously the Department did not, because even the acceptance of R15,000 as damages shows that the matter was very much more serious than the magistrate seemed to have regarded it. I think the Minister must be quite frank and tell us what his legal advisers advised him; he should tell us whether in fact they thought that this case was doubtful, whether they felt that there was any doubt at all or whether the simple facts are that Mr. Raubenheimer would have been ruined if the State had pressed its claim, and that it was really on that ground that the Government took the line it did. If it was purely a case, as it appears to be on the Minister&#x2019;s own explanation, that this large sum of money could have been recovered by the State, but that the Government felt that it was not a case where in all the circumstances it should pursue its claim, I think we are entitled to be told that in the clearest and most frank language.</p>

Then after negotiations on the question as to whether the State could claim the full amount, a settlement was arrived at by which the State got R15,000 and the other claimant also got R15,000.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>There would seem to be a number of peculiar aspects to this particular case. There were apparently two claims, one by the Government and one by a private individual. The Government&#x2019;s claim was one for approximately R840,000 and the private individual&#x2019;s claim was for R35,000. Each claim was settled for R15,000. It seems a strange state of affairs that a claim for R35,000 should be settled for R15,000 and that a claim for R840,000 should settle for the same amount. It would seem that if the only amount that Mr. Raubenheimer could pay was R30,000, then the distribution of that R30,000 between the claim on the one hand for R840,000 and on the other for R35,000 should have been very different.</p>

<p>Secondly I want to follow up what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) said, because one of two things must have happened: Either the Department decided that they were going to waive the claim against Mr. Raubenheimer, in which case there is no need to have a remission or <i>ex gratia</i> payment in the Estimates, which we now have before us, or alternatively, Mr. Raubenheimer must have signed an acknowledgment of debt or agreed that he was liable for this particular amount. If he did not agree to that, then there is a vague claim against him which has not yet been proved, and the Department in its wisdom could have decided that it would not press the claim because they could not collect it or because they did not think they should do so, and then there would be no reason for the remission of this amount. But I think perhaps we will get the answer if the hon. the Minister will tell us why the Treasury asked for the inclusion of this item in the Additional Estimates.</p>

You see, Sir, if you have a remission of R100,042, then R100,042 has been spent, and if it is just a book entry there must be a corresponding entry on the other side. Where would that corresponding entry appear? If cash has not been paid and if this is purely a book entry, then we want to know where the book entry is on the other side.

The State&#x2019;s claim was for R840,000, and the hon. the Minister now tells us that because this man&#x2019;s assets were only worth R130,000, the claim was suddenly reduced to R130,000, of which R30,000 was paid and R100,000 is purely a book entry.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>Those are the terms of the agreement, but whether we accept the agreement depends on whether this amount is made available; in other words, the State has not abandoned its claim; the claim still stands and we can still proceed with it if it is considered desirable.</p>

<p>Let me deal first with the question put to me by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), namely how we arrived at this figure of R130,000. The damage which the State suffered originally amounted to R840,431. The hon. member now wants to know how we arrived at a figure of R130,000 and eventually at R100,000. The reason for this is that Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s assets consisted of the following: A farm valued in 1964 by the divisional council at R85,660; movables R25,882; donations to his wife and sons since the fire R18,500, a total of R130,042. There were two claimants, the State and this private company. Initially the company insisted on full settlement of its claim for damages amounting to R35,000, but eventually the company settled with the owner for R15,000. There was no agreement between the State and the other claimant as to the amounts to be accepted in settlement. There was an intimation that if the State was not prepared to settle also, the other claimant would insist on the sale of Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s assets. It was not considered to be in the general interest that that course should be followed.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>It is naturally not in the interests of anybody that a private individual who engages in farming should be totally ruined in this way by pressing the full claim against him. That is why the State referred this matter to the State Attorney and its law advisers who expressed the opinion that there was no certainty as to whether the State would succeed with its full claim or with a claim for an amount equivalent to the full value of Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s assets. There was no certainty in that regard. There was no doubt that the State would be awarded a certain amount, but that amount would be entirely within the discretion of the court. We cannot say with certainty what amount would have been awarded to the State and it was felt that this was the best course to follow since Mr. Raubenheimer might have been ruined completely if the State had pressed its claim and because it was considered that it would only be reasonable to meet Mr. Raubenheimer by keeping him on the land in this particular case in which a fire, which was started as a result of a certain amount of negligence on the part of his employees, got out of control. After all, the same sort of thing may easily happen on the farms of hon. members who live in the same sort of area. Hon. members know that a fire may break out as a result of negligence or a degree of negligence on the part of their employees. Must we ruin the man financially in these circumstances? The State felt that it would not be justified in doing so, particularly having regard to the fact that there is no absolute certainty as to what the finding of the court is going to be eventually. The Government law advisers and the Treasury decided after careful consideration, since the other party eventually agreed to settle for R15,000, that the State should also be prepared to settle for a sum of R15,000. But in order to be able to do so, approval has to be obtained for the other portion of the total claim, the portion which might have been recoverable, to be written off by way of <i>ex gratia</i> remission. That means that this amount has to be voted as an item of expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue Account, but it will immediately be deposited again as revenue in the Loan Account, in just the same way as all forestry revenue is deposited in the Loan Account.</p>

<p>This thing happened before I became Minister of Forestry. I have no first-hand knowledge of the circumstances. But that is the in <span class="col_2137-2138" refersTo="page_1083"/>formation given to me by my Department. After having discussed this matter fully with them on various occasions I am satisfied that this is the best course for us to follow here.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that the hon. the Minister has gone wrong somewhere in his explanation. As the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) has pointed out there should be a counter-entry. It seems to me that the position is that the whole R130,000 of Mr. Raubenheimer was taken by the State and that the State paid R15,000 to the other claimant, and that this <i>ex gratia</i> payment is therefore now made, because the whole R130,000 was appropriated by the State. That is how it appears to me. But that was not the point I wanted to speak about. To what I want to draw attention is this: The hon. the Minister says that in respect of this fire at Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s farm he was only fined the sum of R20 in the magistrate&#x2019;s court. This means that he could not have been very negligent. But if a fire causes damage to the extent of R841,000 I cannot for the life of me think what the Minister&#x2019;s Department was doing. What precautions do they take against fire? Do they just allow a fire to rage? Don&#x2019;t they take any precautions? I think the explanation of the hon. the Minister is an explanation of failure. I think the Minister&#x2019;s Department is very sure indeed that if it should go to court the court will not allow the full claim. I am perfectly sure, as far as I know the position, that forestry departments take precautions against fire. For a fire to have spread over such a large area and to have caused damage to the tune of R841,000 there must have been extreme negligence. To me it seems as if the Minister&#x2019;s Department knows that they have hold of the wrong end of the stick. It is perfectly true, as most farmers will know, that a small fire can assume large proportions only if the neighbour has not taken certain precautions. This seems to me to be a case where the Minister&#x2019;s Department was negligent to such an extent that they feel they cannot press the claim. I have no comment to make on the <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R100,042 to Mr. Raubenheimer. I have no fault to find with that but I have fault to find with the Department. I have fault to find with the precautions which should have been taken in the ordinary course of events by anybody who knows anything about tree planting and forestry. Surely no ordinary farmer will allow himself to get into a position in which he can suffer a loss of R841,000 because of the lack of precautions. It seems to me that the Minister&#x2019;s Department is in a very poor position. This whole explanation by the hon. the Minister seems to me to be a confession of neglect on the part of the Department.</p>

<p>When the non. member for Durban (Point (Mr. Raw) has finished with the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), I should like to reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s re marks. I think I should reply immediately before this, to my mind, unnecessary discussion is taken further. [Interjections.] The hon. member over there ought to know that that fire was spread by wind which came up suddenly and became very strong. I am informed that it blew at more than 100 miles per hour on that occasion. Officials of the Department of Forestry lost their lives in the struggle against the fire which was raging there. This was one of the most destructive fires that we have had in the history of the Republic. The fire did not spread because of lack of precautionary measures. The Department of Forestry, together with the other bodies concerned, do everything in their power to make use of the most modern methods; they take proper precautionary measures. Hon. members know that where plantations are situated alongside one another, one cannot keep a fire which starts in one plantation out of the adjoining plantation if the wind blows at 100 miles per hour, even where there is a firebreak. How can one keep that fire out of the adjoining plantation? What precautionary measures can one take? I just want to make it perfectly clear that my Department and the other responsible parties did everything in their power to keep the damage caused by the fire down to an absolute minimum. And we are going to continue to use every means at our disposal in the future to keep the damage caused by fires down to an absolute minimum. There was no question at all of negligence or failure as suggested by the hon. member for Drakensberg. In actual fact every effort was made in this case to prevent the fire from spreading. I have the highest regard for what my Department did in this particular case.</p>

<p>Let me explain the position once again. The State&#x2019;s claim is one for R840,431. That is the estimated amount of the damage. But after R15,000 had been paid to the other claimant, Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s remaining assets stood at R115,042, of which he is prepared to hand over R15,000; in other words, the other R100,042 is recoverable; that is to say, R100,042 of the claim of R840,431 is recoverable or at any rate it would have been recoverable if the full amount or an amount in excess of R100,000 had been awarded by the Court.

<p>Through you, Mr. Chairman, I thank the Minister. I want to deal with the point made by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore). There is all the difference in the world between going to court on a criminal charge with which this man was apparently charged and going to court with a civil charge to try to get damages from him. Now that was never tested. The point seems to arise on what grounds we can take anything from him at all in these circumstances? What is the basis on which you even take the R15,000? [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing must not now get angry on behalf of his colleague. I am dealing with his colleague at the moment. Perhaps the hon. the Minister would like to come into the debate and explain the position on behalf of his colleague. His colleague is a new Minister. Perhaps the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing can explain to us why this is the position. There was no case in court on the civil charge. There was nothing to show that this man would actually have had an award against him for civil damages notwithstanding the fact that there was a criminal case in respect of which there had been a conviction. On the face of it it looks as though it would have justified a claim being made against him, but that is not the point at issue, particularly when the Minister explains that this was one of those days when the weather was completely out of the ordinary. I have heard that from another forestry source as well. It was an act of God. It might well have been that the court would have said: No, we are not prepared to award any civil damages in this case whatever. Leave aside this question of book entries as between one Department and another Department. What are the moral grounds for claiming any damages at all from Mr. Raubenheimer? That is the point that occurs to me. There was a criminal conviction involving a very small amount indeed whatever may be said to the contrary. It was an extraordinarily small amount in a case of this kind; even if the court had thought there was something in the way of contributory negligence on the part of Mr. Raubenheimer it was still a very small amount indeed. Here is an extraordinarily difficult position because of the amount of damage that has been done. It seems to me pressure was brought to bear on the man; it seems to me that he was threatened with court proceedings that would have involved him costs and damages and that he gave way to that pressure. But that is not the attitude, in our opinion, the State should have adopted. The Minister has not advanced any reason whatsoever to show that there is any ground for demanding from Mr. Raubenheimer R15,000.</p>

It seems to me that if we continue this debate a little longer we may yet agree. Let me say this to the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. <span class="col_2141-2142" refersTo="page_1085"/>D. E.

But if a civil case is instituted, as the State ought to do in every case where it suffers damage of this kind&#x2014;if it does not do so it will be criticized&#x2014;then one does not continue with a civil case, as the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) suggested we should have done, merely in order to get judgment in one&#x2019;s favour; one settles. That is recognized legal practice. The general practice in this country is that in civil cases the parties may come to a settlement at a certain stage of the proceedings, and they frequently do. That is what happened here. Two parties instituted a civil claim. The State instituted a civil claim and so did Springbok Farm and Feeding Stations (Pty.) Ltd. When Mr. Raubenheimer received those demands, he accepted responsibility by making an offer to settle. He was not told by the Department or by the State to make that offer of settlement. He himself made the offer after careful consideration. He offered to pay R15,000 to each of the two claimants. Springbok Farm was prepared to accept the offer and the State, after consultation with the State Attorney and with the Treasury, is also prepared to accept it. I honestly cannot see how we could have acted differently in this case. I think the way in which Mr. Raubenheimer is being treated in the circumstances is very fair. The circumstances were unusual but the fact remains that there was negligence. The fire was caused in actual fact by negligence on the part of Mr. Raubenheimer and his employees. He admitted this and on the strength of this fact he accepted a certain amount of responsibility.</p>

<p>In view of the remark by the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economic and Marketing that there was a gale of 100 miles per hour it seems to me that this is an act of God and the Government should pay him back the R15,000 seeing that we are paying him this amount of R100,042 which he never paid to make confusion more confounded. Quite frankly this is an act of God. I quite agree with my hon. colleague. Even R30,000 can put a man in debt out of which he never can get. I think a 100 mile-per-hour gale is something nobody can prevent or be responsible for damage due to it. Therefore I should like to see that we pay him back the R15,000.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question. He has told us that the case went to court and that the smallness of the fine imposed has influenced the amount of the settlement. As so often happens in this type of case, the employees of the owner of the farm start a fire which gets out of control. Was Mr. Raubenheimer himself the person who appeared before the court or was it one of his employees? I live in an area where we often have bush fires. In many cases the owner of the land, who ultimately has to shoulder the responsibility, is away in Cape Town or elsewhere on business. One of his boys starts a fire for which the owner is eventually held responsible. I think there is a big difference in the angle from which we look at this matter and the amount of responsibility that rests on the shoulders of the owner when it comes to the question of assessing the damage.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Now that we have had this further explanation of this matter I think we must come back to one important factor. The relationship between the Government and Mr. Raubenheimer is one which they basically must decide themselves. They have full information regarding the facts as to what transpired. It is up to them to come to whatever reasonable arrangements they think correct. I accept the Minister&#x2019;s explanation regarding this R15,000 paid to each claimant. But what I still do not understand is what this item is doing in the Additional Estimates. For the life of me I cannot understand it. We now understand the position as follows: There was a loss suffered by the Government of R840,000. The total assets of Mr. Raubenheimer were R130,000 odd, of which he paid out R30,000. That left him with R100,000. The Government, without ever having established a claim, in effect says &#x201C;We have the right to claim from Mr. Raubenheimer and we would be justified in so claiming because we could establish it in a court of law; he still owes us R100,000.&#x201D; But he owes the Government nothing, Sir. Mr. Raubenheimer does not owe anybody any money. The hon. the Minister has said he does not know whether he can substantiate a claim even for R15,000. He does not know. What this means, Sir, is that the Minister is saying to us: &#x201C;Mr. Raubenheimer owes my Department R100,000. I do not want to collect it from him so I shall make him an <i>ex gratia</i> payment on the one hand and bring it into account as revenue on the other hand&#x201D;. But that does not tie up with the facts. I do not understand the reason for this. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he would please be good enough to tell us why the Treasury insisted that this item should appear in the Estimates. Why is this item here, because I think the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has put the position quite clearly. The hon. the Minister does not know whether he has any claim whatsoever against Mr. Raubenheimer. I am sure all of us, listening here this afternoon, do not know either. As a matter of fact, it seems to be, from what we have heard about the wind and so forth, that there is probably no claim whatsoever. Yet this item in effect says to this House, and to anybody in South Africa, that Mr. Raubenheimer owes this Government R100,000 but we are going to give it back to him as a present. I do not think that is fair, Mr. Chairman. And I do not think this is a correct accounting or budgeting principle. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will <span class="col_2143-2144" refersTo="page_1086"/>tell us why the Treasury insisted upon it appearing in the Estimates.</p>

<p>The question of the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) is one which affects the Treasury. He wants to know why this item appears here. I can only say to the hon. member that this is sound budgetary policy; it is sound practice. We could have concealed this and in that case we would not have had this perhaps very useful discussion here to-day. The whole policy of the Treasury is to hide nothing. The position was that we had a claim, but if we went to Court we did not know what the judgment was going to be. We did know, however, that the maximum was R130,000; that was the maximum it could be. Because we did not know what the outcome might be, we decided that since this was a possible loss to the State we had to come to Parliament to obtain approval to meet this potential loss. That is our practice.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, any possible State revenue. But what makes the hon. Minister think that it was possible State revenue that was being waived? That is the crux of the whole matter. What makes him think that? The hon. Minister of Finance says that the maximum amount that the State would have been able to get was R130,000, of which R15,000 went to some other company and R15,000 to the Department of Forestry, that leaves the R100,000 here. But what makes him say that the State could only have got R130,000? Merely the fact that that was alleged to be the value of Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s estate? That does not mean that that is all that the courts would have granted. Over R840,000 damage was done, and no court is concerned with what the value of the estate is of a person who comes before it in a case of damage. He may be a man of straw and R500,000 damages may be awarded against <span class="col_2145-2146" refersTo="page_1087"/>him. That has got nothing to do with it. The court is not interested in the value of the estate of anybody who is the defendant in a damages case. There is nothing to show that the State in this case had reason to believe that R130,000 was the maximum amount that it could have got.</p>

He said &#x201C;No, it is not written off; this is merely a book entry for the purpose of the accounting of the Department, that is the Treasury, but it is not written of so far as the particular person is concerned.&#x201D; Confusion gets worse confounded.

<p>That does not matter. I am not following it in all its wanderings through the Treasury. I am dealing with where it finally finishes up, and it finishes up in the Department of Forestry. The Department of Forestry has suffered a loss and apparently the Department of Forestry says &#x201C;We can get R15,000 from Mr. Raubenheimer; it is obviously no good to go for him for more than the total value of his estate; he has given R15,000 to somebody else; that leaves R100,000; now we ask you to go to Parliament and from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to vote R100,000 which will come ultimately to Revenue on behalf of the Department of Forestry. We finish up with the R100,000 on the income side of the books of the Department of Forestry for the appropriate financial year, if this Vote is passed. There is the position, and we say again: Why? What possible ground is there to say that that R100,000 would have been obtained had there been a civil case? What possible ground is there for saying that R50,000, or R100,000, or R1 would have been obtained?

<p>No, no, that is a completely wrong assumption. When a man is standing in the shadow of a Supreme Court action, what will he consider? I know of people who will pay R10 or R12 or R15 for minor speeding offences, or something of that sort, not because they admit guilt, but they do not want to go to the trouble to go to court, and here a man has got a Supreme Court action hanging over him and it looks as if he may be liable for R840,000. He may well say: I am going to get out of this for an amount of R130,000. But that is a tacit admission that in fact he owes it and that he is responsible for the whole of the damage, and that he is going to compromise now with the State and getting away with R15,000.

<p>I am, Sir. I am dealing with the explanation that the hon. Minister gave that this happened before he became Minister of Forestry. He said that, and, Sir, I think I am entitled to touch upon that matter. He said that he did not know all the facts, and that was borne out by the fact that he gazed beseechingly at his officials, and the hon. Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and the hon. member for George, in order to get some information. He says he does not know all the facts, and so one naturally feels some sympathy for his discomfiture. But at the same time, one is entitled to ask him certain questions, and one of the questions I want to put to the hon. Minister is this: Did this person, Mr. Raubenheimer, carry no insurance whatsoever, e.g. public liability? Does the hon. Minister say that short of making this man bankrupt &#x2026;</p>

<p>The first point is: Did Mr. Raubenheimer have no insurance&#x2014;for <span class="col_2147-2148" refersTo="page_1088"/>example, in the form of a public liability policy? This will possibly explain the point the hon. Minister has made that the Government, the State, did not want to put the man out of business, take him off the land where he was a farmer&#x2014;they did not want to break him. Point Two: There was a reference earlier in this discussion by the hon. Minister to an item in the estate, or rather the assets of Mr. Raubenheimer, I think R28,000 or R18,000, in the form of gifts to his children. Now, if these gifts to the children of the person concerned consisted of various amounts of money, or part of the assets which had been disposed of, how does it come back again into the estate, as it were, into the estimation of the assets? How does that happen? Then there is the question of the wind that was blowing through that farm that day&#x2014;the wind of change seems to have been blowing at 100 miles per hour through this particular farm&#x2019;as it started off as a very minor incident, according to the hon. Minister, but by the time he got up to give his third explanation, it was a hundred-miles-an-hour gale that was blowing. That is what he said. It is no use him looking so despondent about it.

<p>Exactly. It was only a minor little breeze, but by the time the third explanation was proffered, it was a hundred-mile gale! I want to put this to the hon. Minister: He appears to have made his earlier statement under the misapprehension that we were taking him to task because he was dealing too lightly with Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2014;because he had apparently been responsible for R800,000 damage, and all he had to do was to find R15,000 to square off. The converse appears to have been the case. The Minister appears to have dealt very harshly with Mr. Raubenheimer, as things turned out; and by the time we get to the bottom of this case, it may turn out that the Minister, in accepting the R15,000 from Mr. Raubenheimer, has been virtually guilty of robbing the poor. Therefore, I think it would be best if the hon. Minister armed himself with all the facts and, in one fell swoop, at the seventh attempt tells us exactly how and why this matter was settled.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>It is very interesting to sit and listen to people who do not know what is going on. This makes me think of something about which I read in a book some time ago regarding a directors&#x2019; meeting and which I think is comparable to what has happened here. The first item on the agenda was an item of R100,000,000 to be spent on a nuclear reactor. The directors asked a few questions about it and then they said that they did not know what it was all about but they hoped that everything was in order and approved of it. The next item was an amount of R20,000 for lorries. A few questions were asked in regard to this item but after discussing it for half an hour, it was approved of. The next item was an amount of R15 which had been spent by a typist on a party and the directors spent the whole afternoon discussing this item! That is the type of attitude which has been revealed by the Opposition here this afternoon.</p>

<p>It is very clear that the hon. the Minister had this item inserted in the Estimates in order to bring it to the attention of this House. I should like hon. members who are so vociferous and who want to show how wise they are in this regard tell me how the Treasury should have brought it to the notice of this House if not in the way in which it has been done here. The only argument which hon. members opposite can advance is that it should not be shown as R100,042, but simply as R1, because then the item would appear here and we could discuss it. I want to tell hon. members opposite that some of them asked good questions and others did not; there were same hon. members who displayed complete ignorance in this regard and it would be better for them to sit still and just listen.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister told us that Mr. Raubenheimer was fined R20 by the court because there was a certain amount of negligence on his part. If the Treasury, the State Attorney and the Department arrived at a settlement with Mr. Raubenheimer, what was so wrong about that? Do the Opposition want to tell us that the State should never try to arrange a settlement, rightly or wrongly, in the future; whether or not they know that they have lost a case, should the State still take the matter to court? Is that what the Opposition want? The hon. the Minister also said that there was a certain amount of negligence, that a strong wind came up at a later stage, a wind which became stronger and stronger. Indeed, the wind may even have reached the same velocity as that reached by a United Party supporter riding a bicycle through the Free State! I do not think that there was any other way in which the Treasury could have brought this matter to the attention of the House.</p>

<p>There is a principle involved here on which I think we should get some clarity from the hon. the Minister. It is quite clear from what the Minister has told us in several replies that the settlement arrived at between the state and Mr. Kaubenheimer for the original claim lodged by the state of R140,000 was an amount or R15,000. The hon. Minister shakes his head, but i cannot see it in any other way, because the Minister has made it perfectly clear that the assets of Mr. Kaubenheimer were R1,50,000, he is meeting a claim of R15,000 from an independent company and he is making a settlement to the state of R15,000, leaving Mr. Kaubenheimer with R100,000. Now we have had the explanation from the hon. Minister that we are voting the R100,000 in order to keep Mr. Kaubenheimer on his farm and that the state does not take the remaining assets or Mr. Kaubenheimer. Is that correct or not correct?</p>

The Minister said clearly a minute ago that, as a matter of policy, the State was not prepared to claim from Mr. Raubenheimer the total of his remaining assets of R115,000, because &#x201C;he is an established person with a farm, and he should not be moved from the farm&#x201D;. We heard from the Minister that there were exceptional circumstances and that that is the reason why the State is prepared to arrive at a settlement, because it was an act of God; that the original fire started through negligence, but spread to such proportions as a result of 100-mile-an-hour gale. The Minister says that this man should be retained on the land and that the State, therefore, should waive its claim against a farmer, although the State, according to the Minister&#x2019;s legal advisers, has a perfectly legal claim. Now I want to ask; Is this tne principle that is going to apply in respect of all farmers who find themselves in difficulties <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the State? We nave had a few interjections of the hon. Minister of Agricultural technical Services a minute ago. Is he going to apply tne same sympathetic approach to other farmers who, through acts of God, on account of droughts and other reasons, are finding themselves in difficulty in meeting their obligations to the State? We would like to know that, and they would like to know that, there is a further extension of the principle: There are numbers of farmers &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, I am dealing with the reply the non. Minister gave, and the reasons the non. Minister gave in regard to waiving this claim. Because clearly it must be a matter of policy, and there is a principle involved as tar as the Government is concerned, and I think we should get complete clarity in respect of this matter because there are other people who farm extensively next to Government plantations, and there should be a clear-cut statement from the hon. the Minister in reply to his policy and how he views matters of this kind, because clearly others may be placed in the same difficulty as Mr. Raubenheimer was placed in this regard. But I cannot accept the statement made by the hon. Minister that we must vote R100,000 here on a claim of only R15,000 that he is making against Mr. Raubenheimer. Surely the claim must be R15,000, being the settlement figure the hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department has agreed upon in lieu of the claim of R140,000, and in order to keep Mr. Raubenheimer on his property we must now vote the R100,000. Surely that is the correct position as I understand it, and not as the Minister says of arriving at a settlement of R15,000 only. I hope the hon. Minister will clarify the position.</p>

<p>I think gradually we are getting a clear picture. I believe that this matter has been hopelessly confused by the way in which it is reflected here. I have now understood from the various statements by the hon. Minister that the position is as follows: That there was a fire; there were circumstances in that there was an exceptional storm, there were doubts as to what was the amount that the State would recover, and finally, when the person from whom a claim had been made, made an offer to a third party of R15,000 and offered to the Government R15,000, those offers, after consideration, were duly accepted. Now I would believe that there was either a signed agreement between the parties in regard to the settlement, or more likely, an exchange of letters between the attorneys acting on the two sides, the State attorney and the attorneys acting for the claimants, and in <span class="col_2151-2152" refersTo="page_1090"/>terms of those I have no doubt&#x2014;the Minister must tell me if I am wrong&#x2014;apparently the claim was settled.

<p>R15,000 which the State is prepared to accept. There is no certainty, because the matter has not been tried as to whether anything would have been recovered. There are innumerable cases where, on a criminal charge, a motorist has been held guilty, but on a subsequent civil charge he has been found not to be liable for the payment of damages. There has been a disagreement. Obviously the second claim would have been heard in the Supreme Court and there might have been a variation. We now leave out the third party, but clearly so far as the State is concerned the offer from Mr. Raubenheimer to the State was to pay an amount of R15,000. For administrative convenience, apparently, the State has now decided (I believe Mr. Raubenheimer had no part in that), or the accountants who advised the State have recommended that an amount should be shown which is the net value apparently of Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s assets after these two amounts of R15,000 had been paid. This amount is shown as the maximum which in any circumstances could have been recovered if Mr. Raubenheimer had been squeezed to the last drop.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>If that is so, then I say that the State has shown a settlement of R15,000; this R100,000 need not have been dealt with the way it is being dealt with, because in any case the State is clearly writing off a further R700,000, being the balance of what was originally claimed. Then surely the sensible thing to do is to write off the whole amount of R800,000, and not to deal with it by making it appear that the state is giving Mr. Raubenheimer a present of R100,042. In fact he made an offer of R15,000 which was accepted, and the matter should have come before us on that basis. If it had come before us on that basis, I think we could have avoided the whole of this discussion. We could have been told that there was this disastrous fire and tremendous damage to the State, which all of us regret, and I assume there was also great damage to Mr. Raubenheimer&#x2019;s own plantations and damage to adjoining farmers. But it seems to me that it is quite unfair to Mr. Raubenheimer, now that I see the facts, to make it appear as if the State is in fact out of the kindness of its heart giving him a present of R100,000, when the real fact is that he denied liability, but made an offer of R15,000 to try and come to a settlement and to save the future of his family and children.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Germison-District (Mr. Tucker) has outlined the implications fairly well here. He stated the position fairly reasonably. I just want to say that I think actually it was not absolutely essential to come to Parliament at this stage to approve of this <i>ex gratia</i> remission. We could have accepted the offer with the permission of the Treasury, and we could have remained silent about it at this stage, but then the Auditor-General would have had to report this matter to Parliament; he would have had to report that a claim which was originally instituted for R840,000 against a man whose assets, taking everything into consideration, amounted to R115,000, had been settled for R15,000&#x2014;a man who had been found guilty of a criminal offence in connection with this matter. He would have had to report this and then Parliament would have been able to discuss the matter. But the matter would then have been disposed of finally; the offer of settlement would then have been accepted and the matter could not have been re-opened. At the moment the offer has not yet been accepted. It has been intimated that if Parliament agrees we will accept the offer, but if Parliament refuses to accept the offer we will be able to go back and still claim the full R840,000. In this case Parliament is being given the opportunity to express its opinion as to the desirability of making this <i>ex gratia</i> remission, or rather on the desirability of accepting the amount offered by way of settlement and confirming the reasonableness of the offer, and Parliament also has the opportunity to discuss this matter before finality is reached.</p>

<p>In 1962. It usually takes a very long time to dispose of claims. Hon. members must remember that extensive investigations were instituted in connection with this matter and that there was also a criminal prosecution. For a civil claim this was not a long period, particularly having regard to the amount of the claim and the fact that there are different claimants.I think it is a very good thing that we are giving Parliament an opportunity to express its opinion with regard to this case. But the important point is that here we are offering Parliament the opportunity to exercise parliamentary control, which hon. members opposite so jealously guard and which we <span class="col_2153-2154" refersTo="page_1091"/>ourselves jealously guard. Here Parliament is being given the opportunity, before the case is disposed of, before it is closed, to express its opinion. If Parliament refuses to approve of this amount and indicates that a different course is to be followed, then we will follow that course. But if we had accepted the offer of settlement and had remained quiet about it, then Parliament would have read about it two years hence in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, but Parliament would then have been unable to do anything about it. That is the reason why we preferred to proceed along these lines in order to retain parliamentary control.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct. The hon. the Minister who has just sat down told us that this matter appears now so that Parliament can object or agree before the settlement is made. Now the important principle is this. Is this now to be the policy in regard to these matters? Is the policy to be different from what it is at the moment? The policy at the moment is that the Treasury, in consultation with the Department, will settle these matters, the Auditor-General will report it to the Select Committee on Public Accounts, which will either reject or accept it and then report to Parliament if it rejects it, and then Parliament will come into the picture. But here an entirely new principle appears by virtue of the fact that this item is on the Estimates. The Minister of Finance says he wanted to bring it to our notice, but this sort of thing happens every day. If a person knocks over a motor-car belonging to the Department of Defence and there is a claim by the Department against that person and it is settled, we are not told that this man is worth R50,000 and our claim could have been R40,000 but we have settled it for R10,000 and therefore we are asking for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R30,000 to be approved. It does not work that way and I think it is imperative that the Minister of Finance should tell us now that this is a new principle which is going to be adopted in regard to the preparation of the Estimates, that in respect of a claim which has not been decided in <i>quantum</i>, and where a settlement has been made, he is going to come to Parliament for prior authority instead of its being referred to Treasury and finding its way to the Auditor-General and coming before the Select Committee on Public Accounts.</p>

We are dealing here with a refund and not a remission, and I should like to ask what the basis of the refund was. Secondly, in regard to Item G, compensation for coin-operated machines, it is quite obvious that this is simply a nominal amount. Could the Minister at this stage give <span class="col_2155-2156" refersTo="page_1092"/>the House some indication of what is contemplated will be the amount of compensation which will have to be provided for ultimately?I think the House is entitled to more information in regard to this item.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The <i>ex gratia</i> payment to African Cold Storage (Pty.) Ltd. of R37,531 is explained as follows. As the result of a considerable increase in the price of meat, Messrs. African Cold Storage in Pretoria, to whom the contract to supply meat to Government institutions in the Pretoria and Voortrekker Heights area had been granted, applied for relief. On investigation it was established that the firm had actually incurred a loss as the result of an unexpected rise in the price of meat, and the Treasury accordingly approved of an amount of R37,531 being placed on the Estimates.</p>

<p>The item in regard to compensation for coin-operated machines&#x2014;that is a new sub-head, and we consider it necessary at this stage in order to enable the Department to meet claims in the first quarter of the new financial year, if there are any. As implied by the heading, the money will be utilized to compensate owners of coin-operated machines. The position is that the Government has decided to pay compensation, but the basis of the compensation has to be fixed by the Committee dealing with this matter, which was appointed under the chairmanship of Professor Reynders. They will have to evolve a basis of compensation. At the moment I cannot give any particulars of that. This is merely a nominal amount to get it voted, but I suppose it will be more or less on the lines of the compensation awarded when we switched over to the decimal system.</p>

The wording used here is &#x201C;ex <i>gratia</i> refund&#x201D;, but surely he was not refunded anything. He was granted compensation and the word &#x201C;refund&#x201D; therefore does not fit in with the explanation given by the Minister.

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has given an explanation, but is not a dangerous precedent being established? A firm finds that the prices of the product for which it has tendered have gone up, and now it asks for compensation. Is that going to be a general precedent which will apply to people who supply food to Government institutions? Where do we start and where do we stop in a matter of this kind? Here is a company which must have calculated its risks when it gave a firm tender for the supply of foodstuffs, meat. It must have made estimates. Surely if it was expected that there would be an increase there should have been an escalator clause, but according to the Minister&#x2019;s explanation this firm found it had incurred a loss and asked for compensation. There are hundreds of companies which tender for Government institutions, and because of the inflation we have at present they are finding that by the time they have to deliver they make losses on Government contracts. Are they going to get compensation? There is a principle here which will open up the door to further <i>ex gratia</i> payments and we should like to have some assurance from the Minister as to whether this will be the general practice. The Minister of Defence will have all sorts of contracts with people who submit tenders, and then they find that due to the increase in the price of steel or labour they may have losses. Will the Treasury make <i>ex gratia</i> payments to them? What is the good of having a tender and a contract if that firm is going to be compensated for the loss incurred if there is an increase in prices? Is the converse going to apply, will refunds be given if the firm makes too much profit? If prices of meat go down, will the African Cold Storage get a refund? It is no good having a tender system and a firm giving a tender and entering into a contract and then getting a refund unless it happens in very exceptional cases.</p>

<p>This is not the first example of a remission of this nature. We have done it time and again. In my time as Minister of Finance, I remember cases that where a contract has been entered into and circumstances have arisen over which the contractor had no control, particularly as far as foodstuffs are concerned, that we have gone into the matter very thoroughly. It is not every application we accede to, but if the circumstances are such as in the opinion of the Treasury to justify that this man should not suffer a loss, then we give a remission of this nature. But it is very closely investigated by the Treasury, and we do not do it as a matter of routine. But where the circumstances are such, as has happened in the past, where there has been a sudden rise in prices and foodstuffs must be delivered, that has been done, because otherwise they might cease their deliveries and hospitals and other institutions will be in a difficulty. In order to ensure that deliveries are made, we are prepared to meet them in such cases as the present one.</p>

<p>I do not know why hon. members are getting hot under the collar. Every year we get before us a number of contracts that have been revised to the detriment of the State. They are tenders that were accepted and where the tenderers subsequently found that they could not carry out the contracts because of unexpected price increases. What is the position? The hon. member for Pinetown says the person should have made allowance for the risk he was taking. What would ten to one have happened is that he would have tendered 10 per cent or 15 per cent higher than he did for the meat he had to deliver to the hospitals and hostels and if you add all that together and you think of all the food that has to be supplied to State institutions is could have cost the State millions of rand more every year. That is why there is an arrangement that the Auditor-General must annually report to the Select Committee all the contracts that have been revised to the detriment of the State and they are subsequently analyzed. This is a case where it was revised before the end of the financial year and it is quite right that, instead of our only being confronted with this on the Select Committee next year, it is submitted to the House this year and the House asked to vote the amount.</p>

<p>I am pleased that we have this opportunity of eventually getting clarity on this question, namely, that if the State is not prepared to meet a tenderer who has tendered on the basis of making a very small profit and is suddenly confronted with an unexpected increase in price it will cost the State millions of additional rand because these people will tender at higher figures. That is the important point we have to face up to and I trust hon. members will consider this aspect of the matter. Those hon. members who serve or who have served on the Select Committee will also remember that we deal with numbers of such cases every year. In every case the chairman of the Tender Board comes and explains the position. They bring all the evidence and prove their case conclusively. No contract is revised if the person cannot prove beyond any doubt that he is suffering a loss.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet I just want to ask the hon. the Minister something in connection with the Advisory Board on Coinage. I notice reference is made here to an Information programme. I want to ask the Minister whether this board only travels around and gives information or whether it travels around trying to persuade people to accept its views, views which were rejected by the Select Committee last year. My information is that they have arrived at a post office, for example, and insisted that they abolish the 2&#x00BD;c postage and accept the 5c tariff. I get this information from municipalities and other bodies. If that is the case these people are trying to wreck something which has practically been accepted by Parliament. I should like the hon. the Minister to give us clarity on this matter, even if he only replies later.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this type of contract is entered into without any provision being made for adjustment in the case of a movement up or down in the prices involved? Particularly in the case of meat where a large measure of control is exercised over the floor price, I should like to know whether it is customary to insert such a provision in these contracts, particularly where one knows that there is a wide fluctuation between the lowest and the highest price, so that for each agreed movement upwards or downwards the contract adjusts itself. If there is not such a condition I can quite understand a firm coming along and asking for relief, and I can even understand a sympathetic Government giving them relief. But it does open the door to a very serious position whereby tenderers for such contracts can deliberately lower the original tender price and then at a later stage come along and claim that prices of material, etc. have risen and ask to be compensated. It follows the principle very largely of the extras clause you get in building contracts, where the tenderer who tenders at a low price often secures the contract knowing full well that the extras will pay him handsomely once he has landed the contract. I think in a contract of this nature it is customary trade practice to insert such an adjustment clause, and it would be a surprise to me to learn that in a Government contract there is no such protection given against a rise or fall in prices.</p>

What they have done, as far as I know, when it became known that there was a possibility of the post office increasing the rates for telephone calls from public telephones, was to say that if the Post Office decided to do that the Post Office must advise the board as soon as possible because in that case they would have to adopt a totally different attitude in respect of the automatic machines they were busy changing; if a change were to be made they wanted to know about it so that they could make arrangements to take the fact that it was going to happen into account.

<p>I wonder whether the Minister can tell us, in regard to the item dealing with the information programme of the Advisory Board on the coinage, whether he has been consulted in respect of the programme for which the Minister is asking R30,000. and what is the basis of this information programme that is being conducted, and whether any private individuals or private consultants have been employed by this advisory board. I think it would be advantageous to the committee if the Minister could give some sort of general outline of the information programme the board intends to embark upon as far as the new coinage is concerned.</p>

<p>The decimilization programme embodied a lot of other additional expense and this campaign will, I presume, follow a somewhat similar pattern. What I specifically want to know is this. The Minister says a private firm of consultants has been consulted. Is this R30,000 the fee that is being paid to the consultants, or on what basis are they employed, and who carries the responsibility for this information programme?</p>

<p>The firm of consultants works in close collaboration with the Department and particularly with this advisory board. They have to approve all the publicity that is undertaken.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>When this temporary agreement was entered into, based on the expenditure, I think, for the year 1955-6, allowing for an increase, provision was made at the same time that if any increases were made by the Government in salaries; increases which the Provincial Administration <span class="col_2161-2162" refersTo="page_1095"/>would have to follow, the Government, over and above the other provisions, would pay 50 per cent of such rises. This is what we are doing here. At the Cape there is increased aid to civil pensioners, R80,000, and a salary adjustment in the case of nurses, R172,000; that represents our 50 per cent. Natal underestimated the amount required as a result of the 1963 salary adjustment. The balance of the increase is due to the 1964 salary adjustment in respect of Indian teachers, R160,000, nurses R170,000 and Bantu R85,000. The increase in respect of the Transvaal is mainly due to the fact that they under-estimated their requirements in respect of salaries, wages and allowances. The balance of the increase is due to increased aid to pensioners, R36,000, increased salaries of nurses (R95,000), and the adjustment of salaries of Indian and Coloured teachers R32.700. The decrease in respect of the Orange Free State is due to an over-estimate of the 1963 salary adjustment, against which must be put increased aid to pensioners, R7,000, increased salaries of nurses, R33,400, and increased salaries of Bantu, R32,500. That is how the amount is made up.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members will notice that all these items are refunds and remissions of grace and favour. If hon. members would like me to do so. I will explain all these items. Where a number of items are governed by the same principle I will group them together. The item referred to by the hon. member stands by itself so I will deal with it first. This is something which we have every year. In terms of Section 48 of the Income Tax Act, the undistributed profits tax is levied on so much of the distributable income of a private company as has not been distributed by way of dividends during the &#x201C;specified period&#x201D;. The specified period is defined as a period of 12 months ending six months after the specified date for any year of assessment. The &#x201C;specified date&#x201D; means the last date of the year of assessment in question. The specified date of A. Fruman &#x0026; Associates (Pty.) Ltd. is 30 June. The specified period is therefore the calendar year; it ends on 31 December. The company&#x2019;s principal assets consist of shares in other companies and it derives its income in the form of dividends from those investments. It has been the practice of the company to distribute by way of dividends to its shareholders the dividend income received by it as soon as it is received, but as a matter of fact these dividends were received after the specified period&#x2014;after 31 December, and strictly in terms of the law they have not complied with the rule that it should be distributed within the specified period. This was outside the specified period but it was distributed as soon as it was received. We have this type of case every year. The company has thus become liable for undistributed profits tax for the sole reason that the dividend of R157,500 which was declared on 15 December 1962, but which was not distributed during the 1963 specified period the year ending 31 December, as is required by the Act, could not be taken into account. By distributing its income as soon as it was received the company complied with the spirit and the intention of the law, but in the meantime, strictly according to the law, they had been assessed with the undistributed profits tax and it now proposed that the undistributed profits tax of R39,350 be remitted as an act of grace. Do hon. members want explanations in respect of the other items as well?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Let me deal first with the two temporary liquor licences to Strong and Pienaar. A temporary liquor licence was issued to Mr. Strong, manager of Duff&#x2019;s Continental Hotel for the sale of liquor at a function to be held on a Sunday, 25 November. In terms of the Liquor Act a temporary liquor licence may not be issued for the sale of liquor on a Sunday. The licensee was informed by the chairman of the liquor licensing board and the liquor staff of the police that no liquor could be sold under the licence as it had been issued in error, and as it was issued in error we are now asking that the amount paid be remitted as an act of grace. No use could be made of the licence, and it was purely an error on the part of the licensing official who issued it.</p>

<p>The position is very much the same in the other case. A temporary liquor licence was <span class="col_2163-2164" refersTo="page_1096"/>issued to Mr. Pienaar, secretary of the Sentrale Karoskou, De Aar, for the sale of liquor on the showgrounds between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. on 15-16 October. The police had no objection to a temporary liquor licence, and it was issued to Mr. Pienaar by the acting assistant magistrate. When the magistrate checked the work which had been dealt with during the day&#x2014;he was aware that a public auction of livestock and not an exhibition was to be held by the Sentrale Karoskou&#x2014;and he noticed that the licence had been issued in error, he immediately communicated with the district commandant of police. The latter, who was under the impression that the licence was required for a show, because it was being held on the showground, raised no objection under that misapprehension. The applicant had paid for the licence and he had no use for it, so the licence fee was refunded.</p>

<p>Then I come to &#x201C;late hours occasional licence&#x201D;, which was issued to Mr. Stonall in his capacity as secretary of the East African Pavilion Cafe, in terms of which the company&#x2019;s hours of sale of liquor were extended to 9.30 p.m. on 15, 16, 22, 23, 29 and 30 November; the hours were extended by one hour per day. At a SDecial sitting of the Liquor Licensing Board in Johannesburg on 22 November, the board authorised an extension of the hours of business of the licensee to 11.30 p.m. as a special privilege. Again it was not necessary to have this late hours occasional licence because he had been given a licence generally to keep open his business until 11.30 p.m. This was only to 9.30 p.m., and he was given wider powers by the Liquor Licensing Board; this licence was not necessary and the Secretary of the Treasury has approved of the amount of R16, being a fee of R4 per hour for each of the days included in the original payment of R24, being refunded as an act of grace, subject of course to the prior approval of Parliament.</p>

<p>Then I come to the wholesale liquor licences: Springbok Wynkelders, Van Riebeeck Wyn en Brandewyn Maatskappy, Christina Magdalena Myburgh, Hermanus Christoffel Pienaar, Christoffel Hercules Kruger, Pretoria Wine and Spirit Company (Pty.) Ltd., Kloof Bottelstoor, A. Sweidan and King (Pty.) Ltd., Myrtle Grove Wine Producers (Pty.) Limited, Harmony Bottle Store (Pty.) Limited, Bosveld Bottle Stores (Pty.) Ltd., and Avenue Bottle Store (Pty.) Limited. This applies to all of them; In terms of Section 55<i>bis</i> of the Liquor Act of 1928, the holder of a wholesale liquor licence may, subject to certain provisions, apply for the conversion of that licence into a bottle liquor licence; that is in terms of the amendment of 1963. Authority was granted to the holders of wholesale liquor licences, Nos. 1 to 9, that is to say. Springbok Wvnkelders up to and including Myrtle Grove Wine Producers, for conversion, and, upon payment of the prescribed fees, reduced in accordance with Section 12 (3) of the Liquor Act, new bottle liquor licences were issued. Licensees Nos. 10,11 and 12 held wholesale liquor licences, as well as bottle liquor licences. Section 76 of the Liquor Act, however, provides that an unlimited amount of liquor may be sold under any bottle liquor licence and wholesale liquor licences were therefore not required. The Secretary to the Treasury has approved of the refund of the licence duty as an act of grace, subject, however, to parliamentary approval being obtained. That is also a case where the amount was paid, but it was not necessary, and in the circumstances we are asking that it be refunded.</p>

<p>Then I come to the wholesale liquor licences issued to Wolmaransstad Drankwinkel, Observatory Wholesale Liquor Supplies (Pty.) Ltd., Rocklands Wine and Brandy Company (Pty.) Ltd., Springbok Bottle Store, Letaba Bottle Store (Pty.) Ltd., Star Wine &#x26; Brandy (Pty.) Limited, Barnet Dansky and Jan Pickard (Tvl.) (Edms.) Bpk.: In terms of Section 55<i>bis</i> of the Liquor Act, as amended in 1963, the holder of a wholesale liquor licence may, subject to certain provisions, apply for the conversion of that licence into a bottle liquor licence. Authority was granted to the above-mentioned holders of wholesale liquor licences for the conversion and upon payment of the prescribed fees, reduced in accordance with Section 12 (3) of the Liquor Act, new bottle liquor licences were issued to them. The Secretary to the Treasury has approved as an act of grace of the refund, calculated on a <i>pro rata</i> basis of the wholesale liquor licences originally paid, subject to parliamentary approval being obtained. This is the same type of case as the others.</p>

<p>Item 224 (b) of the old Customs Tariff made provision for duty-free importation of &#x201C;such preparations for the eradication of disease in stock as may be approved by the Minister&#x201D;, and, under this <span class="col_2165-2166" refersTo="page_1097"/>provision, a preparation containing the drug thibenzole as active ingredient was approved by the Minister. M.S.D. (Pty.) Ltd. later decided to make the preparation in the Republic and, as a result of a request by the Division of Veterinary Services to ensure that adequate supplies of the preparation are available, placed large orders for the active ingredient under the misapprehension that the ingredient would also be admitted duty-free under the above quoted tariff provisions. When the mistake was discovered the importers made representations to the Board of Trade and Industries immediately and the board recommended that the ingredient be admitted under rebate of duty, but in the meantime the company had paid the duty; it was legally payable, and under those circumstances the necessary rebate provision was created by Government Notice on 16 November 1962, but, as a result of the urgency of the matter, certain consignments on which the duty amounted to R35,178, were required and had to be cleared before the date of publication of the notice. The importers did not include the duty in the price of the preparation to the public, and in all the circumstances of the case it is recommended that Parliament approve of an <i>ex gratia</i> refund of the duty involved. It was only a question of a week or two; the company satisfied the requirements, and the whole object was to give a refund of duty for this preparation as a whole. This was a more profitable way to South Africa of obtaining the preparation.</p>

<p>Can the hon. the Minister give us the reason for the very big increase in Item F? The original estimate was R3,631,500 and the revised estimate is the best part of R1,000,000 more.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>This is the annual provision that we have to make. These payments are all made as a result of the customs agreement of 1910 between the Republic and the High Commission Territories. The agreement provides for the payment to the Territories of a reasonable portion of the duties collected in the Republic on goods which are sent to the Territories for consumption, and <i>vice versa</i>, and the payment of the duties&#x201C; except excise duties on spirits, beer and wine manufactured in the Republic, which were excluded because the Territories wanted to exercise control&#x201C;will not depend upon covering documents, but will be made on the basis of paragraph 12 of the Schedule to the South Africa Act of 1909. On that basis these payments represent a fixed percentage of the collections in the Republic and the Territories. We could not go and calculate every year what amount went through, but they had a fixed percentage which amounted to 1.31097 per cent for all three of them, divided as follows: Basutoland, .88575 per cent; Bechuanaland, .27622 per cent; and Swaziland, .149 per cent. Prior to the financial year 1956-7 these payments were made as a draw-back from revenue as required by the South African Act, but, as a result of discussions in the Select Committee on Public Accounts, it was decided to make provision in the Estimates of Expenditure and to vote it for the year. The estimated amounts due to the Territories are as follows: The original estimate was R2,780,000; the revised estimate is R3,490,000, and it is a difference of R710,000 that we are being asked to vote here. The amount due to the Territories was under-estimated as a result of the increase in customs and excise collections for the whole of the Republic. The amount was higher than we anticipated and, therefore, their percentage was calculated on the amount anticipated by us at the beginning when these original estimates were made as to what the total imports of the country would be. There is a big increase in the figure and, as their percentage is a fixed percentage, they, of course, have to share in the increase.</p>

<p>The hon. member must put that question to the hon. Minister of Railways. The Rules of the House do not allow the Minister of Transport to reply to her.</p>

<p>Hon. members know perfectly well that the Railway Administration sends an account to Treasury in regard to the anticipated loss on these services in the ensuing year. The accounts are made up periodically and then the adjustments take place. All that my Department has to do with the matter is to have the amount debited to my Vote and paid by Treasury. Hon. members are quite aware what the position is. The principle has been accepted over the years in regard to the building of new Bantu railway lines that all losses are subsidized by Treasury. The House has accepted that principle in every Construction Bill that has come before the House. Obviously this will increase because new lines are being built; a new line is being built to Chatworth.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Provision is made under this head for four different types of service. The first is pension benefits and allowances to dependants in those cases where persons have not contributed to a pension fund or where persons retire from the service before they have reached the pensionable age. To give an example: A large number of non-Whites are not members of a pension fund. They attain the pensionable age. Although allowance has been made for a normal increase <span class="col_2169-2170" refersTo="page_1099"/>in this service, it appears that it will be inadequate to cover the additional expenditure. It is an incalculable factor. You do not know how many there will be.</p>

<p>The second is compensation payable in terms of either the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act of 1941 or the Government Service Pension Act of 1955. Government employees who have sustained injuries while on duty have to be compensated or their dependants in case of their dying as a result of such injuries. Because the services have been expanded the number of accidents have also increased. I think for instance of the accidents amongst the police and amongst men in the army. Because the number of accidents has increased the compensation has increased. When the number of accidents increase we have to pay more compensation. You can never determine exactly how many accidents there will be.</p>

<p>The third is temporary allowance, bonuses and supplementary allowances to civil pensioners in terms of Section 47 of Act 33 of 1943. Additional benefits are paid to university and technical college staff on retirement. A large number are involved, not only in technical colleges. Hon. members will remember that provision was made in the Additional Estimates for the current financial year for an amount of R245,000 for supplementary allowances to White civil pensioners. The object was to guarantee the White civil pensioner a minimum income of R42 in the case of single persons and R84 in the case of married persons. Because of the limited data at our disposal the amount to be spent on this service was estimated too low and it is now estimated that an additional amount of R700,000 will be required. Hon. members will remember that in the case of civil pensions and social pensions, which are separate entities. We did away with the social pension and introduced the supplementary pension. By introducing that supplementary pension we ensured that the pensioner would receive a minimum income of R42 in the case of single persons and R84 per month in the case of married persons. I must say there was a sample test. Because of the limited data available the expenditure on this service was under-estimated. This is another case where we do not know how many will have to be covered by this procedure. It is now estimated that an additional amount of R700,000 will be required. I might just say that this additional expenditure is largely met, as hon. members can understand, by the savings on social pensions and allowances which have been withdrawn because of the granting of supplementary pensions. The one wipes out the other partly but not quite.</p>

<p>Then we have the cost of the corresponding supplementary allowance paid to railway pensioners. That is borne by the Railway Administration until a male pensioner reaches the age of 65 years and a female pensioner the age of 60 years. After that the Central Government assumes responsibility for the additional expenditure. This expenditure was estimated at R200,000. This is another case where we had to get the data from the Department of Railways. After they had gone thoroughly into the matter it appeared that we had under-estimated. It was estimated at R200,000 and it is now dear that there are more Railway pensioners who will qualify for the supplementary allowance than originally anticipated and a further amount of R530,000 is required to cover the additional expenditure. Hon. members will realize that the effect of the whole process is that nobody will receive less than he received previously but that under this arrangement many will receive more than they received previously. I therefore think this is expenditure that can be recommended without any reservation.</p>

<p>This Mr. Peters was granted a bursary by the Public Service Commission of R400 per annum for three years, i.e. R1,200, on condition that after completion of his studies he would enter the service of the State for a period of four years. The subjects he took were geology and physics. After he finished his studies in 1961 he was appointed in the Department of Mines as a junior geologist. After he had served in that capacity for about two years he unfortunately developed a serious mental upset as a <span class="col_2171-2172" refersTo="page_1100"/>result of which he was medically examined and found by the doctor to be completely unfit to carry on with this or any other work in the Public Service. The result was that he was dismissed. An amount of R1,200 then remained outstanding plus approximately R610 interest, because the interest is calculated at 10 per cent. That came to R1,810 and because he cannot pay this back&#x2014;he is unemployed&#x2014;we have to write it off and that is being done by way of this <i>ex gratia</i> remission.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>This amount is made up as follows: Subsidies in respect of interest and redemption for which no provision has been made in the main Estimates. The hon. member knows that the State has to provide 40 per cent of the interest and redemption charges. That amounts to R491,785. Secondly, compensation to the University of Natal in respect of the non-White section which has been closed and for which no provision has been made in the main Estimates. That amounts to R155,449. The third is additional expenditure as a result of the admission of more students to the non-White medical school attached to the University of Natal. That amounts to R4,162. Then there are bursaries to non-White students to undergo medical training. The actual amount required for 1964-5 in respect of 28 preliminary and first year students at R150 per student amounts to R4,200; 66 second-year to sixth-year students at R200 amount to R13,200. That makes a total of R17,400 less the original estimate of R15,150. That comes to R2,250. There were some savings in respect of holiday bonuses amounting to R1,646. That leaves R652,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that has nothing to do with this. This concerns only one matter. We are afraid that with the digging of the tunnels the soil that is dug out may perhaps contain valuable material. This soil is simply dumped there and may perhaps be lost for all time. Those people interested in palaeontology, archaeology and anthropology only want to exercise supervision there. This amount is really only to give them a little assistance as far as their travelling costs, etc., are concerned. They have their own funds. The State does not pay all their expenses. This is merely a subsidy so that these people can exercise supervision so that any valuable material that may perhaps be excavated is not lost.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>This amount appears here as a result of the revised rates introduced in respect of soil conservation works as from 6 February 1964. For example, the total amount allowed to be spent per farm in respect of water provision was increased from R1,200 to R1,500; in respect of paddock fencing the amount was increased from R600 to R750; in respect of the prevention of the development of brackish land the amount was increased from R600 to R750; and in respect of works for combating the development of brackish land from R1,200 to R1,500. This, of course, led to a considerable increase in the expenditure. Consequently our estimate was too low. Additional provision now has to be made. At the same time we readjusted the whole of our costing in respect of these works to the actual present cost of material and labour, whereas previously this had been based on the costs prevailing at the time. As a result we are making provision for this amount of R668,900 in the Part Appropriation.</p>

<p>It is not merely a matter of the subsidy having been increased by 20 per cent, but as a result of this increase of 20 per cent many more people to-day decide to carry out soil conservation works, for it has now become a paying proposition for them. It is not that they did not want to carry out these works before, but rather that they felt that there was too little encouragement. I have figures here which indicate that considerable progress has been made with these works during the past year.

<p>In 1954 a certain applicant, Mr. J. C. van Heerden of Alexanderfontein, Potgietersrus, applied to the Government to sink a borehole for him. He required it for domestic and for stock-watering purposes. We bored to a depth of 1,026 feet, and the borehole yielded 2,500 gallons per hour. The amount appearing here represents the total cost. On 19 September 1960, i.e. some considerable time after the borehole had been sunk, this applicant informed the Department that he had had the water tested and that the fluorine content of the water was so high that the Director of Veterinary Services had found it to contain 15.4 parts of fluorine to 1,000,000 parts of water, which in actual fact represented a poisonous concentration, and which could have a very harmful effect on the human body. The said official advised him not to use this water either for domestic or for stock-watering purposes. As the safety margin was 1.5 parts to 1,000,000, and not 15.4, this borehole was of absolutely no value to him. In terms of the regulations in force at the time persons who had made use of the services of Government boring machines and had found no water did not have to pay anything. This particular borehole was not a dry one, but the water it yielded was poisonous, and consequently it was as useless as a dry one. Therefore we are asking for this remission. Quite some time has elapsed since these events, and consequently we cannot make good this amount to this person in any other than to make provision for it here.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to take this question of Item G.&#x2014;&#x201C;Boring Services&#x201D;, a little further. Could we have an explanation from the hon. Minister in regard to this hole that was bored by his Department for Mr. Van Heerden? I believe the Minister said that in 1960, six years after the hole had been bored, it was suddenly discovered that the water for cattle and human drinking purposes was useless and was found to be poisonous, and the Minister feels that in those circumstances a remission should be made to Mr. Van Heerden in respect of any further commitments he may have had in the granting of a loan from his Department for the boring services in respect of this particular borehole. This rather puzzles me, because, as I understand the regulations of the Minister&#x2019;s Department, when a hole is bored for drinking purposes, tests are made by the Minister&#x2019;s Department before the hole is handed over, to see if the water is of satisfactory quality for drinking purposes and that it does not hold any poisonous substances that may be detrimental to animals. As the hon. Minister knows, in the area of Potgietersrust, where this hole of Mr. Van Heerden is obviously situated, it does occur from time to time that where holes are bored for water certain holes do render these poisonous substances and that the water is found unsuitable. What I cannot understand is that, after six years, it was found that the water was unsuitable. Presumably Mr. Van Heerden has had the use of this borehole for six years. Did any of his cattle die? Did Mr. Van Heerden or his family or visitors find themselves to be poisoned? Suddenly, six years later, this was apparently discovered, and now, in 1964, we hear from the hon. Minister that this remission should be given to Mr. Van Heerden in respect of his commitments. Obviously other points arise from that. The hon. Minister is well aware that certain subsidies were granted in respect of this borehole. May I ask if this amount of R1,170 is taking into consideration any subsidy that may have been granted to this particular applicant in this particular instance? There is a further principle at stake. The hon. Minister well knows that in this area of the Transvaal, where this particular hole is situated, numbers of holes have been drilled by his Department which have yielded no return at all, or 100 or 200 gallons for drinking purposes, and that the hole, after a very short while, has dried up. The farmer still has to fulfill his commitments to the State. But here is a case where, six years after the actual hole was drilled, this particular farmer is allowed to forego his indebtedness to the State, after getting six years&#x2019; benefit out of the hole, whereas others, whose holes have dried up, have to continue to meet their obligations to the State. Where does the principle come in? Why in this particular case must there be these particular circumstances that entitle this particular applicant to get a remission of such a large amount? I think the hon. Minister must <span class="col_2177-2178" refersTo="page_1103"/>give us a far more detailed explanation, because we are not satisfied with the explanation the hon. Minister has given in this case. On the surface it looks a most unsatisfactory position, and I hope the hon. Minister will now rise and give us the particulars.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not blame the hon. member for wanting more information, because I notice that in his case it is particularly necessary that he should be given information. He spoke about principles. May I refer him to the boring regulations that were in force in proclaimed Government boring-areas in 1964? I propose to deal with this at some length because my reply may serve also to enlighten other hon. members apart from the hon. member. For the purposes of boring-services the Republic of South Africa was divided into two parts at that time. The part situated north of a certain line that was drawn at that time enjoyed certain privileges and could make use of Government boring services upon certain terms and conditions that did not apply in the other areas lying south of that line. The people north of the line included, <i>inter alia</i>, the people in Potgietersrust, where this Mr. Van Heerden lives, and the boring-regulations that were in force there at that time were such that when a farmer applied for the services of a Government boring-machine and awaited his turn and eventually obtained these services, he did not have to make any payment to the State where a borehole was sunk, whether to a depth of 1,000 feet or more than 1,000 feet (as in this case) and no water was found. In that event he paid nothing and the State bore the cost. If he found water, however, he had to pay the State according to a certain rate. The factor that determined whether a bore-hole was a dry one or not was not the quality of the water, but the quantity of water&#x2014;usable water&#x2014;that was obtained. In actual fact, however, the amount to be paid was based on the quantity of water obtained, and the minimum was 60 gallons per hour. You may get a case where the water from a particular borehole, in this case one that yielded more than 2,000 gallons per hour, is perfectly good to the taste. The Department of Water Affairs tested the water from this particular borehole at the time to see whether it met the requirements. To all intents and purposes it was unnecessary to carry out the test, for the bore-hole obviously met the requirements. The water was good to the taste, the animals drank it and the people drank it, and everything was fine. Hitherto it has never been the function of the Department of Water Affairs to determine whether there are any harmful elements contained in any water that is found; to go along and make analyzes for farmers. Nor has it ever been our responsibility, when sinking a bore-hole and finding water, to give a guarantee that the subterranean water that is found will provide a perennial supply or only a temporary one. How would we know this? Enormous and intensive geological surveys would have to be carried out to establish this, and in my opinion the science of geology has not yet advanced to a stage where it is possible to determine what the position is, and I do not think there is any country in the world that can determine whether a subterranean source of water will be a permanent one or not or whether it will perhaps dry up unseasonably. It cannot be determined in advance how long such a water supply will last. Consequently the regulations in force at the time were more concerned with the quantity of the water and the question as to whether it was usable. This water we usable. I do not know what the particular circumstances were that caused this man to go to the Director of Veterinary Services and to tell him that he thought that possibly there were symptoms of deterioration or disease amongst his stock; but the fact of the matter is that eventually, six years later&#x2014;I understand the water is still there in this same hole&#x2014;it was established, after the water had been analyzed and various tests had been carried out, that this water was harmful both to human beings and to animals. For the information of the hon. member I may say that there are areas in the North-Western Cape where even to-day people are drinking water containing fluorine, water which is perhaps not as harmful as this water but which nevertheless is fairly detrimental to the health of human beings and of animals; but because the effects are slow in making themselves felt, and because there is no other water available, they do drink it. I am merely stating facts. However, once we have established that water is particularly unsuitable, or is unusable, owing to its tremendously high fluorine content, what we do in effect simply amounts to this that a bore-hole that has been sunk and that yields a considerable quantity of water, but the water of which is not good enough for constant use by human beings and/or animals, in other words, water of which is declared useless, is dealt with as though it were a dry bore-hole. Unfortunately it was only much later that this man established that the water was harmful. We made certain investigations. As a matter of fact, I want to mention that the State subsequently went along and sank other bore-holes on the same farm, and that when we found that the water from these boreholes had the same fluorine content, a geologist from the Department of Mines was sent to that farm. His geological survey and report indicated that he certainly would not recommend that the State should ever again bore for water for domestic or animal consumption on that farm. That gave us all the more reason to come to Parliament in this case and to say that since the State had sunk a bore-hole for that man and was therefore responsible to provide water for primary use, and also in view of the report we subsequently obtained, and in the light of other tests we carried out on that farm, we were justified in asking Parliament to remit the amount due to the State by this man. That is the position.</p>

<p>I almost felt inclined to speak in my second language, English, so that the hon. member might perhaps understand me better, but I know that he can understand Afrikaans well, but is feigning ignorance. The point is simply that it is not the Department&#x2019;s responsibility to determine whether or not the water is usable. If I have carried out the boring-work for a man and have rendered him the assistance that the State can render a man by means of its boring-services, and success has been achieved and water has been found, then surely it is that man&#x2019;s responsibility to make out a case and to come and tell me that it was not such a success as my Department thought it was. It is not my responsibility. Has the hon. member ever considered how much additional Government expenditure there would be if I, as Minister of Water Affairs, had to accept the principle that it was the responsibility of my Department and of the Government to do all these additional things for the farmer and to determine the value and the usability of his water? Surely this is something that can be determined by the man himself.</p>

<p>This amount is actually R180,000 but because there has been a saving under other sub-heads of R665 the amount asked for here is R179.335. This amount reflects the desire of the Government to promote the decentralization of industries to the Eastern Cape, namely, the Ciskei/Transkei area. As hon. members will know, from an industrial point of view, that area is faced with very serious problems and is in many respects a backward industrial area. The White areas which surround non-White areas are in particular not areas blessed with afforestation, mining and agricultural activities as in the case of other areas of the country. It is an area where there is a scarcity of the raw materials which can form the basis of industrial activity. Basic facilities such as power, water and transport are inadequate and hon. members who know that area will know that coal is much more expensive there than in other areas of the country, that electricity is much more expensive and that they have railway problems.</p>

The Minister has so far indicated his general policy, and you, Mr. Chairman, has indicated that that cannot be discussed because that was dealt with under the original Estimates.

Therefore we want to know why there was this substantial increase of R179,000, and we are entitled to have details in this regard so that we can find to what extent this involves industries in the Transkei and the Ciskei. We cannot make suggestions, but we can ask the hon.

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to ask the hon. Minister two questions in regard to sub-head E. The first question is that this item refers to a &#x201C;nominal provision&#x201D;. In the hon. Minister&#x2019;s reply he gave no indication of his long-term expectations of the ultimate amount in respect of which this is a nominal provision. He dealt with the policy, but he gave no indication of how far this was &#x201C;nominal&#x201D;. We have gone up some 750 per cent, from R26,000 to R206,000, over 700 per cent increase, and we have asked the hon. Minister to give us the reasons. He has dealt with policy, but did not indicate whether the R26,000 is nominal or whether the R206,000 is nominal. If, within the course of this year, the amount can increase by 750 per cent, and R206,000 becomes a nominal amount, what will the ultimate amount be? I feel that the hon. Minister owes this House and the country an explanation of that, particularly with regard to this new item, the question of the subsidies. The second question is that in regard to the footnote, there is a reference to the Transkei/Ciskei complex. Those are not the only border areas, and I feel that the hon. Minister should indicate why the Transkei/Ciskei, and not other border areas, such as the Natal border areas, such as cities like Pietermaritzburg, are not included, why Rosslyn near Pretoria are not included. Why should a policy designed for border areas suddenly be restricted to one complex, in terms of the footnote? The footnote refers only to the Transkei/Ciskei, but the item is &#x201C;Development of border areas&#x201D;. Are we now having an A-class border area, a B-class border area and a C-class border area? It says here &#x201C;Development of border areas&#x201D;, but the footnote qualifies it as &#x201C;Transkei/Ciskei&#x201D;. Are we to have a T-class, the Transkei class of border areas which falls in a different category and is entitled to different privileges from the other border areas? This matter is far too important and far too vital for the hon. Minister to get away with vague generalizations. This is part of the fundamental policy of the Government, and the Minister cannot get away with vague generalizations when he has an item on the Estimates, a new item, in respect of which we are entitled to ask, not merely a general statement on the Government&#x2019;s ideas and principles, but the detail of what is going to happen. What is the Government doing about this? Is this only applicable to the Transkei, or is it going to be extended until the R260,000 which we are asked to vote is itself a nominal amount? Finally, I want to ask the hon. Minister to state categorically here to-night that this establishes a new principle that Consolidated Revenue is to subsidize the South African Railways in regard to the transport of goods in the national interest at lower rates; in other words, do we now to-night establish the new principle that Consolidated Revenue will pay to the S.A. Railways or to the producers&#x2014;whichever way you work it, it is a subsidy on transport&#x2014;a subsidy in regard to any transport which the Government feels should be carried out at a lower rate than that laid down by normal railway tariffs&#x2014;any class of goods? We have at the moment special tariffs for agricultural products, exports, and so on, which enjoy preferential railway tariff rates. Now we are faced with a different principle that the Railways are not granting special tariffs for these goods which are required to be transported in the national interest, but that Consolidated Revenue is now paying the Railways the difference between normal tariffs and what the Government believes is necessary as an overall policy. We are entitled to ask if this is an isolated question, or is this part of a new Government policy whereby Consolidated Revenue will now subsidize Railway transport to provide cheaper movement of goods if that movement is required at a cheaper rate in order to carry out the Government&#x2019;s ideological policies? I think we are entitled to a clear explanation from the Minister on that issue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Must I repeat them? I indicated that that area was at a disadvantage as far as raw materials was concerned, as far as markets were concerned, as far as power and water were concerned, as far as coal was concerned and in many other respects. I also pointed out that industries were leaving that area; that industrialists refused to establish or to expand industries there and that we had received representations in this connection. I should like hon. members who represent that area to stand up and tell us what they think of the situation there. Let the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) and other hon. members who represent constituencies in that area stand up and tell us what their attitude is with regard to this matter. Here we have a forgotten area, an area that we should like to develop for various reasons, one of those reasons being that there is unemployment in that area, and there is only one way in which we can provide opportunities of employment for the unemployed in that area and that is by attracting industries there.</p>

<p>Hon. members constantly talk about the decentralization of industries. We are constantly told that we should decentralize our industries, but as soon as we take steps to decentralize industries hon. members opposite immediately become suspicious and whatever we do is supposed to be done in pursuance of our &#x201C;ideologies&#x201D;. [Interjections.] But even if that statement were true, here we have a case of industrial decentralization, of uplifting a forgotten area industrially. The method that we are following here is only one of the methods; another benefit that will accrue to border industries is a rebate to factories on railage payable to the markets.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) wants to know whether there are different types of border areas; whether there are A areas, B areas and C areas. No. Border industry benefits are adapted to the needs of the particular area. Natal, for example is at no disadvantage as far as rail and marketing facilities and coal supplies are concerned. Natal&#x2019;s market is not as far away as East London is from Johannesburg. For the greater part Natal can get her raw materials on the spot whereas East London and the area in question have practically no raw materials. As far as all these economic factors are concerned, the Transkei-Ciskei area is at a tremendous disadvantage in comparison with some areas of Natal. We feel that it is because of this fact that industries have not shifted to this area, and that is why we have granted this additional concession of a 10 per cent rebate on railway tariffs to this particular area.</p>

<p>This 10 per cent rebate will be given to every industry. Hon. members opposite have a bee in the bonnet as far as Cyril Lord is concerned. The fact of the matter is that this rebate will be given to every industry that needs it. This amount has not yet been spent. We are making provision here just for a nominal amount which is to be spent when applications for rebates are received and considered. As soon as applications are received, this concession will be given to industries to the extent that they need it, not necessarily the full 10 per cent but only as much as they need. I do not know whether the hon. member for Durban (Point) still insists that I am just generalizing.</p>

I should therefore like to ask the Minister how much of that is in respect of the rebate on railage and how much of this rebate is attributable to the Transkei and Ciskei. The Minister has, I submit, thus far talked only in a general way.

The entire amount of R179,335 constitutes a rebate on railage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Chairman. I ask you for your ruling in respect of this matter. You have already indicated that this amount is part and parcel of the provision made when the Estimates were first before the House. The point I now should like to put specifically to you is that there is no indication about any rebates at all. This item speaks of subsidies, but not of rebates. The question or rebates is a new one and consequently I submit that this Committee can discuss the question of rebates fully.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has indicated that this amount of R179,335 is only a nominal amount. He stated that everything was in respect of rebate on railage but I also understood him to say that it was a nominal amount in respect of rebate on railage for this area. That is what I understood the Minister to say. The Minister must quite obviously be aware of the fact that this question of rebates&#x2014;which really amounts to a subsidization of industries in respect of railage in the border areas in this Transkei-Ciskei area&#x2014;was the subject of a special report which his colleague the Minister of Transport, received fairly recently, although he has not yet given us an indication of what his attitude is going to be in regard to it.</p>

<p>I want to name one reason why I think it is absolutely essential that we should have absolute clarification from the Minister in regard to the manner in which he intends disposing of this amount. The report to which I referred was quite specific in stating on page 147&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It appears therefore that the correct procedure is to make recommendations in respect of specific products when circumstances require such a step after investigation has indicated that existing industries will not appreciably be harmed.</block>

<p>It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is in point of fact something which will require constant attention over a long period in future.</block>

<p>Now we are being called upon to vote this amount of money. But how are we on this side of the House to know that in this matter of the subsidization of railage on specific products, the manufacturer on the border is going to get a preferential rate to say the Reef area, a rate which will influence his costs favourably when compared with the costs of the local manufacturer? I should like to ask the Minister what steps, as the report recommends, he has taken to have an investigation carried out before granting the rebate in order to ensure that existing industries will not be affected? That, to my mind, is the crux of this whole issue. It is of no use the Minister coming with this when we have had no statement of policy from his colleague, the Minister of Transport, on an important issue of this nature. I hope, therefore, that before the Minister asks us to vote this amount of money, he is going to give the Committee more information in regard to what specific products are going to receive this rebate, because if we vote this amount of money now at the Minister&#x2019;s behest, we might be prejudicing the interests of quite a number of manufacturers in other parts of the country. We do not know. Consequently I think we are entitled to have this information on who is going to get the benefit of this rebate&#x2014;a rebate which amounts to nothing more nor less than the subsidization of railage out <span class="col_2189-2190" refersTo="page_1109"/>of Central Government funds to preferred manufacturers who have created their industries at the Government&#x2019;s behest, within a border area. As far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to act to the prejudice of a Witwatersrand manufacturer, nor do I think the hon. member for Durban-Point is prepared to vote to the detriment of the competition area of Durban, neither a member in the Cape to the detriment of a manufacturer in the Cape.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if you look at the item &#x201C;miscellaneous expenses&#x201D; you will find that the additional amount to be voted is R179,335. If to that is added the amounts of R665 and R26,500, you will get the amount of R206,500 which is shown in the revised estimate column. Against this column there is a footnote &#x201C;a&#x201D; which says that this includes rebate on railage in respect of articles manufactured in the Transkei/Ciskei complex for consumption within the Republic. In the item itself the following reasons are given: i.e. development of border areas, nominal provision for subsidies for the erection of industrial buildings and/or losses on housing schemes, and other subsidies and losses. I submit that this description is misleading because the hon. the Minister now tells us that the R179,335 is in respect of rebate on railage alone. If that is so, then this item should read &#x201C;additional rebates for railage&#x201D;. But as it reads now, it is misleading.</p>

<p>When dealing with item E, the Minister told us that the amount of R179,335 is a provision for rebates on railage in order to keep industries in the border area where they are. and also to attract new ones. This is something about which the public and particularly industrialists should be very clear. Therefore, I should like the hon. the Minister, when he replies to this debate, to deal with the reference to the &#x201C;Transkei/Ciskei complex&#x201D;. Clearly, this is an arbitrary definition, because as far as I am aware, while it is possible to define the borders of the Transkei legally, there is less likelihood of that in respect of the Ciskei. But certainly, when it comes to the &#x201C;Transkei/Ciskei complex&#x201D;, I must say this may be a phrase of convenience adopted by either the Minister or by his Department. I think, however, the hon. the Minister should try and define what area is meant by the &#x201C;Transkei/Ciskei complex&#x201D;</p>

<p> Can this hon. member, Sir, who is chairman of the Native Affairs Commission, or anybody else for that matter, show me a map on which the &#x201C;Transkei/Ciskei complex&#x201D; is defined? The hon. member for Heilbron may have a complex of another kind, but for the moment I am speaking to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, and I am asking him to define this complex. He cannot just arbitrarily draw a line through any part or area of the Republic and say that if industry A is on that side of that line, it is within the &#x201C;Transkei/Ciskei complex&#x201D; and thus entitled to a part of this very large provision for rebates on railage: or that if it is on this side of that line&#x2014;it may be a matter of one inch&#x2014;it is outside that &#x201C;complex&#x201D; and thus not entitled to the rebate. Then that entrepreneur has to compete with industrialists on the other side of that line, industrialists who are getting the rebate. This is not a light matter, and it is all very well for the hon. Minister, who seems to want to give the Committee this information, to say that he has made this provision for a very good reason&#x2014;for in order to encourage industries in or to a blighted area. But he still has to indicate to us what this &#x201C;Transkei/Ciskei complex&#x201D; comprises&#x2014;that is, if he wants to make his point as far as this additional provision is concerned as effective as it should be.</p>

<p>There is a second point I should like to put before the Committee. We have fallen into an error perhaps, but certainly into a difficulty, over this &#x201C;nominal&#x201D; provision. Is the amount of R179,335 indeed a nominal amount? The hon. the Minister has not yet dealt with that matter, although it is a very important one&#x2014;because just as the original provision of R26,500 has grown to R206,500, is it possible for this amount of R179,335 to grow to, say, R3,000,000? What is nominal? Who nominates? What can be the final amount involved? There are questions on which the hon. the Minister should try to give us information, despite the discouragement he is getting from his colleagues.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>This is a very important debate. The hon. the Minister has challenged hon. members representing constituencies in this area to get up and state their views about the matter. This is of great importance to the Transkei. The Minister has now enunciated a new policy. He told us that this money has not yet been spent and that it was going to be spent to attract industries to this area. He spent some time in telling us that this area was not too attractive for industrial purposes, hence the provision. We have always understood the policy of the Government to be not to attract White industries to the Transkei. The footnote to this item E says &#x201C;includes rebate on railage in respect of articles manufactured in the Transkei/Ciskei complex&#x201D;. Industrialists may be interested in going to the Transkei. As a matter of fact, we know of industrialists who said they would be interested in going there. But now the Minister should tell us and the country what principles will apply to the establishment of industries in the Transkei. Who, for instance, will get this rebate? What type of industry in the Transkei is going to get it? I welcome this and I am hoping that this will bring the establishment of industries in the Transkei. This is what I have been pleading for every year. So the Minister owes a duty to industrialists throughout the country to say what encouragement is going to be given to industrialists to establish themselves in the Transkei. The Minister should now get up and tell us.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>To my mind the hon. member who has just resumed his seat has made the best contribution to this debate so far. He wanted to know what industries to which this rebate would be granted, were going to be developed in the Transkei/Ciskei area. I do not blame the hon. member for wanting to know that. In fact, it is his duty and his task to obtain information for other hon. members on his side who are full of suspicion and who are afraid that the industrial triangle of <span class="col_2193-2194" refersTo="page_1111"/>the Transvaal, or of the Rand/Pretoria complex, or wherever it may be, industries will have to compete with industries in the Transkei or the Ciskei that receive subsidies from the State. The hon. member is quite right in saying that it is in the interests of the Transkei and the Ciskei that industries in these areas should receive support. But now he comes along and asks what industries are to be given support and what border industries are.

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to conclude, Mr. Chairman, by saying that it is necessary to make this provision. We are making this provision because it is the policy of the National Party to develop border industries in order to prevent industries from being concentrated in the White areas alone, and also because it is necessary that industries employing large numbers of Bantu workers should go and establish themselves in the border areas. Hence this amount on the Additional Estimates for granting support to such industries. The object is not that these industries should compete with industries in the White areas. It is in the interest of this area, and, consequently, also in the interest of many hon. members on that side, amongst others the hon. member for East London (City), that industries should be developed there. I therefore say that hon. members who come and split hairs here to-night by asking for what purpose this amount has to be voted, do so with only one object in mind, namely, to sabotage the National Government in the implementation of its policy of developing border industries.</p>

In the first place I want to tell him that if this House is not entitled to obtain further details in respect of the Additional Estimates it will necessarily create suspicion, and the National Party will be regarded with suspicion. It is, after all, a function of Parliament that is involved here.

We should like to know whether the development of the border areas is in fact so honest a policy as the Government professes it to be. Will the industries along the west bank also be entitled to this rebate if their cases are of a deserving nature? I wish to point out that the Ciskei is not being defined, that it has no specific boundaries; as a matter of fact, we do not even know whether the areas outside King William&#x2019;s Town fall inside or outside the Ciskei complex.

<p>He knows that East London is in the complex. He knows that Queenstown is in the complex. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I am making a plea here this evening for industries in Queenstown.

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members ostensibly do not know what border industries are. What did the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) say when he addressed a meeting at Queenstown last year? He said: &#x201C;This policy of border industries is sheer madness&#x201D; At the time he was speaking about &#x201C;border industries&#x201D; but this evening he apparently does not know what the &#x201C;policy&#x201D; is. The hon. member for Durban-Point (Mr. Raw) will, I am sure, remember that about two years ago he opened a fete in East London and on that occasion he had the following to say: &#x201C;If you people bargain on industries under this policy you are living in a fools&#x2019; paradise&#x201D;</p>

<p> Mr. Chairman, the hon. member was so right that the Mayor of East London as well as the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce said to him: &#x201C;Go away, Mr. Raw, we do not need your advice&#x201D;. [Interjections]. Mr. Chairman, the crux of the whole matter, as far as I am concerned, is not the fencing which has been going on here this evening. Hon. members opposite are, after all, also in favour of the decentralization of industries. We are dealing here with the decentralization of industries to a certain part of our country and I am making a plea for that part of the country this evening. The areas concerned are backward economically. Those areas <span class="col_2197-2198" refersTo="page_1113"/>are also backward in the industrial sphere. We must welcome every concession which is made to those areas. I must welcome it, the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bennett) should welcome it, the hon. members for East London should welcome it and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town should welcome it, but I have seen very little indication of it this evening although we are dealing here with a concession to those people.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister this evening that all the people in those areas, including myself, people of all political convictions and of all race groups, heartily support the Government in this respect and we are all in favour of these rebates because we do after all derive some benefit from them. East London is deriving all sorts of benefits to-day as a result of this policy and the time will come when Queenstown and King William&#x2019;s Town will also derive benefit from it. This is our only hope. I want to emphasize the fact that if we have to rely on the natural economic factors in those border areas, if we do not receive a few additional concessions, concessions as made under this system and such as those which appear under this Vote, then we can forget about industrial development there. That is why I make an appeal to the Opposition not to continue to sabotage industries in the border areas as they have been doing here this evening.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I go any further I should like to refer to a remark which, according to the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) I am reputed to have made in Queenstown last year. I apparently said then that &#x201C;the border industries were madness&#x201D;. I most strongly deny that I did say that.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But that is what I have been accused of saying. What I did say was that the Bantustan policy was madness. I said so at Queenstown and I have said it throughout the country. The question which I put to the hon. the Minister but which has not yet been answered, was: To which goods will the rebate be of application? The hon. the Minister says that they will be applied in every deserving case. If this is so, then the hon. the Minister must ascertain what representations must be made by an industry in order to qualify for these concessions. We on this side are not concerned simply about the question of border industries&#x2014;as the hon. member for Queenstown has tried to suggest&#x2014;but we are concerned because the hon. the Minister apparently wants to have the power to discriminate between industry and industry in the border areas. If those industries are going to receive a general rebate, we can discuss the matter on a completely different basis. But we are informed that rebates are going to differ from factory to factory and from industry to industry, and that it will be in the discretion of the hon. the Minister whether a rebate will be given or not. Before we can go any further we should like to have clarity in this connection.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. the Minister will be able to answer this question but I would like to know whether this concession will be restricted to the border industries. I want in passing to say&#x2014;I hope you will permit me to do so and I hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will also give his attention to this matter&#x2014;that this is an extremely unsatisfactory way in which to frame the Additional Estimates and lay them before this House. Not only is this side of the House at a disadvantage, but your task too, Mr. Chairman, is made more difficult because this item is actually a new item. It should have appeared as a new item and not as an increase in an existing item, an item which it has nothing at all to do with. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether this item was inserted under sub-head E to indicate that the assistance will be restricted to industries in the Transkei. Will the rebate not be of application to other border areas and areas which do not border on a Bantu area&#x2014;for example Somerset East? If this were the case of general decentralization, the hon. the Minister could have relied upon our unequivocal and enthusiastic support. [Laughter] If it is the policy of the hon. the Minister to decentralize industries to areas such as this area, an area which is backward and which needs help, then we are on his side. But has this new item not been included deliberately under subhead E, which is apparently restricted to border industries, to indicate that these rebates will only be allowed when industries are established in particular areas in order to promote the ideological Bantustan policy of the Government? We must have clarity in this regard. The position as set out in these Additional Estimates is confusing. In view of what was said by the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) I take it that he is also completely confused. Is this concession to industries confined to border industries? Is it confined to industries which will serve to promote the Bantustan policy, to assist the Bantustans towards independence, or is the policy aimed at assisting all the backward areas and the people in those areas to progress and to achieve a higher standard of living?</p>

<p>If I understood the hon. the Minister correctly, he said that the whole of the R179,000 odd was for rebates on railage in respect of articles made in the Transkei/Ciskei complex. I should like the Minister to clear up one point for me. The heading relating to this amount is &#x201C;Development of Border Areas&#x2014;Nominal provision for subsidies for the erection of industrial buildings and/or losses on housing schemes and other subsidies and losses.&#x201D; Will the Minister please confirm that none of this money is intended to help housing schemes or bear losses in that connection, but that it is intended purely and simply as rebates for those industries?</p>

<p>That is right. I said that if anybody believed that this policy for which we are being asked to vote now was going to cause an industrial explosion in East London, such a person was living in a Fool&#x2019;s Paradise. All that this policy has created is a Cyril Lord Paradise! An East London paradise has not materialized. The hon. member for Somerset East and the hon. member for Queenstown have both accused us of opposing industrial development in terms of this policy in East London. I now put it to the hon. the Minister across the floor of this House that this policy will not assist any of the established industries in the industrial area of East London south of the Buffalo River. The industries complex of East London, where the existing basic factories of East London stand, south of the Buffalo River, does not get a single cent of this R179,000 odd. In other words, Mr. Chairman, if you have an industry and you risked your capital for 10, 15 or 20 years, battling against the &#x201C;agterlikheid&#x201D; which the Minister referred to, the backwardness, the difficulties, the long way from raw materials, the long way from markets, and you sustained losses over the years in the hope that you would ultimately succeed, nevertheless you will not get a single cent assistance from this Government. But if you come along to the edge of the Bantu area on the other side of the Buffalo River then you can draw on this R179,000.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Will the Minister tell me what part of Somerset East shares in this railage rebate? What town, what industry, what single industrialist has received one cent of this R179,000 in the Somerset East constituency or Somerset East town? Will the Minister tell us? I want to go to the next town namely Umtata. What industrialist in the Transkei and in Umtata has drawn one cent of this R179,000? I want the Minister to tell us how he has helped to decentralize industry to Umtata. We on this side of the House are in favour of decentralization in the whole of the North-Eastern Cape. The whole of the North-Eastern Cape suffers from the same disabilities as those listed by the Minister here. Every disability he listed applies to every town in the North-Eastern Cape. He cannot deny that. Now I want to ask him whether Grahamstown shares in this subsidy. Does Cathcart share therein? Does Queenstown share therein? Queenstown has had one new industry created as a Border industry. It burnt down and they are busy rebuilding it. What other benefit has Queenstown derived from this policy? Nothing. The reason is that the policy is not based on the basic economic laws of decentralization. As the hon. member for Yeoville said, we will support the hon. the Minister one hundred per cent if he will apply a policy of decentralization under which every platteland town in South Africa has an equal chance of competing for the benefits, every platteland town in every province. But we are not prepared to say that Somerset East or Durban, or this or that town, cannot enjoy the privilege, be it a big city or a modest platteland town, but that because a town is situated in the Transkei or the Ciskei, therefore it will receive benefits. If the wording appearing in the footnote means anything, it means that only the Transkei and the Ciskei will enjoy any benefits thereunder. The rest of South Africa, which needs and deserves support in building up industry, is debarred from being assisted. The Minister is quite prepared to let industrialists in his constituency be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis people whom he is prepared to assist for the sake of Black political policy purposes. He is not concerned about helping the White man in South Africa, he is not concerned about assisting White towns in the country, he is not keen to keep the White man on the platteland. All he is interested in is carrying out a Black political policy. As long as it is in alignment with the Minister&#x2019;s Black political policy, certain select industries will enjoy railage rebates out of this nominal R179,000. [Interjections.] A White town without a Black area nearby can, as far as the Minister is concerned, go and whistle for assistance. A White town in the platteland, not having a Black area near it, will not receive a sixpence from the Minister. But if a town is near a Black area, industrialists in that town can go along and say, &#x201C;I <span class="col_2201-2202" refersTo="page_1115"/>want ten per cent railage rebate.&#x201D; That is what we oppose, Mr. Chairman. We are opposed to discrimination against the platteland towns of South Africa, including the towns of the North-Eastern Cape Province, which are placed at a disadvantage because of the obsession of the Government with Bantustan ideology. If the Minister were to stand up now and say &#x201C;I will make this rebate applicable to any industry in any rural town in South Africa&#x201D;, I can promise him that everyone on this side will support him. If he will extend this rebate to every industry in a White town in South Africa, we will back him. But if he excludes existing industries and he excludes areas which do not have Black reserves near them, then he cannot expect us to support a sectional policy in conflict with the interests of the White platteland population. These people are being driven off the platteland because they cannot share in this benefit owing to the Government&#x2019;s policy of only assisting in cases where there are Border areas in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are prepared here and now to give our full support if&#x2014;and as we are dealing with the Transkei/Ciskei complex&#x2014;the Minister will assure us that this subsidy will be available in Umtata and in every town in the Transkei and the Ciskei. But as long as assistance will be available only to those towns which he nominates while other towns that need it just as badly are excluded, then we will continue to oppose it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is clear from the speech of the last speaker that the true aim of the United Party is to make every White rural town Black. They are not satisfied that the Bantu should remain within their own area. They now want to decentralize industries throughout South Africa&#x2019;s White platteland, not for the sake of the White towns but in order to make the White towns Black by means of Bantu labour. [Interjections.] They do not want industries in the White towns. What they actually want there is Black voters for their federation policy. We on this side want industries to be established, at Heilbron as well, and our policy is very clear. In the case of White towns we want industries which are not labour-intensive. We want all the labour-intensive industries to move to the border areas where we will be able to harness non-White labour for that purpose. It is not true to contend that we do not want industries to be established in rural towns. We only want certain types of industries to be established there&#x2014;those which are not labour-intensive. In other words, we want to keep the White platteland White. On the other hand the United Party wants any sort of industries to be established there, particularly labour-intensive industries, so that the White platteland can be overrun by non-White labour.</p>

<p>If it is on the borders of the Bantu area, it will be a border area and this also affects the question of industries established on the west bank. If the industries on the west bank are not labour-intensive, it will be silly to regard them as being border industries. Those industries could then just as well have been established in Bloemfontein or Heilbron. But, simply because an industry is on the west bank, even though it is not labour-intensive, hon. members opposite regard it as being a border industry. That is not in conformity with our policy. But if an industry is labour-intensive and it is within striking distance of a Bantu area, then, even though it be situated on the west bank, it will be a border industry.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As I have already said, every case will be dealt with on its merits. For example, it is to no avail to assist a factory in Umtata which uses no non-White labour. Every case will then have to be dealt with on its merits in order to determine whether an industry qualifies as a border industry or not. The fact that an industry is situated in a border area will not be the only qualification; there is also the fact that it must be labour-intensive&#x2014;in other words, that it must make use of non-White labour. Only then will such industry qualify for the purposes of this rebate. I think the matter ought to be clear now.</p>

<p>Let me come back now to the question of borders. It has been contended that the Cyril Lord factory will be the only one to qualify as far as East London is concerned. That may be the case at the moment because this undertaking is at present making use of Bantu labour on a large scale. The reason for this is not because it is situated on the east bank of the river but because it is labour intensive. Other industries may also qualify at a later stage because they make use of Bantu labour. The fact is that they will not qualify simply because they are situated in a border area. The deciding factor will be whether they make use of Bantu labour on a large scale&#x2014;in other words, whether they are labour-intensive. There are, of course, other requirements as well which I cannot deal with at the moment because they are not relevant to this discussion.</p>

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Up to the present, three hon. members on the other side have participated in this debate. Firstly, there was the hon. member for Somerset-East (Mr. Vosloo). He is not here now. He contended that we on this side were opposed to the establishment of industries in rural areas, and that we were also opposed to the fact that railage rebates should be given to industries in the rural areas. He mentioned <i>inter alia</i>, industries in East London, and challenged the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) to tell the House whether he was in favour of the granting of this concession to industries in this area or not. The speech of the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) followed the same pattern. He went so far as to say that we on this side of the House were opposed to the establishment in Queenstown of industries which have to be given these rebates. What happened then? The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) stood up and coined a brand new word. He said that only those industries which were labour-intensive would receive that assistance, would receive these rebates. If this is the case, gold mines should also qualify for these rebates because they are labour-intensive industries. What happens now to the arguments of the hon. members for Queenstown and Somerset-East? They spoke about industries on the White platteland but the hon. member for Heilbron told us that he did not want industries on the White platteland which were labour-intensive. He said that if they were established there, they would make the White platteland Black. What do hon. members opposite have to say now? The hon. the Minister stood up and indulged in vague generalities.</p>

<p>These Additional Estimates show this amount as being a nominal amount. We must remember that to-day is only the third of March and that the Main Estimates will be tabled on the 24th of March. This large sum of R179,335 has now to be allocated before the 24th of March and yet it is called a nominal amount. What is it? What is this absurdity which we are dealing with here this evening? What proportions does it assume? There is also an industrial area in my constituency which will not qualify for these rebates&#x2014;at least, according to hon. members opposite. My constituency would not qualify for these rebates. What is going to be the position of the industries in my constituency as far as competition is concerned, in regard to the amount which we are being asked to vote? The industries in my constituency have the same market as these industries which are being supported by the hon. the Minister and which, according to the hon. member for Heilbron, are labour-intensive industries. What is going to be the influence of this artificial support for these industries on the part of the Government upon the industries in my constituency?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron has told us that we know exactly where the borders of the Transkei and the Ciskei are and that we know precisely where that industrial complex is. But at the same time the hon. member for Queenstown told us that Queenstown is also an industrial area which borders on the Ciskei and the Transkei. The hon. member wants to extend that area; he wants to make Queenstown and East London Black. One begins to wonder whom the hon. member for Queenstown recognizes as his Prime Minister&#x2014;Dr. Verwoerd or Kaiser Matanzima. I think it is time that the hon. the Minister gave us a satisfactory explanation of this large sum of money which will have to be allocated within 22 or 23 days.</p>

<p>It is clear to me that the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) has no idea of the meaning of the words &#x201C;border industry&#x201D;. Let us take the item as it stands here: &#x201C;Nominal provision for subsidies for the erection of industrial buildings and/or losses on housing schemes and other subsidies and losses&#x201D;. It is clear that this amount is for the development of border areas. This item appeared on the Estimates for the first time last year and it was then called &#x201C;nominal provision&#x201D;. Although it is no longer <span class="col_2205-2206" refersTo="page_1117"/>nominal, the wording still remains the same as that which appeared on the Estimates last year. I am sure hon. members will be able to work this out for themselves. They must not be so stupid as to discuss this matter for an hour and a half. No one contends that the amount of R206,000 is still only a nominal amount. It is no longer nominal but the wording remains the same as it was last year.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg asks what the border areas are and where they are. Does she not know that in terms of our policy a border area is an area within striking distance of a reserve; an area which will enable people living in a reserve to enter that area each day to work? If the area is too far away for them to enter it daily, they can return home every week-end. The hon. the Prime Minister has defined it. He has said that a border area is an area from which workers can return home every evening. If it is a little too far for this, perhaps 10 or 15 miles away, they may perhaps be able to go home twice a week in the evening; if it is 20 or 30 miles away from the reserve, they may be able to return home every week-end. How can the hon. member for Drakensberg be so stupid as to ask whether the gold mines can also be classified as border industries because they are labour-intensive? Can she tell me whether there is a gold mine within 30 miles of a Bantu reserve.</p>

As far as I know, this House has already decided in regard to the border industry policy&#x2014;that industries should be encouraged on the borders of Bantu reserves. We can assist those industries to a far greater extent financially than we can assist industries in other places because we want the Bantu to be domiciled in their reserves as far as possible and we want those Bantu who leave their reserves for a time to return to their reserves again. That is accepted policy. With all respect, Mr. Chairman, in discussing the question of industries throughout the whole of the platteland hon. members are trying to oppose a policy which has already been adopted by this House. I say that because we are dealing here with Additional Estimates which simply extend a principle already adopted and which simply require us to vote additional money for services which have already been approved of, I think, with all respect, that 90 per cent of the speeches made by hon. members opposite have been out of order.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>It is very significant that this item is related so slightly to the item on the original Estimates that it required a footnote. If one looks at the original Estimates one finds that item E &#x201C;Miscellaneous expenses&#x201D; is worded exactly as this item is here but significantly the footnote does not appear in the original estimates. When one reads this footnote it is clear that the obvious reason for it is that there was doubt as to whether this was really an item which could be included in the revised Estimates. That is quite clear and that can be the only reason for the inclusion of a footnote such as the one we have here.</p>

<p>I come back to the point made by the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) and the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). What they have said, Sir, is right off the line. The hon. member for Heilbron said the United Party wanted to make the towns throughout South Africa black. I ask him is it the policy of the Government that those towns which happen to be near the borders of the reserves will be made black.</p>

<p>The fact that they live next to those towns does not make the slightest difference. So far as Johannesburg is concerned, the Johannesburg Native area is just as far as from Johannesburg as is the Pretoria Native area from the north of Pretoria. How you can say you have integration in the one case and separation in the other case is completely beyond my understanding. The hon. member for Queenstown, as an authority on that area, was going to tell us exactly which areas fell within this note. I must object to the inaccurate information we have because even the footnote which explains this item says &#x201C;Includes rebate on railage in respect of articles manufactured in the Transkei/Ciskei complex for consumption within the Republic&#x201D;. There is some excuse for us being in doubt as to exactly what areas are covered because we find a totally different line taken by the hon. member for Queenstown as against that taken by the hon. member for Heilbron. I say we are entitled to have clarity on this. It is high time that the hon. the Minister entered this debate and told us which of the versions which came from that side of the House are the right ones and to which areas this item applies.</p>

<p>I just want to reply briefly to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. <span class="col_2207-2208" refersTo="page_1118"/>Tucker) and the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). The hon. member for Drakensberg said that I know that Queenstown is a border industry area. I want to say for the information of the hon. member for Drakensberg that this surely does not mean that we now fall under the prime minister of the Transkei, as she says is the position. I do not think that her argument was intended seriously and I do not think it is necessary for me to reply to it.</p>

<p>I stand up actually to reply to the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw). I just want to tell the hon. member for Durban (Point) what this policy has done for Queenstown. Last year the Fisher&#x2019;s furniture factory burnt down. If it were not for the type of concession which we are dealing with here this evening, and others, Fisher&#x2019;s furniture would have built their new factory on the Rand. I am telling you this this evening, Mr. Chairman, because I know what has happened. For the sake of this sort of concession and others, they are building their new factory at Queenstown and they are building it twice as large as it was before. I want to tell the hon. member further that we have Frontier Meat Products there. They are expanding enormously.</p>

We have a new industry there, Wormald&#x2019;s Mills, which markets all its products which it markets outside that area by means of this 10 per cent rebate. Is this not an encouragement to any industry to become established there?</p>

<p>An HON. member on the other side asked what about Indwe? The hon. member must not ask: What about Indwe? He should ask the hon. members for Durban (Point) and East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) about Indwe because the one donated the ram and the other one presented it!</p>

<p>With respect, Mr. Chairman, this has as yet been the only contribution which those two hon. members have made this evening towards the border areas. I just want to tell the hon. member for Durban (Point) that he should study the East London complex. I spoke to the Mayor of East London this afternoon. Something is definitely happening in East London. There is an economic upsurge. I want to say that the policy and this sort of item which we are being asked to approve here this evening are the things which are making East London in the economic sphere. I want to tell you this evening, Mr. Chairman, that the people of the &#x201C;Border&#x201D; will not be grateful to hon. members opposite for the attitude which they have adopted during this discussion here this evening.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister just how far west the Ciskei/Transkei complex extends. Yesterday, in reply to a question by me, he told this House that the question of border industry status for the new pottery plant at East London was under consideration. He further told this House that the raw material for that plant was going to be drawn from Grahamstown. I take it that, if that industry is granted border industry status, it will enjoy this 10 per cent railage rebate as is shown here. You already have an existing pottery industry at Grahamstown. in the area mentioned by the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo)&#x2014;in an area where there is also unemployment&#x2014;and I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is his intention to discriminate between industries in the same area, simply because the industry in the East London area will be right bang on the border of the Bantustan, and the industry in Grahamstown is over 30 miles away and therefore does not presumably qualify for border industry status.</p>

<p>Yes. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether an industry is granted border industry status on that ground. Suppose an industry satisfies all the Minister&#x2019;s requirements and its labour intensive factor is satisfactory the industry is in due course granted border industry status and is granted the railway rebate. What happens if subsequently that industry introduces modern automation and reduces the labour factor from a ratio of. say, nine to one to one to one. i.e. one White to one non-White? Will that industry still enjoy the rebate or will it be withdrawn? If it is withdrawn is it the intention to ensure that industries which are granted rebate because they have a border status and because they have a satisfactory labour intensive figure remain inefficient and not modernize their plant?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Just before the Minister replies I would ask him whether he could give us some clarity in respect of which railway rebates will be granted to these decentralized border industries. Will the rebate be granted to a manufacturer, say, in a border area in regard to the raw material he requires to manufacture the finished product or will the rebate be granted in respect of the distribution of the finished product from the factory? I think it is important that we know that for this reason. The Cyril Lord factory is classified as a border industry manufacturing textiles. If they are going to get a rebate they must get a rebate on the distribution of the finished article flowing from the factory to the sale area which may be the Witwatersrand or the <span class="col_2209-2210" refersTo="page_1119"/>Cape for instance. But here in the Cape we have manufacturers of textiles who are selling their product to the border areas such as East London and Port Elizabeth. Will the manufacturer in the Cape be granted the same equitable rebate in respect of the finished product he sells in the same area in which the border factory is located as that border industry is granted? Because if that is not the case you are obviously going to create an unfair competitive area for the manufacturer located in an area distant from the consumption area in which the border factory may be located. I am sure the Minister will not tell us that he is going to give to a manufacturer in a border area a preferential sale rate in the area in which his industry is located. Because if the rebate is granted on the raw material consigned to the border industry for the manufacture of the finished product then obviously the end unit cost flowing from that factory is going to be cheaper than in the case of the manufacturer located in the Cape who also wants to sell his product within a Native area or the area in which the border industry is located. I think as far as assisting border industries is concerned and this question of rebates the hon. the Minister should give us a clear statement as to the basis on which rebates are to be granted to these border industries. It is important in the over-all interests of any manufacturer. He may feel that because of the granting of these rebates he will be faced by unfair competition on the part of manufacturers located in the border area. I am sure the Minister, as Minister of Economic Affairs, will not desire to create competitive conditions of this nature where the manufacturer in the border area will be in unfair competition, because of these cheaper railway rates, with the local manufacturer who sells in the same area. I hope the hon. the Minister will deal fully with this question because I think he appreciates it is one of considerable concern to industry as a whole.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think by this time it has become perfectly clear that the main difference between hon. members on the other side and this side of the House is one of principle. It is a difference of principle in this sense that we believe in border industries whereas hon. members on the other side do not. If we had come forward with these measures in respect of an area which did not also happen to be a border area, then hon. members might perhaps have agreed with us. Their main reason for opposing this item is not because this is a method of bringing about decentralization of industries but because this decentralization happens to apply also to a border area. I do not think that is fair. I do not think it is fair on the part of hon. members on the other side to adopt the attitude that this area must be punished because it happens to be a border area, in spite of all the disadvantages suffered by it as an industrial area.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) who is not here at the moment apologized for his absence, but the hon. member said, &#x201C;We will support this if you extend the same benefits to all platteland towns.&#x201D; But surely that cannot be done. If we are to give the same benefits to all platteland towns, then we must assume that all platteland towns have the same advantages and disadvantages in respect of the establishment of industries. Surely that is not the position. Certain towns and certain areas have certain advantages in establishing industries as well as certain disadvantages. The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) asked, &#x201C;What about my constituency?&#x201D; Sir, I say for the umpteenth time that that portion of Natal does not have the disadvantages that this area has in establishing industries. I am not referring now to railway rebates generally; I refer to railway rebates for this particular area. Let us forget for a moment that this is a border area. Let us think of it as an area that has certain disadvantages because its markets are far removed and because its raw materials are far removed; it has to pay two or three times as much for electricity as other places, and its coal is expensive. Let us think of it as an area in which there is a great deal of unemployment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>We have often said that what we seek to do under this policy is to take the factory to the masses of workers. We are dealing here with an area therefore which has certain disadvantages, an area which has masses of workers who are unemployed and who should be provided with employment by means of industrial development. Industrialists cannot establish their industries in that area. Forget for a moment that it is a border area. Industrialists cannot establish their industries there because of the adverse factors which I mentioned here a moment ago.</p>

<p>If my hon. friend, the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman), forgets for a moment that this is a border area, would he not be in favour of our giving these benefits to the area of East London so that East London may develop and have a greater share in the industrial development of our country? Or is he against it? Is he against the proposition that we should promote industrial development in East London by granting these rebates?</p>

<p><span class="col_2211-2212" refersTo="page_1120"/>I must assume that the hon. member is against it because he refuses to accept it.</p>

<p>There is one legitimate question which hon. members put to me in this connection, and I want to reply to it in all fairness. They want to know how this is going to affect industries in other parts of the country. I want to tell hon. members that it is not our object to place industries which receive this rebate&#x2014;it is a very small amount&#x2014;in a more favourable competitive position as against other industries of the same kind. It is not our object to give them an advantage over their competitors so that they can compete with industries of the same kind in Cape Town or Johannesburg or Durban or Drakensberg. Our object is to help these industries to overcome the tremendous disadvantages that they have to contend with, so much so that existing industries face potential ruin and new industries simply cannot be established there. I can assure hon. members that our object is not to give them an advantage over their competitors; that is not the spirit in which this measure will be administered. Those industries will not be placed in a position of unfair competition with industries in other parts of the country. I trust that the House will accept that.</p>

<p>Hon. members, unfortunately, are obsessed with the idea that we want to establish factories only in that particular complex. Let me say here that an enormous industrial upsurge is taking place to-day in East London as a result of this border area policy. I think the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) also mentioned this. The hon. member for East London (City) must know that that is so. That is the position as a result of this policy. The City Council of East London is grateful to this Government for what it has done in that area. At the present moment we are negotiating with quite a number of industries which are anxious to go to East London under this policy, and so far the hon. member has not said a single word to support this policy, nor has his Party done so.</p>

<p>I have already given the assurance that we are not introducing these rebates in order to place those industries in a more favourable competitive position but so as to help them to overcome the disadvantages that they have to contend with in this area. Hon. members opposite are very concerned to-day about Cyril Lord and the whole of that complex. I just want to tell them that this issue arose as a result of the position of certain old established industries in King William&#x2019;s Town and in East London. Let them listen carefully now. It was not because of new industries that we established there or which were attracted to that area because of the border area policy that this policy of railway rebates was formulated. The position is that old established industries in King William&#x2019;s Town and East London faced the threat of having to close down or to shift to Cape Town or Johannesburg. I do not want to mention their names; I will give the names privately to hon. members but I do not think it would be right to mention their names here across the floor of the House. Some of these names are old household names.</p>

They would have had to leave this area because they were unable to expand.

<p>Because the industries of Potchefstroom are not faced with difficulties in the shape of coal supplies, power supplies, transport facilities, marketing facilities and all the other problems that these areas have to contend with and because there are not thousands unemployed in Potchefstroom as there are in those areas. The position is entirely different. We would then, of course, have to give the same advantages to all towns, which would mean, of course, that we would then be giving no advantages to these areas which are badly handicapped at the present time.</p>

<p>In every type of decentralization in the world&#x2014;let us take our type of decentralization&#x2014;there is specific decentralization in specific areas. It is not just a question of a general, even distribution of industries over the whole country. Certain parts of a country are selected for certain reasons, and certain benefits are then given to those areas with a view to encouraging industrial expansion. That is the pattern throughout the world. Now that we are applying this pattern in this area, an area in which development has been retarded, we find that hon. members on the other side oppose us.

Sir, we have a committee which is called the Permanent Committee for the Establishment of Industries and Border Area Development, a committee consisting of officials of the departments concerned. This committee considers the applications of firms or factories which are established in this area. The committee establishes whether the particular factory is at a disadvantage as a result of its siting far away from the markets and far away from raw materials; it establishes whether the factory&#x2019;s siting in that area is advantageous to it and whether its existence is affected by it, and it then determines whether and to what extent the factory is entitled to a rebate.</p>

We all realize there is a possibility of damage and danger as a result of nuclear explosions and fall-outs and so forth. That is a real danger. It is something that is likely to affect the ordinary man. This is merely to open an account and it is being done in the Additional Estimates. The Government has not waited for the Main Estimates later in the year. There must therefore be a reason why the Government comes early, timeously, if I may put it that way, with such a Vote. I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister would explain this to us.</p>

<p>The reason why this provision is being made is to enable us to deal with claims which might arise. We are only making provision for a nominal amount of R1. There may be no claims but we are merely making provision for the admissibility of such claims. Provision is being made because the plant at Pelindaba will soon be coming into operation. A start has been made on the experimental work necessary in this regard. The plant will be open in August and so we are making provision for claims now.</p>

<p>They are covered by insurance. There are insurance policies covering almost R5,000,000. This is in respect of buildings as well as public liability and personnel.</p>

<p>No, not each person. There is a maximum of R10,000,000 and if that is exceeded then the Government is responsible.</p>
