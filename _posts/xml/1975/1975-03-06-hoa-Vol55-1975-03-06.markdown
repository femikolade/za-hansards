<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was interrupted last night, I was dealing with the more specific points raised by the hon. member for Green Point, those which I did not deal with in the general survey I gave. I had discussed the question of quantity surveyors, and I think I disposed of this matter completely. Other hon. members also referred to certain aspects of the matter. I shall discuss the matter further when I come to those hon. members. I think that disposes of the points raised by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the hon. member for Walmer. Last night I told the hon. member for Walmer that he had let the cat out of the bag during his Second Reading speech when he warned the hon. member for Boksburg that he would have to report back to his voters. I linked this to the circular which was sent to all hon. members. I said that it was the wrong approach to legislation altogether to allow our conduct to be determined by who the minority and who the majority is. I said that minorities also had rights.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Quite right.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I am turning specifically to the Progressive Party because I believe that I will find support for such a standpoint from that quarter! The hon. member for Walmer went further, and what he actually did was to attack my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Planning and the Environment. He laid the housing shortage at the door of group areas. I indicated in this House last year what the actual position in regard to group areas and housing is. I indicated that 90% of the people who are removed in terms of the proclamation of group areas, are people who are removed from slum areas. With that I leave that point. He also advocated tax concessions. The hon. member for Green Point did not want to tell me this last night, and I do not see the hon. member for Walmer here, therefore I cannot ask him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>He apologized for his absence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the hon. member offered his apology. I would have liked to have known from him whether he wanted rent control in respect of all dwelling units in South Africa, and whether this was the only way in which this could be applied in practice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>There he comes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer heard my argument last night on the consequences of tax concessions. I want to put this question to him: Is he in favour of rent control in respect of all dwelling units in South Africa up to the present, and in the days to come? [Interjections.] I am frequently charged with not speaking loudly enough, but that hon. member must not expect me to hear what he is saying now. [Interjections.] Apart from that, that hon. member commented unfavourably on this legislation in general. He wanted to know from me where the quantity surveyors are to be found. I indicated last night that it is not compulsory or if one cannot find a quantity surveyor this year, one can find one next year. This does not apply only to the lessor, but to the lessee as well. The lessee may also find that it suits him to go to the Rent Board with a computation made by the quantity surveyor. If he cannot find one this year, he will find one next year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>A computation for a similar building, the same size, the same everything.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member is interested in this, I can tell him specifically what the quantity surveyor looks for, but I think he ought to know. The hon. member for Walmer also asked for guidelines in respect of deproclamation, and these I furnished last night.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hercules asked whether 2&#x00BD;% for maintenance costs was not too low. The hon. member for Sea <span class="col_1983-1984" refersTo="page_1007"/>Point said that we should keep it at 2&#x00BD;%. I shall come to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I asked for the reason why it should remain at 2&#x00BD;%.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. In view of the experience which has already been gained, when it was set at 2%, we now have a 25% increase, and this is regarded as being reasonable. I think we must accept that no owner is going to spend the same percentage on maintenance every year. We shall find, for example, that he will spend 7%, 8% or 10% on maintenance this year, and far less&#x2014;perhaps 1 % &#x2014;for the next two or three years. Here one actually works on averages, and I think that a 25% increase at this stage is an adequate concession. The point which the hon. member for Sea Point made, is not entirely valid. He thought that this 0,5% means so much more as regards the increase in the rent which has to be paid. It is not only 0,5% more which the lessee pays.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hercules suggested that consideration be given to the consolidation of the Act. I can tell the hon. member that this is a matter to which the Johannes Committee gave attention, and that the consolidation will be dealt with after we have given this matter further attention.</p>

<p>This brings me then to the hon. member for Houghton. She raised the question of the Johannes Committee report again, and I should like to refer to this again briefly when I come to her amendment. I also dealt with it last night. The hon. member put a question to me in regard to Silver Oaks. I established that the regional representative here in Cape Town received a request on 9 December last year. The matter has been investigated and it will in due course be submitted to me. That is all comment I can make on that matter at this stage. The hon. member for Houghton expressed the opinion that the penal provisions which may be imposed should also include the alternative of imprisonment. Perhaps I should just remind her of what was said not so long ago in this House by the hon. member for Johannesburg North. It does not appear in the record, but I remember saying it he complained that our prisons were too full; that we were too inclined to put people in prison. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Houghton must give me a chance to speak. Sir, if I can be convinced that this malpractice, this intimidation, is really assuming such serious proportions, then I am prepared to consider the suggestion, but not at this stage. In this Bill certain concessions are being made to the lessor. There are certain provisions which make it easier for him to prove his case, and I would at least want to ascertain first what the effect of this is going to be. I want to tell the hon. member that in the interests of the lessee I am afraid of one thing, and that is that we are going to drive people away from this industry through having measures which are too drastic. The hon. member for Sea Point was not here last night, but he can look up my speech to see what I said about rent control; what my candid feelings about that matter are. I do not want to take steps which are going to drive people away from this industry which provides residential accommodation. I said yesterday that it cannot be expected of any Government to be solely responsible for meeting the housing needs of the population. Therefore I am not prepared at this stage to accept an amendment to the effect that imprisonment may also be imposed.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what guide-lines I adopt in respect of deproclamation. I think that I elucidated this in detail last night. The hon. member complained about Mr. Mouton and Mr. Wainer. I do not know Mr. Wainer, but I know Mr. Mouton&#x2014;I am quite candid about this&#x2014;very well; I know him very well personally. Mr. Mouton has so far, as far as I can remember &#x2014;my memory may be playing tricks on me&#x2014;made four applications for deproclamation. One of these was approved&#x2014;the hon. member knows about that&#x2014;and three were refused. I think that the hon. member for Houghton accepts that the application which was approved was justified. As I have said, I do not know Mr. Wainer personally; I have merely read the reports about him in the newspapers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>You said that four applications had been made and one had been approved. Did the four include Silver Oaks?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. It has not been before me yet. I said that I was speaking from memory. As far as I can recollect, there were four applications and I approved of one.</p>

<p><span class="col_1985-1986" refersTo="page_1008"/>*I do not know Mr. Wainer. I read the newspaper reports and frequently heard his name mentioned in this House. Sir, I want to say this to the owners, the lessors: They have an association and they also have a code. I think they should see whether they cannot improve that code in such a manner that action can be taken against members who might perhaps act in such a way that a stigma is going to attach to this industry. Sir, this is a very important industry in our country; it is an industry which has to play a very important role, and I think it is the task of the members of that association&#x2014;I cannot condemn Mouton or Wainer&#x2014;to ensure that respectability, if I may put it in that way, is maintained in their industry.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton inquired about servants&#x2019; rooms. I am quite satisfied that as the legal position stands at present, servants&#x2019; rooms are in fact covered. Not a single complaint has reached me from anyone complaining that the rent from a servant&#x2019;s room had been terminated. Not a single complaint has reached my department either. Our view is that servants&#x2019; rooms are covered, and unless there is a court ruling to the effect that servants&#x2019; rooms are not covered, we shall continue as at present. We are not aware of any complaints, but if there were to be a court ruling to the effect that servants&#x2019; rooms are not included under the lease or under rent control, we shall have to consider this matter very positively in order to effect the necessary amendments because this can in fact be a method of intimidation.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer briefly to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton. She urged that the Second Reading be declined because the Government had refused to make known the findings of the Johannes Committee. Sir, is that a sound reason? After all, she is being asked whether she agrees with this Bill. She is very intelligent; she is, after all, able to judge the amendments which are being effected in this Bill on their merits. I indicated here last night that virtually all the drastic amendments originated with the Johannes Committee. The hon. member then maintains that the Second Reading should be declined, because the Government has failed to create conditions in which sufficient accommodation at reasonable rentals will be available for persons of the lower and middle income groups living in the cities.</p>

<p>Sir, this Bill, for all practical purposes applies to Whites, it applies to Indians to a very limited extent and Coloureds to a minimal extent; for the rest, it applies to Whites. My department is now spending in the region of, say, R80 million per annum on housing for these three population groups. The biggest slice of that R80 million is going to the Coloureds today because their position is the most critical, and what remains goes to the Whites and to the Indians. I want to tell the hon. member that if national circumstances allow the Minister of Finance to give me more money, I shall spend that money. The department is in a position to do so, but I think R80 million per annum is a considerable amount.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<p>You ought to encourage private enterprise.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I explained to the hon. member for Green Point last night, and I was unable to receive any reply from them. I do not know whether the hon. member for Houghton has received any reply yet. But I shall come to his speech. The amendment moved by the hon. member then states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(c) it does not provide adequate protection for tenants against unfair harrassment from landlords.</block>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that when we amended this Bill by removing the words &#x201C;with the object&#x201D; (of inducing that person to vacate), we took a very drastic step. The object need no longer be proved. That was the difficulty. All that need be proved now is that that person&#x2019;s peaceful enjoyment of what he is letting, is being interfered with in an improper manner. In that case it is possible to intervene. We have already gone very far, and I want to remind the hon. member once again of what I said a moment ago, namely that we could go too far, and the day we go too far, we will be driving people away from this industry, and that is a dangerous thing. That is all I want to say about the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<p>This brings me now to the hon. member for Wynberg. He told us that that side of the House gives more specific consideration to the lessee who suffers. In the same context I can refer to the speech made <span class="col_1987-1988" refersTo="page_1009"/>by the hon. member for Durban Point, who became emotional about the lessees who are suffering. Those hon. members cannot come to me today and say that my department and I have no sympathy for the lessee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I admitted that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member alleged that we were not giving consideration to the lessee who is suffering. I want to tell hon. members on the opposite side that there are two sides to every case. Now we do not for one moment accept that all the lessees are little angels. There is another side to that matter as well. I could invite the hon. member for Wynberg to examine in my office a letter which I received a few days ago from a small lessor, a woman who inherited a property which now has to provide her with her principal means of subsistence. She complained that the Rent Board had treated her unfairly and had determined such a low rent that she was unable to make a living. Then there is the story she told me of how the lessee had treated her, the damage which he had caused to her property. Consequently the lessors could also have tales of human suffering to tell. I can tell hon. members on the opposite side that there are two sides to this matter as well, and that there are ogres among the lessees as well. But then there is also the case of a lessor who went to look at a flat one day to find that the lessee had moved and had held a farewell party in the form of a barbecue, a barbecue in the middle of the lounge.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That is an exception.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members on the opposite side, and especially the hon. member for Umbilo, quoted the exceptions. This person gave a farewell barbecue in the middle of the lounge. He needed firewood, and then decided that the place had far too many doors in any case. So he took down a door and used it to make a barbeque fire. I could tell him about another case, a case which can be substantiated. An owner who went to a flat one day to carry out an inspection there, found that all that was left in that flat&#x2014; the person was still there&#x2014;was a mattress. He had sold all the furniture. But it did not end there. Everything which could be detached from the walls, the doors and the ceilings, had been removed and apparently had also been sold. What redress does that lessor have? He has no redress. He can lay a criminal charge, but what redress does he have from a person who owns only a mattress? So, Sir, there are two sides to this matter as well, and it is my task and the task of my department to try to look after both sides.</p>

<p>I also want to tell the hon. member for Wynberg that his reaction to the hon. member for Durbanville was very unfair, and I want to leave it at that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that he thought that very few people who had been owners prior to 1966 were still owners today. With that he destroyed his own argument. Would a person sell such a remunerative business? Surely one does not sell such a remunerative business; surely one keeps it for one&#x2019;s heirs to carry on. This point I shall subsequently link up to the argument advanced by another hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that an amendment is being effected in respect of rent value, and he linked uncontrolled flats to that. The hon. member should look at the Act. If he does so, he will find that a series of instruments are mentioned which are taken into consideration by the Rent Board.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I quoted it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member did not quote all of it. There is a series of instruments, but the Rent Board is not bound to all of them. Nor is the Rent Board bound to any specific one. I believe that these two provisions, namely that the Rent Board may take into consideration, if it finds this necessary and if this is available to it, the replacement value, as well as the price of an uncontrolled flat, enables the Rent Board to give precisely that balanced judgment which one should like to have, for complaints were voiced here of capricious rulings by Rent Boards. The hon. member also complained that Rent Boards would be inundated. I doubt whether that will be the case. The cases will simply be placed on the roll of the Rent Boards. It cannot be done in any other way. There is provision in the Act to the effect that a rent determination cannot be made with retrospective effect for longer than six months. I shall probably come to that as well later on. The hon. <span class="col_1989-1990" refersTo="page_1010"/>member also referred to applications for deproclamation. I have already dealt with that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte asked whether attention could not be given to the question of less affluent people, and controlled flats. I think I indicated last night what problems could arise here, and that means tests would then have to be applied. Means tests will then have to be applied, and when a person no longer meets the requirements of the means test, he will have to vacate the flat. This is the kind of problem which could be created here. It would entail an encroachment on the rights of the private entrepreneur, and I am disinclined to accept that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sandton said the Bill prejudices the middle and lower income groups. But the hon. member did not tell me that 8&#x00BD;% is too high. Is it too high? Or is it not too high?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>He says it is not enough. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As I interpreted the speech made by the hon. member for Sandton, he was implying that all dwelling units fall under rent control. If he was under that impression, he knows now that is not the case. Here I made a note: &#x201C;Lessors receive too little, and lessees are staring increases in the face.&#x201D; The hon. member for Sandton criticized the provision we made in this Bill in respect of the supply of electricity. I want to tell him that this is a protective measure for the lessee of a building who will, under given circumstances, have to pay a little extra. Now he can, however, keep a check on what he is paying&#x2014;he can read his meter. At the end of the month he can read his meter and say to the lessor: &#x201C;Here is my electricity account.&#x201D; At present the position is that he has to accept the amount which the lessor places in front of him because he has no control over it. He has to accept that amount and he has to wait to ascertain what the amount is which the lessor worked out and which he can collect from each lessee after he has submitted it to them.</p>

<p>Now the benefits apply to both sides. It makes it easier for the lessor as far as his calculations are concerned, and it makes it easier for the lessee because he is able to determine precisely how much he owes. He now knows exactly what he saved, and this amount goes into his pocket.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Why do you allow the lessor in certain circumstances to make a profit on such things as electricity which has been passed on to the lessee? Surely this is a wrong principle.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The amount involved is very small. It is not as important as the fact that the lessee now has control over what he has to pay, namely that he can read the meter himself and can determine himself what amount is owing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>May I make myself clear? Why is it not possible for the lessor to sell the electricity or pass it on to the lessee at exactly the same price that he pays for it? Why has he got to charge a higher rate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know what more I can say to explain to the hon. member for Sandton that, under the present system, the lessee has no control over the amount which he pays. He cannot calculate the amount. He has to accept the amount which the lessor submits to him, and he has to pay it. What is involved here are lesser amounts.</p>

<p>For the most part I have already dealt with other matters which the hon. member raised. As far as ejectments with the view to renovation are concerned, I just want to say this strengthens the position of the lessee. But now he wants to complain about this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North is, as I said yesterday, one of the few members who tried to go into the provisions of this measure in depth. It is not that I have a specific affinity to the hon. member for Johannesburg North, but it is true that he went into these provisions. He investigated and discussed them and arrived at the conclusion that the rate for which provision is being made in respect of the lessor, is still too low. I want to acknowledge that the hon. member for Johannesburg North is right on that score &#x2014;this rate of 8&#x00BD;% is low in contrast to the profit margin which the manufacturer, for example, is allowed when there is price control.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. the Minister refer to a profit of 8&#x00BD;% on an investment amount or on an arbitrary valuation which rises with the cost of building on the building cost index?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from><span class="col_1991-1992" refersTo="page_1011"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am including capital appreciation to which every man in this country is entitled. The capital appreciation to which I referred last night is not a new principle. I have told hon. members how this principle has been followed by Rent Boards over the years and how they have been trying to apply it in a rather more arbitrary way. That is exactly what it amounts to.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. the Minister a question? If the hon. the Minister agrees that they should have 8&#x00BD;% on an appreciating value, what does he regard as a reasonable return on a depreciating asset such as the investment of cash?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have been referring to factories and the profits allowed to such people. They also have their difficulties.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Johannesburg North referred to the risk that the Minister may proclaim and that this may keep people out of the industry. That is true; it is a real danger. I am aware that this may keep people out of the industry. This is why I am trying, with this legislation, to find a reasonable principle so that it will not deter people to that extent. The hon. member referred to intimidation. I have already disposed of that. In principle the hon. member advocated the lifting of rent control, and if the hon. member refers to the speech I made last night, he will find the standpoint in this respect. The hon. member also advocated a subsidy, but to whom? Is it to the lessee or to the lessor?</p>

<p>&#x2020;A subsidy to the lessor or the lessee? Which one?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Who is going to control that? Of all the thousands of people in this country who are hiring premises, who is going to control that? In other words, in what circumstances are we going to pay that subsidy? Is there going to be a means test? There has to be a means test. In other words, my department must also check up in respect of all the thousands of people who are living in rent-controlled premises and in uncontrolled premises in this country. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Hon. members must enable the hon. the Minister to finish.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Sir, the hon. members opposite are to blame for my not being able to finish. The member for Tygervallei asked me for two assurances. The one was that the Rent Boards would receive guidance. It is a recommendation of the Johannes Committee that the Rent Boards must be given guidance, and consequently it is the practice in my department that conferences with Rent Boards should take place from time to time. It is the intention that once this new legislation is in operation another conference of Rent Board chairmen will be held to inform Rent Boards about the provisions and what is being envisaged with them. My department cannot deprive the Rent Boards of the discretion of deciding what is reasonable for both sides. After all, Rent Boards are committed to principles. For example it is an integral part of the legislation that Rent Boards should be reasonable to both parties. In its ruling the Rent Board shall have to ask itself the question what is reasonable to the lessor and what is reasonable to the lessee.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown said that this legislation solves nothing. He said that Rent Boards determine value in a completely arbitrary way, but now that more fundamental instruments are being built into the legislation, he is opposed to them. He invoked assessors, and asked why they had not been included. If the hon. member would look at the relevant clause in the Act, he would see that they have in fact been included. I said last night that it had been our experience that the valuations of sworn appraisers sometimes differed by up to 800%. The hon. member is now suggesting that, as in the USA, buildings should be depreciated by 2&#x00BD;% per annum with a view to write-offs. If buildings had to be depreciated in this way, it would mean that the rent income would decrease every year. Surely that is not what is being envisaged. The hon. member for Durban Point also referred the hon. Chief Whip on this side of the House and the hon. member for Tygervallei to their voters. Why were they being referred to their voters? After all, we are trying to find a fair dispensation in there between people with conflicting interests.</p>

<p>He referred to the voters because this legislation will allegedly result in rent increases. My experience with voters has been that one can confront them with clean hands and look them in the eyes if one has acted fairly. That is my standpoint. What is being done here, is fair in respect of both parties.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member complained that the interest rate of 8&#x00BD;% and the replacement value would create a nightmare to thousands. Therefore, I take it that he disapproves of the interest rate of 8&#x00BD;% because it is too high.</p>

<p>The determination on replacement value makes it too high.</p>

<p>In other words, according to the hon. member, this person should not get 8&#x00BD;% interest on his capital.</p>

<p>It is appreciated capital and nothing else.</p>

<p>*Last night I dealt with this matter step by step in my speech. I mentioned the example of A and B. B receives it, while A is deprived of it because his block of flats was occupied a day later. Is that fair? Should we not also be fair to A? If we must then be unfair to A, we must also be unfair to B, and then we should apply rent control throughout. Is the hon. member in favour of that? If the hon. member had come to me and advocated that these things should not happen, but that rent control should be applied throughout, he would have had a point. But he did not say this to me because he would run into problems from some of his voters. I think that I have now, for the most part, replied to all the other points raised by the hon. member. He referred to people who were being misled into buying shares. Honestly, it is too much to expect of my department to guard against people buying shares which could get them into trouble. When I refer to shares. I am referring to shares in blocks of flats. To keep a watchful eye over individuals throughout the country is surely an impossible task.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point was not here. He apologized for that. I want to consider a few points which he raised here. He said that 2% on maintenance costs was sufficient.</p>

[Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, one need only look slightly askance at one of the six chicks of the hon. member for Houghton and she wants to peck at you.

</speech>

<p>Yes, the cost of construction.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The experience of the rent boards has been that they were unable to determine this. The hon. member for Wynberg told us that very few of the people who originally constructed those controlled flats are still the owners of such flats today. Consequently the present owner informs the rent board that he does not know what the cost of construction was. He says: &#x201C;I paid R100 000 for it, but do not ask me what it cost to construct&#x201D;. The rent boards accept that. Now the hon. member for Sea Point is saying that it should be established.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. the Minister a question? In relation to the buildings which fall under rent control at the moment, are there any buildings for which the original erection costs have not already been determined?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There may be thousands of them for all I know, but my information is that the rent boards cannot always determine the original erection costs. That is the position and that is one of the reasons why a substitute is being sought.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<p>But surely the costs of A and B were identical.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member asked me very specifically&#x2014;and pressed me for an answer&#x2014;whether I accepted responsibility for the lower and middle income groups in the cities. South Africa is not a socialist state. The Government of South Africa is trying to help as far as it is with in its means to do so. That is my reply in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member also stated it as a point that rent controlled flats should only be available to people who require the protection of the Rents Act. Does the hon. member for Sea Point really think that that is realistic? There are thousands of people who are at present living in rent controlled flats and who nevertheless do not require that protection. Should they be evicted and should the flats which fall vacant immediately be reoccupied by people who require the protection of the Rents Act? The day a person receives a salary increase and no longer falls within the category in which he requires the protection of the Act, should he have to vacate the premises in order to make way for the next man?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is a board for that purpose, and there is a person.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo mentioned the case of a widow whose rent was increased so drastically. What would his reply be? The rent board finds that that lessor has a reasonable right to a certain increase in rent in respect of that property. What else should the rent board do but determine that it is a reasonable rent? This is typical of the cases in regard to which, accusations are being levelled at me. I have sympathy for these people. My department is trying to make provision for these people in so far as it is within our power to do so. Financing is being provided for old-age homes. Financing is also being provided in other spheres where people are destitute. This is already being done today, and now it is being expected that the lessor should subsidize this person. This is a typical case of picking out the eyes.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo also requested that rent increases should not be made with retrospective effect. I do not know what the position used to be in respect of this matter of retrospective effect. I think it was for an indefinite period. It was precisely with a view to this that it has been fixed at six months. It has been fixed at six months because the lessor also has a right. When there is a delay of more than six months, perhaps of nine months, and the Rent Control board finds that that person was entitled to a certain rent as from that day, it is nevertheless fixed at six months. A sensible lessee will know that such an application is pending. He will realize that the possibility of an increase does in fact exist, and he will therefore take it into account.</p>

<p>(Second Reading)</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In order to realize in full the objectives of the Architects&#x2019; Act, 1970 (Act 35 of 1970), it is necessary to effect amendments to provide for the limited registration of persons as architects and to exempt certain persons from the application of the provisions of the Act.</p>

<p>These amendments are being effected at the request and on the recommendation of the South African Council of Architects, and the reasons and considerations underlying this are as follows:</p>

<p><i>Clauses</i> 1 <i>and</i> 2</p>

<p>These clauses amend sections 4(l)(b) and 14(l)(b) and relate to the amendment of section 19 (clause 3) in which provision is made for the limited registration of persons as architects. Because it is not beneficial for a person without full architect status to have control over the destiny of full-fledged architects, it is also undesirable for persons who are not registered as full-fledged architects to be appointed as members of the South African Council of Architects or its Education Advisory Committee.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3(a)</p>

<p>This clause amends section 19 by means of the insertion of a subsection after subsection (3) and is aimed at making concessions in the case of architects (primarily from foreign countries) who have qualifications which it will be possible to recognize, but the holder of which still has to pass an examination in professional practice as applicable in South Africa before being registered as an architect in terms of the Act. The main object is to enable in particular Government departments which desire to do so, to recruit such persons abroad and to employ them pending registration.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3(b)</p>

<p>This clause amends section 19(10)(b) and is of an administrative nature. The period of six months at present allowed for the payment of annual fees is unnecessarily long and is being reduced to 60 days to bring it into line with the period at present prescribed for the payment of membership fees to the South African Institute of Architects.</p>

<p>In addition there is an anomaly in the Act in the sense that the registration of a person as an architect or an architect-intraining automatically expires if he does not pay the annual fee within the prescribed period and he consequently has to re-register despite any extension of time for payment which the council may subsequently grant.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 3(c)</p>

<p>This clause amends section 19(12) and is necessary&#x2019; to enable the council to recover expenditure which it incurs in collecting arrear fees.</p>

<p><i>Clause 3(d) and</i> 4.</p>

<p>These clauses amend sections 19(13)(a) and (b) and 23(l)(e) and result from the insertion of the new section 19(3A).</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 5.</p>

<p>This clause inserts a new section similar to section 31 of the Professional Engineers Act, 1968 (Act 81 of 1968), and provides for the exemption of certain persons from, <i>inter alia,</i> the provisions relating to the demarcation of work in terms of section 7(3) (c) of the Act. In particular it affects architectural draftsmen who are at present performing work of an architectonic nature under a variety of designations. Apart from the fact that it has never been the intention to deprive these people of their livelihood, it is essential that in view of the <span class="col_2003-2004" refersTo="page_1017"/>continuing shortage of architects, their knowledge and services should be fully utilized, just as in the case of foreign architects who do not qualify for registration.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill contains amendments to the Architects&#x2019; Act. It is largely of an administrative nature but does contain two important principles. The two important principles are, firstly, that the council will now be able to register as architects those persons who do in fact and can in fact do the work of an architect and allow them under certain circumstances and under certain conditions to do the work of architects. The second important principle is that the hon. the Minister is now being empowered to exempt certain persons from the provisions of the Act and, I presume, also for that purpose.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. the Minister and his department and other departments of State in this country have had trouble with persons whom they have recruited overseas and have brought here to do the work of architects. The same applies to people recruited to do work in other professional capacities. They have found that they run into trouble with, for instance, the Public Service Commission regarding grades and salaries which should be offered to these persons because they do not have the required qualifications and because, for one reason or another, the Council of Architects or none of the Institutes of Architects in the country has agreed to accept them as members. Because of this we believe that this is a measure which is to be supported. The Bill, if enacted, will make available not only to the Government departments but also to the private sector the services of people who are qualified to do this work but who have not done it up to now.</p>

<p>With those few words it is my privilege to support the Bill on behalf of the official Opposition.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to note that the introduction of the Bill flows from a significant amendment that was effected in the Architects&#x2019; Act in 1970 as opposed to the original Architects&#x2019; and Quantity Surveyors&#x2019; Act of 1927. In the original Act the work of an architect was not protected but merely the name of the architect. One could not call oneself an architect but there was no protection to the work. As soon as one moves into the field of protecting the work, one will inevitably run into difficulties because there are people who do not have the formal qualifications and who are not acceptable to the professional associations, but who nevertheless have the ability. The fact that the hon. the Minister has come with the amending legislation is an admission on his part of the extreme difficulty in regulating a situation where you deny people the right to do work even when they have the necessary qualifications or the ability. And so he seeks authority to allow people who have not the necessary formal qualification, but nevertheless the technical competence to do the work which is normally restricted to qualified architects. For this reason we think that it is an anomaly, a problem which has to be met by way of exemption. We will support the measure as far as it permits exemptions to be made to the general blanket ban on people doing the work of architects.</p>

<p>I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to clause 5 providing for exemption of persons from the provisions of Act, and put it to him that the initiation for the exemption should not lie with the Minister, &#x201C;in consultation with the council&#x201D; as it is stated, but should rather lie with the Council of Architects. He has appointed a Council of Architects&#x2014;he has the exclusive right to appoint them&#x2014;selected from 12 persons who shall be nominated by the various architects&#x2019; institutes. Two others will be professors and there will be one person selected by the Minister because he is in the service of the State and two other members selected because of their special knowledge either in relation to the architectural profession or to the laws relating to architecture. It is in fact the Minister who appoints these people. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should have sufficient confidence to rely on their advice in this matter and that he should only act when this change or this exemption is sought by them. For this reason we will move an amendment at the Committee Stage, not to deprive the Minister of the right to grant exemptions, but instead of it reading &#x201C;the Minister may, after consultation with the council&#x201D; we believe that the Minister should consider rewording it so that it should read &#x201C;the Minister, upon consideration and approval of any relevant recommendation of the council&#x201D;, take this action.</p>

<p><span class="col_2005-2006" refersTo="page_1018"/>We do feel that, where the Minister has appointed a council and where he trusts that council, he should act on their initiative rather than on his own in consultation with the council. Subject to the Minister giving serious consideration to this amendment which we move, we have pleasure in supporting this amending legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would, in the first place, like to express my appreciation for the support&#x2014;apparently qualified support&#x2014;of the Progressive Party and the complete support of the United Party.</p>

<p>In connection with the amendment suggested by the hon. member for Sea Point, I would like to make it clear to him why I won&#x2019;t be in a position to accept that amendment. In the first place this legislation is as proposed by the Board of Architects, as I stated in my Second Reading speech. The second and very important reason is that is a factor of conflicting interests between these building designers and the registered architects who constitute this board. There are, as I have said, conflicting interests. That is the reason why I think the final discretion should rest with the Minister and not with the board.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In the application of any Act, necessary amendments present themselves from time to time. Circumstances, or the requirements for the effective implementation of the Act change, and consequently the necessary adjustments have to be made. The Bill before you represents such essential adjustments to the Community Development Act. I shall deal with each of the adjustments separately.</p>

<p>Clause 1</p>

<p>Section 16(l)(a) of the aforesaid Act in its present form provides that when the Community Development Board required all the lots or erven within any township or portion of a township, all the public places in that township or portion thereof rests in the board, and these are deemed to have been closed, etc.</p>

<p>It is happening now in the urban renewal areas that the board has tackled in various cities, that when all the lots in an area have been acquired, the streets have been deemed to have been closed and the board, as the owner of the land, is then responsible for what happens there. However, it frequently happens that the board replans and redevelops the properties on both sides of the street and the street is retained in its original form. In those cases it is therefore not necessary for the streets to be closed and for the board to bear the responsibility as owner. Consequently it is deemed necessary that the board should be able to determine which streets are to be regarded as closed and when they are to be regarded as closed.</p>

<p>Clause 2</p>

<p>Under section 43A of the Act no licence referred to in Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the Licences Act, 1962 (Act No. 44 of 1962) with the exception of a licence referred to in items 5, 12, 16 or 19 of said Part 1 may be issued for the first time to an unauthorized person unless a certificate is issued by me or someone authorized thereto by me. The aim of this section is to prevent traders from infiltrating into areas in which they are unauthorized persons. It is also the object to effect a resettlement by means of licence control and to ensure that licences are issued to a variety of dealers in group areas so that unauthorized traders must also play their part in their own group areas.</p>

<p>With reference to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Trade Licensing and Relating Matters, 1964, an inter-provincial committee was appointed to implement the recommendations. The result of this inter-provincial committee was the identifying of business concerns which have to be licensed and ordinances which make provision for the necessary licensing. The four provincial councils passed ordinances accordingly and each of these ordinances provides that the Licences Act 1962 be repealed <span class="col_2007-2008" refersTo="page_1019"/>in respect of the application thereof to the province concerned. The authorization thereto is granted to the provinces by Act No. 69 of 1968.</p>

<p>It appears from the above that section 43A of the Community Development Act, 1966, is now based on an Act which, has been repealed by the respective ordinances, and the section concerned will therefore have to be amended. The existing section 43A excludes certain licences. However, it appears that the various ordinances do not incorporate the description of businesses and professions as contained in Act 44 of 1962. The businesses and professions have been redescribed as well as regrouped in the ordinances. Furthermore the ordinances described businesses which, are not mentioned in the Act. Apart from that businesses are being excluded in section 43A which according to the ordinances do not exist as a business which has to be licensed. Some licences fall away in certain provinces while they are retained in others. For the purposes of uniformity, therefore, it is advisable that none of the licenses mentioned in the ordinances should be excluded from the operation of the contemplated amendment of section 43A. The ordinances in question have already come into operation on various dates for the various provinces, and consequently it is necessary for the amendment as envisaged in clause 2(2) to be made applicable.</p>

<p>Clause 3</p>

<p>In terms of section 32(10)(a) of the Community Development Act, 1966, no changes or extensions or additions to a building may be effected or any new building erected on land, the owner of which is an unauthorized person or company, without the prior approval of the board. Unauthorized extensions to buildings create serious resettlement problems and notwithstanding the penalty for a contravention of this provision as prescribed in section 50(1), contravention of section 32(10)(a) have recently occurred more and more frequently.</p>

<p>A similar provision to that contained in section 32(10)(a) appears in section 15(2) (e) in respect of &#x201C;frozen areas&#x201D;, where urban renewal is taking place. In respect of the latter section the penal provision for a contravention is contained in section 50 (2) which is very effective since a contravention of the prohibition seldom if ever occurs in this respect. The proposed amendment in this clause therefore merely brings the penal provision in respect of section 32(2)(a) cases into line with the penal provision in respect of section 15(2)(e) cases, as contained in section 50(2) of the Act.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has introduced this Bill with brevity. He introduced it in the same manner in the Other Place. Nevertheless, I think it is necessary to examine this measure in a little more detail to realize what its implications are, particularly having regard to the declared intent of the Government, supported by all sides of this House, to eliminate unnecessary discrimination on the grounds of colour. The hon. the Minister has presented this measure as being purely an administrative one because of the fact that section 43A of the Act is no longer of effect as the result of certain provincial enactments that have been promulgated and of the transfer of licensing powers to the provincial authorities. However, the implications of the Bill are not quite as simple as that.</p>

<p>To turn to the Bill itself, we have no objections to the provisions of clause 1. The hon. the Minister has referred to the question of roads. He said that roads should remain open when the board has acquired the total area of a township. This is a valid reason for this amendment. I think there is another reason which also justifies this amendment. When one has regard to what is done in the laying out of townships, one frequently finds that there are waterways, ravines, etc., which form open areas within the townships. I see no reason why such open areas should be taken over by the board and why they should be closed to the general public. But one welcomes the provision of clause 1 that enables the board to look at the open areas which fall within a township to decide which of those ought to be closed to the public.</p>

<p>Clause 2, on the other hand, contains provisions to which we have basic objections. Our objections to this clause are indeed so deep-seated that we cannot support the Second Reading of this Bill. I believe I should detail to the hon. the Minister why we adopt this attitude. In 1968, when the existing section 43A of the Act was enacted, we had a fairly lengthy discussion in this House concerning the extent to which the Minister should be able to control licensing in areas which normally fall under local or provincial authority. I do not propose to repeat the views that were expressed at <span class="col_2009-2010" refersTo="page_1020"/>the time, but since then developments that have taken place in regard to the licensing of trades and occupations were of such a nature that I believe section 43A should not be amended but should be repealed, i.e. removed entirely from the Community Development Act. We cannot do that in the Bill that is before us; we can only reject the amendment. I believe therefore that the hon. the Minister would have acted more wisely had he taken steps summarily to repeal the whole of section 43A in the principal Act. We cannot move that section 43A be omitted from the Act. We can only reject the amendment. If we do reject the amendment as it appears in the Bill before us then section 43A will become meaningless and will have no legal effect. In fact, our rejection of this amendment will have the effect of repealing section 43A entirely.</p>

<p>I have said that there are reasons why I believe this should be done. The first is that the commission of inquiry to which the hon. the Minister referred, the Commission of Inquiry into Trade Licensing and Allied Problems reported in 1964. I do not think that this measure was before the House when we debated the amendments in 1968. It was stated by the hon. the Minister that the recommendations of that 1964 commission were referred to an interprovincial committee which was required to give effect to the commission&#x2019;s recommendations. That has now been done and by law, by ordinances that have been adopted in the various provinces and because of the lapsing of the 1962 Act in so far as trade and occupation licences are concerned, licensing is firmly in the hands of the provinces. The responsibility for licensing and the control of the issue of licences rests with the provinces. Therefore the retention of section 43A as it stands is meaningless because the proposed amendment is contrary to the principles which the provinces themselves were asked to adopt and to take over from the 1964 commission&#x2019;s report. We believe then that as far as the measure before us is concerned it is running foul of what has in effect been accepted by the Government, viz. that licensing should be taken over by the provincial authorities and conducted by them. There is therefore no reason for this provision to remain in the Community Development Act.</p>

<p>The second point that I want to refer to is also a development since 1968. That is that the powers and functions of the Coloured Representative Council and of the Indian Council have been substantially extended since the original Community Development Act was introduced in 1966 and since the amendments of 1968 were adopted. However, we have before us today, in 1975, a suggested amendment of statutory provisions which now apply in which there is not one word of an obligation being placed upon the hon. the Minister of Community Development to consult with either the CRC or the Indian Council when members of those communities are directly affected by the powers which the hon. the Minister is to exercise. Without that provision that in itself serves to make the amendment which is before us to section 43A totally unacceptable.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also told us in his remarks to us today that the powers to control licensing were required so as to make resettlement effective. In other words, the hon. the Minister wants to use what is purely a taxation provision&#x2014;that is all that licensing is&#x2014;which under the laws of the central Government was the responsibility of the Department of Inland Revenue and is regarded as a taxation measure and not as anything else, as a lever to effect resettlement. As far as this position is concerned, I think I must refer to the answer which the hon. the Minister gave me in a written reply to question No. 96 a day or two ago. As far as the position of Indian traders is concerned, I asked the hon. the Minister how many Indian traders had become disqualified to remain in their previous premises and the latest date for which figures were available; in respect of what dates those figures were and how many of these traders remained to be resettled in new premises. The reply was that 5 058 Indian traders became disqualified. This figure is given as at 31 December 1974. Of the 5 058, 4 074 are still to be resettled in the areas for which they qualify. Surely it is wrong that a taxation measure such as licensing should be in the hands of the Minister of Community Development without any consultation whatsoever with the Indian Council&#x2014;there is no obligation upon him to consult the council&#x2014;to see to the resettlement of 4 074 Indian traders who are at present disqualified. I believe, Sir, that it is an undesirable approach that taxation measures should be used to implement a socio-economic measure such as the resettlement of disqualified persons. These powers are being asked for to ensure that unqualified or inexperienced traders get fair <span class="col_2011-2012" refersTo="page_1021"/>treatment in their group area. I think the words used by the hon. the Minister in his speech this afternoon were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">om te verseker dat groepsgebiedelisensies uitgereik word aan &#x2019;n verskeidenheid van handelaars sodat onbevoegde handelaars ook hul deel in hul eie groepsgebiede kry.</block>

<p>Is that a motive, Sir? Who better can decide which of these persons should be given these opportunities than the local authorities in consultation with, in the case of the Coloureds, the Coloured Representative Council, or, in the case of the Indians, the Indian Council? They will have personal knowledge; they will have local knowledge which is certainly not available to the Minister to enable him to decide whether A, B or C should get a permit to obtain a licence for a particular trade or occupation. Sir, I asked the hon. the Prime Minister earlier this session whether it was the intention of the Government to allow representation of the non-Whites on the various boards which determine matters which affect them in common with the other groups, and he assured me that the matter was receiving some attention and that probably there would be such appointments. Sir, we meet here this afternoon and we are asked to give this power to the Minister of Community Development when no such appointments have been made to the boards concerned, but section 43A is to be amended to vest the power in the hands of the Minister of Community Development. Sir, subsection (3) of section 43A, which is not in the Bill before us but which was introduced at the request of this side of the House when we debated this matter in 1968, provides that the Minister may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> apply the provisions of section 43(1). It is his right to control the issue of permits, and those powers would apply to areas which he might specifically designate by notice in the <i>Gazette.</i> But, Sir, there is no say for the persons affected, Coloureds or Indians, as to whether or not certain areas should be so designated under that section.</p>

<p>Although the hon. the Minister explained in his introductory speech that it was merely to meet a situation which had changed in regard to licensing authorities, the Bill in fact extends the control that the Minister had under the 1968 amendment. Part 1 of the 1962 Licensing Act had reference only to trade licences; part 2 of that Act, which was not brought under the Community Development Act, was the section which deals with occupational licences, like brokers, appraisers, and licences of that nature. Now in the Bill before us the words are &#x201C;to deal with licences in respect of any trade or occupation&#x201D;. It is a further extension of the powers previously vested in the hon. the Minister. Now, this action, the introduction of this Bill, is contrary to the recommendations of the commission which sat to deal with trade licences. It is contrary to the recommendations of the commission which were passed on by this Government to the provincial authorities for implementation, because if one turns to the report, to page 88, paragraph 718(i) one finds that the commission stated that full and effective power should be granted to provincial councils to legislate in regard to the licensing of trades and occupations and the existing power to collect and retain revenues from the licensing of trades and occupations listed in the first schedule and parts 1 and 2 of the second schedule of the Licences Act of 1962 should be transferred from the central Government to urban and rural local authorities and to the provincial administrations in those White areas not falling within the jurisdiction of such local authorities or within the Bantu homelands. Now, that was the recommendation. Now the Minister, in terms of the amendment before us, is to retain one of the fundamental rights of licensing, i.e. the veto right on the individual as to whether he should get a licence or not. Those are the recommendations made by the commission. But what is involved is that this Bill will give the Minister the inherent right to control the necessity of whether a business should or should not be established, and also to say what his view is on the qualification or otherwise of the applicant to obtain a licence. But here again the commission dealt with this matter very fully. I do not want to take up your time, Sir, by dealing with a lot of these recommendations, but I would like to refer to paragraph 718, subparagraph (17). (18) and (19). What does the commission say? It says that the commission cannot recommend the criterion embodying necessity or public need which restricts competition by limiting the number of licences, and it has come to the conclusion that although substantial discretionary powers should be granted to the licensing authorities, they should not be authorized to refuse licence applications on the <span class="col_2013-2014" refersTo="page_1022"/>ground of necessity, sufficiency of business or over-trading. Special business qualifications as a prerequisite to the issue of a licence are not recommended. That is what the Minister referred to, that the unqualified, the inexperienced man should have an opportunity of operating within his own territory. That is the very recommendation of this commission and is the operative directive to the Provincial Administrations. It goes on in subparagraph (19) to say that hearings of licensing boards should be held in public subject to a discretionary power vested in the chairman to exclude the public should he consider it not necessary. In other words, Sir, this should not be an administrative matter executed at the discretion of a Minister. The issuing of licences should be a matter which is open for everyone to see and hear what is taking place. The commission went further and ensured in its recommendations that the licensing authority should give reasons for its decision and that there should be appeals to a statutory tribunal. Sir, in the matter before us, and the procedures which are inherent in the Bill before us, none of that is there. It is purely an administrative right vested in the Minister. Now, the necessity for permits for persons disqualified in terms of the Group Areas Act, or in terms of any other legislation, was considered by this commission. After all, the licensing authority is subservient to legislation of this House. This House has, in fact, passed legislation in regard to the rights of use and occupation. It is very interesting to read what the commission said in regard to this particular aspect of the matter. I should like to quote from page 48 of the report, paragraphs 364, 365 and 366. This makes very interesting reading, when one realizes that this report was published in 1964. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under the circumstances the commission therefore feels compelled to recommend that notice be taken of the provisions of the Group Areas Act and that future licensing legislation provides that a licensing board shall refuse an application for a licence if the issue of the licence or the occupation of the premises in respect of which a licence is applied for is contrary to or is prohibited by or under the Group Areas Act.</block>

<p>This is a recognition of the overriding authority of the Government, empowered by an Act of this House. I continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission would like to emphasize here that it could find no precedents for discrimination in the issuing of trade licences to persons on the grounds of race or colour, nor do its recommendations contained herein amount to such discrimination in any way. Its sole aim has been to take cognizance of existing legislation. Although evidence was given before the commission in which it was requested that members of certain racial groups be protected by means of licensing legislation against unfair competition by members of other racial groups, such recommendations or steps would in effect amount to discrimination on the grounds of race or colour and the commission is not prepared to make such recommendations.</block>

<p>This finding makes interesting reading today, when we are <i>ad idem</i> on both sides of the House that discrimination on the grounds of colour only must be removed. We find that this was the attitude which was adopted in 1964 by this commission. May I mention, Sir, that this report had not been published when the House discussed the 1968 amendment to the Act. It seems to me that, until this House sees fit to amend the Group Areas Act, the licensing authorities are bound by the laws in regard to use and occupation in terms of the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p>It is not, Mr. Speaker. It is all very well for the hon. member to try to evade and escape the consequences, but if you vest the power in a certain authority to control licensing, then that body must control licensing in every respect. Let me say that I am a very <span class="col_2015-2016" refersTo="page_1023"/>reasonable person when it comes to these matters. I want to suggest to the hon. member that if he really wants to be reasonable in this matter&#x2014;and he knows this from his experience at local authority level&#x2014;the best people to determine whether A or B or C should be allowed to trade in a particular area, if he or she is disqualified, are the local authorities. They know the people, they know the background and they know the situation. Sir, I shall certainly support the hon. member in the Committee Stage if he is prepared to move an amendment to this clause whereby the permits to be granted to comply with the Group Areas Act are granted by the hon. the Minister on the recommendation of the statutory licensing authority. Sir, the hon. member looks puzzled. I want to say that the Licensing Act in fact provides for a form of taxation. The whole concept in this report is that licensing is a form of taxation. Suggestions in this report that that revenue should go directly to the provinces and local authorities instead of to the central Government were accepted by the Government. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs helped to pass the legislation through the Cape Provincial Council. He was very happy as an MEC to say that the legislation was desirable because the provincial administration would like to control licensing. Having done that, he must now in his present capacity be consequential and say that the provincial authorities should do the licensing and should have the right to recommend the extension of permits to disqualified persons when they should like to obtain trade licences. It is a quite reasonable request. I should like to go even further and say that in the case of Coloureds, the Coloured Representative Council should be consulted. I believe that that council should make the necessary recommendations if a Coloured group area is involved. It is, after all, inherent in the whole policy of having a Coloured Representative Council that it should look after the affairs of the Coloured community, more especially after the local affairs of the Coloured community. I believe that when it comes to licensing even this Government will in due time pass licensing authority for Coloured group areas, whether they be business or residential areas, over to the Coloured Representative Council. If that is a reasonable approach, why should the Coloured Representative Council not decide on the issue of licences for trading within a Coloured group area or the Indian Council in so far as Indian group areas are concerned?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>It is for the White provincial administration to decide whether he should get a licence or not. It is quite a simple matter. Surely the whole basis of this is local autonomy. A decision should be taken by the local authority as to what ought to be done. I believe that is an approach with which nobody can find fault. Here is an opportunity to move in the direction which we in this House all agree we must do, i.e. in a direction away from keeping the rights within the hands of the White authorities to dictate who, Coloured or Indian, can trade whether it is in a Coloured or White area. I think we are losing an opportunity by enacting this amendment as it reads now. We are losing an opportunity of moving along that road. For those reasons I do not need to elaborate further on our attitude. I am sure that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs will enter this debate. He has studied this 1964 report and he presented it with his usual forcefulness to the Cape Provincial Council for acceptance as a highly desirable development flowing from the Licensing Act of 1962. I am sure that he will support me in saying that we cannot accept the Bill as it stands now. We could have accepted it if there were adequate recognition of the rights of the Coloured Representative Council and of the Indian Council but there is not. For that reason we cannot support the Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

Once again I point out that this legislation incorporates no new principle. It has been introduced with the sole and exclusive aim of bringing about uniformity and laying down guidelines in accordance with which the provincial administrations issue and control licences in cases where altered situations have developed since the legislative power was transferred to the provincial councils. These altered situations also gave rise to many changes in respect of new licences that had to be issued, other licences that lapsed, and so on. All that this amendment envisages is establishing guidelines so as to bring about uniformity and co-ordinate the four provinces, each of which has its own authority over this matter. Consequently I do not see why group areas should be brought into it. Group areas were discussed when the Act was discussed originally and I am therefore unable to follow what the hon. Opposition has in mind in again discussing, through the hon. member for Green Point, the whole question of group areas. I therefore want to support the amendment as proposed by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill contains three provisions which deal with three separate matters and in so far as clause 1 is concerned, from a purely technical point of view and as it introduces no new principles, I think one can find no fault with it.</p>

<p>As far as clause 3 is concerned, there a new remedy is provided and we have some difficulty with part of that remedy particularly in so far as it now refers to the fact that in addition to imposing a fine or imprisonment, it may also, if the court convicts an individual, cause such person to demolish an alteration, extension or addition, in fact order that the person concerned be rejected from the portion of the building which has been altered, extended or added to. From a purely practical point of view, one of the difficulties that arises is that an alteration may be of such a nature that it is quite clear that as a result of a minor alteration, you may find the man completely ejected either from a room in a building or possibly even from the whole building itself. This seems to be an illogical step to take in connection with what may be a minor alteration. The word &#x201C;alteration&#x201D; is not defined. Let me give you a simple example. If you have a bathroom, but you have not had a shower in the bathroom and you then provide a shower in the bathroom, that is an alteration as a result of which you may be allowed to occupy the rest of the house, but you are ejected from the bathroom. It is obviously an illogical thing to seek to do. I think that the problem with this provision is that while it seeks to effect a remedy, it casts its net so wide that it may become an absurdity in the end if applied in that particular fashion. I think that that could be regarded as a relatively minor matter and clauses 1 and 3 fall into that particular category.</p>

<p>When we come to clause 2, we are in quite a different field. Here we are not dealing with pure technicalities but with the lives of individuals, with their ability to work and their ability to prosper. The hon. member for Green Point has made very valid points, which I do not want to repeat, in regard to the concept of the delegation of powers and in regard to the fact that one should decentralize to the maximum extent possible and I hold that view. When it comes to licensing, the commission made it very clear that this was a power which should be exercised on a decentralized basis. The present provision which is before us goes much, further than the existing Act because it now specifically includes in it occupations and trades which were not previously covered by the provisions of <span class="col_2019-2020" refersTo="page_1025"/>section 43A. Consequently, it widens the whole ambit of this issue. It then raises the issue of the freedom of the individual to trade where he wants. One of the matters which seems to us to be of importance in relation to what is happening on the South African scene, is that it is perfectly proper for Black, Coloured and Indian people to buy in White shops while it is not regarded in the same light that they sell to White individuals. Let me take a simple example. The commercial community would be hit by a disaster if for example the Coloured people were not allowed to shop in the White stropping centres of the Cape Peninsula and it would be a disaster to the commercial community if the Black people were no longer allowed to shop in Eloff Street in Johannesburg. There is no doubt that it would be a calamity or a disaster from a business point of view if this should happen. What to our mind is completely lacking in this approach is that it is perfectly proper to have Black, Coloured or Indian people working in Adderley Street or Eloff Street and to have Black, Coloured and Indian people buying goods and being in a shop in a so-called White area in Adderley Street, Eloff Street or in any part of South Africa while it is wrong in the eyes of the governing party of this House that Blacks, Coloureds or Indian people should own shops in the same place.</p>

<p>That hon. gentleman is somewhat excited at the truth. With great respect, this is a fundamental principle, and what is happening at the present moment is that we are passing another piece of legislation which is discriminatory, which can only bring us into disrepute and which we do not accept.

Not only should all races be allowed to buy there, but they should also be allowed to trade, to sell and to carry on ordinary business activities there.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, like previous hon. speakers I should like to deal with clause 2 of this Bill before us this afternoon. I was horrified to hear the hon. member for Hercules saying that no new principle was embodied in the proposed amendments which are before us. I have never heard such utter nonsense in all my life. Here we have a complete amendment to existing legislation, yet he suggests that no new principle is being introduced.</p>

<p>I would like to localize this problem and bring it down to a level where we can understand what this type of legislation can do in a particular field of business operations. Although this clause will no doubt be dealt with at greater length in the Committee Stage, I am sure you will permit me, Sir, to highlight an aspect of this clause and to illustrate one of the many reasons for our objecting to the proposals before us. I would ask that we look closely at the effects <span class="col_2021-2022" refersTo="page_1026"/>of clause 2 on one particular type of licence, a licence, incidentally, that is enumerated here as being item 12 of Act No. 44 of 1962. This licence is granted to people of all the race groups which make up our complex South African society, but in particular it is granted in Natal to members of one race group enabling a large proportion of this group to make an honest and decent living &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, by producing this Bill in the year of the women! As I say, I am referring to housewives of all races who live in their respective areas&#x2014; they live there legally, I may add, because they are in the areas demarcated in terms of the Groups Areas Act. These housewives actually expect the Indian hawker to call regularly plying his ware, because they have come to rely on him for their supplies of fruit and vegetables. This is the situation in Durban. Indeed in Durban this hawker is universally known as the &#x201C;Vegetable Sammy.&#x201D; I do not say this in a disrespectful tone at all. He is simply known as the &#x201C;Vegetable Sammy.&#x201D; He is known as such by the Indian housewife and by the White housewife. He calls on Indian-owned homes in places such as Chatsworth; he calls on Coloured-owned homes in Sparks Estate; and he calls on White-owned homes on the Bluff, in Durban North and in all the other White suburbs of Durban. Incidentally, he is also seen with his truck doing business in the Bantu areas such as Kwa Mashu and Cleremont.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. W. B. PAGE</person>:</from>

<p>Firstly, when he makes application for his licence and he wants to ply his trade as a fruit and vegetable hawker using a vehicle, he has to specify the type of vehicle in his application. The vehicle has to be such that it is acceptable to the licensing officer. It may be inspected prior to the licence being granted, and he has to make it available for inspections at any time he may be called upon to do so, certainly at the times of the renewal of such licence. Secondly, he has to provide a store-room or storerooms, storage facilities which are examined prior to the granting of the licence and also prior to renewal. These storerooms are subject to inspection by the health department of the local authority concerned and, I might add, at any time. They are also subject to snap inspections by officials of the licensing department if they should want to make them. The storeroom is situated in the area in which the applicant lives and usually forms part and parcel of his home. In that respect, therefore, there is no transgression of the terms of the Group Areas Act. I think it will be agreed that every precuation is taken.</p>

<p><span class="col_2023-2024" refersTo="page_1027"/>The licence is granted in respect of either a magisterial district or of a particular demarcated area within the boundaries of a borough or township such is allowed or prescribed by the licensing officer. That can be a White, a Coloured, an Indian or even a Black area. Where do we go from there? [Interjection.] My hon. friend opposite says they will not be affected. What are we going to do? In the White areas are we going to declare every little road verge which an Indian hawker happens to stop on, the road verge outside my home, suitable for Indian occupation just while he is there as a hawker every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday morning?</p>

<p>I believe that the existing measures are effective in ensuring control and are also fairest to all, the trader and the client. The interests of the housewife are safeguarded as regards the fairness of prices paid because sufficient licences are granted in order to maintain healthy competition, and the interests of the hawker are safeguarded in that the number of licences granted does not in any way create a situation where overtrading precludes him from making a living. I am sure that the House will be interested to know that in Durban alone as of yesterday, there were 1 595 licensed hawkers of whom 338 were licensed to trade in Indian areas specifically, like Chatsworth, 919 in the city of Durban &#x2014;this would include flatland and suburbia&#x2014; and, coincidentally, again 338 in other areas, that is to say, in areas other than Indian or White areas. These could be Coloured or Bantu areas. We must ask now what is wrong with this existing system and method of control and why must a ministerial permit now be obtained in respect of any new application? Surely, Sir, it would be far more desirable to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and to leave it to the people who know what they are doing in this connection, that is to say, the local authorities and their licensing officials, to determine what is needed and what will best serve the local interests and demand.</p>

<p>Listening to them, one might think that we were dealing here with a very drastic measure with far-reaching consequences and that South Africa&#x2019;s whole future was at stake. However, Sir, when we read the Bill and consider what it involves, we find that it involves nothing more and nothing less than a mere adjustment of the existing Act to allow for altered circumstances. Actually, it is merely an administrative measure. But the hon. member for Green Point has well and truly let the cat out of the bag for us. Hon. members opposite are not really opposed to the amendments that are now being moved here. What they are really opposed to is the principal Act. Because they were unable to have their way in 1968 when <span class="col_2025-2026" refersTo="page_1028"/>the principal Act was placed on the Statute Book, they want to try and unman that Act in its present form by opposing this amendment bill now. The hon. member said so in so many words: that he could not ask for the repeal of section 43A and that consequently they opposed the amendment and tried to get their way by that means, because the mentioned section would then be null and void. Actually they want to get around the Standing Rules and Orders in this way, as it were.</p>

<p>They come here peddling all kinds of arguments and say that these are supposedly far-reaching extensions of the Minister&#x2019;s powers, and that it is in conflict with stated policy that licensing should now be the prerogative of the provincial authorities. Surely, Mr. Speaker, that is not true. If we consider what is implied in the amendment Bill, then we find that the extension of powers is only in respect of four types of licence, namely a peddler&#x2019;s licence, a hawker&#x2019;s licence, an ostrich feather buyer&#x2019;s licence and a buchu buyer&#x2019;s licence.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if the hon. gentlemen will only give me a chance I shall come to those other specious arguments of theirs. Before doing so I just want to refer to the extension of the Minister&#x2019;s powers in that the exceptions in terms of the old Act are now being done away with. To that extent the Minister&#x2019;s powers are now being extended. But surely, Sir, this does not constitute an interference with the authority or the prerogative of provincial authorities in regard to licensing in general. It only concerns the implementation and application of the Community Development Act; that is what is involved here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point advanced a whole long argument about the implications of licensing and the question of whether licensing is solely a tax measure. I want to differ from him. Licensing is by no means a question of taxation only; it is also a control measure. We had the same principle in respect of the Liquor Act. After all, licensing in terms of the Liquor Act is certainly not concerned solely with the aspect of revenue; it is also concerned with the aspect of control. It is therefore in itself a specious argument that licensing is only a question of taxation. It is in fact also a control measure.</p>

<p>This Bill does not provide for an interference in the powers of provincial authorities with regard to licensing. It only has regard to licensing in as far as the Community Development Act is concerned with the matter. But, of course, it does not suit the hon. member for Green Point to put the matter so clearly. Now he is confusing the issue and simply talking about licensing in general so as to be able to drag in this argument, an argument that really has nothing to do with the measure at present before the House. Sir, I say that this is definitely not a case of extension of the Minister&#x2019;s powers. It is merely a question of the rectification or the adjustment of the existing Act so as to allow for the circumstances that have arisen in that the Licences Act of 1962, Act No. 44 of 1962, has been repealed by the Act of 1968. As the hon. member for Green Point himself said, if this adjustment or amendment is not effected, the existing measure is deprived of all force and effect.</p>

<p>In conclusion I also want to refer to the argument advanced by the hon. member for Yeoville. I want to tell him that he used this measure as a peg on which to hang an attack on the Government&#x2019;s whole approach, viz. the Government&#x2019;s approach in regard to separate group areas. He states that the Government is wrong, but I want to remind him that the Government&#x2019;s approach is in accordance with the repeated verdicts of the electorate of this country, which wishes this Government to implement these measures, and until such time as he and his party acknowledge this fact &#x2026;</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville once again that he and his party&#x2014; and the official Opposition might as well also take note of this&#x2014;will achieve nothing by attacking the Government with regard to these basic standpoints, in regard to which the voters have expressed themselves repeatedly.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I expected this reaction today because I had to listen to precisely the same argument in the Other Place when the measure was discussed there. Consequently nothing new has, in fact, been added, except for the fact that the hon. member for Green Point quoted from the report of the Commission of Enquiry that investigated this matter. I am also going to quote from the report; I have the same right as he does. In the first place I want to stress that, as hon. members on this side of the House have also said, I am not coming to this House with a new principle. I am not asking for an extension of the powers vested in my department. My department had no need specially to involve these new bodies and persons that are being involved and to which reference has been made, namely the hawkers, the ostrich feather buyers, the buchu sellers and the Part 2 people. We did not need to do so before these measures were taken, but now the situation has arisen where, as a result of the recommendations that have been made and the legislation that has been passed here, the provinces have promulgated their own ordinances in this connection. They were, of course, entitled to do so. Those ordinances were not precisely uniform. Nor could one expect this to be the case with the various provinces and executive committees. Nor did they follow the guidelines laid down by the original Act; otherwise we could have dealt with the matter easily. For that reason it became necessary for a uniform provision to be laid down through this Bill to ensure that the objectives of the Community Development Act are not frustrated. The objectives of the Community Development Act do not concern the interests of the Whites only, but also concern the interests of the Coloureds and the Indians. Under given circumstances, all three of these groups are in precisely the same position as disqualified persons. Consequently all three are treated alike in terms of this legislation.</p>

<p>In the Other Place, Indians, in particular, were referred to as the people who would be affected. But the Indians themselves insist that there should be no infiltration&#x2014;they have made prepresentations and have held discussions with me. The day those people are re-settled, my department has to provide them with accommodation equal, in terms of floor area, to what they had before and for which they had possessed a permit. That accommodation must be provided at a subsidized rent in order to enable them to be re-settled. That is why my department is involved when new licences are issued. This provision only deals with first licences. The hon. member for Green Point adopts the standpoint that the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and the Indian Council should have been consulted. I said in the Other Place, and I say it again: No new principle is involved here; no new powers are sought. I said it there, and I say it again here, that I am not prepared to use those councils merely as rubber stamps. No significant new measures of any kind are being effected. My department would not have been interested in this matter if it were not for the circumstances that have arisen. My department and I cannot allow the aims of the Community Development Act to be frustrated. The hon. member for Green Point is quite wrong when he states that licence control is purely a tax measure. That is not true. Taxation is only a secondary aim of licence control.</p>

<p>But you did not quote further. The Commission&#x2019;s recommendation No. 40 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notice should be taken of the provisions of the Group Areas Act &#x2026; and future licensing legislation should be brought into line with the policy embodied in the said Act.</block>

<p>The implementation of that policy was assigned to the Department of Community Development by the Community Development Act. After a group area is declared, the Community Development Act comes into operation. The hon. member&#x2019;s appeal to that commission&#x2019;s recommendation is, therefore, totally invalid. What was, in fact, an oversight is now being rectified by means of this legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. member dealt with the extension of powers and said that provincial authorities can decide on licences. However, provincial authorities do not have the power to decide in respect of control over group areas. That power rests in my department.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has difficulties with the penal provision in clause 3. He is of the opinion that all kinds of illogicalities and absurdities could result from it. However, these penal provisions have been taken over in an unaltered form from the penal provisions in respect of frozen areas, where such absurdities are not being found. What has been found, as I said in my Second Reading speech, is that they are more effective. That is why they were taken over.</p>

<p>As far as clause 2 is concerned, I do not have much more to add except to say that I do not know what the hon. member had in mind when he made a fuss about purchases made in Eloff Street or in Adderley Street. No one is prohibited from buying where they want to and from whom they want to.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlanga was very concerned about the hawkers. However, my department is not interested in hawkers unless they occupy or use land. The hon. member&#x2019;s interpretation, namely that if the hawker does business in the street, he is using land, is not something my department is interested in. My department will not re-settle such a hawker. My department is only involved when a person uses or occupies land in an affected area and is taken away from there, because if such a person is resettled in his own group area, my department is obliged to give him something of equal value. That is all that my department is interested in.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s difficulty as regards housewives has nothing whatever to do with the functions of my department.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>It is known that a comprehensive investigation of our criminal procedure and law of evidence by a commission of inquiry, the Botha Commission, was completed in 1971. The report of the commission and a Bill in which a new Criminal Procedure Act was recommended were published in December 1971. During the 1973 session of Parliament a Criminal Procedure Bill was introduced and taken as far as the Committee Stage, but lack of time prevented the discussion from proceeding beyond clause 55. The intention was to re-introduce the Bill during this session. However, because of the appointment of the commission of inquiry into the penal system of the Republic, the Viljoen Commission, the matter was reconsidered and it was decided to refrain from introducing the Bill for the time being. The terms of reference of the Viljoen Commission cover almost the entire penal sphere. Far-reaching changes in our penal system may therefore result from the recommendations of this commission, which may necessitate drastic amendments to legal provisions relating to punishment. In addition, changes in the approach to punishment often have an effect on criminal procedure. All this may mean that the Criminal Procedure Bill will have to be drastically changed. The Bill contains quite a number of innovations and their acceptance will mean that new procedures will have to be acquired by everyone who is concerned with a criminal court, in whatever capacity. It appears to be unwise to initiate this process in the knowledge that other drastic changes may be imminent. As soon as a new Criminal Procedure Act has been enacted, new text-books or revised editions of existing text-books on this Act will be published. The State and legal practitioners will be obliged to purchase such text-books. When the Act has been amended in terms of the recommendations of the Vijoen Commission, the text-books will probably have to be revised again and reprinted, and the new editions will have to be purchased. This will involve considerable unnecessary expense.</p>

<p>However, the Criminal Procedure Bill contains certain provisions which have become urgently necessary for reasons such as the manpower shortage in the South African Police and the Department of Justice, and with a view to the efficient implementation of traffic legislation. These provisions have been lifted from the Bill and included in the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill which is now before the House.</p>

<p>The proposed clause 1 contains an amendment to section 5(3A) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, which provides that when an Attorney-General is for some reason unable to perform his official duties, the State President may appoint any competent officer in the public service to act in his place. Unforeseen circumstances often make it necessary for Attorneys-General to take leave at short notice, sometimes for fairly short periods. I believe hon. members will agree that it is unnecessary to <span class="col_2033-2034" refersTo="page_1032"/>trouble the State President with acting appointments, particularly in the circumstances already mentioned. The amendment provides for acting appointments to be made by the Minister.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Clauses 2 and 3 of the amendment Bill replace the chapter in the Criminal Procedure Act relating to search warrants, the entering of premises and the seizure, forfeiture and disposal of property connected with offences. The procedure in the existing chapter creates a considerable number of problems, especially in the larger magistrates&#x2019; offices, in connection with the handling of articles which may afford evidence of the commission of offences. Many manhours are expended in the constant handling of these exhibits and considerable losses are sustained as a result of exhibits which are lost primarily because of the continual handling thereof.</p>

<p>In broad outline, most of the principles presently contained in sections 42 to 50, inclusive, and in section 360 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, are reflected, with the necessary adjustments, in clause 3. There are, however, also new provisions in the clause such as&#x2014;and for the sake of convenience I refer to them as sections&#x2014;sections 42; to a certain extent 43; 45(a) and (b)(i); 50(2); 50A(2); 50C(a) and (b): 50D(2); 50E; and 50F. The clause is self explanatory and I merely elucidate the various provisions in broad outline.</p>

<p>As the provisions of the Act read at present, articles which are seized with a view to their being produced as proof of the commission of offences, are brought before magistrates who must in the course of time make orders as to their disposal. From the time of seizure of an article until the final disposal thereof, it is handled by various persons. Those of us who are acquinted with court procedure know that exhibits go from the police official to the exhibits clerk at the magistrate&#x2019;s court, and from the exhibits clerk to the court orderly or other responsible official who must ensure that they are available before the commencement of the sitting of the court concerned. In the court the exhibits are also handled by various persons. In the afternoon when the court adjourns all the exhibits must be returned from hand to hand back to the exhibits room. In lengthy trials the procedure is repeated at every hearing of the particular case. With the rapid interchange of staff it is not always possible, when the control of exhibits passes from one official to another, to keep a constant check whether all exhibits are on hand.</p>

<p>Experience has shown, Mr. Speaker, and this has been confirmed in discussions with magistrates in the larger centres, that articles which are seized with a view to being tendered as proof in criminal cases do not necessarily always have real value as a means of proof. In fact it appears that neary 50% of the articles which are seized, do not have evidential value. This illustrates how much unnecessary time is spent on the handling of these articles.</p>

<p>I have already referred to certain provisions, but in particular I wish to direct attention to sections 50C, 50D and 50E in clause 3 which provide respectively for the disposal of perishable articles; of articles where no criminal proceedings are instituted but an admission-of-guilt fine is paid In all these instances it would be possible to dispose of articles without the necessity of removing them from police control. It is trusted that this procedure will eliminate most of the problems to which I have referred.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that by the application of clause 3, the provisions of which correspond in principle with chapter 2 of the Bill recommended by the Botha Commission, exhibits will be more efficiently controlled resulting in better utilization of staff; furthermore that the storage space in exhibit rooms, which more often than not are overcrowded, can be used more effectively and that the losses which are invariably experienced where large quantities of goods are handled, will diminish.</p>

<p>*In clause 4, Mr. Speaker, provisions have been embodied similar to those in clause 212(10) and (11) of the Criminal Procedure Bill. These provisions are the result of representations received from the National Road Safety Council. The Council believes that in order to combat loss of life in road accidents, the law must be much more strictly enforced than it is at the moment. Scientific development has provided instruments, apparatus and equipment which can be utilized to good effect. However, because of the requirements laid down in regard to evidence, many problems are experienced and many anomalies arise in the courts. In this way a speed reading by means of stop-watches is readily accepted, but the functioning of a highly developed apparatus, specially designed for <span class="col_2035-2036" refersTo="page_1033"/>this purpose, is questioned. Scientists consider speed measurement by means of stopwatches to be unreliable and believe that the only reliable way to measure speed is by means of apparatus specially developed for this purpose.</p>

<p>Consequently the object of the proposed subsection (5A) is that the Minister of Justice will be able, after consultation with scientists from bodies such as the S.A. Bureau of Standards and the CSIR, to prescribe the conditions and requirements to be complied with, before a reading by an instrument which has been designed, to measure speed or the alcohol content of a person&#x2019;s blood, for example, may be accepted as proof of the fact which it purports to prove. The conditions and requirements will have to be announced in the <i>Gazette,</i> which will ensure uniformity and will also satisfy the public that all traffic departments are subject to strict rules and cannot act arbitrarily. Upon proof that such conditions and requirements have been complied with, the accuracy of readings will have to be accepted by the courts unless the contrary is proved. As far as speed measurement is concerned, the provisions will also be of great value in implementing the fuel saving measures.</p>

<p>In the proposed subsection (5B), provision is made for a simplified method of proving that a syringe or receptacle to be used for analysing a person&#x2019;s blood for purposes of criminal proceedings is clean and properly sealed. With a similar end in view, all the provinces, with the exception of Natal, have already made provision for presumptions in their traffic ordinances. However, the proposed provisions are deemed necessary for the sake of uniformity and more efficient action. In this respect, too, the Minister will prescribe the conditions and requirements to be complied with.</p>

<p>Clause 5 contains the provisions of clause 37 of the Criminal Procedure Bill. In broad outline this clause corresponds to section 289 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, but it also contains new principles which have been included at the request of the National Road Safety Council. At the moment the law only allows the fingerprinting of persons who have been arrested. However, the proposed section 289(1) extends this power of police officers to other categories of accused. The purpose of this is to include certain offences on the part of drivers in a central register of licensed motor vehicle drivers. The proposed sub section (2) extends the power of certain medical practitioners to take blood tests of persons to any medical practitioner or nurse, provided that he or she is requested to do so by a police officer. However, in terms of subsection (2)(b) a medical practitioner who is attached to a hospital will be able to make such tests on his own initiative. The purpose of subsection (2) is to enable more people to make blood tests and also to facilitate the making of blood tests of drivers who have been injured and admitted to hospital.</p>

<p>Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 contain amendments to the Criminal Procedure Ordinance of the territory of South West Africa and are merely a repetition of clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5, with the necessary adjustments.</p>

<p>By the proposed clause 10 a provision corresponding to section 333ter of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, is being inserted into the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, 1963, of the territory of South West Africa. That section provides for the antedating of a sentence imposed after the original sentence has been set aside by a competent court.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has outlined the background to this Bill and has reminded the House of the Botha Commission which sat to inquire into the revision of the criminal procedure, as a matter of principle, relating to pretrial procedures and relating especially to pre-trial interrogations by magistrates. Sir, the Bill that was introduced here, as the hon. the Minister has mentioned, in 1973 as a result of the findings of that commission was opposed by this side of the House. I hope the Bill that will be introduced, probably, as the Minister says, after the Viljoen Commission has reported, will be in a different form from the one which we received two years ago and will have regard to the suggestions that were then made. I think the hon. the Minister has shown wisdom in postponing the introduction of the new consolidated and amended Criminal Procedure Bill until after the Viljoen Commission has in fact reported. I may say, just in passing, in respect of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s remarks about the province of Natal and its attitude towards the question of onus and the requisites of proof insofar as syringes are concerned when blood samples are taken, that it was the attitude of the province of Natal that it was not prepared to acknowledge <span class="col_2037-2038" refersTo="page_1034"/>that the onus should rest on the accused in this regard, in other words, that there should be a presumption that everything was properly and correctly done when blood was taken for the purpose of analysis in cases of drunken driving and driving with more than the specified maximum of alcohol in the blood, because a conviction for the statutory offence of driving with more than a certain content of alcohol in the blood carried with it a compulsory sentence, namely that one&#x2019;s licence had to be suspended. The provincial council in Natal conceded that this presumption that everything had been properly done by the district surgeon could in fact exist in respect of a syringe, provided that the court had a discretion in respect of the sentence for driving with more than the specified limit of alcohol in the blood. That, Sir, is the position in Natal today and in that regard Natal is, of course, unique and, of course, we are very grateful and very pleased that the discretion of the court is retained in cases where people are convicted of driving with more alcohol in the blood than is statutorily allowed where they are not under the influence of alcohol, and the Courts in Natal properly exercising their discretion.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to say this about this Bill. It falls, as the hon. the Minister has said, into three parts. First of all it deals with the question of search and seizure of articles in one clause or in some 16 sections of the new Act as it will be; it deals with the question of fingerprinting and it deals with the question of measuring instruments and syringes in respect of evidence in court. Sir, there is one other aspect which I am very pleased to see, and that is in South West Africa the existing provisions of our Code are being introduced, namely that if on appeal or review the court finds that the person who is appealing has already served part of his sentence of imprisonment, that may be taken into account when reviewing the sentence. The fact that that power was not transferred before was obviously an oversight.</p>

<p>Sir, before I say anything about the contents of this Bill, I would like to indicate that to place in one clause, i.e. clause 3 this Bill, what amounts to the replacement and the insertion of 16 new sections in the Criminal Procedure Act is not the way in which the law should be amended and it is not the way in which this House should have legislation presented to it. I want to say that these provisions, the 16 new sections of the Act&#x2014;there are in fact 17, but there are 16 substantive ones&#x2014;were all in the Criminal Procedure Bill introduced in 1973, and every one of them was obviously a separate clause because each was to be a new section of the Act. In debating matters of this kind in the Committee Stage, where one has to deal with matters of detail and some clauses are related to others, hon. members are entitled to speak only three times, normally three times each in respect of one clause. But now, in the way this is presented, it is three times each in respect of 16 clauses. Now, I think it is not good enough that the Bill should be introduced in this form. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister will reply that all these provisions in clause 3 came before the House in 1973 in almost exactly the same form, and indeed, Sir, from no one on this side of the House was any serious objection offered to these particular clauses. But this is a new Parliament and the House is differently constituted, although I do not anticipate that there will be any difference in so far as the attitude of this side of the House to these provisions is concerned.</p>

<p>Now, to deal with the many proposed new sections of the Act which are in clause 3, it is quite clear that they are the same, or slightly improved, versions of those clauses we dealt with in 1973. The safeguards are there. There are a few minor amendments which we shall deal with in the Committee Stage. We believe, for example, that the circumstances under which articles may be seized without search warrants should be restricted to the more serious offences such as those mentioned in the First Schedule of the Code. Further, we believe, and with great authority, if I may say so, inasmuch as the Supreme Court has often said that this should be the position, that a search warrant should not only authorize the policeman to search any person identified in the warrant, identify the premises and identify the persons, but it should also identify the crime or the offence in respect of which the search is to be made. That, I think, is fair and I think the reasons for it are obvious, but that is a matter of detail with which we can deal in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>In so far as fingerprinting is concerned, the provisions of the Bill in this regard are practically identical with the existing law. Protection is still there that the fingerprints all have to be destroyed if the person concerned is found not guilty and is discharged, <span class="col_2039-2040" refersTo="page_1035"/>or if the prosecution is not proceeded with, against him. That is a matter which the public is pleased about for reasons which very often escape me, because one wonders why everybody in the country should not be fingerprinted. But there is a feeling that this is undesirable and in the result I suppose it springs from a feeling that you are being tainted with crime when you are innocent. But be that as it may, public opinion and public feeling in this regard certainly require that these provisions be maintained.</p>

<p>Now, the last aspect of the Bill is the question of the measuring instruments and syringes. The measuring instruments which come to mind immediately, and which the hon. the Minister has indicated, are those with which this Bill is concerned, those instruments known as gatsometers and velometers and all sorts of things for measuring the speed of motor-cars on public roads. The hon. the Minister has made the case that it saves a lot of time if one can produce an affidavit to say that certain requirements have been met. Well, I quite agree that this position he sets out is desirable. The question, however, is: What conditions is he going to lay down? The Minister has to prescribe the conditions and requirements for such a machine. If you prove that those requirements and conditions are being complied with, by affidavit before the court, then that is to be accepted as proving the fact recorded by that machine, in other words, your speed, unless the contrary is proved.</p>

<p>When it comes to syringes, the Bill provides also that certain conditions should be laid down. If you produce an affidavit to the effect that those conditions were observed, then again the affidavit is sufficient proof that the syringe was in the condition prescribed. The big difference, however, between the two is that when we come to syringes it is provided that the affidavit must say that immediately before the syringe was used, it was in the condition prescribed. There is no such provision, however, in relation to the measuring device, the gatsometer, or whatever instrument is used for measuring the speed of a motor car. I think this is a defect in the Bill as its stands, and we shall seek to amend this clause at the Committee Stage. It seems to us that proof that an instrument complies with the requirements laid down by the Minister is not proof that at the time of the measurement, the time of the trap, the instrument did in fact comply with those requirements. There is indeed much evidence in the law reports to support the view that merely to say that it at one time complied with the requirements of, say, the S.A. Bureau of Standards, is certainly no evidence that at the time of the alleged offence it so complied.</p>

<p>The other aspect we shall deal with in the Committee Stage relates to all the other parts of the existing section 239, where all sorts of things are dealt with. For instance, affidavits can be produced to show that a consignment note on the S.A. Railways was correct, to show that certain medical facts are correct, to show all sorts of things. Throughout all of this there is a pattern. The one golden thread that runs through all these various presumptions and this proof by affidavit is that it is to be subject to subsection (6), which provides that the court may, in its discretion, call to give evidence the person who made the affidavit. We shall seek in the Committee Stage to amend the provisions which are here being inserted into section 239, to provide also that the court should have the right to call upon that person to give <i>viva voce</i> evidence. I think the reason for this being in the law already is obvious. It is obvious in respect of all the other matters in respect of which there are presumptions. But, <i>a fortiori,</i> it should apply in cases such as this, because if one goes through a speed trap today, one starts with a minimum of R50 if one is one kilometer over whatever limit is allowed above 80 km per hour. Then the fine increases by R5 per kilometer thereafter. I think the hon. the Minister will concede that the court ought to have the discretion in this case, if it has the discretion to call the person concerned in other cases.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these are all matters of detail which we shall deal with in the Committee Stage. I mention them here to give the hon. the Minister notice of our intention to do so. We find ourselves then in the position that the majority of the clauses in this Bill we in fact approved of two years ago. They do not change the law that much. They in fact improve the statement of the law. We shall therefore support this Bill at Second Reading, and hope to have a fruitful discussion in the Committee Stage on the matters I have mentioned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vlok">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have heard from the hon. member <span class="col_2041-2042" refersTo="page_1036"/>who has just resumed his seat that the official Opposition supports this Bill in principle. Having said that the Bill has their support, the hon. member then complained about the fact that a great many sections are being grouped together in clause 3. His main objection was that these will constitute approximately 16 or 17 sections in the new Act and that hon. members of the Opposition will supposedly not have sufficient opportunity to discuss these in the Committee Stage. However, it seems to me that an hon. member, who is allowed to make three ten minute speeches to raise objections or put his case as far as each clause is concerned, is really being afforded enough of an opportunity of making what he has to say quite clear.</p>

<p>As has been explained by the hon. the Minister, the Bill contains a great many important provisions. I think these provisions deserve the support of each one of us. We would do well to have a closer look at some of these provisions. Clause 3 amends, among others, section 50(2) in terms of which powers are granted to the Police, in cases where the Police have to confiscate articles which they suspect are present on any premises or in a room of a binding in order to prove an offence, to open the door and enter without first having to announce their presence audibly. This is a measure which has become absolutely necessary in our present circumstances. One does not give drug pedlars and people in gambling houses a chance by having the Police knock on the door first and announce their presence. Neither do these people simply hand over to the Police the pills, the powders and other articles they have been peddling with. Quick action must be taken and these people must be caught red-handed, otherwise it will be impossible to prove the case in court. A similar measure has been in existence in America for a long time, and I believe that we shall be strengthening the hands of our Police considerably by introducing this measure in South Africa as well.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister gave a detailed explanation of the proposed sections 50C, 50D, 50E and 50F, and so on. These sections deal with an amended procedure with regard to the handling of exhibits. Those of us who have had experience of the handling of exhibits, will know that these really pose a major and extensive problem in magistrates&#x2019; courts. The procedure is being tightened up by means of the proposed amendments and it will be far easier to handle exhibits in an efficient way. In future the Police are going to handle exhibits themselves until such time that these exhibits have to be used in the court. The advantages this will have are obvious, and I quote only a few of them. The handling of the exhibits will be reduced and storage space will be saved. In the past the Police had to retain these exhibits in safekeeping and from them it had to go to the court, where it had remained in safekeeping as well. This duplication will be eliminated to a large extent in future. This amendment therefore entails major advantages for all the people concerned with the matter.</p>

<p>Clause 4 amends section 239 which, as was quite rightly pointed out by the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Durban North, sets out the requirements and conditions measuring instruments which are used in criminal cases have to comply with. In terms of the present position numerous instruments and types of instruments are being used by local authorities in order to prove their case in our courts. At present no requirements exist with which such instruments have to comply. This places the public in an unfavourable position, because a person who is caught in a speed trap does not know whether the instrument was set correctly. He does not know whether the instalment was reliable. He does not know which requirements the instrument has to comply with either. In terms of the present position he has to call in experts to be able to question the reliability of the instrument. However, the State is in an unfavourable position too, because neither do any requirements exist with which the instruments have to comply as far as the State is concerned. The State therefore does not know when an instrument can be regarded as being reliable. In actual fact, nobody knows and consequently there is considerable confusion on the part of both the State and the public in regard to this matter. On account of this confusion considerable legal uncertainty prevails, and in practice we find that people are found guilty and are acquitted on mere technical points. The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that one can with justification say that the application of measures pertaining to the speed limit have become a farce. I do not think we can allow this state of affairs to continue.</p>

<p><span class="col_2043-2044" refersTo="page_1037"/>The advantages of the legislation are obvious. It would bring about certainty in the minds of the public, who will now know precisely with which requirements these instruments have to comply. As a matter of fact, it protects the public because a local authority which uses an instrument which does not comply with the requirements laid down in terms of the legislation, will still have to make use of the old procedural evidence&#x2014;the procedure which is applicable at present. Such a local authority will therefore not have the privilege of making use of the new, easier procedure. I admit and I concede at once that it will facilitate the task of the State in court of proving that an offence has been committed. Surely this is the right thing to do and we can find no fault with that. The carnage on our roads can in many cases be attributed to high speed and people who drive recklessly and we simply cannot allow this to continue.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also referred to the fuel conservation measures which, for this same reason, are equally difficult to enforce effectively. After all we cannot allow this state of affairs to continue with out people who violate the measures being brought to book or, if they are, in fact, brought to book, being acquitted on technical grounds. I do not think we can allow this state of affairs to continue. We in this House have a duty to protect the general public in this regard, and we have to fulfil this duty. At the same time, it is also our duty to uphold the authority of the State. A person who has transgressed or has committed an offence, has to be punished. All we have to do is to satisfy ourselves that people caught in these speed traps, for example, do not suffer an injustice. I am convinced that, in view of these requirements and requirements which are going to be laid down, we are definitely not going to act unjustly towards anyone caught in these speed traps.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with section 289 of the principal Act, which is being amended by clause 5. This section deals for the most part with fingerprints and blood tests and, as has been indicated by the hon. the Minister, does not contain many new provisions. One of these provisions, however, justifies further attention, i.e. the question of blood tests which may be made by a medical practitioner at a hospital if and when a person is admitted and the medical practitioner has reason to believe that these may be relevant to subsequent criminal proceedings. At present a medical practitioner is unable to do so at the hospital. He has to receive instructions from either the court or a policeman first. This is unfair as far as the State and also the public are concerned, because this may lead to important evidence being lost, evidence which might otherwise have proved that the person is guilty but, at the same time, might have proved that the person is not guilty in-particular cases.</p>

<p>As far as fingerprints are concerned, I agree with the hon. member for Durban Point that it is important that we should emphasize that there need not be any fear on the part of the public that fingerprints would be kept after they had been taken and the person concerned is found not guilty, or the case against the person is withdrawn. Subsection (5) contains a provision to the effect that the fingerprints should be destroyed in that case.</p>

<p>I could continue in this vein, but at this stage I shall leave the matter at that, and I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the positive legislation he is introducing in connection with these matters. The registration is of a positive nature and essential under the circumstances prevailing in South Africa at present, both from the viewpoint of the State, as I have indicated, as well as from the viewpoint of the public. I have great pleasure in supporting it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. Minister will know that when his predecessor introduced the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill in 1973, I moved that the Bill be read this day six months. Therefore I am very glad to see that the Bill which the hon. the Minister is introducing today, is a very different cup of tea. We on these benches have no objection to the Second Reading of this Bill. It does not affect the major principles of our Criminal Procedure, unlike the original Bill which was subjected to considerable criticism both from the Bar and the Side-bar in South Africa. I am no lawyer, as is well known, and because this is a lawyer&#x2019;s Bill, I am simply going to say that we do not wish to oppose the Second Reading. I have several amendments, however, which on legal advice I shall be moving at the Committee Stage. I have already submitted them to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department for their consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North has created one impression in his speech which we should quite clearly reject, if it is possible for one to make such a deduction from what he has said. I do not think it was his intention to do so, but he nevertheless created the impression that the provisions in the Bill relating to measuring instruments and the determination of the alcohol content in the blood would be&#x2014;to use his own words&#x2014; sufficient proof if the provisions of the Bill are complied with. A thorough analysis of the clause concerned indicates that it is for the most part a question of <i>prima facie</i> evidence. <i>Prima facie</i> evidence is a totally different concept to sufficient proof. Scoble, the well-known authority, has the following to say about <i>prima facie</i> evidence in his <i>Law of Evidence&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the evidence adduced is in the absence of any rebutting evidence sufficient to prove a given fact.</block>

<p>As against this, &#x201C;conclusive evidence&#x201D;, which may be compared with the concept of &#x201C;sufficient proof&#x201D; used by the hon. member for Durban North, is, according to Scoble&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; evidence of a fact which the court must take as as full proof of such fact and excludes all other evidence to disprove it.</block>

<p>What I therefore want to do is to eliminate the impression created by this speech completely and point out quite specifically that the affidavit which may be submitted, is solely <i>prima facie</i> evidence and all the accused has to do in such a case is to give evidence. If the witness proves to be a reliable witness, it would be the end of the case and reasonable measure of doubt would exist.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>And then you cross-examine the machine?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_klerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>On the one hand it is a fact that it would be impossible to cross-examine the machine, but it is a fact that it would be impossible for the presiding officer in such a case, after he has heard the evidence of the accused and the accused has created a good impression in his evidence, to accept an affidavit in preference to the evidence of the accused and would have to give him the benefit of the doubt. I want to refer the hon. member to the appeal case of <i>Ainsbury</i> v. <i>Ainsbury</i> of the year 1929. On page 119 of the report the following was said by the hon. Judge&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but there is no onus of proof cast upon the accused to completely satisfy the jury that this explanation is truthful. If it is doubtful, whether it is true or false, the accused must be acquitted as was decided in the case of <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Du Plessis</i> in 1924, T.P.D.</block>

<p>Therefore, there is no question about this. As soon as a prosecutor has taken cognizance of this fact during the cross-examination, the State should lead evidence to the effect that an offence has been committed. An instrument for the measuring of speed is usually handled by a traffic constable. Therefore, the traffic constable has to be called. He would then give evidence with regard to the alleged speeding offence. He would be cross-examined by the accused who would question, during his cross-examination, the manner in which the machine was set up. From this it might appear that the accused is not happy about the manner in which the machine was used and that he believes that the conditions the hon. the Minister is going to prescribe in terms of this provision, have not been complied with. Any sensible prosecutor would immediately put away his affidavit in his drawer and call for oral evidence because he would know that his evidence was being questioned. Therefore, it presents no problems to me in practice, and I think this is something we should state quite clearly here.</p>

<p>This is procedural law and as such it has to comply with the requirements of procedural law. On this occasion I should like to refer to the debate conducted on this matter in 1973. On that occasion we were desperately looking for a test for sound procedural law. In this process reference was made to a very learned author, Dr. G. B. Paton, who wrote <i>A textbook of Jurisprudence.</i> Dr. Paton is a well-known <span class="col_2047-2048" refersTo="page_1039"/>legal philosopher and legal practitioner, a person who was awarded two honorary doctor&#x2019;s degrees. Dr. Paton prescribed the following test as:</p>

<block name="quote">A functional test to which all procedural rules should be subjected, is the practical efficiency in providing machinery for the prompt and reasonably cheap settlement of disputes on lines that do justice to both parties.</block>

<p>Therefore, this is a threefold test, i.e. in the first place, that the procedural rules should ensure the speedy settlement of the case; in the second place, that it should be done at a reasonable cost and, in the third place, that it should be based on a basis which ensures justice. I am satisfied that this Bill will pass this test with flying colours on all three points. I believe that the application of this Bill will ensure justice, the elimination of unnecessary delays in respect of the matters covered by it and, through the elimination of delays, also ensure a saving in costs. The other provisions simply serve to streamline the existing provisions and the objection raised by the hon. member to the effect that all these provisions are grouped together in one clause and that he is allowed to speak on them only three times, was merely lodged for the purpose of playing for time. Since there are no real drastic differences between the existing measures and this Bill, and since this has been argued repeatedly in the discussion on a previous Bill which never became law. I really think it would not be necessary to divide this into separate clauses and that, as I have said, the hon. member only used this argument to play for time.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to say that I believe that, with this Bill, we succeed in promoting the efficiency of the Police and, in doing so, also the efficiency of the protection enjoyed by the public, and, in the second place, to alleviate the administrative pressure on our courts and on everyone concerned with this matter as far as exhibits are concerned. Consequently there would be a saving in costs. I therefore feel myself quite at liberty to support this Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>If I may interpose for a moment in the argument between the hon. member for Vereeniging and the hon. member for Durban North, I want to say that I listened carefully to the arguments put forward by both hon. members and that I think that judgment with costs should in this case be granted to the hon. member for Vereeniging, because I think that he was quite clearly correct in interpreting the law. However, this is merely a small point. We welcome the provisions of this Bill which give greater amplification and clarity to the powers and duties of policemen in regard to search, seizure and forfeiture of property. I do not wish to cover any of the points which the hon. member for Durban North covered so very well, but I would like to mention a trend which I see in this Bill, one which, I think, we see in a lot of legislation, and that is that in many cases where amending Bills come before us, one finds the wording of the relevant Act is being changed, although only very slightly. As far as these slight changes are concerned, our experience from time to time has been that the new wording always seems to favour the State rather than the individual. One finds these little changes creeping in. If one does not look carefully for them, one sometimes doesn&#x2019;t even notice them. For instance, if one looks at the proposed new section 50(1) and compares it with the old section 44(4), which it replaces, one sees that under the old section a policeman could force his way into premises&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; provided that no policeman shall act under this subsection unless he has previously failed to obtain admission after having audibly demanded the same and notified the purpose for which he seeks to enter such premises.</block>

<p>In the new provision it reads just slightly differently. It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that such policeman shall firstly audibly demand admission to the premises and notify the purpose for which he seeks to enter such premises.</block>

<p>However, it does not say anything about previously having failed to get in. I suppose this is just to make life a little easier for the Policeman and ensures that his actions are correct. However, I think that in changing wording like this, there is the tendency to favour the State at the expense of the individual.</p>

<p><span class="col_2049-2050" refersTo="page_1040"/>There is another example of this in the Bill. We welcome the safeguards that have been inserted in the Bill relating to the seizure of property and the investigation of certain matters relating to the safety of the State. There are these safeguards and judicial officers who abuse them will in fact be dealt with under the safeguards contained in this Bill. However, over the years that Bills have come before this Parliament&#x2014; certainly during the very short period that I have been a member of this House&#x2014; fines have always been increased two, three, four and five times. The situation is that where a fine of one hundred pounds or fifty pounds was imposed in a law about 10 or 15 years ago, the Minister will now stand up and say that circumstances are different today, that the value of money has been eroded and that now the fine should be doubled or trebled or whatever the case may be, that it should be considerably higher in view of the length of time that has elapsed. However, in regard to the penalties provided for in this Bill, which penalties relate largely to actions by judicial officers and employees of the State, where the fines were one hundred pounds in 1955, they are R200 in 1975. All of a sudden in regard to matters which affect the State the fines are not altered whereas in regard to matters where individuals may do wrong, the fines are doubled and trebled. [Interjections]. I think that if we look at the one proposed new section that I am referring to particularly,&#x2014;I think it is section 50A&#x2014;we will find that we are back to the old R200.</p>

<p>I should also like to mention another small point. In trying to cast the net wider as far as persons to whom finger-printing will apply, are concerned, I think that the wording in this regard tends to overlap. For instance, on page 20 of the Bill&#x2014; this is something with which we will deal with in more detail at the Committee Stage &#x2014;we find that the proposed new section 289 now brings in any person arrested upon a charge and any person released on bail. I do think that when one wishes to widen the net in this regard the wording of the various provisions tends to overlap considerably.</p>

<p>We support this Bill and will deal with some of the minor matters which I have mentioned during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I referred to the various persons. Apparently the hon. member from Houghton does not regard herself as a person. [Interjections.] I shall include the lady and I say so with gratitude towards the hon. lady from Houghton. I thank her for her support of the Second Reading. I told her one or two evenings ago that it was the first time I agreed with her, and I believe this is the first time the hon. member agreed with me.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to two aspects raised by the hon. member for Durban North. The first question he asked me was why all the proposed sections were grouped together in clause 3. He said it would limit the discussion. I want to tell the hon. member that this was not done deliberately. We accepted that the majority of these old sections would be taken over virtually as they stand. These are old principles which have been in existence in our law for a long time. During my Second Reading speech I pointed out a few minor differences and I did not think, in all honesty, that these few minor differences would evoke so much discussion that it justified separate clauses.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member indicated that he would seek an amendment to clause 4 and that he would request in his amendment that a magistrate be allowed to call for <i>viva voce</i> evidence, if I understood his argument correctly. Sir, I do not want to start shooting down the amendment of the hon. member for Durban North at this stage already, but since he has indicated that he is going to move an amendment, I may as well indicate what my argument is going to be. The hon. member will notice that this is an amendment to section 239 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 239 deals with the proof of certain facts by affidavit. There were five types of affidavit that this section dealt with, so it was quite proper, when we came to affidavits with <span class="col_2051-2052" refersTo="page_1041"/>regard to syringes and that type of thing, to add subsection (5A). This subsection was inserted as (5A) because there is a subsection 6, which of course is still in the Act and is still part of the whole procedure. Subsection 6 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The court in which any such affidavit &#x2026;</block>

<p>And that applies to all the affidavits referred to in subsections (1) to (5) and (5A) &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in my respectful view, what the hon. member has indicated that he will seek by way of amendment is already in the Act and will apply to this particular Bill in any case when it becomes law.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>For the very simple reason that it gives a magistrate the right to ask for <i>viva voce</i> evidence; subsection (5A) is therefore added there; it also applies to (5A).

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In recent years there has been an increasing direct interest on the part of Governments in various countries in the whole concept of consumer protection. This interest has been stimulated in general by the idea that the State is to accept responsibility to a certain extent for the protection of the consumer against forms of action by private enterprise which expose him to unjustified methods of exploitation and other sorts of personal prejudicing. This particular approach is stimulated further by the fact that in times of inflation and price increases, the general impression exists in the private sector that the State is actually responsible for taking steps to combat inflation and price increases; because the allegation is also made in general that the State has at its disposal the instruments of policy for combating this evil, it is important that we realize in our own country, too, that there is a general expectation among consumers themselves that the State, too, has a responsibility to shoulder in respect of the exploitation of the public in various forms and by means of various practices. Apart from what the responsibility of the State might be in this specific connection, it is also a fact that in the business community itself the idea has taken root that industrialists and businessmen must make attempts on their own initiative to prevent undesirable practices which prejudice the consumer in an unjust way; in other words that the private sector, too, ought to establish a particular code of conduct in terms of its actions also as far as marketing is concerned. For example, various trade organizations in foreign countries drafted so-called codes of conduct which they may <span class="col_2053-2054" refersTo="page_1042"/>enforce on their members and which are enforceable in terms of their own rules.</p>

<p>Here in South Africa the idea of State protection for the consumer against unjustified trade practices which may prejudice him, has already found expression in certain legislation such as the Price Control Act, the Weights and Measures Act, the Sale of Land on Instalments Act, the Merchandise Marks Act and the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act. At the same time the Government gave financial support to the establishment of the South African Co-ordinating Consumers Board, as a representative body whose aim is to protect the interests of the consumer, and the Government is still giving financial support and assistance to that body. At the same time certain trade organizations proceeded to drafting their own codes of conduct and propagating the application thereof among their members in an attempt to curb certain sorts of malpractices, especially in the distributive trade.</p>

<p>All these steps, I believe, have in fact contributed to the protection of the consumer against possible exploitation or malpractices. But none the less this Government and my department receive a continuous stream of complaints from consumers throughout the country about allegedly or reputedly undesirable practices in the distributive trade against which they want protection from the State.</p>

<p>Although in some other countries there are Government departments which are exclusively organized, from the point of view of consumer protection, for identifying practices and investigating complaints from the public about these practices in order to recommend possible action against these to their respective Governments, we in South Africa do not have at our disposal any exclusive Government machinery of this nature. Up to now the Department of Commerce remains the only Government body which has entered the field of the protection of the consumer, and consequently the legislation which the Government has already passed, and to which I have referred, in an attempt to protect the consumer against undesirable practices, is chiefly administrated by the Department of Commerce.</p>

<p>However, the Government felt, and I believe that hon. members in general will agree with me, that the time has arrived for the existing legislation to be supplemented and for special machinery to be established under the wing of the Department of Commerce in order to identify reputedly undesirable trade practices which do not fall within the scope of the existing legislation as yet, and to recommend action against these to the Government.</p>

<p>The sort of alleged malpractices in respect of which the department continually receives complaints from the public and against which it has now been found necessary to make Government action operative for the protection of the consumer, are, <i>inter alia,</i> the following:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) <i>Advertisements</i></li>

</ol>

<p>In the first place I refer to an issue which has already been a subject of discussion in this House, viz. advertisements which appear in catalogues and pamphlets and in respect of which the complainants allege that the descriptions of goods which are offered for sale, are exaggerated. It is also alleged that the claims in respect of the description of goods go much further than what may be regarded as a normal extolling of merchandise. Even when such a transaction can be set aside on grounds of fraud in our civil courts, the amount which the buyer can recover from the seller in terms of his civil remedy, is so small that the cost of the action exceeds by far the amount which can be recovered.</p>

<p>Posters and labels which are used by dealers contain, according to complaints which have been received, descriptions by means of which the dealers try to bring prospective buyers under the impression that the price at which a specific item is offered for sale, is in fact much lower than the price for which the buyer can eventually buy the item.</p>

<p>Often a dealer advertises that he is going to sell a specific item at a very cheap price. Complaints are then submitted to the department that the dealers concerned in fact had no such item in stock and that the advertisement was nothing but a trick to attract prospective buyers to their shops so that they may be offered for sale other items in which such buyers were not all interested. In this connection I may just mention that an hon. member showed me an advertisement last week in which a firm of property agents advertised that they acted as the sole agents for the sale and the lease of State-owned property. When I asked him to check this, the reaction was that there was no property available at that moment. The fact is that the firm who <span class="col_2055-2056" refersTo="page_1043"/>placed the advertisement had no mandate whatsoever from any Government department to offer land for sale or for lease. The obvious motive for the placing of such an advertisement was to bring interested people into contact with the firm in the first place in order that they could then offer them other property for sale.</p>

<p>Various complaints have been submitted about the invoices or so-called invoices mailed to people demanding an amount of money from the addressee. At the first glance the impression is created that the addressee already owes the amount concerned, but when these so-called invoices are scrutinized it appears that the amount supposedly owed concerns some asset which is offered for sale to the addressee.</p>

<p>A further complaint which has been lodged with the Department of Commerce is that dealers mislead prospective buyers in connection with the conditions on which credit may be obtained from them. It is alleged that dealers bring prospective buyers under the impression that they may buy certain goods without a deposit although deposits are in fact required in terms of existing legislation.</p>

<p>(ii) <i>Undesirable trade practices</i></p>

<p>Let me say at once that when I refer to these complaints, I do not want to generalize at all It is purely in order to give you examples of which practices we believe must be combatted. I believe that all hon. members would like to have them combatted. Nor do I want to intimate that the examples are representative of our total trade and of the private sector.</p>

<p>Foreign organizations have introduced a system of distribution into the Republic in terms of which people are recruited and given the right to recruit further agents for such an organization. For the right to recruit such agents, the persons concerned must pay an amount of money to the foreign organization. Although the organizations give out that they want to distribute a specific product on the local market, they are more interested in receiving the remuneration which is paid for the agencies. When the so-called agents discover that there is no demand for the products of the organization, they are normally unable to demand their agency fees back and, although the organizations give out that they will supply the products to the agents, the latter are hesitant to take delivery of the products because they can do nothing with them on the market.</p>

<p>There are dealers who make a business of mailing goods to consumers with the request that if they do not want to buy the goods within a specified period, they are to return the goods to the sender. Such dealers rely on the consumers concerned not returning the goods within the specified period. The amount demanded for the goods is usually excessive in such cases.</p>

<p>Some dealers employ the practice in terms of which their clients receive a discount on their purchases if they succeed in obtaining orders for the dealers from other buyers. To qualify for the offered discount, clients must obtain a specific number of orders. For example, if they have to obtain five orders to qualify for the discount, the total number of orders which must be obtained, increases so rapidly that it becomes impossible for the last clients to obtain that number of orders.</p>

<p>I want to say that the ingenuity of certain people in this particular connection is apparently unlimited in making use of such methods.</p>

<p>A final complaint which has been received and to which I want to refer as an example, is that door to door salesmen visit consumers at their homes and harass them to buy goods of a dubious nature, or goods which they can afford, at excessive prices on instalments. Let me say at once that the people who are caught by these advertising or sales methods in the first place, are the lower income groups who need the largest measure of protection. Although we can differ from one another about the methods which we can employ to cope with these specific practices, I do not believe that we can differ from one another about the principle, viz. that we owe it to the consumer public to take steps against these practices.</p>

<p>In order to make it possible for the Government to act against practices of this kind, it is desirable that it has the necessary legal powers at its disposal, and the Bill now before this House, is the result of protracted negotiations conducted with interested organizations in an attempt to formulate a Bill which will afford the consumer public the necessary protection without, however, putting unnecessary burdens on the private sector; in other words, the distributive trade in particular. In this specific connection, I believe, you will allow me to tell you that I had the opportunity <span class="col_2057-2058" refersTo="page_1044"/>to speak to a representative who has particular knowledge of this specific subject. He is on the staff of the American department in charge of these matters and he made the general statement to me that the legislation which we are considering at the moment is, in general terms, of the best in the world.</p>

<p>I now want to deal briefly with the most important principles of the proposed legislation.</p>

<p>Clause 1 contains a number of definitions which seek to define certain terms which, occur in the proposed legislation.</p>

<p>Because advertisements play such an important role in commerce, the word &#x201C;advertisement&#x201D; is defined as widely as possible to cover all means of advertising which are used by businesses to attract clients.</p>

<p>The definitions of the concepts &#x201C;benefit&#x201D; and &#x201C;trade coupon&#x201D; correspond with the definitions which are given to these concepts by the existing Trade Coupons Act, 1935. The reason for this is that the existing provisions of the Trade Coupons Act, 1935, are included in the proposed legislation with certain adjustments, to which I shall refer later.</p>

<p>Although virtually all the remaining definitions are self-explanatory. I just want to mention that the concept &#x201C;trade practice&#x201D; is defined in such, a way that a monopolistic condition, as referred to in section 2(1) of the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955, is not included in the concept under discussion. Since investigations into monopolistic conditions are undertaken by the Board of Trade and Industries on the instructions of the Minister concerned, and steps in connection with such conditions, which are not justified in the public interest, are taken by the Minister on the recommendation of the board, measures in respect of such conditions cannot be taken appropriately in terms of the proposed legislation now under consideration. Therefore it has also been considered advisable to put the position in this regard beyond any doubt.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I must also point out that the usual meaning of the word &#x201C;sell&#x201D; will be extended by the proposed legislation. At this stage I want to thank the hon. member for Constantia for informing me that he has problems with this specific provision, since, as he maintains, it extends the Trade Coupons Act as a result of an extended definition of the word &#x201C;sell&#x201D;. This extension is necessary because it is considered desirable that, for the purposes of the proposed legislation, the concept &#x201C;goods&#x201D; will include incorporeal things such as rights, because the application of the proposed legislation would be made considerably more difficult if action in terms thereof were limited only to actual selling and buying transactions.</p>

<p>Clause 2 of the Bill makes provision for the establishment by the Minister of a Trade Practices Advisory Committee, consisting of not fewer than seven and not more than 13 members. One of the members is designated chairman and one vice chairman by the Minister. In terms of clause 2(2) the members of the committee are to be appointed by the Minister on grounds of their particular knowledge and experience in certain fields. Since no decision in connection with the appointment of the members of the committee has been taken as yet, I want to make use of this opportunity to assure the interested parties and interested bodies concerned, that they will be approached in due course to submit nominees to me from whom the members will be selected. I want to give the assurance that I intend appointing a committee as broadly representative as possible in which all the sectors will enjoy representation. The composition of the committee will be such that it will be able to advise the Minister on advertising, commerce, industry and consumer affairs.</p>

<p>The Trade Practices Advisory Committee will fulfil a cardinal function in the application of the proposed legislation because, as I shall indicate later, it will not be possible to take formal steps in connection with certain trade practices in terms of the legislation before a recommendation relating to such steps has been obtained from the committee. The procedure which will be followed at meetings of the committee, as well as the allowances and costs which will be paid to members of the committee in connection with the activities of the committee, are regulated by clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill, respectively.</p>

<p>The provisions of clause 5 up to and including clause 8 of the Bill deal chiefly with the functions and powers which the Department of Commerce will fulfil and exercise in connection with the application of the proposed legislation in practice. In clause 5 of the Bill it is provided that the Secretary for Commerce may delegate certain of his powers in terms of the proposed legislation to other officers of his department and that <span class="col_2059-2060" refersTo="page_1045"/>he may designate officers as inspectors for the purposes of the legislation. Although information is normally made available voluntarily by businesses to the Department of Commerce, there are cases nevertheless of people being unwilling to furnish, certain information to the department at its request. Consequently it has been deemed advisable to provide in clause 6 of the Bill that the Secretary for Commerce may by notice in writing request the necessary information if it has not been furnished voluntarily.</p>

<p>The powers of inspectors are prescribed by clause 7 of the Bill. Clause 8 prohibits the disclosure of information which a person obtained in the performance of his duties or functions in terms of the proposed legislation, in any way except in the prescribed circumstances.</p>

<p>An important principle which has been included in the proposed legislation is the provision that no consumer may be misled in respect of the nature, properties or advantages of goods or services, nor in respect of the manner in which conditions on which or prices at which such goods or services may be obtained. Therefore clause 9 of the Bill contains a prohibition on advertisements, statements, communications, descriptions and indications in connection with the sale of goods and the provision of services, which are false or misleading in a material respect.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that the provisions of the existing Trade Coupons Act of 1935 will be included with certain adjustments in the proposed legislation. Consequently clauses 10 to 12 inclusive, contain the relative provisions in this regard. The existing Trade Coupons Act is only applicable to the supply or giving of benefits and trade coupons in connection with the sale of goods. The proposed legislation will also be applicable to the supply or giving of benefits or trade coupons in connection with the provision of services. Furthermore, I want to point out that there is uncertainty about the question as to whether a manufacturer or dealer may have trade coupons printed to be supplied or issued in connection with the sale of goods. This uncertainty is removed by the provisions of clause 11(d) of the Bill in which it is provided that the supply to, or the acquisition of trade coupons by someone engaged in the sale of goods or the provision of services, is not illegal, provided the supply or giving of such coupons is in agreement with the provisions of the proposed legislation.</p>

<p>The principle relating to the prohibition on the misleading of consumers, to which I have already referred, is dealt with further in clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill. In terms of clause 13 it will be an offence for a person to mislead a consumer in respect of the price which he in fact has to pay for goods or for the utilization of services.</p>

<p>I should like to add that it has come to my attention that the Advertising Standards Authority, under the chairmanship of a former Chief Justice of the Republic, is already doing fruitful work in the field of advertising. However, the Authority unfortunately does not have control over all advertising media. Clause 14 of the Bill now gives the Minister the necessary powers to be able to take the necessary steps in those cases where effective action cannot be taken at the moment against false or misleading advertisements.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned as well that the Trade Practices Advisory Committee will fulfil an important function in the application of the proposed legislation. Although clauses 14 and 15 give the Minister wide powers to act against false or misleading advertisements or undesirable trade practices, clause 16 requires that the Minister may only take the measures concerned in pursuance of the recommendations which the committee has submitted to him. The proposed legislation also provides that any recommendation of the committee to the Minister in respect of any measure which the Minister is to put into operation in terms of the legislation, be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> for general information before the Minister applies the measure.</p>

<p>The procedure which has to be adopted before the Minister can take any steps in terms of the proposed legislation, will, in all probability, take a great deal of time. On the other hand it is very easy for a resourceful person&#x2014;and I believe that I have already proved that there is no lack of resourceful people in this specific connection &#x2014;to make a considerable amount of money from ignorant consumers in a relatively short time in a manner, if I might put it favourably, which is irregular.</p>

<p>That is right. For this reason the Secretary for Commerce will, on the recommendation of the Trade Practices Advisory Committee, be empowered in terms of section 17 of the Bill to place a temporary prohibition, for a period not exceeding six months, on such irregular and undesirable practices.</p>

<p>Furthermore clauses 18 to 25 of the Bill include provisions in connection with a number of miscellaneous matters to which I only want to refer briefly. Clause 18 states clearly that no one shall be convicted of any offence under this Act if he proves that the Act or omission is due to a reasonable mistake by him in respect of the relevant facts. Clause 19 of the Bill contains a penal provision and prescribes the maximum penalties for contraventions of the proposed legislation. In terms of clause 20 the period in which prosecutions for offences in terms of the proposed legislation may be instituted, is limited to two years after the date of the alleged offence. In other words, the term of prescription is being shortened. It happens fairly often that people sign documents in respect of the purchase of goods or the acquisition of services without understanding the contents of much documents. For this reason clause 21(1) provides that the waiver by any consumer of any right which is conferred upon him by this Act or by any provision of any other law, if such waiver will derogate from any provision of this Act, is illegal.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a measure that has given us some difficulty on this side of the House. I want to say to the hon. the Minister at the outset that we on this side of the House would like to see a Trade Practices Act on the Statute Book, an Act that protects the consumer. However, this Bill, the Second Reading of which has been introduced here this afternoon, is a Bill which contains a number of good features, a number of features which we regard as being highly desirable, but which also contains some bad features. It is unfortunate that apparently the main bad features contained in this Bill result more from the manner in which the Bill has been drawn up or drafted than from any intention that such features should be embodied in it. I listened very carefully to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading speech and I could find no intention that these features which have been included were intended to be included.</p>

<p>As far as the good features of this legislation are concerned, they are the features which provide for the protection of the consumer. These are features which we have no difficulty at all in supporting. In fact, we support them wholeheartedly. However, due to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s having embodied the provisions of the Trade Coupons Act of 1935 in this measure, which is a measure that has been framed to protect the consumer in areas other than in trade coupon trading areas, due to the fact that it is framed in this manner and contains definitions that are directed towards these provisions providing for consumer protection and to the fact that thereby the provisions regarding trade coupons have been widened to such an extent, in our opinion, the consumer is going to be harmed. The consumer is going to be harmed because of the inclusion of the provisions of the Trade Coupons Act in this measure. As I said, I believe that this is an unintentional result. In fact, however, the potential for harm in this Bill by the inclusion of the provisions of the Trade Coupons Act and subjecting them to the definitions that have been included in this Bill is so great &#x2026;</p>

I believe that <span class="col_2063-2064" refersTo="page_1047"/>the harm that can be done by the inclusion of these trade coupon provisions in this Bill and subjecting them to the definitions contained in this Bill which are required for other aspects, far outweighs the good in this Bill. The result is that we on this side of the House are unable to support the Bill in its present form. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that this is something that I regret because without the trade coupons provisions in this Bill, it might well be a model piece of legislation.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>I sincerely hope therefore, Sir, that the hon. the Minister will seriously consider excising from this measure the provisions which deal with trade coupons and leave them as they are now in a separate Act. That separate Act can be amended to take up the amendments which are proposed in this legislation, but unless the definitions in this legislation are to be radically amended I can see no other way in which the problem that is facing us can be overcome. If the hon. the Minister is prepared to excise from this Bill the trade coupons provisions, i.e. clauses 10 to 12 and certain other consequential matters, then we would have no difficulty in supporting the Bill and I would certainly withdraw the amendment that I propose to move.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to deal with the provisions that we can support and then deal in greater detail with those affecting trade coupons which we cannot support. Apart from the trade coupons provisions in this Bill, the Bill is primarily aimed, as the hon. the Minister has said, at protection for the consumer. We already have measures on the Statute Book, such as the Price Control Act and the Regulation of Monopolies Act and other measures, which are aimed at protecting the consumer, but their aim is to protect him from price exploitation. This Bill is aimed at protection for the consumer in respect of advertising practices, in respect of selling practices, marketing practices and other practices which may be declared undesirable. As far as advertising is concerned, I am very conscious of the fact that the volume and the power of advertising to which people are subjected has increased enormously over the past few years. Advertising is now a very big and a very powerful industry. It covers not only newspapers, direct mail, radio, neon signs, cinemas and possibly, in the not too distant future, TV but also a host of other media which enterprising people are continually thinking up. It has an increasing effect on people&#x2019;s lives and habits, and I believe therefore that this House would be justified in passing legislation which ensures that ethical standards and standards of accuracy are maintained. I am also very conscious of the fact that in the modern world the public is subjected more and more to high-powered sales techniques, whether it be from insurance salesmen, whether it be from property salesmen, whether it be from salesmen trying to sell your wife a fur coat or whether it be from itinerant encyclopaedia salesmen. I am also aware that bright people are continually introducing new marketing techniques. We now have tea parties selling plastic ware. We have mail orders, a big industry, which tends to direct its efforts more and more to the less sophisticated part of the market, namely the Africans, who are most vulnerable to malpractices. We have Christmas clubs and lay-byes, etc.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I would regard these practices as desirable. They are part and parcel of the free competitive enterprise system. They represent innovations and initiative. They oil the wheels of the economy and they help by doing so to raise our living standards. Advertising helps to keep the public informed and it whets their appetite for expanded trade. It promotes <span class="col_2065-2066" refersTo="page_1048"/>economic activity in commerce and industry. Good sales techniques are desirable, particularly when complicated and large items are being bought and sold, items such as motor-cars, property, insurance policies and so forth, which are bought only seldom and when bought, require thorough knowledge and investigation. New marketing techniques often result from ingenious innovations and are the very lifeblood of the competitive system. But while I do appreciate that these practices may be desirable in themselves, it has been found, as the hon. the Minister said in his Second Reading speech, that on occasion they are subject to abuse, and when they are abused it is the consumer who is hurt, and it is particularly, in this country, the lower income consumer, the non-White person who is hurt. As the Minister said, many Western countries already have legislation protecting the consumer. I also believe, with the hon. the Minister, that voluntary measures taken by private enterprise itself and by organizations representing private enterprise are very desirable and should be encouraged, but at the same time I think that had it not been for the trade coupon provisions in this Bill, this Bill would have been a timely and advisable measure, timely and advisable because it prohibits misleading and false advertising and selling practices. It provides for the control of advertising in certain respects and it provides for the prohibition of certain injurious trade practices. All these are aims which we on this side of the House can support. As far as misleading and false advertising and selling methods are concerned, which are dealt with in clauses 9 and 13 of the Bill, of course we wholeheartedly support the principle of prohibition. But I must say that except for blatant transgressions in this regard, I believe that these provisions are going to be very difficult to enforce. Salesmen in shops and salesmen selling motorcars and property frequently make inaccurate statements, and it is virtually impossible for the authorities to detect such inaccurate statements and it is certainly virtually impossible for the employers to control those activities and to make sure that such statements are always accurate. In most cases I do not think that the customer is hurt by that inaccuracy. The same problems apply to advertising, where I think it is going to be extremely difficult to detect and interpret what is misleading advertising in many respects. It is certainly going to be difficult to enforce the provisions of this Bill in this regard. For example, is the well known advertisement, &#x201C;If you want to know how good a Volkswagen is, ask a Volkswagen owner&#x201D;, misleading or not misleading? A Volkswagen owner who has paid over R2 200 for his Volkswagen is unlikely to say that he has made a bad buy.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Then ask him after he has sold it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think, Mr. Speaker, it is important to avoid action as far as minor and unintentional transgressions are concerned. I think it is also important to avoid this legislation becoming the cause of businessmen and customers coming to loggerheads with each other, which could easily happen unless this legislation is sympathetically administered. I regard the provisions dealing with misleading and false advertising and selling methods as being more of a deterrent than anything else, but I still think they serve a good purpose.</p>

<p>The second measure we would support in relation to consumer protection is the measure giving the Minister power to control advertising in certain respects. I refer to clause 14. We already have the Advertising Standards Authority, set up by the advertising industry and the National Press Union, which is doing excellent and effective work in the controlling of advertising. But the Advertising Standards Authority does not control all media. It does not control in-store advertising, it does not control placard advertising, and it does not control mail order advertising. I agree that other powers, as provided in this Bill, are needed, provided that they are subject to very careful safeguards. I hope that in administering this clause of the Bill the Minister and the Trade Practices Advisory Committee, which is provided for in this legislation, will work in close cooperation with the Advertising Standards Authority, which already has a considerable wealth of experience in this field.</p>

<p>The third and last measure included in this Bill to protect consumers is the power to control, restrict and prohibit injurious trade practices, and is contained in clause 15. I think this is a clause that needs looking at very closely because the Minister is taking power to prohibit undefined, unspecified, unforeseen and unforeseeable trade practices, trade practices which may <span class="col_2067-2068" refersTo="page_1049"/>be of a minor nature or of a major nature. In these circumstances, owing to the unforeseeable nature of the practices that are going to be controlled, I regard the safeguards upon the Minister&#x2019;s actions as being critical. I would suggest that this power to control and prohibit trade practices should not be used to control trade practices which are already known. Trade practices which are already known should be controlled by specific legislation or specific regulations. This provision should not be used to control trade practices which can be controlled by other provisions of the Act or by other legislation. Multi-level trading for instance to which the hon. the Minister referred in his speech, can be controlled as it is already being controlled in terms of the Price Control Act or it could justifiably be controlled by separate legislation. The worst features of itinerant encyclopaedia selling and mail order abuses are already controlled under clause 9. I believe, therefore, that the power being asked for under clause 15 to control undesirable trade practices is one that should be used only on very rare occasions.</p>

<p>I should now like to come to the question of the safeguards that are needed in exercising the very considerable powers which are given to the Minister under this Bill because I regard this as being a key pointer to whether these provisions, which we regard as desirable are framed in an acceptable manner. The Bill provides that the Minister may take action to control advertising practices under clause 12, and to control, restrict and prohibit injurious trade practices under clause 15 by publishing a provisional notice in the <i>Government Gazette</i> followed by a final notice after representations, made to the advisory committee, have been considered by that advisory committee and recommendations have been made by it to the Minister. The Minister may not deviate from the recommendations which the committee makes. It is also provided that where urgent action is necessary, the Secretary may act on the recommendation of the advisory committee for a period not exceeding six months. Very clearly the Trade Practices Advisory Committee occupies a key position in this legislation and in the safeguards contained in it.</p>

<p>In view of the unforeseeable nature of the circumstances in which the Minister may act, and the complex nature of the measures which the Minister may have to take, I consider it absolutely essential that the advisory committee should be a body which is as competent, representative and balanced as possible. It is very important that men of calibre be appointed to it so that it can enjoy the confidence of all the parties who are going to be affected by its recommendations. I believe that the Minister will be well advised to write into the Bill that the persons appointed by him to the Committee should be nominees of the national bodies of the various categories of trade and consumers which are already mentioned in the Bill. I believe that this Committee must be representative of all the categories which are mentioned in the Bill and that there must be a fairy even balance between representatives representing trading interests and those representing consumer interests. To the trade interests which should be represented on this committee I should like to add a representative of the mail order industry, because that is an industry vitally affected by this legislation, and a representative of the property industry because this Bill also covers the sale of property.</p>

<p>Finally I would like this Trade Practices Advisory Committee to have the power to call for evidence, which it does not have at present. It can only receive representations but if it is to reach a balanced judgment and make balanced recommendations, I believe that it should also have the power to call for evidence in addition to receiving representations. I am afraid that I do not have the time to complete the other side of the picture and this is the side of the picture which we find unacceptable in this legislation. I refer to those provisions which embody the provisions of the existing Trade Coupons Act, namely clauses 10, 11 and 12. In view of the fact that the subject is now likely to change from one in which I am in full agreement with the hon. the Minister to one in which I am not in agreement with him, I think that it will be an appropriate time to move&#x2014;</p>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 1 of this Bill is designed to adjust the presently applicable method of the determination of rentals and, if I may use the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words in the Second Reading, is designed to provide the lessor with a reasonable income on his capital and attempts to satisfy the lessees by containing rentals within reasonable limits. For several hours during the Second Reading debate there was not a word from the hon. the Minister about any planned approach to eliminate the one factor which is vital in determining the adjustments to be made in this clause, i.e. the inadequate supply of housing in relation to the demand. Let me repeat myself by saying that this clause is merely fiddling with definitions and percentages which will satisfy neither the landlord nor the tenant. Effective steps are needed to provide housing so as to eliminate the existing imbalance between supply and demand as far as possible. I readily accept that a good deal has, in fact, been done&#x2014;and I appreciate what is being done for sub-economic housing&#x2014;but one must look at the percentages suggested here on the basis that the housing backlog will never be overcome, especially while compulsory removal still hangs over people&#x2019;s heads in terms of the Group Areas Act. The position is also aggravated when one comes to determine rentals and reasonable returns. Figures given by the hon. member for Sea Point are evidence of a complete and callous disregard of the needs of old-age pensioners. If we adopt clause 1 of this Bill, this juggling with figures and definitions, the inevitable and unavoidable result is going to be&#x2014;despite what the hon. the Minister suggested in the Second Reading &#x2014;an excessive burden on tenants. That excessive burden will be caused by the increased percentages which are to be provided&#x2014;the 8% to 8&#x00BD;% on buildings, the 6% to 8&#x00BD;% on the value of land and the extra on maintenance. When it comes to the basis on which those figures are to be calculated, however, it is not going to be the basis now applying to the 8% and 6% figures. What the hon. the Minister has done in this clause is to eliminate from the Rent Board&#x2019;s consideration the cost of erection of buildings as a factor in determining the valuation for rental purposes, i.e. the actual cash investment, an important factor. I believe that the term &#x2018;&#x201C;cost&#x201D; must refer to the price paid if the purchasing landlord was not the original builder. There is a further aspect which is going to shoot up the valuation on which these percentages are assessed, and that is the introduction of the consideration of replacement costs less depreciation without one word as to the method of determination of what the replacement costs is, especially in relation to buildings which are old and outmoded. The Bill does not give any direction either about the factors that must be taken into account in determining depreciation. I want to refer the hon. the Minister to some facts which his departments should have drawn to his attention. I do not know why attention has not been paid to this. Under the Cape valuation ordinance, in regard to the land, samples are taken in an area of sales. A value is then laid down which is considered to be acceptable to a willing buyer and a willing seller for that particular area. When one comes to buildings, however, the municipal evaluation for tax purposes, and I quote from the ordinance:</p>

<p>Then the ordinance adds specifically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; with power to the Administrator to determine a special reduction when in his opinion replacement costs are excessive due to exceptional circumstances or inflated costs of construction and erection.</block>

<p>That is in the ordinance, but there is not a word of that in this legislation. One of the factors to be taken into account in determining the amount upon which the percentages will be calculated will mereley be replacement value less depreciation. The Administrator of the Cape, the last time when we had a valuation&#x2014;a few years ago&#x2014;was so concerned about what this burden would be on ratepayers if they were to have the replacement costs, that he ordered an initial deduction of 25% and thereafter the depreciation for obsolescence and age. The hon. the Minister says that the percentages in this clause are not going to put up the rents which will have to be paid by the tenants. Let me give one fact. In determining the value for rent purposes, in taking into account the replacement cost, no regard is had when it comes to the rent-payer, of an initial 25% because of the inflated cost of building. This even goes further because this does not apply to this clause. The full inflated cost of erection will be loaded on the tenant. This clause goes further because not only is that the position, but the other factor, namely the original cost of erection, is eliminated from the consideration of the board. If one has that full inflated cost, one must look at the proposed return about which the hon. the Minister posed to query to me. The hon. Minister asked, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is 8&#x00BD;% too high when a person today can obtain 10% from a safe investment with a financial institution?</block>

<p>It is a fair question and I shall deal with it Investment in property has a built-in benefit factor for the investor, a benefit which is absent in a cash deposit investment, such as a fixed deposit investment for instance. The built-in benefit for the investor in property is a capital appreciation which by and large, throughout the country, is not less than the depreciating value of the purchasing power of the rand. When there is a cash investment on fixed deposit, the investor himself must carry the depreciation in his money value. If he has a fixed deposit for three years, he gets back the same sum of money but of a depreciated value. For that reason such an investor asks for a higher rate of interest from the borrower. This is a perfectly normal matter. The hon. the Minister says here that not only must the tenant give a return which is reasonable on the investment involved, but he must also give a return on an appreciation of the original investment as it appreciates from year to year. Obviously these two figures, the 8&#x00BD;% and the 10%, which the hon. the Minister attempted to compare when it comes to a fixed deposit income rate as opposed to the interest rate on property, is a wrong approach. Obviously, if the income returns on these investments were equal the investor would prefer the property investment to cash investment. The fact that a bondholder who is for instance investing in a bond on immovable property, asks for a higher rate of interest than the rate of interest that he can get on a fixed deposit, is quite legitimate because his money, as a bondholder, is in that property as much as the amount which the owner or the builder himself has invested in the building. He is also entitled to participate in the capital appreciation of that property over a period of time. In other words, if the bondholder were to lend his money at an interest rate of 7% or 7&#x00BD;% and the property is appreciating at a higher figure, the bondholder is losing his share in the benefit accruing to the owner of the property concerned.

<block name="quote">On page 4, to omit paragraph (f).</block>

<p>Our opposition to paragraph (f) is along the same lines as our opposition to (b) as outlined by the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

<p>During the Second Reading debate we made a case through a number of speakers on this side of the House that the effect of the increased percentages provided for in paragraphs (b) and (f) will inevitably be to <span class="col_2073-2074" refersTo="page_1052"/>bring about extensive increases in rentals for the tenants. The hon. the Minister has said that this is not the case, and I want to discuss with him this statement of his. As far as I am concerned, it cannot be justified. The hon. the Minister has made it clear that the object of increasing the percentages is to give landlords a better return for their investments. If that is so&#x2014;I think it is quite clear that is the object of increasing the percentages&#x2014;the landlord is going to get a better return as a result of these amendments to the Act, because from where will he be getting a better return if it is not as a result of increases in rentals? There is no other way in which landlords can get a better return than they are getting at present from their investments other than by getting a greater rental. Inevitably it must follow that these increased percentages will have the effect of extensive increases in rentals to tenants. We are therefore opposed to these amendments because of the increased burden they will place on tenants generally throughout the country. I want to make our position on this side of the House clear.</p>

<p>Landlords are entitled to reasonable return on their investments, that is if it is decided to maintain this way of subsidizing those tenants who cannot afford the sort of rental that they are required to pay. I believe that the time has come to revise this whole approach to the question of subsidizing of those tenants who require to be assisted with their rentals. We believe on the one hand that we have a capitalist society, a free enterprise society, but on the other hand we continue this practice of requiring certain landlords to subsidize those tenants who cannot afford the rents that they are required to pay. The position is becoming increasingly unsatisfactory for both sides. The tenants are not satisfied with this legislation, the landlords are not satisfied with this legislation and neither side is going to be satisfied with the situation which is being created under this legislation.</p>

<p>As long as the Rents Act is retained, we accept that landlords are entitled to a reasonable return on their investments, but not if that is going to provide an unreasonable burden on the tenants. Obviously tenants must be prepared to accept reasonable rentals and reasonable increases from time to time in view of the increasing costs of living. Our contention is that these provisions in the Bill will have the effect of placing a totally unreasonably burden on tenants, particularly on those tenants who have fixed incomes, like pensioners and others whose income is not subject to periodical increases as are those of ordinary salary-drawing people. We can therefore not accept or support the amendment which is proposed in paragraph (f).</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I have said earlier that the new basis of determining the value of premises for rent purposes in terms of clause 1, now eliminates as one of the factors for consideration the amount invested by the landlord. That is now no longer a matter for consideration as far as the Rent Board is concerned. Secondly, the Rent Board will now have to give consideration to another factor, a factor which can only be inflationary in so far as determination of value is concerned, and that is the rentals of uncontrolled premises in the locality. One wonders if one looks at the luxury finish that the modern flat has against the old controlled flats, how one can ever visualize this criteron doing anything but push up value. In addition to that the hon. the Minister has accepted as a fact that in determining value, the board can have regard to the capital appreciation of the original investment. All this will be taken into consideration of determining the <span class="col_2075-2076" refersTo="page_1053"/>valuation. At the same time the landlord receives back into his pocket all the outgoings involved in the management and running of that business e.g. his rates, his percentage for repairs and he is even allowed to make a profit on electricity, according to this clause, by buying it in bulk and charging the tenant at the domestic rate. When one looks at this inflated value, I would say that 7% on that inflated value is an adequate return for the landlord. It is not a return on his investment. If it was it would be totally inadequate. It is a return on an inflated, arbitrary valuation determined by the Rent Board as a valuation for the letting unit. The factor is not remotely connected with the cost of construction or the market price. The factors being introduced in respect of rentals of the uncontrolled premises are factors which are determined by the total imbalance of supply and demand for residential accommodation. Obviously high and inflated rent in the economy as we have it at the present moment will be the result. That is why I say that 7 % on a value of that nature is an adequate return. It is not a return on an investment, but a return on an arbitrary figure taking into consideration all these inflationary aspects which are now to fall upon the tenant. If the hon. the Minister had retained the present criteria for the determination of the value for a property for rent purposes, I would say to him that I think there was a very good case for accepting 8&#x00BD;% as a present return. However, that is on the present criteria for fixing the valuation and not the criteria which are introduced by this clause. For that reason I move he amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the third amendment which the United Party intends moving to clause 1 is patent to everybody. We fail to see why the owner of the building should be entitled to claim a profit on electricity supply. We see this as quite unnecessary. It is going to involve a very small sum of money but despite the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation in his reply to the Second Reading debate, we still find his arguments unconvincing and we believe this is something which we can usefully get rid of. I therefore move the amendment printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 4, to omit paragraph (g).</block>

<p>I want to speak very briefly to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Green Point. I have been making a few sums to ascertain what the effects of this 8&#x00BD;% increase will be on the average tenant. Under the old system, on a building valued at R80 000 on land valued at R20 000, the reasonable return, i.e. if the old formula of 6% and 8% was applied, would have been R7 600. If that building is going to be revalued and provided the Rent Board&#x2014;this, of course, is the big condition&#x2014;takes into account the scientific valuation principles which are now included in the legislation, then the valuation of the land and the building may easily be determined at R130 000 which is not unreasonable under prevailing price increases of land. This will have the effect that the owner of the building will no longer be entitled to a return of R7 600, but to a return of R11 050, which is an increase of just under 50%. I am aware that this is, shall we say, a worstcase analysis, but I believe we should nevertheless look at this because for any person who has a limited income to be suddenly faced with an increase in rental to the tune of 50% is by any standard a calamitous event. Consequently, I believe that we must try to bring this down to a more reasonable level and accordingly we have proposed the figure of 7% which on that same building would only mean an increase of about 3&#x2019;3%, which is pretty shattering for many tenants anyway, but at least less shattering than an increase of close on 50%.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is quite clear&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister came some way towards admitting it during the course of the Second Reading debate&#x2014;that this piece of amending legislation is a compromise. Speakers on this side of the House have indicated that it is a compromise which is going to please no one. This arises from the fact that the assessment of the return on an investment and the balancing of that assessment with the amount the tenant is prepared to pay, is based on completely arbitrary criteria. The hon. the Minister keeps asking whether 8&#x00BD;% is a fair return on an investment. Quite clearly. 8&#x00BD;% is not an unfair return on a cash investment, given the circumstances <span class="col_2077-2078" refersTo="page_1054"/>of South Africa today. But this is not what this clause sets out to achieve. I want to show him that this is not so. Secondly, it all flows from the fact that the Government is not prepared to accept responsibility for bridging the gap between what is a fair return for the building owner and what is a reasonable rental for those in the lower and middle income groups, and especially the pensioners.</p>

<p>I want to refer first of all to the arbitrary nature of the basis on which this rental is to be established. First of all, the whole original provision relating to the definition of value has in it a built-in arbitrariness, because there are five criteria, and the board can accept or reject any one of them. There are criteria which may be conflicting and which may be arbitrary, and the Rent Board is not required to pay any greater attention to one than the other. Therefore there is an arbitrary approach towards the determination of what is the basic value. Quite clearly, the changes to paragraphs (a) and (e) of the definition have increased the arbitrariness of this determination, by deleting any reference to the original cost of erection and placing the emphasis both in paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) on the cost of replacement, because the municipal valuation provided for in paragraph (b) does take into account the cost of replacement as well. This means that from now onwards the valuation is going to be linked to the rise in building costs. I must point out to the hon. the Minister that the rise in building costs over the last ten years has gone ahead of the rise in the cost of living. In other words, this Government has chosen a basis, an index for increasing rentals which is even ahead of the index of the average rise in the cost of living in the urban areas. The building cost index from 1964 to 1974 rose by 150%, while the cost-of-living index rose by some 113% over the same period. This means that an additional 30% rise in respect of the building cost index will be taken into account. If one takes the 4&#x00BD; year period from the second quarter of 1970 to the end of 1974, one finds that, in spite of there only being an increase of 3.5% in 1972, the increase in the building cost index over that 4&#x00BD; year period was 58%. What the Minister is saying is that in future the determination of rentals for rent-controlled flats should be locked into the increase in the cost of building. This is going to have a dramatic effect on rentals, especially for the lower income groups. Secondly, it is going to increase the fluctuation, because whereas in the past, once the cost of the erection of the building had been determined it could not be adjusted, one can now have, at intervals as frequent as the building owner or landlord would like them to be, revisions of the basic cost taking into account juctuations in building costs. So there is a whole new element of uncertainty. Instead of taking into account the basic cost of erection, there will be constant reference to the replacement value in terms of the new paragraph (a) and the existing paragraph (b), which relates to municipal or divisional council valuations. So, on the one hand there is going to be a dramatic increase in rentals; on the other hand the Minister is concerned, as we all are, about providing for a reasonable return to the building owner.</p>

<p>I want to take just one simple illustration of a building which is valued at R600 000, on which the building owner will be allowed a return of 8&#x00BD;%. This gives one a net income of R51 000. This building owner has to take out a bond for two-thirds of the value of the building at 12%, which means that his outgoings in respect of bond interest will amount to R48 000, leaving a balance of a net return on his equity of R200 000 of R2 000 or 1,5%. I want to ask the hon. the Minister: Does he think that 1,5% is a reasonable return to a property owner on his investment? Does he think that 1,5% is reasonable? This imbalance in the supply and demand, in the requirements on the one hand of a tenant who deserves protection and on the other hand the reasonable return which a building owner can expect on his investments, can only be met by the Government, it cannot simply be passed to the landlord. The Government itself has got to accept the responsibility to bridge the gap between these two problem areas. Sir, I want to indicate the immediate effect of these increases without taking any increase in the basic value into account. I want to take the three areas in which increases are being allowed. Presuming a property investment in which the value of the total investment is 50% in the land and 50% in the building. There are many instances in my constituency where in the case of the older buildings the land value is much higher than the building value, but let us assume that the value of the land is 50% and the value of the building 50%. An increase from 6% to 8&#x00BD;% on the value of the land is an increase of 42% <span class="col_2079-2080" refersTo="page_1055"/>in the rental as applied to the land. An increase from 8 to 8&#x00BD;% on the value of the building is an increase of 6,2% on the building, and an increase of &#x00BD;% in the depreciation allowance is a further 6,2%. This would then give you an increase, taking the land and building together, of 27,2%. Without any revaluation of the land, just taking these figures which the Minister has put before the House, this would automatically result in an increase of 27,2% in the average rental in that kind of property.</p>

<p>But, Sir, one must add to this the fact that the Minister by changing the definition in clause (a) has now virtually directed the Rent Board to give special attention to replacement costs, and in future rentals are going to be geared to the building cost index. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is prepared to argue that pensions should be geared to the cost-of-living index? Is he prepared to see that pensions rise commensurately with the cost-of-living index, or is he going to make an arbitrary adjustment from time to time well below the rise in the cost-of-living index? Sir, I want to raise another factor. The effect is going to be to push up the basic value of the land merely be changing the percentage return which one can earn on that land. In the past land has been valued to give a net return of 6%, so the capitalized value of the land has been related to 6%, but from now onwards the capitalized value of the land is going to be related to 8&#x00BD;%. The immediate effect of increasing the return on the land is to increase the value of the land because you can now earn 42% more on your land than you could before and therefore you would be prepared on the free markets to pay 42% more for your land. As the result of these figures, therefore, you are not only going to increase the percentages, but you are going to increase the base of the value on which these percentages are worked out. Mr. Speaker, we will not be in a position to support this clause. We believe that this is a clause of a patchwork nature which will in no way relieve the situation. It is going to push up rentals and it will still not see that the building owner gets a fair return on his investment, and it will also not encourage any further investment in low income group housing in the cities.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that before we on this side reply to the arguments of the Opposition in regard to this specific clause, we must be clear on the standpoint of the Opposition in respect of one matter. Do they recognize the principle that replacement value less depreciation is the new norm that must be laid down, or does their argument only concern the percentage allowed in respect of that joint valuation? Does it only concern the 8&#x00BD;% or does it also concern the principle? Because you see, Sir, the hon. member for Sea Point and the hon. member for Pinetown argue in absolute circles when they try to prove here that there is going to be a substantial increase in rents. The hon. member for Pinetown, for example, makes an arbitrary calculation and increases it from 7&#x00BD;% to 8&#x00BD;% and says that the rest is increase. But surely that is not so. If the hon. member were to take the trouble to read the Bill, he would see that in terms of this legislation, mortgage interest is now being done away with as a factor. After all, one cannot simply make a calculation, as he did, without leaving out the factor of mortgage interest. Earlier on, Sir, I indicated that the hon. member for Green Point had adopted the standpoint that this replacement value less depreciation could now give rise to a substantial increase in the rent value of the premises. He even tries to go so far as to say that this is going to be the only norm by means of which the rent value of premises may be determined, which is most decidedly not the case. But he goes further and tells us, in his Second Reading speech, that the present municipal valuation in the Cape Province is based on replacement value less depreciation. In other words, a formula that he now finds objectionable in this Bill is a formula that he accepts as far as municipal valuation is concerned. Sir, I just want to mention to you a single example in the constituency of the hon. member for Sea Point. There is a certain block of flats there. I should appreciate it if the hon. member for Sea Point would listen to this now. The municipal valuation of the land is R114 900, say R115 000, and of the buildings, R369 900, say R370 000, That is the municipal valuation of those premises. In other words, the valuation of those premises is replacement value less depreciation, if the argument of the hon. member for Green Point, that that is the basis of municipal valuation, is correct. Now you ask me what the board&#x2019;s valuation will be. As against a valuation of R115 000 for the <span class="col_2081-2082" refersTo="page_1056"/>land, the board placed a valuation on those premises that bore relation to the surrounding areas, and valued it at R200 000, in other words, R85 000 higher than the municipal valuation. As far as the buildings were concerned, they valued them at R370 000, which was the same as the municipal valuation. In other words, here the rent was calculated on the basis of a valuation that was R85 000 higher than the municipal valuation. Now with the best will in the world I cannot see how this new norm, when it is applied&#x2014;assuming that, as the hon. member for Green Point says, the dominant element in that formula will be replacement value less depreciation &#x2014;it can affect the rents in this instance in any way. The hon. member for Musgrave followed this overall Opposition pattern of objecting to a reasonable rent for the owner. He is not prepared to argue the increase of <i>2%</i> to 2&#x00BD;% for maintenance separately. I want to ask the hon. member for Musgrave, who is a reasonable member, to state specifically with regard to his amendment whether the increase in maintenance expenses, the allowable increase in maintenance expenses, is not a reasonable increase. Sir, we have the problem that in the calculation of a possible rent, hon. members have in all cases accepted this increase of an allowable 2% to 2&#x00BD;% as an increase that is going to occur. After all, it relates to an inspection of those premises that can be made by the Rent Board concerned. The hon. member for Green Point comes along with an amendment that envisages reducing this 8&#x00BD;% to 7%. However, he does not move an amendment in regard to the abolition of mortgage interest. In other words, he wants to leave the lessor in a far poorer position than he had been in before the introduction of this legislation. What is their own verdict concerning this matter of 8&#x00BD;%? I need only refer to the argument advanced by the hon. member for Green Point in this regard. He states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must also at the same time&#x2014;and this is also a very valid aspect of the matter&#x2014;remember that the investor who is seeking avenues for investment which will allow for capital growth and capital appreciation, wants to be sure that he will receive reasonable returns on his investment.</block>

<p>A little further on he states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must look at those landlords who, I believe, are in the majority and who seek only a reasonable return on their investment.</block>

<p>Although this is in fact what is envisaged in this clause, the hon. member says that this is not right. He says that the lessor should receive less than he received before this amendment was proposed. That is the double-talk we have here. I have already quoted the hon. member for Walmer, but I want to refer once again to what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proposed increase to 8&#x00BD;% on the value represents some improvement, but is totally unrealistic and unfair in today&#x2019;s conditions of high interest rates and a shortage of liquidity. An investor is entitled to expect that the return on rented residential property should be higher than that on fixed interest loans. Instead the returns are lower and are fixed in a most archaic manner.</block>

The hon. member for Green Point tried to explain in simple terms that 8&#x00BD;% on an investment was not unreasonable. In this case, however, we are not dealing with 8&#x00BD;% on an investment, but on an arbitrary evaluation. That is the big difference. One may in fact argue in favour of 8&#x00BD;% on an investment. I do not think we would have opposed this, but it is not the investment that counts. Let me put this very clearly.</p>

This is the issue, this is the problem, that we are not arguing here on a return on investment, which is what the hon. the Minister and, hon. members opposite are trying to do.

<p>It could well be, but it would not be like the hon. member for Klip River&#x2019;s land at Umhlatuzana which he and his family bought from the Department of Community Development and which had escalated in value. Therefore the rental which he gets today on the present valuation on ground bought from the Department of Community Development will be worth much more as a return on his investment which he made initially. This is what I am trying to get across to the hon. member. Obviously that hon. member appreciates that land appreciates in value, otherwise he would not have gone in for speculation in buying land. He understands that land goes up in value, and this is the point the hon. member for Green Point was trying to get across so clearly. He said that land and buildings are rising assets and therefore you cannot equate them with money.</p>

<p>The second point I want to make is that we are dealing here entirely with pre-1966 buildings. If those buildings are sold and a person buys it as an investment intending to let it, he pays a value equivalent to the real value of that building. If he is buying it for speculation in order, say, to demolish it and to build a five-star hotel, a shopping complex or some other vast project, he is not interested in the value of that building. What he pays for it has no relationship with its intrinsic value. He is thinking in terms of the huge project, a project of R1 million or R2 million, which he is going to put up on that land. Take a building like Belmont in Durban. It is a very solid old building, but it is to be replaced by a vast complex which will cost some R2 million. Two buildings are in the process of being demolished to make way for project named &#x201C;Tollman Towers&#x201D;. In other words, the replacement has no relationship to the value of the buildings. If one is going to determine rentals on the basis of some future project, it is not fair. If a man is prepared to speculate he must take a chance on a speculation. When he buys the building he knows what its income is. Now that we are talking of replacement value, we are going to get a completely distorted pattern.</p>

<p>I want to answer the other question of the hon. member for Tygervallei, the question whether the 2&#x00BD;% for maintenance is unreasonable. It would not be unreasonable if it were based on a constant figure but here it is 2&#x00BD;% on a rising figure. It is not 2&#x00BD;% on a fixed cost, and whilst the maintenance may increase, the cash amount of 2&#x00BD;% of the investment would mean that if the building was valued at R100 000, the 2&#x00BD;% cost of maintenance which you are allowed to take will amount to R2 500 in a year. If that value has escalated to R200 000 the 2&#x00BD;% becomes R5 000. I hope these <span class="col_2085-2086" refersTo="page_1058"/>figures are correct because I am not good at mental arithmetic, but the fact is it doubles. If your value doubles, the amount for maintenance doubles, and therefore the percentage remains constant. Your cost of maintenance has gone up on the same basis, but certainly not as fast as the cost of building which is now calculated on replacement value and is now going to be the yardstick. Therefore your maintenance remains the same percentagewise. I asked the hon. the Minister at the Second Reading and I ask him again to look at the question of people who take their 2% which will now be 2&#x00BD;% if our amendment is rejected, but never spend it on the building. Just before the next application for a rent increase they paint the outside of the building and dolly it up for a few rand. When the Rent Board comes to inspect, it is neatly painted. If you check back you will see that every time just before the last inspection by the Rent Board that building was last painted. There are landlords who regularly look after their buildings, but where that maintenance percentage is granted and not spent on the building. I believe it should be forfeited. It should be necessary, when an application for a rent increase is made, for the owner to produce evidence by way of receipts of what he has in fact spent on maintenance over the last five years. If it is found that he has not spent anything like the 2&#x00BD;%, or not anything at all, on maintenance the rentals should be reduced accordingly. In many cases this provision is simply a hidden addition to the return. The 8&#x00BD;% plus this 2&#x00BD;% becomes 11%. To the man who is not maintaining his building this provision is going to give an 11% return and again, 11% based on an arbitrary figure. The hon. the Minister shakes his head, but I can tell him that at least 10 of the buildings in my constituency have had no maintenance other than that which can be done by a handyman over the last five years. The tenants themselves have to look after the internal maintenance of the building, while the outside of the building has not had a coat of paint. The landlords wait until the windows fall out and then they ask for a demolition or a reconstruction permit. It is a fact that many of these buildings do not have maintenance.</p>

<p>What the hon. member wants, therefore, is that no yardstick whatever be laid down in accordance with which a Rent Board must determine rent. Paragraph (i) incorporates all the factors which have to be taken into account when rent is determined. But what is the position at the moment as regards the existing Act? Rent Boards are not bound to actual costs of construction, nor to municipal valuations. The situation was that Rent Boards determined the value of properties whether on the basis of actual building costs, municipal valuations, sworn valuations or whatever. They tried to determine the value of a property in a certain way and in practice it appears to me that what this amounted to was cost of replacement. This is how the Rent Boards operated and this is how the Boards determined rent, as I understand it. The hon. Opposition now comes along and fails to state on what basis it should be done. Apparently these Boards must not be given a guideline. After all, the Rent Boards are not bound to replacement costs. Surely there are all those other factors which they may take into account. The hon. member for Durban Point now wants to tell us that the capital appreciation is higher every year and that that 8&#x00BD;% is determined in accordance with that. But has the hon. member for Durban Point never heard of compound interest? When a man invests his money at an interest rate of 10% or 12% and the following year he gets interest on interest, what is the difference between property the value of which appreciates and his own capital that appreciates in that way. Hon. members should also take into account the fact that a risk is involved for the lessor, too. How many people do not leave without paying <span class="col_2087-2088" refersTo="page_1059"/>rent? How many times does one not see a block of flats with flats that are standing vacant? This is a risk that is involved. The hon, member refers to the pensioner. Now I want to tell him that I know of a number of pensioners who have invested their money in a small property and then regard that as a pension for the future. When they refer to the high cost of living, and state that it must keep pace with rents, do they want that pensioner, who has invested his money in a property, to receive a higher rental too?</p>

<p>Can the hon. member for Pinetown tell us&#x2014;the position is that the electricity is purchased by the owner and that he charges the lessees as he sees fit, or he shares it among them. If he were to sell it at the domestic tariff and hold every lessee responsible for the electricity he consumed, who does he think would be held responsible for the installation of the meters? Surely that would be the lessor&#x2019;s responsibility? He would have to incur the expense of installing meters. He cannot recover it from the lessees, or does the hon. member want him to recover it from the lessee? It is the lessor&#x2019;s duty to read those meters. He must also send accounts to the lessees and administer the matter. If a small profit could be made, and I believe it would be minimal, then, in my opinion, he would surely be entitled to it as compensation for his trouble and since, in practice, he might even have to have the meters installed, too.</p>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to make two points on the clause, in regard to which the hon. member for Sea Point stated our overall attitude. One has got to be careful when one talks about capital appreciation, certainly where buildings under rent control are concerned. It seems to me that it is very doubtful that the figures which people are talking about in terms of annual appreciation on such properties are liable to be achieved. In order to build up the capital value of an asset such as a building, the landlord is going to have to get a sufficient return to maintain and to keep up such a building and indeed to renovate it. Finally, if in this respect he does not get a sufficient return, which we think is quite clear&#x2014;though there is some improvement in this Bill&#x2014;then of course other people are not going to wish to buy that property at some future stage and certainly not at the price which will produce the sort of capital appreciation mentioned by the hon. member for Durban Point. If one looks at what has been happening with rent-controlled premises over the past five to 10 years, it is extremely unlikely that one will find that they have changed hands in cases where the owner has shown any capital appreciation whatsoever, simply because it is one of the facts of life in so far as rent-controlled premises are concerned that rent control removes the possibility of keeping the building in such a state that the potential for capital appreciation remains open. The practical effect of the rate of return allowed at this point in time is, as I have said, the cause why the more humane and vast majority of landlords simply sell out to the unscrupulous few who are prepared to take the necessary action to step up the return.</p>

<p>I should like to return to paragraph (h) of clause 1 which reads, &#x201C;by the deletion of the second proviso to the said definition.&#x201D; The object of this amendment is to remove a system of allowance whereby owners of buildings who had to pay a substantially higher rate of interest on a mortgage bond could include an allowance for such payment in the formula for calculating the rent. There were two conditions which applied to such an allowance. In the first instance it had to be a <i>bona fide</i> loan in the sense that it was from a third party and for a mortgage on the building and secondly, the Financial Institutions Act applied to it. I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention the fact that certainly in Johannesburg a fair number of buildings have been financed on three to five year money. The <span class="col_2089-2090" refersTo="page_1060"/>hon. the Minister knows as well as I do that interest rates go up and down, but certainly at the present point in time this will cause great difficulty when it comes to refinancing if such an allowance is not allowed, because then we shall be back to the unsatisfactory compromise which the hon. the Minister is trying to solve where the return on the building will be 8% whereas the landlord who has to borrow money will be paying in excess of 12%. It is when one faces this sort of reality that it becomes clear that what the hon. Minister is proposing to do is a compromise or a slight improvement which is going to be of no lasting satisfaction to either of the parties.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I am not going to cover the ground that we covered so well in the Second Reading debate by replying once again to arguments to which I replied during that debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point states that during the Second Reading debate he put a question to me to which I did not reply. I can remember him putting such a question to me, but apparently I overlooked it. My reply to his question is that when a building is neglected, the lessees may apply to the Rent Board for a reduction in rent on those grounds. There would be little point in the lessor applying a little limewash to the building after the application had been made. The Rent Board is able to allow a reduction in rent when buildings are neglected. There are other bodies, too, that may deal with the matter of buildings being neglected and may approach, the person responsible.</p>

<p>It can go as high as 2&#x00BD;%; that is the position. He has to satisfy the Rent Board. We may summarize the whole position as follows: If I were to accept the four amendments moved by the hon. gentlemen, I should have no choice but to delete from the Bill the withdrawal of permission for the charging of mortgage interest. That would be the least I should have to do. The hon. member for Green Point falls back on his 7% which is less than the percentage is at present. At present the average is 7&#x00BD;%. Now he is falling back on replacement value. I have indicated <i>ad nauseam</i> that Rent Boards have only made concessions in regard to a reduction in the value of capital. They have already made a concession in respect of the depreciation in the value of money. Now we are coming up with, something which is more stable and which Rent Boards, <i>inter alia,</i> may also take into account. Up to now, Rent Boards have been able to take cognizance of sworn statements and they will probably continue to do so. What can <i>a bona fide</i> sworn statement be other than a statement as to what that building is worth on the market today in the judgment of the appraiser, the man making the sworn statement? What else would it be? This is in the Act and Rent Boards can take it into account at this stage. I am not prepared to argue this point at length. I have already replied to the points raised. All that I can still say is that because it would be a disastrous step, I am not going to throttle people for the sake of the standpoint adopted, for whatever reason, by hon. members opposite. Owners who do not fall under rent control, too, are looking at what is being done in this Bill. I am not going to deter people or drive them away from the industry of the construction of dwelling units and consequently the four amendments are not acceptable to me.</p>

<speech by="#aronson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. ARONSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that he seeks to ignore the solutions advanced by the Opposition during the Second Reading debate. We are with him when he says that he wants to see the utmost development in respect of flats in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to deal very briefly with the hon. member for Tygervallei. The hon. member quoted my Second Reading speech out of context. I put the case of the landlord very, very carefully and I put the case of the tenant very carefully. I then suggested a solution which I said would be by way of Government concessions. I want to refer that hon. member to my Second Reading speech&#x2014;the reference is BB.l&#x2014;and I want to say that I am surprised <span class="col_2091-2092" refersTo="page_1061"/>at the hon. member for merely using part of my argument to bolster his own case which, I must say, was very weak. This surprises me even more because the hon. member is an experienced hon. member of this House. I am not going to recap what I said during the Second Reading debate because I shall not be allowed to do so. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister what he estimates will be the average percentage increase in rentals as a result of the increase to 8&#x00BD;% for the years 1975 and 1976 respectively. When replying, the hon. the Minister should take into account the change from cost of erection to replacement value, less depreciation. If the hon. the Minister is unable to indicate the average percentage increase that will occur, will he concede or agree that the increase in rentals in regard to pensioners and people with fixed incomes, will be far greater than he anticipates? What do these people now do for relief? The hon. the Minister will say that he can always amend the legislation next year, but the question arises how these people are to survive in the meantime until next year when they have to pay these increases during this year. Sir, we have made it clear that we believe that the landlords must get an adequate return on their investments, but we have also made it clear that this must not be solely at the expense of the tenants, particularly tenants in the lower income groups. The only equitable way out is for the Government to assist those tenants who are not in a position to help themselves. We suggested to the hon. the Minister during the Second Reading debate what remedies the Government could adopt. I get the impression from what the hon the Minister has said that he is so committed to this clause that he is merely going through, the motions with us here this morning and that he will not allow any substantial changes at all. Because of the definition of replacement value less depreciation, the Minister is virtually giving a blank cheque equating rentals to rising building costs. For the wealthy tenant, Sir, this will not materially change his way of life or his life style, but for the less affluent person it introduces an element of constant uncertainty. For the affluent person this means no security of tenancy whatsoever; that is the logical consequence of this clause, and the Minister is going to have to accept the responsibility in time to come. I predict, Sir, that after this measure has been enacted and this clause becomes law, the Minister is going to have many poor people on his doorstep looking to him for relief and that he will come back to this House next year to grant that relief.</p>

<speech by="#louw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat expressed the fear that the rent that will now be determined, will perhaps be too high for the lessee. But, Sir, if we read all the provisions of this Bill together, then it is very clear that an obligation is being imposed on the Rent Board to determine a reasonable rent, bearing in mind all the circumstances. Indeed, these are the words that are specifically used and in fact the whole tenor of this Bill is to that effect. Sir, taking all the amendments of the Opposition together, we get a very clear picture of what they would like. In the first place they want the interest rate reduced from the proposed 8&#x00BD;% to 7%, which is even less than the present 6% and 8% under the provisions of the existing Act. In other words, they want to insert a provision to the detriment of the lessor. In the second place they agree that mortgage interest should not be allowed, also to the detriment of the lessor. In the third place, where this clause refers to replacement value, they want to come back to the concept of construction costs, again to the detriment of the lessor. In other words, those hon. members are only championing the interests of the lessee, which in itself can be a good plea, but after all, one cannot simply blatantly ignore the lessor. Is he not the man who provides the accommodation; is he not entitled to a reasonable return on his investment? After all, one cannot simply ignore him and drive him out. Sir, the whole standpoint of the Opposition, as is also reflected in their amendments, is that the provisions of this Bill are going to be to the disadvantage of the poor and the widows who are supposedly going to be driven away now. But surely we know that there is no way of differentiating between the rich and the poor living in controlled flats and dwelling units. How many of the hon. members on that side who are championing the cause of the poor here do not live during the parliamentary session, in controlled buildings where the rents are low? Why do these rich people not make way for poor people? There is simply no method of distinguishing between the rich and the poor in a controlled block of flats. Sir, I fear that the Opposition is trying to make political <span class="col_2093-2094" refersTo="page_1062"/>capital out of this Bill. They want to project the image of people who look after the interests of the poor, but in the process they are forgetting about the lessor, the provider of essential accommodation, and in the process they are merely trying to recruit votes in a clever way because there are more lessees than there are lessors. As regards the amendments moved by the Opposition, I want in the first place, to discuss the amendment moved by the hon. member for Musgrave, namely, that paragraph (f) be omitted. Sir, what is the intention behind the increasing of this amount in respect of maintenance to 2&#x00BD;%. Surely there is only one aim, namely to encourage maximum maintenance to the benefit of the lessee who has to live in the building and to the benefit, too, of the lessor who has to see to his own interests. After all one must be reasonable. The lessor must be given the opportunity to do the necessary maintenance work. During the Second Reading, the hon. member for Sea Point voiced fears concerning the fact that this percentage was being increased by 25%, from 2% to 2&#x00BD;%. Earlier this morning he contradicted himself by saying that the index of the rise in building costs over the past ten years from 1964 to 1974 has risen by 150% as against the rise in the cost of living of 113% over the same period. It is for that very reason that the matter of the 2&#x00BD;% has been broached, because the rise in the price index for building costs has been so much greater than the overall price index. This 2% is a provision that dates from 1950. We know that under the existing Act it was calculated at a lower value because building costs had to be taken into account, and probably there is nothing that has risen faster and more today than the cost of these very items, viz. paint, construction material and the cost of wages. Now the important point here is that the Bill specifically states &#x201C;not exceeding&#x201D; 2&#x00BD;%. This is the whole key to this amendment, in other words, when one applies to the Rent Board for an increase in rent, on has to furnish clear proof of what one&#x2019;s maintenance had been over the preceding period of 12 months, and if one&#x2019;s maintenance was poor, one would only get 1% or 1% and if one was prepared to spend more than the necessary, one could apply for 2%, and if one was very lucky, in exceptional circumstances, where one had taken a great deal of trouble and incurred great expense, one could get a maximum of 2&#x00BD;%. But surely that is now in the discretion of the Rent Board and surely that is a reasonable discretion, that the man who always repairs his place so well should be able to get the maximum rate of 2&#x00BD;%, which, in the nature of the matter, is very low. Sir, the Opposition has not read the provisions of the definition in the Bill properly. They confine themselves to the word &#x201C;maintenance&#x201D; and repairs only, but what is stated in the provision in question? It states &#x201C;in respect of maintenance, repairs and depreciation&#x201D;. But so far, no one opposite has referred to this word &#x201C;depreciation&#x201D;. Now, Sir, perhaps you may say that this argument does not apply. But there is wear and tear in a flat. There is wear and tear of doors and of ceilings and of thresholds and of skirting boards. These are things one cannot replace as they become worn. One can only replace them when they give way entirely. In other words, what we have here is depreciation that occurs gradually and that cannot be measured immediately in terms of money, but which can only be included, eventually, in the determining of the value of the property. And then, too, one must bear in mind that there are certain improvements which an owner, a lessor, has to effect and in respect of which he is unable to claim a deduction for income tax purposes. If he is forced to replace his septic tank system with a proper sewage system, or if, perhaps, he has to tar surfaces which had not been tarred before, then that is specifically listed by the Receiver of Revenue as improvements and not repairs. In other words, in those instances he incurs expenditure to the benefit of the lesse, which he is unable to recover.</p>

<p>In the second place I should like to discuss the amendment introduced by the hon. member for Pinetown, namely that paragraph (g) be omitted. What is the whole intention behind this? The Opposition fears&#x2014;they have said so in so many words here&#x2014;that the lessor will be able to obtain additional rent in that he will be able to ask more for the supply of electricity than he would have paid to the municipality concerned.</p>

<p>What is the true situation? What we have here is not a situation in which the lessor is seeking additional sources of income. We have two situations here. The one is where the lessor has the choice of requesting the supplier of power to distribute the power directly. The second example is where the lessor may be obliged to receive the power in bulk. I can mention one example. In all the larger blocks of flats that are being built here in the Cape complex and that are being supplied with power by Escom, the lessor is obliged to receive power in bulk. In other words, the power is measured by one meter. He receives his account and he has to settle it. What must the lessor do now? He has to distribute the charge for power consumption. He is then given the opportunity to recover a minor additional amount. However, consider what he has to do in return! He has to read meters every month, send out his accounts, receive the money and then still run the risk of not being able to obtain the money in the case of occupants of flats having left. Then, too, there are the cost of administration, the entries and the time taken. All these things give rise to more problems than benefits. That is what he has to do to comply with the requirements forced on him by a body such as Escom that supplies the power. On the other hand this holds no disadvantages for the lessee.

<p>Mr. Chairman, my heart bleeds for the man who has to sell electricity at a profit and has this tremendous task of bookkeeping, reading the meters and keeping records. I honestly think the hon. member should try and get a job as a meter-reader in a block of flats, because he could certainly do better at that than at trying to understand a simple argument. I am sure he cannot really be as stupid as he sounded when he tried to make out that we were wanting to reduce the income of a landlord to 7% from the present 8%. Despite all the arguments he completely, continuously and deliberately avoided the fact that there is a new formula for calculation. That is the whole issue. The actual cost of erection is eliminated and a replacement value is introduced, a value which is far higher. Cannot the hon. member understand that 7% on a figure of R150 000 is more than 8% on a figure of R100 000? [Interjection.] The hon. member for Tygervallei seems to understand this but his hon. friend from Durbanville does not seem able to understand it. If the value increases, a smaller percentage on an increased value means more money than a higher percentage on a much smaller value. That applies both to one&#x2019;s return and to the maintenance figure of 2&#x00BD;%.</p>

<p>*Is the hon. member unable to follow this? On a doubled basis, the same percentage will bring in twice the money. If the percentage is decreased on a higher figure, one nevertheless receives more money. The tenant does not pay a percentage; he must pay a certain amount, for example R60 or R100 per month. This is a fixed amount.</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) records its deep appreciation for the thorough work done by the Commission of Enquiry into Universities as embodied in its various reports; and</li>

<li>(b) requests the Government to give effect, where possible, to the proposals contained in such reports.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_2097-2098" refersTo="page_1064"/>The terms of reference of the Commission of Enquiry cover a broad spectrum, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">To inquire into and report, in so far as universities for Whites in the Republic of South Africa and the University of South Africa are concerned, on the educational, academic, financing and developmental aspect of universities, and on any other matters which the commission may deem to be of importance &#x2026;</block>

<p>The terms of reference of the commission attest to exceptional insight and attest, too, to the high expectations entertained in respect of the commission&#x2019;s report. Everyone in South Africa places a high premium on the academic functions of our universities and the interaction of universities and community. We are all aware of the exceptional responsibility that rests on every university.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House should like to convey our thanks to the Government for the appointment of this commission. Furthermore we want to convey our sincere appreciation and thanks to the members of the commission for the very thorough, comprehensive end penetrating investigation that was undertaken.</p>

<p>A lengthy list of the persons and bodies interviewed by the commission is to be found in Annexures A and B. In conjunction with these, the commission made use of innumerable related reports and documents published both within and outside South Africa. The commission acquainted itself with all possible standpoints in regard to all aspects of universities. To my knowledge this report is the bulkiest which has been tabled since I have been in this House. The value of the report, however, does not lie in its length as such, but in the insight it displays, its thoroughness, its comprehensiveness and particularly in its objectivity. It was a radical investigation in depth and the consequences were accepted courageously and were processed. The conclusions reached by the commission were reached solely on the basis of the evidence submitted to it. In my opinion, this report is the most significant report on education published thus far in the Republic of South Africa. It will undoubtedly serve for decades and more as an extremely valuable document for interested persons and researchers into the matter of universities. I do not want to dwell on the members of the commission as such, but I do want to point out that three of the members are principals of universities&#x2014; two of Afrikaans-language universities and one of an English-language university. The other persons who served on the commission are persons who occupied or still occupy high posts and whose ability and integrity are beyond question. Above all, the chairman was a serving judge of exceptionally high status who compels universal respect in the exercise of this illustrious office. It is a great pity that the report was not unanimous, but that instead the principal of the English-language university found it necessary to bring out a minority report in regard to the main report, and refused to sign the interim report. The commission member in question did not want to identify himself with the recommendations contained in the commission&#x2019;s main report. He put it, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows: &#x201C;I cannot associate myself completely with chapters 3 and 4 of the report&#x201D;. Chapter 3 deals with the university, its nature, its function, its autonomy, academic freedom and so on, while chapter 4 deals with the relationship between the university and the State. In the nature of the matter it was undoubtedly difficult for the principal concerned to endorse a point of view different to that with which he had identified himself for many years. This point of view or outlook is expounded in detail in a brochure that appeared recently, viz. <i>The Open Universities in South Africa and Academic Freedom,</i> 1957-1974. His name appears on the list of the members of the Academic Freedom Committee. This committee existed before the commission was appointed. The principal concerned was already a member of this committee before being appointed to serve on the Van Wyk de Vries Commission. Evidently he already had fixed opinions before the commission heard evidence and formulated findings. I would deduce, therefore, that the principal was, to certain degree, prejudiced against any evidence that did not accord with his way of thinking. For this reason the minority report perhaps loses some of its effect and impact. In passing, one wonders whether it is purely by coincidence that this brochure appeared more or less simultaneously with the main report of the commission.</p>

<p>I should like to confine myself exclusively to the main report and select from it a few aspects which I regard as important. <span class="col_2099-2100" refersTo="page_1065"/>Initially, I want to express a few ideas concerning the high rate of failure among undergraduates. The commission gave a great deal of attention to this matter and suggested measures to combat this phenomenon. Through the years there have often been discussions in this House and this matter has been brought to the attention of the Minister. The high rate of failure at universities, among first-year students in particular, gives rise to concern in the circles and bodies that are concerned with this matter. Here I have in mind the parents, the students, the university and the State. Much of the State&#x2019;s contribution to a university student is lost and is wasted if the student fails. The average State subsidy per student per annum nowadays amounts to about R1 100 to R1 200, while it costs approximately as much for a parent to keep his child at a university. But apart from the wastage of money, a wastage of the spiritual and intellectual potential of human material also takes place. A great many students fail and leave the university, and in this way valuable potential is lost, whereas it could perhaps still have been developed at another tertiary level. Consequently, it is essential that there should be an easier transition between the university and other institutions at the tertiary education level, for example between the Colleges for Advanced Technical Education and the universities. The commission also gave a great deal of attention to this aspect and in another chapter of the report puts forward well-considered recommendations on the subject.</p>

<p>Many reasons are given for the high rate of failure at our universities. I do not intend to dwell on this for very long, except to refer briefly to a few of them.</p>

<p>It is often contended that the academic year at most universities is too short to allow the contents of the curricula to be dealt with thoroughly. In other words, it is maintained that the curriculum is being overloaded. From the report it appears that the academic year at some universities consists of 28 or 29 teaching weeks while there is one university with an academic year of 35 teaching weeks. I made inquiries concerning the length of the academic year at universities as planned for the year 1975. I shall only furnish the number of teaching days at the universities without mentioning the names of universities. The figure varies from 116 teaching days at one university to 164 at another. In between, one gets 133, 138 140 and 146 teaching days. In other words, there is a difference of 48 teaching days between the two universities with the highest and the lowest number of teaching days respectively. The question occurs to one quite involuntarily as to whether this also makes a difference to first-year results. According to reports at my disposal&#x2014;I do not want to expand on them &#x2014;this is in fact the case. It is evident from the report that the majority of universities are not really in favour of a general lengthening of the academic year, although they do think that the lengthening of the academic year in regard to first-year students only, would in fact be beneficial. The commission also recommends that the Committee of University Principals should investigate the reorganization of the academic year. The commission recommends that in cases where universities want to retain the usual academic year, serious considerations should be given to the period being extended for the first-year students at least. The commission is convinced that this would facilitate the transition from high school to university and that it would reduce the failure rate. I should like to endorse that standpoint very strongly.</p>

<p>Initiation or assimilation, about which we have heard so much at universities in recent times, and the time that is lost thereby, is also advanced nowadays as the cause of the failure rate. In a recent letter to members of Parliament by Professor E. M. Hamman, the principal of the University of Pretoria, he puts the following question in this regard: Consider how much encroachment on the study time of first-year students is caused by initiation, orientation and related troublesome practices which in some cases occur throughout&#x2014; please note, &#x201C;throughout&#x201D;&#x2014;the year. I, too, should like to put that question. It may be added that students miss many lectures and much study time owing to the organization of rags, rag processions, carnivals and all that this involves.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the students themselves are, in fact, the major factor contributing to the high failure rate at the universities. There are undoubtedly many students who are not ready for hard work and consequently their studies are neglected; this is also a result of excessive participation in social and other activities. There is sufficient proof that a large number of students who do have the intellectual ability, nevertheless fail owing to an imbalance <span class="col_2101-2102" refersTo="page_1066"/>between study and social activities. In the nature of the matter one does not have much sympathy with such students.</p>

<p>The commission goes on to furnish in its report, in the form of a table, the high failure rate at universities in 1962. This is, of course, somewhat out of date. Whether there has been any improvement in this state of affairs since then, is doubtful. I am convinced that the commission&#x2019;s report, in which the cause of failure at the universities has been put to our readers so pertinently, has in fact had, and will have, a positive effect on universities. To my knowledge it has never occurred in the past that principals have made use of the occasion of welcoming speeches to warn the new first-year students in such straightforward and frank terms. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 23 February this year I read, <i>inter alia,</i> the following under the heading &#x201C;University duds will get walking orders&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The rectors of three English universities in South Africa are making it clear that they intend taking a much tougher approach towards students who fail examinations.</block>

<p>The names of the three rectors are then mentioned: Sir Richard Luyt, Prof. Bozzoli and Prof. Stock. The report goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They have indicated that students who fail may not be allowed to continue study.</block>

<p>The newspaper then comments in the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The warnings and the general tightening up at universities are believed to be a direct result of the recommendations of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission of Inquiry.</block>

<p>At the Afrikaans-language universities, too, it is put to new students that they come to university to study. Prof. Hamman mentioned, <i>inter alia,</i> that various methods would be employed at his university to eliminate students who neglect their studies. In a speech he made to his first-year students, he went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The University of Pretoria is not a place for people who have come here with motives other than to study. There is simply no place for people who come here to play the fool.</block>

<p>The commission strongly recommends to universities that procedures be evolved to eliminate students who neglect their work. The commission goes on to recommend forcefully that the universities should have the right to terminate a student&#x2019;s registration at the end of the first semester on grounds of unsatisfactory academic progress. The commission points out that the Universities Act. 1955 (Act No. 61 of 1955) must be amended accordingly. I have already referred to chapter 3, &#x201C;The University&#x201D;. This chapter contains extremely interesting reading matter, particularly in respect of the autonomy of and academic freedom at universities. Through the years, the concepts &#x201C;autonomy&#x201D; and &#x201C;academic freedom&#x201D; have been discussed repeatedly in this House. Often the concepts &#x201C;autonomy&#x201D; and &#x201C;academic freedom&#x201D; are mentioned in one breath as if they are twin concepts or synonymous with each other. However, they remain separate concepts. Both have acquired emotional nuances over the past few decades, here and elsewhere. Not on here but throughout the world, people write about and debate on this matter. Even during the Fourth International conference of Universities held in Tokyo in 1969, one of the basic themes of discussion was this very concept of university autonomy. Each country has its own interpretation of the concepts &#x201C;autonomy&#x201D; and &#x201C;academic freedom&#x201D;, arising out of the history, traditions, social order and body politic of the country in question. Autonomy is bound up with the concept of &#x201C;administration&#x201D;. The university as such only has the power, or the right, to administer affairs in its own sphere, within the bounds of its academic function. Autonomy of the university means, merely, self-government of the university, which is a complex organization with its multifarious activities. All these activities must be controlled and administered and as regards such activities the university has the right of self-government, free of interference or regulation from without. The rights of the university are Qualified by the capacity of the university. Each university in South Africa is a comparatively autonomous State-supported corporation established by means of legislation. The university is an autonomous institution which can claim the freedom of its autonomy in order to make itself felt. However, it must realize its autonomy within its capacity as a university. Beyond that capacity it has no power, no rights and no autonomy. The university is definitely <span class="col_2103-2104" refersTo="page_1067"/>not a state within a state. It is only autonomous in its academic work, autonomous to indicate and maintain its own standards, its own spirit, its own direction and so on, but always limited to and in accordance with its academic function. When it exceeds those bounds and that limit, the university claims a freedom it is not entitled to and may possibly clash with the autonomy of the State. If it wants to acquire the autonomy of the State, there must necessarily be friction or conflict. The autonomy of the university cannot be absolutized, because the university derives its autonomy from the State. The commission states its findings with regard to the autonomy of the university in South Africa in the following terms (page 74 of the Report}&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By virtue of its nature and function and its establishing Act of Parliament, the university in South Africa has autonomy, or powers of self-government in respect of its affairs, free from extraneous regulation. This autonomy embraces every facet of the university, including the academic, the managerial and the administrative aspects. Nowhere in the world is there a university with absolute autonomy &#x2026;</block>

<p>I think that this has been put very clearly by the commission.</p>

<p>To give a concise, short and precise definition of academic freedom is certainly difficult. Academic freedom is interpreted differently from country to country, and from university to university within a specific country. The academic freedom of the student and of the lecturer at a university is derived from the nature and the function of the university. The freedoms are limited to the academic sphere, viz. to the capacity of that university. The academic freedom of the university consists of its ability to regulate, control and organize all the facets of its academic function in its discretion, without regulation by society or the State. Academic freedom is limited to and subject to the autonomy of the university. Surely it cannot be otherwise. Academic freedom cannot go beyond the wide content of the autonomy of the university itself. It is exclusively the English-language universities in South Africa that take the meaning and interpretation of the concepts &#x201C;autonomy&#x201D; and &#x201C;academic freedom&#x201D; to extremes. The over-emphasizing of the value of autonomy and academic freedom and the charge that freedoms and rights have been restricted, date from the days of the Extension of University Education Act of 1959. It is a known fact that since the passing of the 1959 Act, the English-language universities have given much prominence to this so-called violation of academic freedom. It is also being stated in respect of this legislation that the legislation &#x201C;is aimed at curbing the freedom of action of the university&#x201D;. Sir, it is since 1959, too, that certain English universities have held a day of commemoration for academic freedom Those universities have pledged themselves to an affirmation of academic freedom, an affirmation that involves the holding of an annual day of remembrance to commemorate the alleged violation of academic freedom and to renew the universities&#x2019; dedication to the struggle. Sir, entrants to universities are immediately acquainted with the affirmation or dedication. In the above-mentioned brochure it is stated, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">This dedication now appears in the university prospectus and is brought to the attention of all prospective members of staff, both inside South Africa and abroad.</block>

<p>Sir, the finding of the commission is that the dedication of the universities concerned to academic freedom and the over-emphasis of autonomy has a political cast. After consideration of all the evidence concerning academic freedom, the commission comes to the conclusion that the grumbling and the objections neither were nor are directed against the curtailing of academic freedom but, to quote the commission&#x2019;s words, &#x201C;essentially (concern) opposition to the political policy of multi-national development and the consequent establishment of non-White universities on an ethnic basis&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Gezina said at the beginning of his speech that the real value of the report lies in its objectivity, and at the same time he said, with reference to Prof. Bozzoli, that he was prejudiced. Sir, when it comes to the philosophical aspects of the report, I want to tell the hon. member that it seems to me as if the majority of the members of this commission were prejudiced and that I question their objectivity. It is obvious that the people who served in this commission definitely had to make great sacrifices to be able to complete <span class="col_2105-2106" refersTo="page_1068"/>their terms of reference; this we appreciate. Terms of reference which comprise 15 specific tasks and which demand a penetrating and thorough investigation could for obvious reasons not be carried out within a year or two. I therefore do not want to criticize the commission too much for the fact that it took five years to complete the report, but what I do want to do is to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, according to the information which appears on page 5 of the main report, it would seem that up to June 1972, i.e. for the first three years after he had been appointed, the Chairman was able to devote only a small part of his time to the commission&#x2019;s affairs, because he was engaged in a completely different investigation. Sir, this is a state of affairs which caused an unnecessary delay. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that, since we are dealing with such an urgent matter and since it is quite clear that it will be very difficult for a Chairman to devote his attention to the matter, I hope that we are not going to have a repetition of what has happened here. Something for which I want to express my deepest regret is the considerable delay in the making available to us, as members of the House of Assembly, of the various reports after they had been submitted to the Minister. We have been told that translating problems have caused the main report to be delayed for a year. Sir, something is seriously wrong with the Government if it takes a year to have one report translated, no matter how voluminous such report might be. It seems to me as if political reasons were responsible at various times for the delay in presenting these various reports. With regard to the second interim report dealing with student activities, we have had the excuse that it was held in abeyance until the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Organizations had released its reports. The fact remains that this second interim report was only received by us in February 1975, several months after the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Organizations had released its reports, while it was submitted to the hon. the Minister in September 1972. Sir, here we have to conduct a debate today on the contents and recommendations of a report which is based on quite obsolete particulars and information and other circumstances. It is said to be based on conditions which were supposed to have existed in the late &#x2019;sixties, early &#x2019;seventies at certain universities, conditions which are purely of historical interests and nothing else today. As far as I am concerned there are definite indications that a political issue was made of the second report, a fact which. I regret and condemn.</p>

<p>In the second leg of his motion the hon. member for Gezina requests the Government to give effect to the proposals contained in the report. I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the fact that various universities are at present giving attention to the various recommendations contained in the report and that, according to the information I have, the Committee of University Principals has neither submitted final recommendations to the Minister nor conveyed its views to the Minister. Therefore, in view of the wording of his motion the hon. member for Gezina is placing the hon. the Minister in an invidious position. I believe it will definitely be unwise for the hon. the Minister to indicate in his reply today that he is going to accept certain recommendations or reject them out of hand while he has not yet received the final views of the Committee of University Principals. It would be a severe rebuff for that important committee and it would be in direct conflict with the recommendations of the commission. I quote their recommendation with regard to the Committee of University Principals&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the State and the Minister should act with the knowledge of or consult the C.U.P. on all matters concerning universities and thus preserve the prestige and value of that body.</block>

<p>I believe it will be an unforgivable mistake if they are not consulted on this matter as well, particularly so in the light of the findings of this commission. I quote from page 142 of the English text of the main report of the commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the past the State (the Minister) has not consulted the C.U.P. or has acted without its knowledge on important matters concerning universities. This is harmful to the prestige of that body, diminishes its value as the only statutory channel between all the universities and the State &#x2026;</block>

<p>It would seem to me as if the second leg of the motion of the hon. member for Gezina is definitely presumptuous, and in order to state clearly the standpoint of the United Party in respect of this report I <span class="col_2107-2108" refersTo="page_1069"/>want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) takes cognizance of the contents of the various reports of the Commission of Enquiry into Universities;</li>

<li>(b) deplores the fact that there was so long a delay in tabling the various reports after they had been presented to the responsible Minister; and</li>

<li>(c) rejects without any reservation those findings and recommendations in the various reports which are in conflict with the principles of university autonomy and academic freedom and which infringe the civil rights of the student population.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>In any evaluation of the report it is important that we should take thoroughly cognizance of the fact that the only representative of an English-medium university who served on the commission to the very end, i.e. Prof. Bozzoli of the University of the Witwaterstand, was not prepared to sign the second interim report, and that he submitted a minority report particularly because of the inacceptability of the findings and suggestions of the majority as contained in chapters 3 and 4. On an analysis of the report one finds that unanimity was reached when the commission was dealing solely with aspects of education, administration and development&#x2014;which constitutes 90% of the main report. We on this side of the House have taken thorough cognizance of this fact. I can give the hon. the Minister the assurance that, if he should give effect to these recommendations after proper consultations have taken place with the Committee of University Principals or with other authorities which may be affected by these recommendations, authorities such as the Provincial Councils, he would receive a great deal of co-operation from us for the establishment of, for example, an Advisory Council on Universities instead of the present Advisory University Committee, which, according to the findings of the commission, is not functioning properly. The same applies to the idea of &#x201C;junior colleges&#x201D; the whole Question of the position of universities and other institutions for tertiary education and the relations between universities and professional councils.</p>

<p>&#x2020;However, I wish to state most emphatically that the hon. the Minister will get no co-operation from the United Party if he should introduce legislation or take any action which we regard as a violation of academic freedom and as an abrogation of existing rights. We will not tolerate any interference in the autonomy of universities and it will be to no avail for the hon. the Minister to use either the findings or recommendations of the commission to justify his actions. This applies, in particular, to the proposed legislation and the threats contained in the second interim report. These recommendations go much further than being a mere attack on university autonomy and academic freedom. They also constitute an unwarranted attack on the basic rights of citizens, a group of citizens in this particular case, i.e. the student population. In the view of the commission it is apparently quite legitimate for a group of young people who are not students &#x201C;to distribute leaflets and pamphlets which are calculated to promote a particular political aim.&#x201D; However, the moment this is to be done by a group of students, the action becomes a major crime. How ridiculous!</p>

<p>*We do not endorse the findings of the commission in respect of the concepts of &#x201C;autonomy&#x201D; and &#x201C;academic freedom of universities&#x201D;. Neither do we endorse the contention that the English-medium universities are &#x201C;supra national&#x201D;. We also do not accept the tremendous overreaction displayed against Nusas by the majority report, let alone the naive exoneration of the ASB by the commission. It is clear to me that the commission has become the victim of their own specific life and world philosophy, to such an extent that it was unable to come to the necessary objective conclusions in spite of the penetrating study they have made as far as these aspects are concerned.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Let me just give one example, i.e. on page 18 of the interim report. It is stated quite correctly:</p>

<block name="quote">It is the aim of ASB to promote Afrikaans culture by maintaining and fostering the Christian National Philosophy and view of life.</block>

<p><span class="col_2109-2110" refersTo="page_1070"/>I underline &#x201C;Christian National&#x201D; spelt with capital letters. It is then stated:</p>

<block name="quote">Nusas&#x2019;s approach is different. Its guiding principle is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations Organization.</block>

<p>This is quite correct. The amazing conclusion is then arrived at, however, that Nusas has the fostering of a specific political aim in mind, while ASB does not. Just imagine! No political connotation is attached to the fostering of Christian National philosophy! Do they really believe that the Christian National philosophy has not been and is not still the lifeblood of the Nationalist Party? Are there any hon. members opposite who can deny this? This is the conclusion of a commission which elsewhere in its report claims that it knows the South African society well. It knows it so well that it can condemn the attitude of the English language universities and their concepts as being based on a fallacy. It has found that Nusas&#x2019;s principles and policies bring it into conflict with the community, society and the State on almost every conceivable point. It dismisses outright the claim that the difference in outlook and philosophy of life is the reason for the fact that, for example, there has been student unrest at English universities and not at Afrikaans universities. If they really knew their South African society they would have realized that when it comes to the interpretation of concepts such as &#x201C;university autonomy&#x201D; and &#x201C;academic freedom&#x201D;, there is a difference between the English university and the community of which it forms a part and the Afrikaans university and its community, and furthermore, that this difference is a difference of basic philosophy. It is a philosophical difference. It has nothing to do with undermining the State. Instead of giving due consideration to this it condemns Nusas outright and arrives at a conclusion which depicts the English-language universities as being &#x201C;supra-nasionaal&#x201D; and out of line. We reject this conclusion.</p>

<p>In dealing with the nature of the university the commission is quite right when it argues that there should be a harmonious equilibrium between the university and the broader spheres of societal relationship&#x2014; the latter being the community in which the university is situated&#x2014;and the State. The commission, however, fails to take into consideration that this harmonious equilibrium has been disturbed in South Africa not by the universities but by the State, and not for academic reasons but for political reasons. [Interjections.] if the commission&#x2019;s recommendations were to be accepted it would lead to even greater disturbance of this equilibrium. The commission states that the concept of university autonomy and academic freedom cannot be absolutized into single universally valid truths. In order to overcome this problem it then proceeds to absolutize the policy of multinationalism as if it were accepted as a universally valid truth. How absurd! This policy is only something which is accepted within the philosophy of a certain political party, and it is not even accepted by all the members of that party. I think some of the members of that party are very reluctant to accept it when it comes to matters such as sport and the Nico Malan. By doing this &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>I studied it thoroughly. Having first stated that you cannot absolutize it into a valid truth, the commission then sets out to absolutize the policy of the Government as if that were a valid truth Then there is a certain amount of mileage for the members of the commission. By doing this the commission can then proceed to condemn, for instance, the annual reaffirmation of academic freedom at English-language universities and to reject their concept of academic freedom as being based on a fundamental fallacy. This then, is the charge of the commission. Instead of questioning the wisdom of the English-language universities of re-dedicating themselves to the return of their right, namely to admit students on academic merit instead of on race and colour, the commission missed a wonderful opportunity to restore the harmonious equilibrium between the State and the university by not pointing out to the State that it is the State&#x2019;s concept of academic freedom which is based on a fundamental fallacy.</p>

<p>Like Prof. Bozzoli I agree that the recommendations when read alone generally appear to be sound. However, read in conjunction with the findings one discovers the great differences and discrepancies. I am aware of the fact that the commission states clearly that academic freedom and university autonomy must be upheld etc., but it all depends on what their concept of <span class="col_2111-2112" refersTo="page_1071"/>that autonomy is. There is no point in coming here, as they do in their recommendations, and elevating that particular concept&#x2014;which I believe was not reached from an objective point of view&#x2014;and drawing attention to the insinuation that this concept of theirs is the only true and valid concept. I do not deny the fact that the State must have a say when it comes to the autonomy of universities. We recognize this. It has representation on their councils. I must object, however, when I find that the commission condones unwarrented interference.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to conclude my remarks on the concept of academic freedom and university autonomy by saying that as long as the Government continues to deny the right of universities to admit students on academic merit, we will not have true academic freedom in South Africa; and as long as we have undue interference with the appointment of academic staff, of which we had evidence some few years ago in the case of the University of Cape Town when a non-White lecturer was appointed&#x2014;so long will there be a question mark about the degree of autonomy which universities enjoy, and, of course. I want to add to this, as long as we find that a commission can condone such action.</p>

<p>I wish to return to the opening remarks of the hon. member for Gezina when he said that the real value of the commission&#x2019;s report lies in its objectivity. I have already stated that when it comes to philosophical matters, I doubt their objectivity, and that when it comes to political matters, I am quite sure that they definitely are not objective. Their apparent definition of &#x201C;political activities&#x2019;&#x2019; reminds me very much of the personal experience I had when I was a student at the University of Potchefstroom for Christian Higher Education. [Interjections.] Incidentally, that is where I gained my &#x201C;lewens- en wêreldbeskouing&#x201D;, and I would defend the right of the Potchefstroom University to exercise academic freedom according to what they regard as being true academic freedom. But after the 1958 election, when the Nationalist Party gained a great victory, we had a mass meeting of university students, some 1 000 or more, and at this meeting one of the senior students moved a motion congratulating the Nationalist Party on its great victory and in support of the policy of apartheid. It was still known as &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; in those days and not as the policy of separate development. Several speakers participated in this debate and they all spoke about the &#x201C;wonderwerk wat gebeur het&#x201D;&#x2014; the miracle which, had taken place&#x2014;and how this policy would keep the African in his place, until eventually I moved an amendment condemning the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid. I spoke for two or three minutes and then a point of order was taken by one of the senior students who objected to the fact that I was talking politics. [Interjections.] I must say that the SRC chairman in those days was Mr. Hennie van der Walt, the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke, and to his everlasting credit I will say that he overruled this objection and said that I was quite entitled to have my say and to give my reasons for being against apartheid. Apparently the majority of the commission members have adherede to the same view of what is politics. As long as you agree with the Government, it is not politics. That is how I can understand their views on the recommendations in regard to the Joint Matriculation Board. I realize, as they did, that there is a need for streamlining, but I disagree when they say that you should just have the Joint Matriculation Board catering for the standards of only the White people in South Africa. I believe that we should have, as we have had it since 1916, a Joint Matriculation Board looking after the standards for all the people of South Africa. In fact, all of us live and compete in the same sphere. But once you discover the line and the attitude of the majority of the members of the commission, you can appreciate their point of view. I discovered this on page 235, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission takes the line that in the special circumstances obtaining in South Africa it is essential that every White person should be trained to the maximum of his intellectual capacity and that there should be no artificial barriers to debar persons who are capable of university education.</block>

<p>Sir. I could use exactly the same phrases and say that every person in South Africa, irrespective of colour and race, should under the special circumstances prevailing <span class="col_2113-2114" refersTo="page_1072"/>here be trained to the utmost of his intellectual capacity. But, of course, the moment I did that I would be accused of participating in politics!</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban Central accused the members of this commission of prejudice. I want to say that if there was ever an example of blind prejudice, then it was the speech of the hon. member itself. Sir, there is another matter I want to lay at the door of that hon. member. When the members of the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Organizations were nominated in 1972, it was those hon. members who continually said that members of this hon. House could not be unprejudiced; that they could not do proper work in this connection and that the commission should be a judicial commission. Here was a commission which consisted of prominent academics, with a judge as chairman, and while I do not want to use the word &#x201C;scandalous&#x201D;, I think that it is very bad taste to say here that the members of that commission were prejudiced in their views. In my humble opinion the one great asset of this report is the clear exposition which, it contains of the autonomy of the universities and academic freedom. I think that it will be a standard work for many years. I think that the commission did outstanding work in this connection. It gives a very logical exposition of the academic freedom of universities and of the autonomy of universities, and it surprises one that that hon. young member, a product of the University of Potchefstroom, can cling to this holy cow with such blind prejudice. Sir, the views of that hon. member on academic freedom and the autonomy of universities are views which no longer exist anywhere in the world; they are views which date from the British liberalistic period. There is no logic in those views. Sir, we also believe in the academic freedom of universities, but within reasonable limits.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to associate myself with the moves and I want to express great appreciation to the chairman and the members of this commission for their hard work and for the outstanding work which they have produced for us, because I have reason to know that work of this quality and this volume of work cannot be done without great sacrifice and perseverance. I, too, should like to place on record my grateful appreciation for the work of the commission. It is a penetrating piece of work and I believe that it will remain an authoritative, guiding source of reference for many years in respect of universities, not only for the State but also for the universities themselves. Sir, the terms of reference of this commission, as has already been said, cover a wide spectrum in connection with the universities. Some of the aspects were obviously contentious; therefore one can understand that some of the findings of the commission will also be controversial and that everyone will not agree with them; this is obvious. But, Sir, it is none the less a pity that there are individuals and newspapers that attempt to discredit this positive piece of work. The pattern which we get on that side of this House is the normal well-known pattern in connection with reports of this nature when people do not agree with them. Sir, do you know why they do not agree, and why the hon. member and the English-language press and the principals of English-language universities do not agree with it? Early in its report the commission made one finding which is like a red rag to a Jersey bull to those hon. members and their press, and that finding, one which rests on facts and on reality and which is irrefutable, is that the unique characteristic of universities in South Africa is that they have developed within a social order based on the principle of multi-national separate development. That is an objective finding which the commission made; it rests on facts. That is the reason why hon. members disagree with it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>The English-language Press and the United Party which take them in tow when it suits them, and the English universities have placed themselves with blind prejudice and great obstinacy on the negative road of integration and multi-racialism, and they are removed from the reality of South African Sir, they must come to their senses.</p>

<p>I should like to comment on two aspects of this report, but before I do that, I should like to select a few other recommendations and deal with them briefly. In the first place I want to say that the recommendation that an amount be included each year in the Budget which can <span class="col_2115-2116" refersTo="page_1073"/>be used for scholarships to attract prominent academics from abroad to come to South Africa to do research at South African universities into aspects of national importance, is a very important recommendation. I should like to see that it is implemented as soon as possible, because if we can attract foreign brainpower here to come and do research into matters of national importance, perhaps we shall be able to reap the fruits of this. Another recommendation which I should like to support is that the functions of the Commitee of University Principals be extended and that they should have a central office with a full-time secretariat. I think this is an important recommendation. Another recommendation which I should like to support is that university lecturers receive training in didactics. Perhaps we made a mistake in the past by putting people with the higher academic qualifications in front of a class of students without such lecturers having the least knowledge of methodology or didactics. The commission could not find a definite link between this fact and the high first-year failure rate, but they also state that these two facts cannot be completedly isolated from each other, and that there is possibly a link between them. Therefore I hope that we shall support this recommendation in the future. The recommendation that the Universities Advisory Committee be expanded and converted into an Advisory Council on Universities is a very drastic recommendation. The recommendation involves the appointment of a full-time director and two full-time assistant directors and that this body serve as a sort of adviser to the Minister. I am not completely satisfied that I should support this recommendation. I do not know if it will be right to place such a new hierarchy between the universities on the one hand and the Minister and his department on the other hand. I have my doubts, and I think that this demands proper consideration before it is put into operation.</p>

<p>Now I come to one of the most important aspects of the commission&#x2019;s report. That is the college idea, on which I should like to express a few thoughts. The commission complains rightly about the existing rigidity of our universities. If one takes into consideration the progress in the structure of a university from the Middle Ages to today, then one sees that the commission does perhaps have reason to complain that there is rigidity. The commission says unambiguously that the modern university may never be static, otherwise it becomes stagnant. The university must absorb new knowledge timeously and it must even anticipate it, but the university must also be flexible and pliable. Even its physical structure must be pliable so that it can execute its academic function easily. The commission sees the university as a leader in the field of all education; but especially, says the commission, the university has a particular leader&#x2019;s function to fulfil in the field of tertiary education. In our country education, and consequently the university at large, has a particular calling, viz. to develop every individual to his full potential according to his aptitudes and interests. In this task we cannot afford or tolerate any waste. I think that we all agree with that statement. To achieve this objective, the university must be able to provide a wide spectrum of differentiated training and it must have a special system at its disposal with convenient bridges and crossings. Therefore the commission foresees that the university of the future can take the form of a university with colleges within its own structure, but also surrounded by colleges of various forms, linked to it in a variety of ways. The form of theses colleges is not inflexible, and a great variation is possible. Each college will have its own council and its own academic body, and therefore it will also have to have representation in the senate and the council of the university. The commission is of the opinion that the college idea provides a practical pattern of development along which the university can develop a wider capacity for service to the whole community, and as a result of which it will be able to set its sights ever higher in the service of the community. My own opinion is that this idea is fairly drastic in the light of our present university set-up although the college idea is not completely new; there are similar organizations elsewhere in the world. Nevertheless it is very interesting to me, because it offers dynamic possibilities for development. Should it be accepted, I believe that it could put our universities on an extremely functional and meaningful road. Should these proposals of the commission be implemented to their full consequences, it could lead to all tertiary education and training becoming equal in status in due course. This <span class="col_2117-2118" refersTo="page_1074"/>will prevent one type of educational institution, one type of certificate or degree, having higher status or more snob value than another. Obviously it will lead to all forms of tertiary education coming under the wing of the university in due course. If we carry this college idea to its logical consequences, it actually means that the training of teachers, being tertiary education, will also have to take place under the guidance of the university in due course. The present position is that teachers for secondary schools are trained by universities and teachers for primary schools by colleges and universities. But, in terms of section 1A(3) of the National Education Policy Act, the training of teachers for primary and pre-primary schools must be done by a university and a college in close co-operation with each other, from a date determined by the Minister. After a reasonably broad motivation, the commission finds that section 1A(3) of the National Education Policy Act, is totally incapable of implementation. I must say that in so far as I have had experience of this close co-operation at the University of Port Elizabeth, it has been a success so far. At that university close co-operation takes place. But the commission is of the opinion that it is incapable of implementation and I do net want to argue with them about this. Therefore the commission is of the opinion that all existing training colleges must be associated with the universities, as internal or external colleges, and that the university and its colleges must be responsible in future for the training of all teachers. The college idea, as it affects the training of teachers, obviously does not preclude co-operation between the provinces and the particular universities in the future. However, it must be recognized that the college idea, as it is now being propagated here, may be interpreted as a continuation of the old institute idea, which was accepted roundabout 1967 by many people as the ideal solution for the training of teachers, but which was rejected by others at the same time. At that time it caused a fairly unpleasant fight throughout our country. The outcome at the time was the nomination of the Gericke Commission which submitted a compromise report which gave rise to compromise legislation.</p>

<p>I want to accept that the provinces will not be very pleased about relinquishing their colleges. In all fairness, I can understand their standpoint to a very large extent. I only know the position in the Cape Province, where there are seven training colleges scattered across its vast expanses. Each of these colleges has built up a very long and proud history. Those colleges are held in very high repute in their communities, especially because of the exceptionally high quality work and service which they provide. To forego control over institutions which have been developed over many years with so much pride and singleness of purpose into model institutions for the training of primary teachers in particular, will certainly not be easy. The provincial education departments into whose care the schools in the various provinces are entrusted, have been careful in selecting students and lecturers at their colleges in the past, so as to employ the right people at those colleges. Since doubt exists concerning the religious and cultural values of some universities one can understand that there will be a degree of unwillingness among the provinces to entrust the training of teachers to the universities.</p>

<p>If the report of the commission is accepted and the colleges idea is also accepted, one probably has to accept that it will be possible in due course to find a formula for co-operation between the university and the provincial administration concerned in the training of teachers at a college. Although such a college will be associated with a university, the provincial administration can obviously still play a very important role in the college, also as far as the selection of students and staff is concerned. I believe that the provincial education departments will still be able to exercise influence in the pliable structure of a college. This will contribute to the good characteristics of the present training colleges being carried over into the university as well as into the associated colleges in which teachers will possibly have to be trained. An exchange of staff between the university and its college can take place as well and an exchange of students can take place as well so that all the students will be able to enjoy the advantages of attending a university. At the University of Port Elizabeth we already have the system of universities, which amount to a number of small universities developing around a central campus. By making use of this system, and because the association will be very loose, colleges in the rural areas such as those in <span class="col_2119-2120" refersTo="page_1075"/>Oudtshoorn and Graaff-Reinet can be developed into universettes of full status and such a rural community can consequently gain by accommodating a small university and not merely a college.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to elaborate any further on this matter. I think that it is an interesting idea which certainly requires further investigation, and which justifies consultation between the provincial authorities, the Minister and the universities. It is certainly an idea which can be considered seriously.</p>

<p>In conclusion I come to the second aspect of my speech and this second interim report which deals with the non-academic activities of students. It is this part which had to endure the most cutting criticism from the English-language Press and which has also been described by certain principals of English-language universities as &#x201C;preposterous, incredible and Draconian&#x201D;. The mere fact that this report is regarded as an overreaction, even by some of the Afrikaans-language newspapers, shows precisely what effect the reports of the Schlebusch Commission and the good strong medicine which followed them, brought about. Therefore I consider it essential that this report, too, be seen in the right perspective, because it was drafted in the circumstances which prevailed in 1972 when we had large-scale unrest and student demonstrations at the English-language universities. It was a dangerous period for South Africa, and hon. members on that side who sat with us on the Schlebusch Commission, agreed that these people wanted to overthrow the State and the existing order. At that time drastic steps were necessary. This second report was drafted in the light of those circumstances and therefore some of its recommendations are no longer relevant today. However, it is good that the Government has such a report which was drafted by prominent academics with a judge as chairman, so that if those circumstances were to arise again, the Government would be able to step in immediately and administer the right medicine.</p>

<p>I want to say that I do not agree with the report of the commission as regards its recommendation that all politics be removed from the campuses. I cannot see how we can have our young people, the cream of our youth, the best brain power, living in a political vacuum for five years at a university. The very thing the Schlebusch report says is that where Nusas is also active in politics, especially subversive politics, it had a monopoly on the campuses of the English-language universities and it is recommended that other political parties also be allowed there and I should like to agree &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I do not agree with the United Party, I adhere to the Schlebusch Report. I want to conclude by making an appeal today to the English-language universities, their principals and their controlling bodies. We have now had two reports by two prominent groups of people. A group of members of Parliament with the present Speaker as chairman, and a group of prominent academics with a judge as chairman of the other. The findings of these two commissions with respect to the whole spirit and atmosphere prevailing at English-language universities were virtually unanimous and of the same tenor; that they allow themselves to be led by the nose by Nusas with a steel ring welded by that organization.</p>

<p>I think that it is high time that our English-speaking people realize that we no longer live in the 19th century in the period of British liberalism and British imperialism. It is high time that these people should realize, whether they like it or not, that they are living in the second half of the 20th century and that the Republic of South Africa is their fatherland. They must also realize that they have a meaningful role to play in this fatherland. We do not want them to be Nationalists. But where are the young people, the products of those universities, sitting in this House? They are not here. Do you know where they are? They have fled the country or they are banned. The young men who are sitting there are all products of Afrikaans-language universities. As a result of this negative, nihilistic view of life which is nourished at those universities &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not going to reply in detail to the speeches of the hon. members for Algoa and Gezina, but I should just like to say that it is significant that the hon. member for Algoa links the spirit of the second interim report of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission with the Schlebusch Commission. I hope that the official Opposition will take note of the way in which this linkup has been made. It is true that in the main report there is much evidence of hard and thorough work by the commission of inquiry, especially on the financial and academic situation of the universities. The main report manifests a concern for the desperate situation in which the universities find themselves financially and it tries to make certain positive suggestions in this regard. If this were all one had to consider, obviously I do not think there would be any objection to supporting the motion of the hon. member for Gezina. This partial evaluation, however, is completely overshadowed by both the tone and the nature of the recommendations of the second interim report. When I reject this motion I do so with the second interim report in mind, as well as Chapters III and IV of the main report read in conjunction with the second interim report, which provides the main conceptual framework in terms of which the eventual recommendations were made. If one keeps Chapters III and IV and the second interim report in mind and one has read both in conjunction with each other, one can come to no other conclusion than that the logic is so tortuous and so obtuse that it is almost incomprehensible in some places. One cannot really find a clear-cut and logical argument. Therefore I must disagree with the hon. member for Algoa and say that there are many contradictions in this report.</p>

<p>That the second interim report is tendentious and contradictory in its analysis, that it is biased in its observations and that, in the last analysis, the recommendations are pernicious to the normal functioning of universities, I have no doubt in my own mind and I hope to prove these accusations as follows. As regards the tendentious and contradictory nature of this report, I want to mention four major contradictions which run right through this report. The first one is that there is a basic logical fallacy in the report where it consistently confuses the legal personality of the university as a corporate entity with any subsection of that particular university. This comes out clearly on pages 70 and 71 of the second interim report where the logic seems to be that the political activism of a Nusas minority equals student activism, equals student politics and equals the university&#x2019;s involvement in politics. Therefore the university as a legal corporate entity must be penalized. If the same questionable logic were to be applied to Afrikaans and Black universities, I think we would find rather startling results. The second contradiction is where the report with laborious logic which would even make the Dutch philosopher Dooyeweerd who appears to be the philosophical father of this kind of reasoning, blush with embarrassment, tries to distinguish between the different spheres of competence between the State and the university. Having done so and having paid generous homage to the autonomy of both the university and the State, it destroys this very distinction that it has made in its recommendations. There is no more autonomy left if one has to implement the recommendations of this report, especially those in regard to the relationship between the university and the State. In a sense the report then says that the university has to become responsible for public order and public peace and not the State. In terms of its own logic the State is responsible for maintaining public order and peace, but now in terms of these recommendations the university has to take over these functions. Apart from the fact that the report tries to justify this in terms of an abnormal situation&#x2014;no evidence is provided that there is an abnormal relationship between university and State&#x2014;this is a gross insult to the Government of the day. What is abnormal? If one looks for any relevant evidence in the report one finds that the report simply falls back on its own distinction between the State on the one hand and the university on the other. Then it destroys this distinction with its own recommendation. That the logic of this report is tendentious, and dangerously so, is manifested in the fact that it consistently equates the State with the Government and the Government with society. This is a very crude but also very effective way of establishing that the only political ideology in a society that is natural, right and reasonable, <span class="col_2123-2124" refersTo="page_1077"/>is the one supported by the governing party of the day. This is a pure and simple case of ideological authoritarianism. There is no other way of looking at this. I can give a quote from the report which spells this out very clearly. On page 23 of the second interim report it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the first place Nusas&#x2019;s policy always leads it into conflict with the Government; all legislation and any action by the State in any matter relating directly or indirectly to the policy of racial separation is described as an act of violence, In the second place, Nusas is continually in conflict with society as a result of the foregoing, but this is not so strongly emphasized in its public resolution.</block>

<p>There we have it, Mr. Speaker: &#x201C;State&#x201D;, &#x201C;government&#x201D; and &#x201C;society&#x201D; are considered one and the same thing. They are consistently used in this way in the analysis throughout the report.</p>

<p>A final and equally dangerous contradiction that I would like to mention is that the report consistently confuses the structure of an organization with the personnel manning it at a particular point in time. This applies to the university as a structure and to the people who work at the university at any particular point in time. The same mistake appears in regard to the analysis of Nusas. This kind of mistake is tantamount to saying that because a man beats his wife we must destroy marriage as an institution. This is ridiculous, but the report consistently uses this kind of logic. These examples of tendentious and contradictory arguments, used in the report in order to justify the recommendations, in no way can give one any confidence in the nature and validity of those recommendations. This lack of confidence is compounded by the biased observations one finds in the report, especially when English and Afrikaans speaking universities are compared. Eventually one cannot help but come to the conclusion that this is mainly an attack on the English speaking universities and particular organizations within those universities. [Interjections.] I would like to prove this. The main thrust of the second interim report is an attack on Nusas. From pages 17 to 19 the report compares Nusas with the ASB. Both have more or less the same structural set-up and both play a role connected with politics. On page 18 it is said that the striking difference of approach between Nusas and the ASB is that Nusas aims at playing an active part in politics, not only on the campus but also in society as a whole. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The published papers of the ASB give every evidence of study, research and reflection and are therefore activity in the &#x201C;academic manner&#x201D;; and the actions and publications of the ASB refute the accusation that it is a slavish follower or instrument of a political party.</block>

<p>I am coming to that point right now, and the hon. member is also involved. Using the same criteria as the report on what constitutes academic and non-academic activity of student organizations, I claim it is arrant nonsense to say that the ASB does not play an active part in politics, in society as a whole, that it does not support any particular political party and that its papers are simply evidence of study, research and reflection. If the ASB does not play any active part in politics and society, how do we explain the fact that on 8 April 1965 6 000 ASB students marched down Church Street in Pretoria proclaiming their support for apartheid with placards saying, for example: &#x201C;Geen bont gehore nie?&#x201D; This led an Afrikaans newspaper to comment: &#x201C;Die Studerende jeug van Suid-Afrika staan vierkant agter sy leiers en sy tradisionele lewenswyse. Dit is onteenseglik bewys deur die massa-optog van sy studente.&#x201D; [Interjections.] As a matter of fact, the person who was president of the ASB at the time happens to be the hon. member for Geduld. In a publication to commemorate the 25 years of existence of the ASB, the present member for Rissik, who was president of the ASB in 1961 and 1962, had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Waiter moeite het die ASB gedoen om hulle binne die party hoorbaar te maak voordat hulle die kongres van bevriende organisasies gekies het om die party se beleid oor &#x2019;n sentrale en hoogs sensitiewe saak te verwerp?</block>

<p>*The editor went on to say that the ASB was a pressure group and that it was being influenced by lecturers from outside and by older politicians. The editorial is available to everyone. To me this is obvious evidence that the comparison between the ASB and Nusas is a biased one.</p>

<p>I should like to dwell on the whole question of student protest. Evidently this is the crucial difference between the ASB and Nusas. Nusas students evidently protested.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The whole question of student protest and student action appears to be a very emotional one in South Africa. What are the dry, neutral facts available to us? If we look at the 1972-&#x2019;73 student unrest in Cape Town, we find that between 1 June 1972 and 21 May 1973 206 people, the vast majority of them students, were arrested for either contravening municipal by-laws or provisions of the Riotous Assemblies Act. Of these 206 people, 45 students acknowledged guilt, admitting that they had contravened municipal by-laws. One stood trial and on appeal had to pay a fine of R20.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I wrote it myself, man. I have a mind of my own. The State, however, withdrew charges against 160 people who were arrested and the Minister of Police had to pay R10 000 in damages and costs to 12 of these people. By 1974 the Minister of Police announced that R34 250 had been paid out in out-of-court settlements to students.</p>

<p>*Surely, it is clear that one should not become over-emotional about the actions of a few students. However, I want to come to the recommendations themselves.</p>

<p>&#x2020;What do these recommendations really imply? In chillingly blunt language the report prefaces its specific recommendations by saying (page 78) that:</p>

<block name="quote">New means and procedures should be woven into the existing structure of universities.</block>

<p>The prefacing remarks continue:</p>

<block name="quote">It considers it essential to recommend a persuasive measure calculated to encourage university councils to make use of these measures of control and to exercise their authority.</block>

<p>If this Government accepts this kind of thinking, and implements the recommendations flowing from it, it will simply be a case of the Government forcing the universities to do the dirty work which the Government is not prepared to do. No university English. Afrikaans or Black, can tolerate such interference and still be proud to call itself a university. The report makes these recommendations after implicitly admitting, on page 77, that in terms of existing legislation the Government has blanket powers to cope with any form of public unrest, disorder and subversion, and yet it proceeds to recommend that despite these awesome powers, the structures of the university must be impinged upon in such a way that the universities must act on behalf of the Government in punishing a small minority of students which from time to time displeases the Government. This is hysterical reasoning of the first order. I am persuaded that this second interim report was written in a spirit of panic, exactly as the hon. member for Algoa said. The hon. Minister will be ill-advised to take its recommendations seriously. I wish to plead with him to ignore these recommendations for I am convinced that if he should consider them seriously, the consequences would be disastrous, not only for all the <span class="col_2127-2128" refersTo="page_1079"/>universities in our country, but also for this society.</p>

<p>*When we look at this report, I think it is very important that word &#x201C;abnormal&#x201D;, when it is used as a comparison between university and State, should be used with utmost circumspection when we look at truly abnormal circumstances which prevailed in South Africa during the Second World War and during the 1914 rebellion, we find that prominent leaders in our society today, made speeches at that time which would make Nusas seem pale in terms of the overthrow of order and in terms of violent revolution. What action did the Government take at that time? Did it take similar steps? No, should we now go and change the whole structure of universities because there is a group of students who are fired by revolutionary romanticism? Surely this is an absurdity! The chairman of the report never even looked at the situation during the Second World War and the 1914 Rebellion. There we have comparative evidence of the situation in a society when abnormal circumstances prevail. But in this report we have no indication of what &#x201C;abnormal circumstances&#x201D; are. Merely minor things said by small groups of Nusas are quoted and as a result of these people are frightened out of their wits, whereas, if they had to be frightened out of their wits in 1914 and in 1939-&#x2019;45, what were to have become of this society? Therefore I want to say that we need a greater sense of responsibility at this moment than what we find in this second interim report. We dare not destroy the structures of our universities just because there are people who look at a situation with hysterical reasoning.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are witnessing a tragic occasion today. The hon. member for Rondebosch, who is opposing the motion, and the other hon. member, who introduced an amendment, are letting a golden opportunity slip. They could have availed themselves of the opportunity of conducting a penetrating discussion on a report which was prepared over a number of years. This report has exposed the dangers which threaten our universities and has unhesitatingly stated the case as it should be stated. Even where the State&#x2019;s contribution is too small, this is mentioned. Criticism is not reserved for one side only, but is freely expressed in all directions. In addition, equal treatment for all universities is advocated, specifically in regard to financial formulas and student fees. What response do we get to this? We simply get negative criticism, criticism which is not constructive in any way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch referred in passing to Dooyeweerd. He did not say whether he understood Dooyeweerd or whether he agreed with him. He suggested that this report was really doing away with the spheres of life advocated by Dooyeweerd and pointed out here. Prof. Bozzoli did not differ as far as the financial recommendations were concerned. He singled out chapters III and IV in his minority report, but he supported the financial recommendations. These, however, are in fact based on the various spheres of life, on the functions of the State and the functions of the university. The hon. member should read the report again. It is quite clear that in taking his stand on university autonomy, the hon. member is in fact recognizing the spheres of life in which the university moves. How can he say now that he does not accept it? After all, he is taking his stand on it!</p>

<p>Now the hon. member says that it is inviolable. The family is also a sphere of life: the father, the mother and the child. One enjoys a reasonable degree of freedom in one&#x2019;s dealings with one&#x2019;s child, but if he were to murder another man, the State would interfere in that sphere of life. The same applies to universities. I should like to know the view of that hon. member and of the hon. member for Berea regarding the stage at which the State may interfere. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>I am asking those hon. members at what stage interference in a university should be allowed. Do they mean to suggest that the autonomy is such that a student&#x2014;whether he belongs to a minority or to a majority group&#x2014;may do as he likes on a campus? Do they mean to tell me then that there is interference every time? Where does one draw the line? In other words. Sir, this second interim report has discussed the climate, it has discussed the sterility of political conditions on certain <span class="col_2129-2130" refersTo="page_1080"/>university campuses and has related this to Nusas, amongst other factors. This commission has come to the conclusion that this is the method it recommends for combating that situation. The hon. member for Potchefstroom, the hon. the Deputy Minister in front of me, was a member of a commission which has reported, and in that report we have found the climate and the idiom in which Nusas operates. However, the method we have decided on for combating this is different. Sir, the hon. member for Durban Central therefore agrees with the hon. member for Rondebosch that the report should be rejected in its entirety, but as far as the facts of the situation are concerned, he and his caucus have come to the same conclusions in regard to Nusas. How on earth can he come along now and reject the report in its entirety? Why does he not tell us that he accepts the climate and the idiom which the commission has found to exist in respect of Nusas, but that they disagree with the method, as was said by the hon. member for Algoa? The hon. member for Algoa said that he did not agree with the idea of banning politics from campuses, and I do not agree with it either. In fact, Sir, I was instrumental in getting political parties allowed on the campus of the University of the Orange Free State. I believe that our young people should grow up in the responsible climate of parliamentary politics and that is the difference; that side propagates and stands for the development of politics outside the parliamentary structure, and they are inspired by motives which will cause this Parliament to disappear. This is what they advocate and this is the real difference, and the hon. member for Rondebosch cannot deny it.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is a pleasure to me to support this motion which has been introduced, specifically because we have been given a penetrating discussion of the financial conditions at our universities. To begin with, I want to point out at once that drastic changes have already been made as a result of the interim report which was published in 1969. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban Central creates the impression that there have been no changes and that this report was futile. But what are the facts? The interim report pointed out to us that the State&#x2019;s contribution was smaller than it should be, and as a result of that report, which was not tabled, that contribution was increased from 64% to 73% of the income of the universities. The situation in other countries was also examined. The percentage which is at present being contributed to university expenditure in respect of teaching costs, the salaries of lecturers, etc., amounts to 74,4% of a university&#x2019;s income. For this reason I want to allege that this interim report, although it was first published as far back as 1969 and has only now been tabled, has had a beneficial effect on our universities, so much so that all the universities have grown tremendously since 1969. But hon. members on that side of the House pay no heed to this tremendous growth at our universities. Our universities have blossomed. It has been possible for them to plan for the future. It has been possible, on the one hand, to judge in advance what the duties of the State would be, and it has been possible, on the other hand, to make provision for the rapid growth in student numbers which was to be experienced during that period. In spite of this the commission said that in respect of teaching costs, an <i>ad hoc</i> situation would apply up to 1972. For the future they advocate a more efficient formula. The formula they advocate in respect of teaching costs calls a number of principles to mind.</p>

<p>The first principle which comes to mind here is that we must do away with the subsidized course as the criterion, according to which the university is subsidized. In its place they suggest the student as a numeric unit. It is quite clear what this would lead to. The moment we have the student as a numeric unit, instead of being dependent on the subsidized course as such, universities will no longer be able to load their degrees with courses just for the sake of the subsidy they get, i.e. on the basis of the number of students who follow subsidized courses. The student will then be counted as a unit. I want to dwell on this for a moment and point out that the commission proposes that an undergraduate student should count as one unit, honours students as two units and students studying for master&#x2019;s degrees and doctorates as three units. But there is a time restriction attached to this principle and that time restriction will ensure that those students do not stay at university any longer than they need to. In this way it is being proposed that the State contribution for undergraduate students should continue for two <span class="col_2131-2132" refersTo="page_1081"/>years more than the minimum period in respect of three-year or four-year courses, and for three years more in the case of longer courses. Honours students are counted for only one year for the purposes of State contributions. The meaning of this is very clear, and that is that it will no longer be possible for &#x201C;loafers&#x201D;, with respect and in quotation marks, to stay on at universities for while the State&#x2019;s contribution may eventually vary between 75% and 85% according to this formula, it means that if the university allows such students on the campus, students it has to support, its subsidy for them will eventually be withdrawn; it will not receive a State contribution for them and this will mean that it will have to support them from student fees. Which student&#x2019;s fees? Those of the students who do their work. Then you will see, Sir, that the students themselves will interfere and see to it that those loafers are removed from their campuses. For that reason I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether there is any prospect of this very interesting recommendation being accepted. I understand that it is subject to changes. Some of its elements or components may be altered, but the principle is very important, for this will remain unalterable and, as I have said, it will have that very important advantage. I may add in parentheses that we have already heard of university principals admonishing their students to pass their examinations.</p>

<p>Sir, this brings me to capital financing, which is also a very important facet of university financing. Another result of the interim report is that 85% of capital expenditure is being redeemed in so far as interest and redemption is subsidized.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to come to the point at once by telling you that the principle which, was particularly important here was that the commission accepted that the State is responsible for preparing its citizens for the future. The principle was accepted that society should contribute to university financing by means of taxes. The principle that was kept in mind here was that future generations would also enjoy the advantages of a well-planned university with sufficient capital and of the people who would be trained by it. For that reason the premise is that the State should render generous assistance in this regard, and for that reason this commission says that for the present, capital expenditure should remain the way it was, but that in future buildings and land should be financed by the State in their entirety. It goes on to say, in respect of the existing debt and loans, that these should be redeemed from a fund to be established by means of a contribution of R50 a student. This fund will also help them to defray future capital expenditure which is not State-supported. This, too, appears to me to be a very interesting idea. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister is able at this stage to let us in on his thinking in this regard, but I should very much like to see this idea being developed, precisely because it would ensure stability.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the possibility of universities being subsidized by means of Government securities issued by the State. Something of this nature should be possible, especially if the universities were to invest their surplus funds in Government securities. At the moment they are investing their surplus funds in pension funds and insurance companies. If they were to invest them in Government securities, they might pay a much lower interest rate than six months ago, for example, when a loan had to be negotiated at the maximum interest rate of 12%. They would then be able to obtain a lower interest rate on a competitive market from time to time.</p>

<p>There remains only the question of the financing of residences. The commission was very honest about this. It said that it did not have sufficient information at its disposal and recommended that the financing and nature of residences should form the subject of another thorough investigation. I believe that it would be a good thing for the financing of residences to be thoroughly investigated, for this is where the bottle-necks in the future development of our universities will probably occur.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the problems which one has with this motion is that so far the speakers on the Government side have certainly not indicated which recommendations of both the second interim report and the main report they actually support and to which ones they object. So far we have only had an indication that in respect of the operation of political parties on campuses there are at least two members on the Nationalist Party side who are not in favour of that. The mover of the motion presumably is, because he asked for the whole of the recommendations, where possible, to be implemented.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Therefore, already it is clear that there is a slight difference of opinion. What we are entitled to know before this debate is finished is which of the recommendations contained in these two reports the Government is prepared to accept and which in fact it rejects. I think this is the very least one can ask for in a debate of this nature. The time that is available to debate a report of this magnitude&#x2014;the main report comprises 528 pages and the second interim one 90 pages&#x2014; makes of course our task an extremely difficult one.</p>

<p>The game was in fact given away by the hon. member for Algoa because he quoted what is the most important finding of the whole report, viz. that unique characteristic of university existence in South Africa is that they have settled into shape in the social order based upon the principle of multi-national separate development. What the hon. member for Algoa and members on the other side will not accept, is that the concept of multi-national separate development is rejected by at least 40% of the White population and by the bulk of the Black population of South Africa. This is a fact they must accept. The decisions which were made to have separate universities in South Africa, the decisions in terms of which Black, Coloured and Indian people, except for very limited exceptions, are excluded from White universities were decisions to which 40% of the White population in South Africa were not a party. They oppose that concept while people at the English universities make it quite clear that they do not agree that that is the correct approach to university life in South Africa. That is really the reason why there is this attack on the English-speaking universities, and not only by hon. members on the other side. There is a thread which runs through this report and which characterizes English-speaking universities as though they were not part of South Africa and are trying to go their own particular way. I want to say here today that as far as the English-speaking universities of South Africa are concerned, they have rendered a service to South Africa. They have projected an image of freedom of speech, they have projected an image of being dedicated to academic freedom and university autonomy and they have projected an image of a high standard of academic teaching and research. All of these things have brought credit to South Africa as a whole. I do not derogate from what Afrikaans universities have done in many fields, but they are not the ones continually under attack. It is the English-speaking universities that are persistently under attack. In this regard I want to refer to the remarks concerning Prof. Bozzoli. It was alleged that he had preconceived views and that the publication of a document on open universities was not coincidental. In his regrettable ignorance, that hon. member is unaware of the fact that that is in fact a re-issue of a publication which was issued many, many years ago. In fact. Prof. Bozzoli did not decide the date of publication of that document. It is quite clear that this is once again an attempt to smear a man whom I think should be held in high esteem in South Africa. I believe that the Vice-Chancellor of the University of the Witwatersrand is an outstanding academic, an outstanding university administrator and a man who stands for freedom of speech and freedom generally in South Africa. The attempt to smear him in this fashion is an act which I think is reprehensible in the extreme.</p>

<p>I would like now to deal with some of the matters arising from the second interim report. Surely a student and a lecturer should be regarded as a citizen in exactly the same way as any other citizen? Surely he should be entitled to equality of treatment? I want to quote in this regard from page 83 of the Second Interim Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Universities. I want to quote this so that there can be no misunderstanding about the point I am making. I want to quote the last paragraph of section 23.3. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The result would therefore be that a student demonstration or pamphlet campaign without prior permission from a magistrate would be unlawful.</block>

<p>What about the number of demonstrations held and pamphlets distributed by people who are not students? Why should students be treated differently? Why should they not be trated the same as everybody else? There should be no more provisions in respect of one section of a community than there are in respect of any other section of that community. In our respectful view, what should happen is that the relationship between students and their lecturers and <span class="col_2135-2136" refersTo="page_1083"/>universities should be governed by the normal rules of contract and it should be left to the university to decide upon the contents of that contract. Their relationship with the State should be governed by the normal laws of the land that apply to other citizens. I venture to suggest that if we look at the picture of student behaviour in South Africa over the years, particularly over the years during which the Nationalist Party has been in power, we will find that if we compare the behaviour of the students in South. Africa&#x2014;and here I refer particularly to the students from English-speaking universities because their behaviour has been singled out&#x2014;it compares very well with the behaviour of students in overseas countries. In fact, they have in many cases acted in a responsible manner.</p>

<p>There is another issue I want to raise, viz. the question of extra-parliamentary opposition. On page 73 of the second interim report of the commission, the following statement is made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are concerned here essentially with a political movement, an extra-parliamentary and therefore unconstitutional political opposition &#x2026;</block>

<p>With great respect, the mere fact that there is action which is extra-parliamentary does not mean that that action is unconstitutional or unlawful. There are many demonstrations and expressions of opinion by newspapers and individuals. There are all sorts of organizations that are entitled to express their views on important matters in South Africa and, provided that their actions are not unlawful, there is no reason why those actions should be prohibited; in fact, those actions should be allowed. We talk about the political party issue. We suddenly find here now that the Nationalist Party is concerned that political parties should not be banned from campuses. How can you stop people who have a particular political point of view, which is a legitimate point of view, from expressing it merely because they do not belong to a recognized political party? They are entitled to do so as long as their actions are lawful and as long as they do not act in an improper way. There is no limit to the examples one could give, if only one had time, to show that the ASB has expressed political views and that it has participated in actions which cannot be excluded if this type of thing is to become law.</p>

<p>There is one last matter which I want to deal with. Reference is made to the system of communication between the students and the university authorities. I venture to say that the SRC system which exists in South Africa is, when compared with other countries, as good as most and in fact better than most.</p>

<p>Lastly there is the threat of the withdrawal of financial support. I believe that to use State subvention as a means for the State to impose its policy goes utterly and fundamentally against university autonomy and the right of people to be educated at universities. It is an undue threat with which one cannot agree.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to come back to the two hon. members who served on the Schlebusch Commission and who have participated in this debate. I want to say that one regrets their attitude and their half-hearted attempts to deal with the recommendations of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission which are directly opposed to the recommendations of the Schlebusch Commission. One can understand their position, because they are now faced with a motion from a colleague and they are not in the fortunate position in which you, Mr. Speaker, have been placed, which is, if I may use the words of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission, a &#x201C;supra party political position&#x201D; where you are therefore not able to be called upon to deal directly with the issue which is before us. What we have before us today is evidence that when this Government, in dealing with the problems with which we are faced&#x2014;we dealt with them on the Schlebusch Commission&#x2014;finds that certain things do not fit into their pattern of indoctrination and their policy in the university sphere and elsewhere, they are prepared to do a double somersault and to run away from the recommendations they made previously. The members of the Schlebusch Commission should be prepared to stand up and say unequivocally today that they reject the motion of the hon. member for Gezina, who wants the acceptance of recommendations aimed at curbing the political activities of students, recommendations which are directly in conflict with the report they have signed. Let me go further in the time that is available to me. This commission of inquiry, the report of which we are discussing this afternoon, claims to believe in university autonomy <span class="col_2137-2138" refersTo="page_1084"/>and academic freedom and it says so in its report. Then it proceeds to say that that freedom and academic autonomy should not only be determined within the laws applicable to all citizens for the maintenance of law and order, but must also conform to the servile acceptance of the political philosophies of the Nationalist Government. That is their attitude towards academic freedom and university autonomy. Let me go on further. The commission obviously states on one page that it firmly subscribes to the right of protest of any individual as well as the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of association, but it immediately goes on to prohibit student participation even in pamphlet campaigns and in what it calls political demonstrations which might not be in keeping with what the Government would like to see. They say that these activities should not only be punishable by fines on the universities, but that they could be passed on to the students by the university authorities.</p>

<p>The commission finds that SRCs become the tools of Nusas. The evidence which we had was completely to the contrary. I need only give one quote which appears in the fourth interim report of the Schlebusch Commission where Prof. Dugard made the following significant remark:</p>

<block name="quote">The presence of Nusas was in any case not felt on the campus of the University of the Witwatersrand.</block>

<p>Let me quote an extract from his evidence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I might just add that the presence of Nusas was not felt on the Wits campus at all. If one looks for a student policy, one looks for the local SRC. The Wits local office is almost a nonentity.</block>

<p>Now the commission finds that the SRCs are contaminated by Nusas and that, therefore, Nusas must be banned as an organization. Let me just refer briefly to what was said on this matter by the Schlebusch Commission which had become the Le Grange Commission by the time this report came in. Let me refer, first of all, to the position in regard to student activity outside of purely party political activities. We found no reason, for instance, to complain against students who, motivated and within the law, turn their attention towards matters such as inadequate wages and certain other aspects of industry in South Africa. We have no objection to that. In fact, as members of the commission we said that it was the duty of the Government to see to such matters and that there would then be no need for this type of protest to draw attention to this country. We did not find that that was something that should not be done. What we did say was that, when such occasions were utilized to foment strikes or disturbances, they were proceeding beyond the legitimate activities of students participating in politics. We went further to say quite categorically that not only should political activities be permitted on the campuses but that it was highly desirable that that should be so. I quote from page 515 of the report:</p>

<block name="quote">The commission is of opinion that the political activities of recognized political parties should also be allowed on campuses on an equal footing with other groups, and recommends that all authorities concerned with this matter should devise ways and means of making this possible, with due regard to the laws of the land.</block>

<p>We felt it was desirable that students should not be isolated from the actual politics of the country by not allowing party political activities on the campuses.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of the banning of Nusas, I just want to conclude by quoting our findings. The hon. member for Algoa suggested that the second interim report of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission was produced in the heat of the moment, but in fact that report was dated almost contemporaneously with the second report of the Schlebusch Commission. What did we say in that report? I quote (p. 31, para 23):</p>

<block name="quote">Your commission wishes to stress that in bringing out this report it has in mind action against individuals and not against Nusas as an organization. In its report to Nusas itself your commission will make certain recommendations on the organization as such, but your commission deems it necessary to state at this juncture already that, on the information it has at present, it will not recommend the banning of this organization. A national students&#x2019; organization functioning from, through and for students is certainly desirable.</block>

<p><span class="col_2139-2140" refersTo="page_1085"/>Two hon. members who were members of the commission spoke this afternoon and it appears that they have changed their political attitudes in that they were not prepared to condemn outright the suggestions contained in this second interim report of the Van Wyk de Vries Commission that Nusas should be banned from the campuses. I know the hon. the Minister will do what is required in the time he has at his disposal. No doubt he will keep talking until the time for the debate has elapsed so that he can thereby save the Minister of Indian Affairs who is not here, the Deputy Minister of the Interior and the hon. members for Algoa, Pretoria Central, Schweizer-Reneke, Cradock and Bloemfontein West the embarrassment of having to vote against the motion of the hon. member for Gezina.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members will probably not expect me, in the 20 minutes that remain for me to reply to this debate, to deal with every argument that has been raised. That would be simply impossible. The hon. member who moved the motion, the hon. member for Gezina, described the report of the commission as the most significant educational report which to his knowledge had ever been submitted to this House. I want to agree with him that it is indeed an extremely important report. As far as that is concerned, the hon. member was certainly not exaggerating. I want to thank him for having moved this motion and for having motivated it in the way he did. I have already expressed my thanks in writing to the chairman and members of this commission and to those who co-operated with it, but I am glad to have this opportunity of doing so in this House as well today. I think that thanks are due to this commission, not only from me as the responsible Minister and from the hon. member for Gezina as the person who moved this motion, but from all of us in this House. I must say that I deplore the fact that the hon. member for Durban Central, who introduced the amendment, did not express any appreciation for the commission&#x2019;s work. The closest approach to appreciation was what was said by the hon. member for Rondebosch in respect of the financial investigation which took place. Sir, we are dealing here with a really comprehensive report. The hon. members who took part in the debate explained how much time had been spent on it. In the report itself we find particulars of the modus operandi. Every single person who approaches this matter in an objective frame of mind must be impressed by the gigantic task performed by this commission and kept up over a period of almost five years. For this reason I expect us all to have appreciation for the work done by this commission. That does not mean that I expect us all to agree with everything that report contains.</p>

<p>This brings me to the second part of the motion, where the Government is requested to give effect, where possible, to this report. It seems to me that all the Opposition speakers simply ignored that &#x201C;where possible&#x201D;. The hon. member for Yeoville, who left after he had made his little speech, insisted that before we adjourned today I should say what the Government was going to do about this bulky report. I want to ask him in his absence whether he expects the Government to take the decisions on its own. In other words, I take it that he is opposed to any consultation with the universities.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I have no hesitation in accepting this motion. The Government will continue to give attention to it and to do what it considers to be necessary and in the interests of our universities. I now want to reply to the question: Where do we stand in regard to this report? Sir, I want to tell you that only one single chapter of this report has been dealt with, and it was dealt with after the Government had given all the universities every opportunity to comment on it and after consultations had been held with their financial officials. Only the recommendation concerning the new formula for subsidizing has been dealt with. The Government has accepted it, and that is really my reply to the hon. member for Bloemfontein West. That formula for subsidizing has been accepted and has even been improved upon in certain respects, as far as the figures are concerned. I do not have time to go into the details, but in the light of inflation and circumstances which have arisen, the Government has made certain adjustments to the figures in the favour of the universities. I think this will be proved by the money we are going to appropriate in the Budget.</p>

<p>It is the easiest thing in the world, of course, for a speaker to take his cue mainly from the English-language newspapers, which attacked this report on the grounds of chapters III and IV and on the grounds <span class="col_2141-2142" refersTo="page_1086"/>of the minority report, to study those few chapters, and then to talk about them in this House. But, Sir, if one considers this report objectively, one will see that the next step which should be taken is to consider the recommendation that the University Advisory Committee be converted into an Advisory Council on Universities with new functions, with new powers, and with more facilities available to it. That is the starting-point. It is mentioned over and over again in the report that that body is to be consulted in connection with these matters. We are dealing with this at the moment. If we make sufficient progress, we may amend the Act even during this session to submit the new constitution of the Advisory Council on Universities to Parliament. Until we have done that, we cannot give effect to any other aspect of this report. In the meantime, however, the universities could do a very great deal themselves if they were to take this report to heart and to examine themselves to see where improvements can be made. The hon. member for Algoa, for example, argues that lecturers should be trained in didactics. This is not something we want to force on the universities, but I think that the universities should nevertheless give serious attention to this idea. If we really want to combat the failure rate, this is one of the aspects we could most certainly consider.</p>

<p>There is one other aspect to which the universities could give serious consideration in the meantime, and I want to lay great emphasis on this, namely the increasing tendency for university councils to abdicate their duties and powers, often to the senate and often to student bodies. I want to make it very clear that the university council is the responsible body as far as the administration of the university is concerned. It must ensure that it does not abdicate its powers by making all kinds of concessions, whether justified or not. We shall have to go into this matter.</p>

<p>Now, what is the basis of the criticism we have heard here today? If we state it in simple terms, without going into detail, it is quite clear that the criticism is based on the minority report of Professor Bozzoli. What is really the phrase to which all this criticism refers? Professor Bozzoli wrote the following in his minority report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the findings is that a unique characteristic of university existence in South Africa is that it is founded upon a social order based upon the principle of multi-national separate development.</block>

<p>I repeat&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; one of the findings &#x2026;</block>

<p>and I absolutely deny that this was a finding of the commission. I want to ask the hon. members who spoke on this to do their homework better. I say that this is not a finding of the commission. It is a description by the commission of the factual situation as it has existed in South Africa in recent years. There is no question of a finding to this effect. I want to read out a paragraph to you, for I think that this is a gross misrepresentation of what was said by the commission in this regard. I think, too, that the hon. members who adopted that standpoint have slighted the judge and his commissioners in doing so. I want to read to you what the judge himself said during a radio interview in connection with this commission&#x2019;s report. He said on 3 November 1974&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The statement that this was a finding of the commission is devoid of all truth. The report of the commission is available and nowhere in this report will anyone find that the commission has come to a finding in regard to this point. The whole attack in the Press and by others against this commission is based on this fallacy that the commission has made that finding. It is untrue. But I want to say something further about the attacks on this commission. To say of this commission, a commission which has spent some years deeply studying the question of universities, that they have come to the final conclusion that all the principles concerned should be brought in line with the programme of a political party is a blatant insult.</block>

<p>Sir, I think that these hon. members really owe this honourable commission an apology. This was the basis of the biased and negative criticism which has been expressed here on the work of this commission.</p>

<p>Sir, the second point of criticism was based on the charge that certain parts of the commission&#x2019;s report interfered with the academic freedom and the autonomy of our universities. I want to say that that charge is completely unfounded. Sir, the commission in fact recommended that the <span class="col_2143-2144" refersTo="page_1087"/>autonomy and the academic freedom of the universities should be watched over, and it recommended that the universities should reflect on those concepts, because they are concepts on which people may differ. In fact, no court in the Western world has yet given an acceptable description of academic freedom. The commission clearly says: &#x201C;You should go home and reflect on these concepts.&#x201D; In actual fact not only the commission, but some of our universities accept that no pressure is being brought to bear on the universities to move in this direction. Sir, I want to show you the pressure that is brought to bear on a man who has the courage to approach this report objectively. I quote from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 24 November 1974, in which an attack is made on Prof. Stock&#x2019;s comment on this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said this week that the report had taken cognizance of the different ideologies in South Africa and had not recommended the placing of any undue restraint on the autonomy of universities.</block>

<p>Sir, do you know what the heading of this article is?</p>

<p>Professor Stock is out of step.</p>

<p>That is their standpoint. I see that the hon. member for Rondebosch is looking at his voters on the gallery. I noticed that he was talking for the gallery in many respects. This man was not speaking for the gallery when he used the words I have quoted.</p>

<p>Sir, wh,at is the crux of this criticism? The hon. Opposition&#x2019;s interpretation of autonomy and academic freedom is simply based on their opposition to separate universities. We had that here repeatedly. Some of my colleagues also referred to it. The hon. member for Yeoville said in a previous debate that every university should have the right to admit whom it likes, to appoint whom it likes, to teach what it likes, the way it likes. This is a very narrow concept of university autonomy and academic freedom. But while this is the point at issue, I want to emphasize here and to make it quite clear on behalf of the Government that as long as the National Party is in power in South Africa, there will be separate universities, not because we want to discriminate on a racial basis, but because for many people in South Africa the separate universities have opened doors which used to be closed to them. These much-vaunted open universities of which we have heard, which have also published this booklet to which the hon. member for Gezina referred, did admit a number of non-White students before the 1959 Act, but it was nothing but what I have described before in this House as window-dressing. Of course they did make a contribution with the people they trained, but the Bantu, the Coloured people and the Indians never really came into their own on the university level. It is this Government which has created that possibility by means of separate universities. For that reason I say that these universities which are grouped together in this way had better keep their academic freedom lectures and have a day of mourning for this matter once a year. As long as the National Party is in power in South Africa, we shall have separate universities and we shall enable everyone to develop his abilities to the full on university level.</p>

<p>I now come to the second interim report. Sir, you will remember what the circumstances were in 1972. That was the time when there was fairly widespread student unrest in South Africa. We had debates on those matters in this House during that time, during February and May 1972, and on both those occasions I made the Government&#x2019;s standpoint and mine quite clear. I said that the Government&#x2019;s standpoint was that it expected every university to set its own house in order. The hon. members will remember that I said that. And I said that they should remember that if they were not prepared to do so, if they were too spineless or did not have the courage to do so, they should not expect the Government to watch with folded arms while things went wrong at our universities and in the country as well. In that atmosphere I requested the Van Wyk de Vries Commission, on behalf of the Government, to publish an interim report on student activism. That report is this second interim report which was published in September 1972. About the same time, during the same session of the House of Assembly, the hon. the Prime Minister proposed here that a Commission of Inquiry into Certain Organizations be appointed, and the Schlebusch Commission, as it was later called, commenced its activities. When it appeared that the work of these two commissions had to a large extent overlapped, the Government took no decision on that second interim report, and you will remember that any steps which were subsequently taken <span class="col_2145-2146" refersTo="page_1088"/>arose from the report of the Schlebusch Commission. In the first place there was the restriction of the eight Nusas leaders and in the second place an Act was placed on the Statute Book, the Affected Organizations Act. Nusas was declared an affected organization and its sources of finance abroad were consequently cut off. Sir, this is where we stand at the moment. No decision has been taken on anything in this report, except for the first point in connection with the formula for subsidizing. I have said that we expect the universities to set their own house in order. My hon. colleague, the hon. member for Gezina, referred to speeches made by certain principals of English language universities, speeches made before first-year students. I want to tell you that I welcomed this. I have a cutting here from a speech which, was made by the principal of the University of Cape Town, in which he said, amongst other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This university is no anarchist community. We have no Draconian discipline, but no society can live healthily unless rules are adhered to. Sir Richard also warned new students that there would be no &#x201C;on-going&#x201D; place at the university for students who did not attain certain academic requirements in their first year.</block>

<p>He went on in that vein. I say that I welcome this, and if the universities were to put into effect what they are saying here&#x2014; for I want to say quite honestly, Sir, that this is the first time I have seen such outspoken standpoints so widely expressed by principals of the English language universities &#x2026;</p>

<p>I know of several other students, strings of them, who are still doing first-year courses but are making no progress. I want to say, Sir, that I welcome this proposed action.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of withholding the subsidy, and I want to tell the hon. members who spoke about this that it is not a phenomenon which is confined to South Africa where so-called authoritarian action is taken. In America, at the time of the student riots there, they thought along the same lines. There was a Gallup opinion poll in this regard. I am not referring now to a Pegasus opinion poll. A Gallup opinion poll was conducted, according to which 84% of the public demanded that the subsidy to universities be reduced. You know what my standpoint was. I stated it in 1972, namely that by withholding the subsidy, one would be punishing the guilty as well as the innocent, and that one should therefore think twice about the matter.</p>

<heading>CO-OPERATION AMONG AND ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES IN AFRICA SOUTH OF THE SAHARA</heading>

<summary>(Motion)</summary>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I move the motion printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House emphasizes&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) the desirability of greater co-operation between the countries of Africa south of the Sahara in the political, economic and social spheres; and</li>

<li>(b) the necessity that the Republic should play a more significant role in giving practical and controlled assistance to emergent nations.</li>

</ol>

<p>I believe that this motion is one of the few non-controversial motions which will be brought before this House this year, for I am convinced that not a single member of this House is indifferent to the two points contained in the motion. Consequently I want, at the outset, to make it very clear that I have great appreciation for the steps which have been taken, and which still are being taken, by the authorities and by private bodies, to bring about greater co-operation <span class="col_2147-2148" refersTo="page_1089"/>between South Africa and other African countries and to render assistance to other States in Africa. I am also aware that the Government is involved in a considerable number of matters which fall into this category, but in respect of which it is not deemed advisable to make public announcements or invite public discussion. As responsible South Africans it is our duty to recognize the delicacy of the situation, and not to attempt to embarrass the Government.</p>

<p>At the outset I want to associate myself with, the ideas expressed by the hon. the Prime Minister in his speech in the Senate, last year on 23 October, when he stated, <i>inter alia</i> the following (Senate Hansard, 1974. vol. II, col. 3336)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When we take a look at Africa, all of us know that it is a developing continent, that on that continent are to be found countries in various stages of development, that there is probably a tremendous potential in the way of unexploited ore and raw materials, but that it is to a very large extent still unprospected. Apart from its probable potential, it is also a fact that this of course also brings problems in its wake, that it has a very high growth rate as far as its population is concerned. If one should want to draw up priorities for Africa, taking this into consideration, then I think hon. Senators will all agree with me that the highest priority one could set for Africa today would be development. That is what it needs most: Development which could result in work opportunities for its growing population. If the reports on certain countries of the world derived from authoritative world sources are read, however, then I think you would also agree with me that one of those priorities is food for its people, for food is becoming a problem in this world in which we are living. If you were to ask me, or anyone else for that matter, what Africa&#x2019;s greatest need is, then it goes without saying, because it has to develop and cannot at this stage generate the capital for that development itself, that capital for development, capital for exploitation is necessary. In the second place I believe that everyone would also agree with me that what is necessary is knowledge to guide that development and knowledge so that Africa can train its people to occupy their rightful place in that course of development.</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister continued in this vein and went on to say that South Africa harboured no aggressive intentions against any country in Africa, but wanted to extend the hand of friendship and assistance. At the end of his speech, he added the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Therefore I also believe that it is not inappropriate that Southern Africa can create its own, not U.N. but P.P.D., which will stand for Peace, Progress and Development.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the meantime all of us have taken cognizance with appreciation of the role which the hon. the Prime Minister has played, and still is playing, to bring about a measure of relaxation of tension in die Southern African situation and to place relations between the Republic and certain other countries in Africa on a sound basis. We are aware that this is an extremely difficult task, and all we can do is hope that his efforts in this regard will be crowned with an increasing measure of success.</p>

<p>The question of inter-territorial co-operation with and the rendering of assistance to African countries should of course be seen against the broader background of the world-wide division into rich and poor nations, into technologically developed and underdeveloped peoples, a division which to a considerable extent&#x2014;not in an absolute sense but unfortunately&#x2014;also coincides with the division into Whites and non-Whites. That most, of the countries of Africa fall into the category of poor, underdeveloped and indigent peoples is of course general knowledge. A further factor in this regard is the fact that the underdeveloped countries of the world are involved in the ideological struggle between the free Western World and the communist dictatorships. Obviously we in South Africa also bear the responsibility of contributing as much as we are capable of, or are allowed to contribute, in this regard. Of course there is a direct correlation between our contribution in this regard and the extent to which we are isolated, particularly on the African continent. As we know the earlier picture was more positive, as is apparent from the role which we played in the CSA and the CCTA and also, previously, in some of the agencies of the U.N. I do not at this stage wish to deal with the causes of the estrangement between the Republic and most of the countries of Africa, except to emphasize <span class="col_2149-2150" refersTo="page_1090"/>that South Africa will only be able to play its role on this continent satisfactorily if it is possible for a new relationship to develop between us and those other African States. In my speech today I want at a later stage, to concentrate primarily on the question of whether there are any possible new initiatives which South Africa could take in this regard both on an official as well as on a non-official level. For the sake of perspective it is perhaps essential to refer briefly to the measure of co-operation which already exists between South Africa and the other countries in Africa, and to the extent to which we are already rendering assistance. From the nature of the case I cannot go into this matter in full details, but I am in fact doing this to demonstrate that we on this side of the House are thoroughly aware of the fact that co-operation and assistance does exist.</p>

<p>On various occasions we have in fact been informed in regard to this matter by the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as well as by other hon. Ministers. Only the day before yesterday an hon. Minister informed this House of the assistance the S.A. Railways is rendering to Mozambique in respect of their railways and harbours. As far as diplomatic liaison is concerned, we have official relations with Malawi and Rhodes&#x2019;a, while direct channels of communication also exist with the BLS countries&#x2014;particularly with Lesotho and Swaziland. We also know that liaison on the non-public level also exists between our Government and certain other governments. This appears <i>inter alia</i> from the recent visit of the hon. the Prime Minister and other members of the Government to Zambia and Liberia, and from the visits of persons from some African countries to South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs informed us last year for example that in the year ending 31 July 1974 there had been 24 Heads of State or Ministers from Africa who had had contact with the South African Government, and that there had been official liaison with 12 countries. In addition there had been 144 visitors from Africa to the Republic who had been involved in official discussions, while ten African countries had been visited by members of the South African Government. Apart from that, 145 South African officials had visited other African countries. This is quite an impressive picture.</p>

<p>We are of course aware of the customs and other financial and monetary agreements and measures between the Republic and the BLS countries, and of the fact that financial assistance, mostly in the form of aid in respect of particular projects, is being rendered. With aid in respect of particular projects I mean, for example, the loan to Malawi for the construction of Lilongwe and the technical co-operation in respect of the Ruacana scheme in the Kunene as well as the Cabora Bassa scheme. These schemes were only possible because South Africa extended its co-operation in respect of such schemes, and indicated its willingness to take large quantities of the power generated. Obviously this applies in respect of the development of the Oxbow scheme and the scheme in Swaziland. We can accept that South Africa rendered financial assistance in the form of loans to other African countries as well. I think it is generally accepted that sound assistance should usually not to take the form of direct donation, but that it should rather be given by way of loans in respect of an approved project. It is a known fact that many African countries feel sensitive in regard to the acceptance of direct financial assistance, even if it is by way of a loan, and that they prefer to accept assistance in an indirect manner.</p>

<p>It is also a known fact that in spite of the absence of contact on a diplomatic level, South Africa frequently renders assistance of a technological nature to other African countries. I do not want to go into details, but we are aware of the role which our officials and scientists are playing in this regard. We are aware of the considerable and mutual dependence in respect of the use of railways, harbours, telephone communications&#x2014;both within as well as outside South Africa&#x2014;and of our marketing machinery as embodied in the South African Wool Board, the Citrus Exchange, and so on. We are also aware of the efforts to promote tourism on a regional basis and of the growing trade traffic, the result of which is that the Republic could achieve a favourable balance of payments position. In addition to that we know that South Africa is playing an important role in that it is providing relatively large numbers of labourers from Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland and fewer from Botswana, Malawi and Rhodesia, with employment. We are familiar with the latest developments. We are also aware of the part private South <span class="col_2151-2152" refersTo="page_1091"/>African financial and business institutions are playing in the economic development of some of the African countries. However, it is clear that what we have done so far, or were allowed to do, actually falls far short of what is required if we bear in mind the requirements and the need of Africa, as well as the necessity for penetrating and wideranging action if South Africa, particularly its White population, wishes to develop a sound relationship with the rest of Africa. Obviously South Africa&#x2019;s resources and its ability to render aid are not unlimited. For that reason great expectations and obligations also rest on us in respect of the supply of services to our own non-White groups and in the development of homelands. South Africa is today, owing <i>inter alia</i> to the high gold price, is a better position to provide such assistance than many other Western countries which might, as a result <i>inter alia</i> of the high oil price, have to cope with balance of payments problems, increasing unemployment and economic recession. One could also readily concede that in some cases it is easier and more fruitful to think in terms of bilateral agreements instead of regional approaches. However, I believe that there are strong economic and geo-political considerations as to why we should for the most part give serious considerations to a regional approach in respect of the countries to the south of the sixth parallel, i.e. South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zambia, Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Kongo-Kinshasha, Gabon, the Malagasy Republic and Mauritius. If we exclude South Africa and Rhodesia from this group, the economy of countries in this region&#x2014;as is in fact the case in most African countries&#x2014;is characterized by all those typical elements of underdevelopment which are well-known to us and which we need not go into here.</p>

<p>These factors entail that most African countries find themselves in a vicious circle of growing populations and dwindling <i>per capita</i> incomes. This affords South Africa a unique opportunity to make a contribution to their economic development. Apart from that it is absolutely essential that there should be a drastic change in the general political relations between South Africa and the rest of Africa. Neither South Africa, nor Africa, nor the Western world can afford any longer the continued isolation of South Africa and the relative hostility between South Africa and the rest of the continent, or at least most of it. The ghastly implications of growing confrontation and conflict make it imperative that priority ought to be given to the improvement of these relations. Obviously, as has in fact already happened in particular cases during the past few months, the initiative for changing the situation should proceed from both South Africa as well as other countries in Africa. That this is not easy to achieve, goes without saying. Unfortunately there is a certain percentage of our population in South Africa who will not easily accept a proper understanding with the rest of Black Africa, <i>inter alia</i> because they do not see their way clear to the essential changes which we will have to effect internally as prerequisite to and inevitable result of such an understanding. There are also African countries which, owing to a diversity of reasons, will fight any attempt at a viable settlement and constructive co-operation between South Africa and other Black States tooth and nail, as we have already seen on various occasions. The type of estrangement which &#x2014;so it would seem&#x2014;has developed in the relations between South Africa on the one hand and Botswana and Lesotho on the other, will have to be avoided as far as possible. In this regard I could quote the words of Pres. Seretse Khama. On 28 March 1970 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not intend to seek aid from South African official sources. It would not be in the interests of either country to increase Botswana&#x2019;s dependence on South Africa. We are determined that no word or deed on Botswana&#x2019;s part will give comfort to the advocates of race supremacy.</block>

<p>It is not important whether his analysis of South Africa&#x2019;s policy is correct. What is in fact important is that most Black States in Africa see South Africa in this light.</p>

<p>It is because of these considerations that I should like to state the following ideas for consideration here as possible initiatives which we could take. In the first place it seems to me as though South Africa should through the mutual exchange of diplomats normalize its diplomatic relations with those Black States that are prepared to do so, as quickly as possible. I am thinking in particular of Lesotho and Swaziland, but there may, indeed, be others as well. There is <span class="col_2153-2154" refersTo="page_1092"/>no more effective way than this of maintaining diplomatic contact.</p>

<p>In the second place I believe that South Africa ought to make a larger portion of its national income available for assistance to Africa. A considerably larger amount than the present ought to be paid annually into the fund in question. Even if that amount should not be used in the relevant year, it ought to be placed in reserve so that that amount may be large enough when substantive assistance is desired, or ought to be rendered. This should also be done so that the hands of the Government may be free as far as the application of that amount is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<p>In the third place I want to say that it is extremely doubtful whether effective economic cooperation could be established among the countries of Southern Africa I have mentioned above without the creation of some or other permanent institution which will make positive efforts to achieve greater cooperation. It seems to me it is essential than an official multi-national body he established which, for example, could take the form of an economic commission for Southern Africa, as proposed by Prof. Sadie, or the form of a secretariat similar to the European Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&#x2014;as suggested on a previous occasion by the present Minister of Finance. This body will occupy itself with the development of the necessary infrastructures, the planning of the necessary rail and road links, the utilization of the existing technical and technological knowledge, the supply of power and water, the centralized marketing of produce, assistance to industrial projects, and&#x2014;in the case of regional drought or other disasters &#x2014;a comprehensive telecommunication system, the establishment of the necessary research and development machinery, the necessary monetary and other financial arrangements, etc.</p>

<p>In the fourth place private bodies will have a major role to play in the development of the underdeveloped areas in Africa. It seems to me that in this regard it is essential that a special body, a non-official institute or body, be established which could advise prospective industrialists in regard to investments and development possibilities, as is the case in various Western countries. I am thinking here more specifically of the machinery which was developed in this regard in West Germany.</p>

<p>In the fifth place it also appears to me to be essential that an increasing reciprocal flow of persons, particularly of opinion&#x002D;formers and leaders, should take place between South Africa and the Black States of Africa. Just as a USSALEP exists which occupies itself on a non-official level with the exchange of leaders between South Africa and the USA, the time has arrived for a similar non-official body to be created to promote this reciprocal exchanges and visits between us and other African countries.</p>

<p>In the sixth place it appears to me of special importance that scientists should be made available and that the exchange of academic leaders should take place. I have indicated that this has already happened to a certain extent. In this regard I just want to point out that South Africa has much to learn from development projects and the problems of other Black countries. I am thinking for example of the construction of Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi, and of Gaberones in Botswana, in view of the fact that we will have to develop seats of government in some of our homelands during the next few years. One thinks of some of the integrated development projects which have been tackled in Malawi, the activities of the Swaziland Credit and Savings Bank and the Botswana National Development Bank in regard to the extension of credit to Bantu farmers and to the experiments with the establishment of co-operatives in Botswana.</p>

<p>In the seventh place it seems to me as though official and non-official contact in the sphere of the Press and communications could similarly play its major role in the achievement of better understanding and cooperation. Possibly the South African Press organizations should take steps to promote the exchange of journalists, and perhaps the establishment of an institution in South Africa similar to the American School for Journalism, for the training of journalists from Africa, would be a fruitful idea. The possible exchange of radio and television programmes could well be investigated too.</p>

<p>It seems to me, as an eighth point, to be essential that we should make provision for the admission of students from the Black States of Africa to our South African universities and other institutions, for example <span class="col_2155-2156" refersTo="page_1093"/>Onderstepoort and our agricultural colleges, particularly on a post-graduate level and in specialized fields. The new course in Islamic and Eastern culture which is being offered by the University of Durban-Westville might very well be attractive to students from Africa. However, it seems to me from the nature of the case as though students from Africa will under these circumstances want to come in particular to some of our White universities and not to the others. The necessary provision will therefore have to be made for this.</p>

<p>In the ninth place it appears to me to be advisable that a special institute for development studies, such as the one which exists in West Germany, should be established somewhere in which courses in specific development aspects and problems are constantly offered, and in which experts, officials, academics, teachers, businessmen and others could regularly be convened. Under the circumstances it would probably be better if such an institute could be established in a Black African State.</p>

<p>As a tenth point I want to state the importance and the extent of the movement of labour to South Africa and the necessity of our thinking in this regard of the creation of a multi-national secretariat or directorate. This matter has frequently been mooted from this side of the House.</p>

<p>South Africans and the other inhabitants of Africa will only fully understand one another when free contact and association between them takes place on a scale which is large enough to give rise to the conviction that we accept one another as people and that we do not regard one another as enemies. The best way of achieving this is when it becomes just as easy and just as customary for South Africans to visit other countries in Africa as it is for us today to visit England or the Continent of Europe, and <i>vice versa</i> of course. We already see that relatively large numbers of White South Africans are going to Lesotho and Swaziland without any resultant threat to the identity or survival of the Whites. The reciprocal throwing open of our various countries to tourists could be a tremendous factor in the establishment of sound human relations, and as a contribution to the economy of these developing African countries.</p>

<p>Mr. Sneaker, the motion which I have presented here may appear to be one of great idealism. However I believe that it is practicable. But al! of us sitting here know that this can only be brought to fruition when the Black people of Africa know that other Blacks in Africa haye the same freedoms and opportunities as White South Africans and that when they, those Blacks from Africa, visit South Africa, they will receive the same treatment and the same rights and privileges as is the case when you and I visit countries in Western Europe.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Edenvale has done in his motion here today what he was actually asked to do by rhe hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs when the hon. the Minister suggested at the end of his speech on the first day of the no-confidence debate that the time had come for a motion to be introduced here which would give all hon. members an opportunity to exchange thoughts on the most fruitful way to achieve co-operation in Southern Africa. For that reason not only we on this side of the House, but all hon. members and all persons in South Africa, I believe, fully agree with the hon. member that a spirit of cooperation should be promoted at all times between us and other Africa, countries. But I just want to say for the sake of the record that I do not think it would be quite correct merely to ask in such a motion for more active steps to be taken to promote the concept of co-operation. I think that in such a motion due cognizance should be taken of what has already been done by the Government, specifically by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and also by the hon. the Prime Minister in recent years. I think that all South Africa will agree with me when I say that they have noted with appreciation the developments which have taken place in Africa in recent times. I think one may take it that these visible signs of co-operation and of detente in Africa can only be the result of work which has been done behind the scenes over a period of years. On behalf of this side of the House, therefore, I wish to move an amendment today to the motion moved by the hon. member for Edenvale, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House expresses its deep appreciation to the Government for the way in which the Government, and particularly the Honourable the Prime Minister, are continually doing everything possible in order to bring about a spirit of co-operation in all spheres in Africa, and promises the Government <span class="col_2157-2158" refersTo="page_1094"/>its support for all practical steps which are taken to promote the objectives of peaceful co-existence and co-operation in all spheres.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the concept of co-opration in Africa is not a new one. It is actually a concept which has been a part of our country&#x2019;s history and of the history of all African nations. For the sake of convenience I want to refer to three phases in the history of Africa during this century and to the thread of co-operation we can trace through these phases. The first period ended round about the middle of the century, in the year 1950. Before that period, most African countries had been colonies of European countries, and any co-operation which existed in Africa had often been hampered by the fact that specific objects were pursued by different, frequently opposing European countries, with the <i>result</i> that before the year 1950, when most parts of Africa were still colonies of European powers, the climate in Africa was not really conducive to fruitful co-operation. But it remains a fact that in spite of this development, in spite of this situation which we had here, there was always a spirit of co-operation on the part of South Africa, which had then been independent for many years. In this way we had had a transport agreement with Lourenco Marques since the previous century, we had had a customs agreement with the former protectorates since the year 1910 and we had cooperated with African countries for many decades, particularly in the agricultural technical field. This is evidenced by the fact that in the period before the Second World War there was consular and other representation between South Africa and countries such as Egypt, Kenya and the Belgian Congo. I want to allege, therefore, that up to the year 1950, as a result of the special history of Africa, the time was not ripe for fruitful co-operation here in Africa.</p>

<p>During the next quarter of a century, the period between 1950 and 1975, as more and more African nations achieved independence and the climate became more favourable for co-operation between independent nations with a common destiny, cooperation did in fact become possible between peoples in this country and also between other African states and ourselves. But the fact remains that new countries often have to learn certain hard lessons in life, especially young countries which are enjoying their first taste of political freedom and which are able for the first time to decide their own destiny and their future. These countries often indulge in daydreams, and it takes quite a while for the leaders of such nations to realize that they have to come back to earth in the end. In this climate, during this period from 1950 to 1975, during this third quarter of a century, the climate was still not really favourable for fruitful co-operation in Africa. A period of greater realism had to come about before the climate would really be ripe for fruitful co-operation to commence. It is also true that certain meetings were held, particularly at the instigation of countries to the north of Africa, and that the younger African countries, those to the south and to the west, joined in condemning South Africa and its aims in Africa. Under the pressure of these nations, particularly of nations to the north of Africa, a decision was taken at a conference of emergent African states in the year 1960 to boycott South Africa entirely. In this way the channels for co-operation and communication between South Africa and other African countries were clogged, if not completely severed.</p>

<p>But as I have said, this period, too, had to pass, and as other countries had to learn from bitter experience that the economy does not allow itself to be dictated to by people with political ends in view, and as countries such as Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland showed, after they had become independent, that in spite of the pressure from Africa they were prepared, not only to continue the co-operation which already existed with South Africa, but even to strengthen it, the climate further to the north of Africa gradually improved and as far back as 1967, diplomatic relations could be entered into with Malawi. From the trade figures, too, it is clear that South Africa has not been completely cut off from Africa during this third quarter of a century, for even in 1974 South Africa&#x2019;s trade with the rest of Africa accounted for 9,4% of its total foreign trade, representing an amount of R695 million.</p>

<p>But now, in this historical year, 1975, we are entering upon the last quarter of our century. Just as in world politics there has been a gradual move away from confrontation between the great powers of the world to a climate of consultation between the competitive groups in the world, we have likewise seen the beginnings of a new realism in Africa. To a large extent this <span class="col_2159-2160" refersTo="page_1095"/>new realism is the result of the economic lessons to which I have referred and which all leaders of states have to learn sooner or later, namely that complete economic independence is quite impossible in this world and, secondly that economic development is only possible where there is true co-operation. Just as an old continent such as Europe had to learn that in the end, for the sake of the prosperity of all its people, it had to forget the conflict of the past and establish the European Economic Union is a spirit of co-operation, and just as there have recently been signs of a new realism in the middle East and attempts are now being made to create from the ashes of wars a new work-table around which nations which have long been at war with one another may gather to co-operate for the sake of the prosperity of all their people, we have likewise seen the birth of a new realism in Africa on account of these economic lessons which have showed the necessity for co-operation.</p>

<p>However, there is also a third factor which I believe we should not lose sight of, and this is that last year South Africa had its first opportunity to show what its true aims in Africa are. Whereas the accusation used to be made, particularly at the instigation of countries in the northern cart of this continent, that South Africa had aggressive designs on its neighbours, that it had expansionist tendencies, South Africa has now for the first time had the opportunity of demonstrating in practice what its true aims are. When Portugal decided to withdraw from Mozambique and Angola, South Africa was able to expose that hollow propaganda for what it really was, nothing but malicious allegations. Now that this lesson has been demonstrated in practice for all the world to see, I do not believe that this propaganda will easily succeed in Africa again. For that reason I may say that I believe that this third factor is a very strong factor which will promote a new climate for co-operation in Africa.</p>

<p>Now that this new climate exists, now that the first visible signs have appeared that countries which used to stand in fierece opposition to South Africa in the world are prepared to meet South African leaders for discussions, I think the time has come for us to consider what should really be a sound basis for co-operation in Africa. In this regard I just want to touch upon a few points.</p>

<p>In the first place I believe that South Africa&#x2019;s policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of neighbouring states and of other nations is the only true basis for permanent friendship and co-operation. In the second place I believe that there should be a constant endeavour to avoid a new power struggle between world ideologies in Southern Africa. I think that this should not be our aim only, but that it should be shared by all countries in Southern Africa. We should endeavour to prevent any foreign ideologies from entering this subcontinent, so that the struggle which has been and is still being waged in other parts of the world will not turn Southern Africa into a battlefield for foreign ideologies, and so that people will always be able to communicate and exchange thoughts freely. I believe that there is also a third foundation upon which co-operation must rest if it is to be permanent. We have seen what the results can be if countries which have monopolies on certain primary products use those monopolies to blackmail consumer countries in the world. We have seen that leaders of the West have even had to mention the possibility of resorting to violence to restore such a situation to normality. For that reason, Mr. Chairman. I think that those natural resources with which Southern Africa is endowed, resources which may one day be of decisive importance to the future of humanity, should be one of the foundations of co-operation and that these resources should not be used as a means of blackmailing the consumer of the world, but that South Africa should only market its products on a competitive basis, as in the past. This must be the basis of development in Southern Africa. I believe that if we accept these foundations we shall be able to create a fruitful basis and a permanent foundation for co-operation in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Now the question arises: What can South Africa&#x2019;s role in Southern Africa be? I believe that South Africa cannot be wished away by any leader in Africa. Even if countries wanted to ignore South Africa, its mere presence, the mere fact that this country with its tremendous production machine belongs to this part of the world, would make it impossible to ignore it in the long run. For that reason I think that countries in Southern Africa will have to recognize that we have an important part to play in this sub-continent. In the first place I want to point out that as the Bantu <span class="col_2161-2162" refersTo="page_1096"/>peoples achieve independence, a group of countries will come into being which will co-operate very closely in the economic sphere. This co-operation will be the basis of their independence and will also be the bond which will ensure the closet association between these countries and South Africa in the future. In the same way as this will happen as the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development and liberation of the Bantu peoples develops, South Africa has already proved that it can cooperate very closely with its neighbouring states. The existing customs agreement between South Africa on the one hand and Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland on the other is the closest bond of cooperation to be found in the free world today.</p>

<p>A further fact is that there is no other industrial country in the whole world which could take over South Africa&#x2019;s role, particularly in regard to certain spheres of development in Southern Africa. The hon. member for Edenvale has already referred to this, but I just want to touch on it again. World tourism which is almost the largest single industry in the world today, is dependent on visitors having an opportunity to visit not only isolated countries, but world regions. By joining with other countries to create Sartoc, South Africa has already demonstrated that it is indispensable to its neighbours in Southern Africa if regional tourism in South Africa is to be developed into a major source of income. In regard to Sarccus as well, and the fact that it has existed for so many years and that there is the closest co-operation with six other countries in this regard, as well as the fact that it has been so clearly demonstrated in practice that South Africa, as a part of this region, has an equal stake in developing the soil and all the assets it contains, I believe that this particular role could not be taken over by any other industrial country or any other developed country in the world.</p>

<p>Transport, communication, coastal shipping and other means of communication would become practically impossible if South Africa were excluded from the bloc of countries in Southern Africa. The hon. the Minister has pointed out, too, that big hydro-electric schemes such as the Cabora-Bassa and the Kunene projects would simply not be possible, or would only be possible at a much higher cost to those nations, if South Africa were not prepared to buy power from those countries. Eight per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s total power consumption will be provided by the Cabora Bassa scheme. This will eventually enable no fewer than 800 000 Bantu farmers to be settled in the Zambezi valley, a population almost as large as that of present-day Mozambique. As far as this is concerned, too, South Africa is the only country in the world which is in a position to buy this power, thereby making these great schemes possible. I want to point out, too, that the great multi-national groups of the world would not be so interested in moving in and promoting the development of isolated countries in Africa if they did not have the assurance that we were a substantial group of nations on terms of peaceful co-operation. South Africa included. Only this climate of co-operation between the countries, and the fact that South Africa with its level of development is already a part of this world, make it possible for the great multi-national groups to accept their vocation in this sub-continent and to contribute their share to the development of all our neighbouring states.</p>

<p>There is a group consisting of 13 independent countries south of the equator. At the moment this group of countries has a population of 110 million people. Within a few decades the figure will be 200 million or more. We have a group of countries here whose gross national product amounts to only about R30 000 million at the moment, but within a few decades, if they continue to develop normally, they will have a national product which may be very close on R70 000 million. I think that the foundations will then be there for closer co-operation, as was requested today by the hon. member for Edenvale. However, before that fruitful co-operation can come about and before the practical steps proposed by the hon. member for Edenvale and other hon. members can be put into practice, a climate of co-operation must first be created. For that reason I think we should be grateful today for having a Government, a Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Prime Minister who have set themselves the ideal of ensuring that a spirit of co-operation is created and promoted in Southern Africa and that this Government adopts peaceful co-existence as one of its principal aims. I think that not only we on this side of the house, but all hon. members and all South Africa would want <span class="col_2163-2164" refersTo="page_1097"/>to wish them every success in this great task.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the motion introduced by my hon. friend is designed to elicit as much support and encouragement and as many ideas as might be relevant in support of co-operation between this country and the other countries of Africa. It is not intended to be a hostile motion or a motion of censure and therefore I find it disappointing that the hon. member for Vasco has found it necessary to move an amendment, particularly because his amendment concentrates on thanking the Government, praising the Government and offering further support to the Government. This makes it less easy to proceed in the way in which we intended this to go. Nevertheless, we accept his general good intentions and we realize that there is a certain approach to these matters outside of the House which perhaps obliges hon. members opposite to take this particular kind of view. But I shall try to show in the course of my speech that a great deal can be done and should be done which does not depend solely on the efforts of the Government. I believe that those who have the task of carrying out this particular job of developing co-operation in Africa, would be the first to agree that there is a great contribution that can be made by the private sector to those efforts which the Government is already making.</p>

<p>I have only one other little point which I want to deal with in connection with the generally valuable contribution by the hon. member for Vasco. I refer to the timescale of history which he dealt with at the outset of his speech. It is not correct, merely to put the record right, that there was a period up to 1950 in the history of this country when in fact co-operation with Africa did not work well and was only developed to a ver/ limited degree and when we had very moderate representation in other parts of Africa; nor is it correct that after 1950 and to 1975, as he put it, we have experienced a great developing era of progress in the field of technical co-operation. This, I am sorry to say, is not how history tells the story. Perhaps there was not wide representation up to 1950, but nevertheless there was, as he acknowledged, representation in a number of African places such as the Congo, in Egypt, in East Africa and so forth. Technical co-operation did in fact flourish right up to 1960 and a few years beyond. It was during the period of colonialism, when the colonial occupation of Africa was still in vigorous sway, that we in South Africa learnt to develop with many other states in Africa a common approach to common problems. I could say a great deal more about this subject, but the history of the case is in fact that up to 1960 there was a steady movement towards closer cooperation over the wide range of fields. Such organizations as Sarccus, the committee to which the hon. member for Vasco referred, were in fact born in this period, as were many of the other organizations which still exist today. Closer co-operation in respect of red locusts, the quelea, water hyacinth, etc., was born in that period. During the period 1960 to 1975 we have in fact had a relative set-back in our relations. This again is not a subject for blame; it was the direct consequence of the decolonization of Africa and the various difficulties which arose out of that situation. We believe that from 1975 onwards, shall we say from 1975 to the year 2000, we should seek to enter a period in which we could experience a great surge forward in our relations with Africa. This is why we introduced this motion; this is the subject we want to discuss. We do not wish to belabour the Government or to criticize it for its shortcomings in the past. We accept that what could reasonably be done, has been done. Instead, we want to talk about the future and our prospects for the future and in this way make some small contribution to the progress we all hope to achieve.</p>

<p>When we speak of the period 1975 to 2000, we are speaking of a period which promises to be of very special importance in the history of South Africa. The fact is that even today, in 1975, South Africa has already reached a position in the world in terms of energy production, the gross national product or use what criterion you will, which places South Africa within the first 20 nations of the world. I believe that because of various circumstances which we have already dealt with in other debates, circumstances which have a good deal to do with recession in the Western World, with population growth in this country and also the enormous economic progress upon which we are launched, South Africa will in the next 25 years move from amongst the first 20 nations in the world to amongst the first 10. This is not just an empty hope; but something which looks like a realistic prospect. This kind of power, this <span class="col_2165-2166" refersTo="page_1098"/>kind of strength, this kind of wealth, imposes enormous responsibilities. In the case of South Africa, it is going to impose these responsibilities in the first place in respect of this continent and more particularly the region in which we live. This is what our motion is about. We believe that South Africa is now developing the means, the opportunity and the inducement to become the catalyst of the whole of this region of the world. We believe for many reasons that South Africa will be drawn and sucked into the kind of vacuum which exists in this kind of world and will, in spite of herself, be compelled to fill this and to play the role for which history appears to have destined her. It is quire obvious that our major role is going to be in the region which in previous debates we have referred to as Capricorn. The word &#x201C;Capricorn&#x201D; does not describe a particular United Party policy, but is merely a convenient and graphic word to describe an area which lies roughly 1 000 miles north and 1 000 miles south of the Tropic of Capricorn, which runs through the Northern Transvaal. It describes almost precisely the area which we have under reference and which we are talking about today. But we talk about more than Capricorn as well, because we have already found that in our relations with Capricorn Africa there is a certain inhibiting factor, a certain restraint or brake on our progress which arises from the hostility of certain African states to the north of the Capricorn area. The Black members of the Capricorn area are also in fact members of the United Nations, they are members of the Organization of Africa Unity, of the Economic Commission for Africa and so forth. In these places they have associations with countries well to the north of Capricorn Africa who are hostile to us for various reasons and whose friendship and, at the very least, neutrality, we badly need. If we do not succeed in obtaining the goodwill of the countries to the north of Capricorn Africa of the countries up to the Sahara and even beyond, if they constantly interfere, inhibit and constantly create hostility, then we will not easily succeed even within our own Capricorn region. Before I go on. I want to say right away that we recognize with pleasure and with respect what the Government has in fact done, particularly in the technical field. We believe that over the years a great deal has been done to try to create an era and a framework of technical co-operation, and that within the very considerable limitations imposed by the situation in Africa, by the hostilities, by the difficulties, by the adverse conditions in Africa, by and large quite reasonable and substantial progress has been made. I want to refer most particularly to a reply which was given by the hon. the Minister in the House the other day in which he stated that South Africa had made a very generous and considerable contribution to Unicef in connection with relief to the drought-stricken areas of Africa. This is the kind of gesture which I believe South Africa can afford in such special circumstances. It is the kind of gesture which is worthy of our position in Africa and it is the kind of gesture which gives us the dignity and prestige that we need in Africa. I congratulate the hon. the Minister on this gesture and I think it was a very well chosen thing to do.</p>

<p>Having said all this, there is obviously a great deal more that needs to be done. The Government has certainly been active in promoting détente and this is also something which we have applauded. We believe that the soil nevertheless remains barren. The soil of Africa had proved barren to many nations before we had any purpose to extend our interests or our area of co-operation within it. It has frustrated many colonizing nations. Our role is not a colonizing one and we hope that we will not be frustrated in our own purpose. Nevertheless I believe that we have a great deal more to do in order to achieve the things which we have in mind. There is a great deal which I had hoped to touch on, but I see that my time is beginning to run out.</p>

<p>In the no-confidence debate we referred to a number of initiatives which we believed might be helpful. We referred to such things as a revival of an African transport organization, something which has, while proceeding along technical and practical channels, lain fallow as a major concept, as a major initiative in Africa. We believe that this is something which could be developed with great advantage, particularly in view of the upsurge in the economy of South Africa and the increased part it will play in the greater economy of Africa. We should take these initiatives and not wait for the Chinese or other people to come and do this under our noses.</p>

<p>We have spoken of a migrant labour convention, not merely in the sense of bilateral arrangements to handle workers <span class="col_2167-2168" refersTo="page_1099"/>who shuffle back and forth between countries, but as a far greater concept in which there will be a recognition of the importance of migratory labour in Southern Africa and a guarantee of the status of migrant workers throughout our area, whereever they go to work, so that they will be protected and respected. This should apply to Whites as well as Blacks because there is a reciprocal flow&#x2014;White men go to do their tasks in other countries, they go to live in other countries where they work under Black majority governments, just as Black men come from other countries to live under a White Government in South Africa. Such a reciprocal arrangement would offer hope and a wider prospect for much greater development, for much, greater cohesion and for much greater safety and security in our interracial relations in the whole of this area.</p>

<p>We have dealt with an industrial development agency. My colleague from Edenvale also referred to it and I shall, therefore, not pursue this particular subject. We have spoken of an energy planning council. Here, in a world which we all know is becoming poverty-stricken in regard to energy, South Africa, with its coal and uranium resources and with the enormous hydro-electric potential that lies to the north of us, can in fact become a major supplier of energy, not merely in the form of electricity, but in the form of energy which can be converted to other purposes and which can increase the value of a great many raw materials and supply them to the rest of the world. Energy is going to be a key feature in the economy of the world and South Africa is one of the few countries which has these enormous reserves of fuel and enormous reserves of hydro-electric potential. This is something into which one should look. These schemes can really only be productive in Africa if they are looked at on a large scale, such as the way in which the Cabora Bassa project was approached. There are enormous prospects for further development along these lines.</p>

<p>South Africa should take the initiative. If we do not, there is nobody else in Africa who will be in a position to do so, and we certainly do not look forward to yet another intervention from another Eastern power doing these things under our noses.</p>

<p>I have, in brief, only two further proposals to make. The first is that I believe that, while the Government has a very definite role to play in the development of these forms of co-operation, the full potential of private enterprise in South Africa has hardly begun to be used. There are, of course, investments to the north of us by private corporations and there are, of course, great mining enterprises. These things have proved to be of enormous importance. There are examples in Mozambique and in other countries where South African private enterprise has moved in, where it has developed and where it has been an enormous asset to us, not only diplomatically, not only economically, not only commercially, but in the spread of our prestige and influence in general. Sir, it used to be said that trade followed the flag. The reverse is true today. Trade no longer follows the flag; it is the flag which follows trade. When I speak of the flag, I obviously speak of it not in the old territorial or colonial sense; I speak of it in the sense of the extension of our prestige, of our willing co-operation and our closer relations with other countries. I believe, Sir, that private enterprise can do a great deal and that the Government should in fact give more attention to promoting and assisting and encouraging the spread of our banks, our insurance companies, our industries, our commerce, into our neighbouring African countries and further afield. In this way we shall not only enhance our influence in these countries, we shall not only introduce a stabilizing element into these countries, an interdependence with these countries, but we shall in fact build-up the very kind of trade and commerce that we wish to establish in this continent.</p>

<p>Lastly, Sir&#x2014;I am told that my time is up&#x2014;I want to make a plea for the more effective development of our relations particularly with the French speaking States of Africa. I know that a good deal has been done. I have to some extent been aware of what has been going on for some time but, Sir, I believe that while our approach can more directly and more easily be made to the English-speaking African States, there is in the French-speaking African States an even greater potential for close co-operation. The French-speaking African States&#x2014;and I am speaking now not only of their Governments but of their populations&#x2014;have in the past years been less conditioned against South Africa. There is a greater readiness to accept South Africa on a rational basis instead of a prejudiced basis. A great deal of the anti-South African propaganda in Africa <span class="col_2169-2170" refersTo="page_1100"/>has run mainly through the English-speaking African States. One finds repeatedly, when one vists the French-speaking African Sates, that hey are far less conscious of certain aspects of South African policy, or certain accusations against South African policy, than is the case in the English-speaking African States. I believe that this French language barrier is something which must be removed. We must get closer to these States. We might, I think, take advantage of the fact that there seems to be a more realistic and a more practical approach to South Africa in the French-speaking States and, through their intervention, even in the Organization for African Unity. It is perhaps those very French-speaking States which can act as the catalyst for us to overcome the hostility and the inhibitions which exist. My time has expired, Sir.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have no fault to find with the motion of the hon. member for Edenvale. It is in accordance with the Africa policy of this Government, and to some extent it is also in accordance with what the Government has already done in practice. Consequently, if this motion is intended to support the Government without saying so, then I want to thank the hon. member very much for having moved it. The hon. member for Edenvale and, in fact, the hon. member for Von Brandis as well, intimated approval in their speeches for what the Government had attempted to do in this regard. The subject of the motion is co-operation, as is the subject of the amendment of the hon. member for Vasco. That is the point at issue in Africa at the moment. The hon. member for Edenvale mentioned 12 points in this connection, and except for the fact &#x2014;I am saying this with respect&#x2014;that he may have put the cart before the horse in certain respects there is no fault to find with the 12 points mentioned by him. Of course, some of the points mentioned by him are already being implemented. There are the Africa Institute and the Institute for International Affairs which already cover a field he wants to have covered in one of his points. There is the financial aid which is already being rendered by the Government. Financial aid is not rendered by the Government of South Africa beyond the limits of its own means. There used to be co-operation in fields in respect of which the hon. member advocated co-operation, and that co-operation was not terminated by the will of the Government. It came to an end as a result of other factors. Sir, I believe that many of the proposals made by the hon. member for Edenvale in his 12 points, will be realized as a matter of course once attention has first been given to certain other aspects. Co-operation as such does not come about on its own and it does not come about overnight. For lasting and successful interstate co-operation, there are certain prerequisites. I just want to mention the four which I regard as being the most important.</p>

<p>The first one is that there should be mutual trust, i.e., the parties must be free from suspicion, mistrust and fear for each other. Secondly, the co-operation should come about voluntarily and from inner conviction. Thirdly, the equality of the parties must be recognized at all times. Fourthly, there must be a positive meaningfulness in the whole idea of co-operation.</p>

<p>As far as the first point I mentioned is concerned&#x2014;the question of mutual trust&#x2014; I think we may say in this Chamber that of all the continents and of all the races, the history of Africa surely is the most flagrant. Apart from the territories north of the Sahara that had their great moments in early history, Africa has been the source of supplies since the earliest times for those parts of the world situated close to it. It was a source of slaves for Arabia, Europe and America. It was a source of raw materials, minerals and precious stones for virtually the whole world. It has been a source of wild animals from which the circusses and zoological gardens of the world have been stocked, also with human material, since the times of the Pharaohs and the Caesars. Africa with its wide open spaces, its climate, its nature and its wildlife has also been the hunting grounds and the recreation grounds of the wealthy and the mighty of the world. We in South Africa know this too. Our ancestors experienced this themselves and we are able to testify to this. I am not saying this in a spirit of accusing or condemning those who were responsible for this. Today this forms a part of history, and at the time when this was done, it was accepted as such. But if we want to understand Africa, for the sake of gaining an understanding of the complexities of Africa, we should tell one another these things. If we remember these aspects of the history of Africa, we have <span class="col_2171-2172" refersTo="page_1101"/>arrived at the underlying cause of the present problem the West and the White powers are experiencing in Africa. Because, and we might as well say this here to one another, all Whites, no matter from what country they come and what language they speak, are mistrusted and doubted to a greater or lesser extent, in Africa from the Cape to Cairo.</p>

<p>No, I do not think the reverse is as true, unless the hon. member means that it is only from Cairo to the Cape, because then I shall agree with him.</p>

<p>Sir, much of the co-operation existing in Africa at present, is forced by necessity. This is not the sort of co-operation South Africa seeks. Since the National Party came into power, suspicion and hatred against South Africa have been sown and South Africa has been pointed out as a malefactor and an arch-enemy of the Blacks in Africa. The Black children in Africa learned this at school and today they occupy positions of authority. And let us say this to each other in this debate quite openly, and in the spirit of this debate: Part of the calumination of this Government came from South Africa itself, <i>ad nauseam.</i> If the Opposition means well with their motion&#x2014;I accept that they mean well&#x2014; they, as well as the Press supporting them, should begin at their own door if they want to make a contribution to co-operation. Then they and their Press should start now to break down the mountains of prejudice and hatred between South Africa and the rest of the world which have been built up through calumniation. They will also have to tell the world that falsehoods have been told against the South African Government, that the National Party Government is not racialistic, that it does not suppress the Plack people of South Africa, that it has not committed genocide in certain areas under its control, but that it is, in fact making a serious and honest attempt to establish a just pattern of relations for all South African&#x2019;s people. From their knowledge of the history of the politics of South Africa they know where to begin with this contribution they are able to make.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister we have, we have not been waiting until to day to do the preparatory work and the spade work for the co-operation which has come about in Africa. Fortunately we ourselves have a history of a struggle for freedom against foreign domination and colonialism from which we could learn to understand the reasoning of Africa. Fortunately we are able to say to Africa and to our neighbours in all honesty today that the dreams of Gen. J. C. Smuts and Cecil John Rhodes of a British confederation of African States has never been ours, that we have never thought in terms of a great African dominion stretching unbroken throughout Africa. Fortunately we are able to say, without fear of contradiction, that we on this side of the House have never thought in terms of Gen. Smuts&#x2019; concept of a united British Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<p>It would have been a free country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>We have never had the colonialistic mentality which Gen. Smuts revealed in his great British Africa idea.</p>

<p>This Government started breaking down the mountains of prejudice itself. It did so through the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the hon. the Prime Minister who extended a hand of friendship to Africa, who offered to conclude a non-aggression pact with any African country, who offered co-operation with whoever was prepared to co-operate with us, who established a fund from which aid can be given to African countries and who have in fact already started co-operating with certain African states in practice.</p>

<p>There is a second requirement for cooperation I have mentioned, viz. that the co-operation should be brought about voluntarily and from inner conviction. Countless times we have been witnesses, also in Africa, of what seemingly was forced co-operation. I think the most important lesson to be learned from forced co-operation, is that it is terminated as soon as one of the parties can afford to do so. I leave it at that; it speaks for itself.</p>

<p>The third requirement for co-operation is that the basis for co-operation should contain the recognition of the absolute equality of the parties, equal in the sense of State to State, of leader to leader, of man to man. It does not matter whether the one is rich or poor, whether the other is strong or weak in the military field, whether the one is numerically strong or <span class="col_2173-2174" refersTo="page_1102"/>small, but at the conference table mutual respect and understanding for each other&#x2019;s political autonomy must be predominant. The feeling that arises that the one is always giving and the other is always receiving, should be guarded against. Accusations from Africa have been made against powers that they are condescending, patronizing, towards African states in their negotiations. Fortunately we have not yet heard this reproach against South Africa. I believe we may assure the states of Africa that they need not expect or fear this attitude from South Africa. On the contrary, I have experienced it myself and have heard on countless occasions that South Africans are amongst those who get on best and most easily with delegates of Black African states at international conferences.</p>

<p>There is a fourth requirement I have mentioned, and that is that the co-operation which is sought should be meaningful. One can elaborate on this at length. To me, the most important meaning in co-operation lies in this; it must be in the mutual interest and to the mutual benefit of the parties. It should not be a <i>Societas Leonina,</i> in other words, a partnership with the lion in which the lion eventually devours the partnership as well as the partners. I also do not believe that we should necessarily limit our co-operation to Africa south of the Sahara. If co-operation with other African states has meaning, I believe we should co-operate with them as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is my belief that if we were to succeed in satisfying these four prerequisites to prepare the field for co-operation, namely by eliminating fear and suspicion, by ensuring that co-operation may take place voluntarily, by ensuring that it is meaningful and takes place on a basis of equality, then that which has to follow on this, as well as that advocated by the hon. member for Edenvale, will actually come about very soon by itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to support the motion of the hon. member for Edevale, as any right-minded person would do, but I should like to introduce a slightly new dimension into this debate by stressing the very real, very important and very close relationship which there is and ought to be between internal policies and external policies, between our internal situation and our hopes and our aspirations in Africa. I do not believe it is realistic to try to separate or isolate these two. If we do, then I believe that a debate like this will degenerate into something very pretty but very theoretical. I believe we have to bring it down to earth. Mr. Speaker, the House knows that this party has made dialogue with the Black people of South Africa and the Black people of Africa beyond our borders a top priority, the reasons for this are self-evident, but I mention it in this context because I believe that dialogue is an essential prelude to the kind of co-operation and the kind of assistance which is envisaged in the motion of the hon. member for Edenvale. I believe it is an essential prerequisite. You have to establish this kind of relationship. We need at the outset to evolve and to have in our mind some clear strategy for Africa. This country has got to identify itself with Africa unmistakably and unequivocally. We have got to try to understand its many moods. We have got to try to understand and sympathize with the aspirations of its peoples. We must in other words, I believe, be seen to be of Africa. We have to keep on seeking common ground with Africa wherever and whenever we can. It is a tragic fact that in the 1960s and the 1970s South Africa was sadly isolated in this continent, to the detriment of everybody concerned. It was to our detriment and to the detriment of the rest of Africa, and it is something that we have got to remedy.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sir, I believe that we have to make our position clear on what I call the unresolved problems of Africa, notably those of Rhodesia and South West Africa. Until these are out of the way, I do not believe that we shall be able to establish the kind of rapport with the rest of Africa which is so essential to the kind of cooperation envisaged.</p>

<p>Finally, and this is really what I want to emphasize, I believe that we have to look to our internal policies because in the final analysis the degree of success or lack of it which, we are going to experience in finding common ground with the people of Africa, will depend on the nature of our internal policies and the degree of success with which we implement them. In the words used by the hon. member for Sea Point on another occasion, a new era of communication and understanding with the African states requires nothing more or less than the changes of policy that are essential, within South Africa if we want to enjoy the goodwill, co-operation and loyalty <span class="col_2175-2176" refersTo="page_1103"/>of Black and Brown citizens of our country.</p>

<p>I should like to mention very briefly a few areas in which I sincerely believe there has to be change if we hope to make any real progress in co-operating with the rest of Africa and in helping the emergent people in Africa. I do not believe that we can talk in isolation of the kind of co-operation which the hon. member for Edenvale has in mind. This is something which has to be related. Let us take the relationship of this country with the communist world. We abhor their policies and therefore there is almost a total lack of communication between us. We must create such a situation in this country that the rest of Africa will not regard us in the same light as we regard the totalitarian states. What do we have to do? I believe we have to make certain basic adjustments in our attitude if we want to achieve this, not because of pressure from outside but for an entirely different reason. We want to make these changes because we believe they will be fair to our own people and will establish the kind of basis on which we shall be able to find common ground with the rest of the peoples of Africa. To begin with, let us get rid of that final relic of the colonial era&#x2014;we are always being told that we were the first people to kick over the traces of colonialism&#x2014;the whole conception of White &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; and what animates it. The hon. member for Waterkloof has already talked of the progress that has been made in this direction. I believe there has indeed been progress, but that it has to go infinitely further for, unless we can rid ourselves of that spirit in our thinking, our behaviour and actions, we shall not be able to identify ourselves with Africa, and we shall remain isolated, we shall remain outcasts. Surely we want to avoid that!</p>

<p>Secondly, we have to get rid of discrimination based on race and colour. How many months ago was it that Ambassador Botha gave the world the solemn assurance that this country is moving away from discrimination? He said it could not happen overnight, but has enough happened in this period? Have we done enough to convince our own people and the other peoples of Africa that we are in fact doing something? This is a matter of extreme urgency. At a meeting in Stellenbosch last week I heard a front-bench member of the party opposite saying that there is no such thing as discrimination here. I do not know what he means; I do not know what he is talking about. I do not think that he was speaking for the party, but he is one of the voices in that party. We have seen recently the rather pathetic egg-dance that was performed over the Nico Malan theatre and we know that the kind of thing that was said in connection with it does nobody the slightest good.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we have to get down to something essential, and that is the sharing of political power. How can we convince the rest of Africa that we are in earnest about this if we, the whites, cling to the exclusive exercise of political power? The Government&#x2019;s formula, whatever it may do for the homelands, is totally unconvincing as far as the urban Africans, the Coloureds and the Asians are concerned. In this regard it remains for us to prove our <i>bona fides.</i> We must prove to the rest of Africa, to our own people and, above all, to ourselves that we seriously mean to share political power and that we want to give these other people a meaningful say in the decision-making processes.</p>

<p>In this way one can go on cataloguing what needs to be done. These things must be done not because outsiders demand it or expect it of us. Basically we know that it is the right thing to do as far as our own people are concerned and that, in addition, it is the only effective way in which we will be able to establish that common ground for co-operating with Africa and, where necessary, helping it&#x2014;which is surely an objective that everyone in this country desires. Just as little, I believe, as the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s efforts at détente can achieve the success they richly deserve, just as little is it likely that South Africa will be able to play a significant role in giving what the hon. member for Edenvale called practical and controlled assistance to emergent nations or in co-operating in the political and economic spheres, unless, as I say, we succeed in radically restructuring South African society by making some of the practical changes I have proposed. Only if we do that will we be able to establish our <i>bona fides</i> with the rest of Africa and create a platform on which we can base the kind of co-operation which this motion envisages. It is for that reason that I support the motion.</p>

<p>&#x2026; but in the short time in which he has been here, he has made many meaningful contributions to the debates of this House. This afternoon we had another meaningful contribution. I do not want to cover the same field that the hon. members for Edenvale and Von Brandis covered here. So in the short time at my disposal I want to limit myself to one aspect of the motion, viz. that part which deals with social co-operation.</p>

<p>Before I come to that I just want to point out a problem which faces us in a debate such as this. In the field of co-operation between South Africa and the rest of Africa, we have a lack of information as to precisely where we stand in respect of co-operation and contact with and assistance to countries in Africa south of the Sahara. The reason for this is that the most important information about this matter is kept behind an official curtain of silence. The result is that Parliament is not always able to judge properly the Government&#x2019;s actions, or lack of actions, in the field of assistance to Africa. We on this side understand the background to the matter. We know that over a period of years we have landed ourselves in a situation in which we experienced hostility from the rest of Africa towards South Africa, chiefly as a result of the internal racial policy followed here.</p>

<p>As a result of that, many countries in the world, especially the Black countries, refused to establish normal relations with South Africa or to maintain them. Fortunately we have now arrived at a stage where the Government is set on a road of change or, rather, where it has convinced large parts of the world that drastic changes are coming in South Africa. Consequently there are more countries in Africa now than there were before which are prepared to make contact with us and even to request and to receive assistance from us, but all of this is done in a very circumspect way and on condition that the matter will not be given loud publicity. We on this side understand the situation and have no desire to embarrass any country in Africa. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs knows that we have never exercised pressure on him to furnish information when he was of the opinion that it was not in the best interests of those concerned to do so. In any case, we like the principle that the least publicity possible be given to the assistance which we give to other people. Nevertheless we believe that Parliament should somehow be consulted in this matter. Therefore we are a little critical of the hon. the Minister and his department in two respects in this connection. We think that they are too reticent as far as information to Parliament is concerned. There is an excess of reticence and this has almost become a characteristic of the department. There is always a danger that such an attitude may be used as a means to avoid criticism. We need only look at a country such as the United States of America. As a leading major power it has more difficult issues and more delicate international situations to deal with than we shall ever have. Nevertheless one finds that the President of the United States submits a comprehensive and reasoned exposition of his whole foreign policy to Congress from time to time. I have here, for example, ex-President Nixon&#x2019;s 1973 report on foreign affairs which he submitted to his Congress. It is a voluminous report of over 200 pages. The report is there for the whole world to see. Here we have nothing of that sort. What is more, the hon. the Minister refuses to create parliamentary machinery through which members of Parliament can be consulted on a more or less confidential basis and through which the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs can be subjected to constructive criticism. I want to say once again that we do not regard this as a reasonable attitude towards Parliament as an institution. Nor does it show much confidence in the parliamentary system. There are members on this side, and I am one of them&#x2014;I am talking about ordinary members and not about the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who is in a special position and who has never, to my knowledge, betrayed any confidence&#x2014;who, for example, know where the hon. the Prime Minister was on his recent visits in Africa.</p>

<p>No, but I have had that information at my disposal for some time. Nor was it very difficult <span class="col_2179-2180" refersTo="page_1105"/>to obtain it, but, as members of Parliament, we who sit on this side of the House do not make use of that information in the special circumstances which prevail and because it has been requested that the matter remains confidential. We wait for the Prime Minister to make the facts public himself, as he did in respect of his recent visit to Monrovia. I simply mention the fact that there are members who have information which they do not use themselves. I mention this aspect to prove that there may be greater confidence in Parliament, especially on the part of the hon. the Minister and his department, in respect of matters which affect Africa.</p>

<p>I began by making the statement that Parliament did not have sufficient information to make it possible for it to form a conclusive judgment on the Government&#x2019;s programme of assistance to the countries in Africa or on the extent of the progress being made with relations between us and the countries of Africa.</p>

<p>There is one aspect of the hon. member for Edenvale&#x2019;s motion about which we do not have to do any guessing. You will see that the motion asks, <i>inter alia,</i> for greater co-operation between the rest of Africa and us in the social sphere. The late President Pompidou of France once said: &#x201C;To be sure, it is not enough merely to meet someone. You still have to understand them&#x201D;. Long distance political contact between leaders of States is good and it is necessary, and that is what is happening now. What the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs have done in recent times in this connection, will, I believe, undoubtedly have good consequences for South Africa in the long run, even if they do not fully succeed in achieving their objective as they would like to do.</p>

<p>Trade, the buying and selling of products between countries, also helps to ensure good relations between States. But without a mutual understanding of each other and without a broad social understanding between the people of the countries, it will be very difficult for the leaders of those countries to establish meaningful and enduring ties of friendship with each other. I want to explain what I mean by that with reference to an example. In communist states and other dictator states, where the state has full control over the mass communication media, it is the practice, when the leaders consider it to be in the interests of their countries to establish friendly relations with an old enemy, that the first thing they do is to try to influence the people in their own countries. The communication media are used to cultivate a new attitude towards the country concerned among the people in that country. This makes it easier for the leader to do his work on a higher level. Therefore this means that together with the attempts at leadership level, there is social influencing of the attitude of the masses in that country.</p>

<p>There is the interesting case of China and the United States of America. For years their doors were completely closed to each other; there was absolutely no contact between the two countries. When the leaders eventually decided to bring about a change in this relationship, America first sent a hand-picked table-tennis team to China. This broke the ice and created interest among the people in the country for better relations. This in turn made the road easier for the leaders to follow it up and to come together.</p>

<p>I am afraid that we in South Africa still completely underestimate the importance of this sort of action, especially in our attempts to normalize our relations with countries in Africa. Successful political relations are closely connected with social contacts and mutual social understanding. I am afraid&#x2014;and I must say it&#x2014;that our biggest problem in respect of better relations with the countries of Africa, will not be at leadership level, but among the people of the countries concerned also among our people, our White people. In fact, with the states of mind and attitudes of our people the problem is perhaps bigger than it is among the people in the rest of Africa. In the first place&#x2014;and this is something which one must face squarely&#x2014; there are the negative thinking which has existed for years in our country on the political level in connection with the Black man, negative thinking which has been created among people about the Black man. It has led to most Whites in South Africa seeing the Black man as a person with whom one cannot or must not associate normally.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterkloof said that the Opposition must make a contribution with its Press. I do not make what he meant by that; the Opposition does not have a Press at its beck and call, a Press it can tell to do this or that. I do not even <span class="col_2181-2182" refersTo="page_1106"/>think that that side of the House has a Press at its beck and call. Our Press is independent and even the organs of the National Party are independent of the Government. Nevertheless, the hon. member must not ask what contribution the Opposition can make. Of course we are pleased to make a contribution. The question is: What contribution is the Government making in the social sphere? I want to mention an example. At the moment we are being visited in South Africa by a very important Nigerian, Mr. Gbolabo Ogunsanwo, the editor of the largest weekend paper in Nigeria, a country of 80 million people. There are members sitting on this side and on that side of the House who talked to him and who held long discussions with him. He is a well-read and a well-travelled man and is also extremely intelligent. There is virtually no leader in Africa he has not yet met. He was regarded as so important here that the hon. the Prime Minister granted him a long interview, as did the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and also the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. A few days ago he left Cape Town on his way to the Transkei to meet Chief Kaiser Matanzima. What happened to him at East London? He was sent out of the dining room at the airport of East London because he is Black. Can you imagine what sort of image this event will take in his reports as a writer who sends reports back to the country with the largest population in Africa? I mention this point simply to illustrate something and this is that unless we correct the attitudes of our people and the Government begins with its own institutions, unless we can create a situation on the level of everyday contact so that a man&#x2019;s dignity will not be injured because he is Black, unless we can normalize the everyday relations between people of the different countries in Africa, there is little chance that the relations between our countries can be normalized.</p>

<p>I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister and ask whether he will be able to give us the assurance that this sort of harm which is done to South Africa through lack of action on the part of the Government, will cease. The hon. the Prime Minister often uses the argument&#x2014;he advances this argument to Black states as well, I think on his recent journey as well&#x2014;that other African states have normal relations with communist countries, although they differ violently with their internal policies, but with South Africa they do not want this because they differ with our internal policies. I must say that at the first glance this seems a fair standpoint and that it seems as if those who act in this way are guilty of maintaining double standards. The Black man of Africa&#x2014;and I have often asked this question; I asked it again now of the Black visitors who were here&#x2014;will tell you that if you want to understand the standpoint of the Black man in this matter, you must first put yourself in his place. Then you will understand his answer. He says that they are not interested in our system of government, whether we have a dictatorship or a military or a capitalistic form of government. They have dictatorships in Africa, something which one finds everywhere in the world. That does not concern them. What makes us in South Africa an exception in their eyes, is that a political and social system exists here which impairs the human dignity of the coloured person, simply because he is coloured. The Black and Coloured countries, according to their own standpoint, cannot remain indifferent to this.</p>

<p>Therefore I have to state once again that if we cannot bring about better understanding and normal contact between the people of our different countries in Africa in the social sphere, then the chances of our really being able to bring about normalization of relations between us and the countries of Africa, seem to me to be very slender.</p>

<p>I want to go further and say that if we want to achieve better co-operation with these countries of Africa, we will also have to set about causing a better understanding to take root among our people about what Africa really is. Among most of our people in South Africa&#x2014;I am sorry to say &#x2014;there is a profound ignorance about the rest of Africa, as well as a deeply-rooted misconceptions, and this is going to be one of the greatest obstacles to overcome if we want better relations. What is vaguely called Africa and its people arouses in the average South African the image of a mass of backwardness and mismanagement and corruption and of a condition of chaos and carnage prevailing almost everywhere. One only has to listen to the political talks on the radio to understand how our people are being influenced in that direction. Sir, we shall have to realize that if we are going to allow this negative image of Africa to continue to exist among our people, <span class="col_2183-2184" refersTo="page_1107"/>then the leaders at the highest level will not get much grass root support in their efforts to establish really sound and normal relations with the countries of Africa.</p>

<p>Therefore I believe that if our Government is really in earnest about establishing better relations, then it must launch a much more extensive programme than mere political contact with leaders at the highest level. In brief it is this: It will have to take the people of our country with it in its attempts to establish better relations. It will have to use the communication media over which it has control to establish a more balanced image of the rest of Africa among our people. Like all countries in the world, African countries have their less favourable side as well, but there is no more poverty in African countries than there is in Asia. There are no more dictatorships in Africa than there are in South America and Eastern Europe, there is no more corruption in Africa than there is in most Western countries, even here in our country.</p>

<p>We shall also have to encourage more human contact between us and other countries in Africa. It is extremely important that there be mutual contact to bring about better understanding. I had a question to the Department of Information on the Order Paper earlier in the session about the number of guests we received from abroad in the year 1974, there were altogether 164, <i>inter alia,</i> 28 from the U.S.A., 22 from Germany, 22 from the Netherlands, nine from Belgium, seven from Israel, but not a single one from our neighbour states or from other countries in Africa. I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, how many foreign Black students studied at South African Universities last year. The answer was 27, but all of them were at Black universities, except for one at the University of Natal and one at the University of Potchefstroom. Now, if we cannot even make the effort to bring our White students at our English and Afrikaans universities into contact with students from the rest of Africa so that there can be better understanding at that level, how are we going to achieve success in the sphere of better understanding between us and the rest of Africa? And then, of course, there is the cardinal requirement, and that is that everywhere in Africa the Blackman has reached a position where he feels personally free and where his human dignity is recognized and it is hopeless to expect that sound relations can be created between us and the rest of Africa if discrimination against the Black man is continued here. Therefore I think that a more extensive programme than mere contact between leaders is necessary if we are really in earnest about having better relations with the rest of Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the theme of the motion before this House is nothing new. On the contrary. It is a theme which has already been dealt with frequently in this House, and one which I myself have already discussed frequently. Approximately a month ago I dwelt on it fully during the no-confidence debate, and I therefore do not want to make myself guilty of repetition this afternoon.</p>

<p>I am glad that I have had the opportunity of listening to this debate. I found it particularly pleasant to listen to the visions for the future of some of the hon. members on both sides of the House. I cannot find fault with the motion, nor can I find fault with the amendment which was moved. In addition I think that the hon. member for Von Brandis would agree with me that the motion and the amendment are not at variance with each other. I appreciate the spirit of the amendment&#x2014;the ideas, the appraisals which are stated therein&#x2014;and I agree with the objectives put forward and advocated in the motion. I want to thank hon. members on both sides of this House for the appreciation conveyed to me and in particular to the hon. the Prime Minister for the very important work he has done and guidance he has given in this regard. I also want to thank hon. members for the words of appreciation to my department.</p>

<p>I personally welcome this debate, for foreign affairs are not frequently discussed in this House. I also welcome the fact that most speakers on the opposite side have apparently decided to turn over a new leaf, that they have decided that the time has arrived to be positive and constructive in regard to our foreign relations.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>In the past debates on foreign affairs in this House have frequently degenerated into debates on petty apartheid, something for which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has a great predilection and something which he very nearly dragged into his speech again today.</p>

<p>We on this side welcome new ideas. We welcome criticism, provided it is objective and constructive. My department and I also welcome it, because we are thoroughly aware that we do not have a monopoly of wisdom and that it would not be possible for us to achieve as much as we have already achieved if we were not able to rely on the support of our colleagues in virtually all the other Government departments as well. I have here a short résumé of the activities of our other Government departments in Africa, and you will be surprised to hear that it consists of no fewer than seven pages. South African Government departments are active in Africa in virtually every sphere. I need not furnish the details in this regard. Then, in addition, there is still a great variety of Government bodies, such as the C.S.I.R., the Bureau of Standards, the Industrial Development Corporation, the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation, the Institute for Medical Research and numerous other bodies which, are doing valuable work in regard to Africa.</p>

<p>However, I would be neglecting my duty if I did not also refer with appreciation to the valuable work which is being done by the private sector. I agree with the hon. member for Von Brandis that the private sector has a very important task in this regard. Fortunately a great deal is already being done. Obvious examples are the health services which are being rendered by the Rembrandt organization in the case of Lesotho, and by the Anglo-American group in Swaziland. I could also remind hon. members that the National Development and Management Foundation arranged a course some time ago which was attended by Government representatives and businessmen from various African states. It was a conference dealing with managerial techniques and was of great value to these people. On behalf of South Africa I want to thank all these persons and bodies, and the large number whom I cannot mention now, for the important work they are doing in this regard. They know, or ought to know, that my door and the doors of my department are always open to them. Consequently they make use of this opportunity. They consult us; they co-operate with us. Only last week I had a very useful talk with the president and the director of the Federated Chambers of Commerce. This is not exceptional at all. Ladies and gentleman &#x2026; [Interjections.] I beg your pardon, Mr. Speaker. On a Friday afternoon prior to political meetings one has to hold over the week-end, this is a natural mistake to make!</p>

<p>I could mention many examples of what action we are taking, but I do not want to take up the time of this House. I want to refer to only one or two examples. In particular I want to refer to the case of Lilongwe in Malawi because this illustrates how the South African Government handles applications for assistance from beyond our borders. What did we do when such a request was made by the Government of Malawi? We did not rush in at once and offer to be responsible for the entire scheme. We did not do that because we did not want to run the risk of helping to create a white elephant in Malawi. We instructed our experts, the then planning adviser to the Prime Minister with his staff, to institute an investigation in that regard. They made a thorough study <i>in loco</i> and reported to the Government that the possibility existed there of creating an important growth point in the central province of Malawi. So we decided to help. But we did not offer to undertake the entire scheme. We selected certain key aspects of that project, after consultation with Malawi, and concentrated on them in the hope and confidence that the interest of other Governments and other bodies would be aroused in this way and that they would also participate in the development of the capital. That is precisely what happened, and the consequences are that this capital has developed splendidly, that it is today the seat of the Malawian <span class="col_2187-2188" refersTo="page_1109"/>Government, that the diplomatic corps has also moved to Lilongwe and what is more, that a growth point has been created there which is stimulating development in the entire central province.</p>

<p>Nossi-Bé in Madagascar was a scheme which also offered great possibilities because it was the intention that the State and the private sector would tackle it together. As a result of factors beyond our control we could not proceed there. But you know, Sir, nothing is impossible in Africa and such a scheme could perhaps revive one day, or there could perhaps be co-operation in another sphere. There are still various other schemes which are under consideration, or in which we are engaged, and there are, too, the confidential schemes to which the hon. members referred. I really hope that the time will soon arrive when it will no longer be necessary for us on this side of the House to perform many of these transactions on a confidential basis. No one is more desirous than I that the House of Assembly should be informed of our activities in Africa. I shall appreciate it when that day arrives, and I hope that this will happen in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Today a great deal is being said about détente. Détente is the fashion today, a good fashion, and not one of us likes being out of fashion. The same applies to me, and for that reason I should also like to say a few words about détente in this debate. I want to give hon. members the assurance this evening that the Government is according the highest priority to the promotion of détente through dialogue. It is the object of the Government to try to eliminate confrontation and problems which make co-operation difficult or impossible, for hon. members will agree with me that where tension exists, co-operation is difficult, and where hostility exists, co-operation is quite impossible. What it amounts to in practice is that however attractive and beneficial a specific project may be to all the parties, that project is stillborn if the climate is not right and if the goodwill and the willingness to co-operate is not present on both sides. This was pointed out in a very excellent manner by the hon. member for Waterkloof. In this regard I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Edenvale said. Specifically I want to issue a warning and say that true friendship cannot be bought. Friendship that has been bought means nothing and is of short duration. It is not something of a permanent nature. What is more, friendship that has been bought is out of keeping with our national character and is also out of keeping with the nature of the peoples in Africa with whom we should like to co-operate. We are all proud peoples and set great store by our honour. For that reason it is the basic endeavour of this Government&#x2014;I cannot emphasize this sufficiently&#x2014;to seek and to bring about peace and friendship. If this could happen, the rest, also the matters mentioned by the hon. introducer of the motion, will follow far more easily.</p>

<p>Fortunately it is a fact that we are not the only ones in Africa, nor in the world, who desire peace in Africa. We are not the only ones who are prepared, and who are working positively, to achieve this. We are encountering that willingness and that desire almost everywhere in Africa, wherever we make contacts. This applies in the first place to our three Black neighbours and to Malawi, with whom we have been maintaining fruitful, friendly relations for a long time. It applies to those African leaders who, together with us, are trying to make it possible for the leaders of the Whites and the non-Whites in Rhodesia to convene around a conference table, to tackle their problems together and, together, find a satisfactory solution to them. That willingness exists on their part. The same also applies to the esteemed President Tolbert of Liberia and those other statesmen who discuss these matters with us on a confidential basis. Those of us who had the privilege of accompanying the hon. the Prime Minister to Liberia were all impressed by the earnestness, the determination, the idealism with which President Tolbert and his Ministers approach the problems of Africa, and by their determination and their belief that the problems of Africa must and can be solved in a peaceful manner.</p>

<p><span class="col_2189-2190" refersTo="page_1110"/>Although progress is being made in the direction of detente, difficult obstacles still await us, obstacles which we still have to overcome. I do not want to elaborate on that now&#x2014;it is late on a Friday afternoon. However, I want to state unequivocally here that there will be setbacks from time to time. However, we should not flinch from or be discouraged by this. We must accept that the graph will occassionally go down, but we must also realize that the trend is an upward one. This is encouraging. It is in fact surprising, for we are dealing with a situation and with problems which have developed over many years. The arrest last Tuesday of the Rev. Sithole, one of the ANC leaders in Rhodesia, may be such a setback. Together with President Tolbert, and together with all others who are seeking peaceful solutions to the problems of Africa, we are now awaiting the outcome of the judicial inquiry which has already been announced by Mr. Smith. We realize that Mr. Smith and his Government have difficult problems, but we sincerely hope that they will overcome those problems and that it will yet be possible for them to have a criminal trial take place.</p>

<p>When will it take place?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is being said that the judicial inquiry will take place within 14 days, but I cannot confirm that. It is a pity that a situation has arisen in Rhodesia which has led to the arrest of one of the Black leaders two days before the announced talks with Mr. Smith&#x2019;s Government were to have commenced. As a result of those events, the talks have been called off by the ANC. Mr. Smith has informed us of the circumstances which forced him to take this step. He assured us that he has irrefutable evidence, and was compelled to take action to protect the lives of other ANC leaders and that, seen from his point of view, he did not by so doing wish to impede détente, but wished to advance it. All of us who have an interest in it are in the meantime giving this entire matter our urgent attention. We shall continue our efforts to try to eliminate obstacles, and hope and trust that any setbacks, of whatever nature they may be, will only be temporary. I do not want to say anything further about this, for it is necessary for all of us who have to discuss critical matters such as these, to weigh our words. One of the problems in Rhodesia was in fact that Mr. Sithole, and others as well, clouded the issues by constantly making statements. I want to reiterate that South Africa will leave no stone unturned to try to help eliminate obstacles in the way of détente. We shall persist in our efforts because we realize what will happen if confrontation and violence are allowed to escalate. We realize that if an armed conflict should take place, no one will emerge victorious from the struggle. The consequences of such an event would be disastrous, not only for one party, but for everyone involved, including those who so readily invoke confrontation when the course which matters are taking is not to their liking. But surely confrontation and conflict are no solution to problems. Allow me to say here today with all the conviction at my disposal: Those who are responsible for the outbreak of large-scale violence in Southern Africa, will be guilty of an act of despair such as that of Samson of old. It is something which must be avoided at all costs. That is our first task. That is the challenge facing us and the other leaders in Africa today. It will be of no avail to rush precipitately into all spheres now. It would at this stage be foolish to act in such a manner. Such action could hold more disadvantages than advantages. I accept, too, that hon. members on the opposite side do not support or advocate such conduct. This does not mean that we should now sit back with our arms folded because the climate is not yet right or because détente has not yet succeeded. It does not mean that we need no longer continue to put our heads together and give thought to the problems, as we are trying to do here today. This is what my department and I, as well as other Government departments, are constantly doing. Our actions should be of such a nature that we are not caught unprepared if détente should succeed and we have to <span class="col_2191-2192" refersTo="page_1111"/>operate in a wider sphere in future than has been the case up to now.</p>

<p>There is not very much more time left, and I shall therefore not dwell fully on all the speeches which were made. However, I agree with the hon. member for Edenvale and with most of the other speakers who emphasized that South Africa has a very important role to play in Africa. I agree with the hon. member that we ought to be doing far more. The initiatives mentioned by the introducer of the motion were interesting. Several of them are already being applied in an amended form and others are under consideration, but owing to the status of certain of our neighbouring states, and also owing to the disposition of some of them, the time for some of the hon. member&#x2019;s proposals is not yet ripe.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis advocated a transport organization for Southern Africa. To him I have to give the same reply. Such an organization could be established with great advantage provided we could persuade these states to join. I hope that something of this nature will in fact be possible in future. I also agree with what the hon. member said concerning the duty resting on private initiative. I may say that we had a good example of cooperation between a Government body and private initiative in the case of the development of the mineral resources of Botswana. I am thinking here of the IDC and private companies which made it possible for Botswana to exploit its rich mineral resources.</p>

<p>The hon. member advocated that we should not neglect the French-speaking states of Africa. I can give him the assurance that my department and I, and the Government, agree with him. I can also assure him that they are not being neglected. I wish I could take the hon. member into my confidence in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown made the statement, which is of course true, that our relations with Africa are to a very large extent interdependent on our internal policy. I do not want to debate this point with the hon. member. In any case there is insufficient time to do so. What I can in fact tell him, is that we on this side of the House have every confidence in our policy. We are determined to apply that policy consistently throughout. We believe that we are able to enter into and maintain friendly relations with Africa precisely as a result of our policy. This would not have been the case if the party of that hon. member had been in power. His party&#x2019;s policy is not acceptable to Africa. All he need do is consider what is happening north of the Limpopo and what the reaction is to a similar policy which is being applied there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout complained bitterly about my being so secretive. I am obliged to be so. He compared our position with that of the powerful United States of America, where full reports are given on foreign relations. Our position cannot be compared to that of America&#x2019;s. Our position is not yet normal. We are hard at work, and I think we are going to succeed, in normalizing South Africa&#x2019;s position. I think this could happen sooner than the hon. member perhaps imagines. Then we shall keep the hon. member informed in all respects and take him into our confidence in all respects.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there was a departure from normal tradition in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s presentation of the Budget which has passed almost unnoticed but to which I would like to refer. I am referring to the use of both official languages in the same speech.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The second point to which I want to refer is that since presenting his Budget to this House last year, the post of the assistant to the hon. the Minister, that of Deputy Minister of Transport, has been abolished. This means that a greater load is now being placed upon the hon. the Minister. I want to say that when I myself look around at the talent that was available, I do not blame the hon. the Prime Minister for having abolished the post. I think that the hon. the Minister is far better off taking everything on himself. It does, however, mean additional work and we will look to the hon. the Minister to carry this double burden.</p>

<p>*My first reaction to the Budget last Wednesday remains completely unchanged. This Budget is a drab and unimaginative Budget. There is not one single idea which bears testimony to a new vision. There is not even a R50 item in the Brown Book which indicates that we have something new here, that there are any new ideas here, that the Railways are going to embark on a new course. However, there are two remarkable items I may mention. The one is a new pipeline from Durban to Johannesburg for oil products, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister why that pipeline was not constructed from Richards Bay to Johannesburg. We were told that the large oil tankers were going to use Richards Bay. Why were those pipelines therefore not constructed from Richards Bay? In that way we would be able to eliminate the installation at Durban, to get rid of the pollution taking place there and place the whole matter under proper control.</p>

<p>The second large amount which appears in the Budget, is in respect of the purchase of new aircraft. The hon. the Minister is unable to tell us at this stage what type of aircraft they are going to be although the amount has been earmarked for aircraft. Except for these two new items, the pipeline and the aircraft only a little was added here and there&#x2014;the erection of an umbrella roof at some or other place, a toilet room, new equipment and general improvements here and there. As far as new items are concerned, there is, however, nothing of any importance. Large amounts of money for rolling stock and harbours. For Richards Bay, for example, the amount is more than R100 million. However, these are only additions to the existing scheme; this is additional. I have looked for something which would bear witness to a new way of thinking as far as the activities of the Railways are concerned.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with the analysis, I also have to refer to the fact that this Budget does not help the Railway pensioner at all. The working person, the person who is able to better his position and who is able to work a few hours overtime, the person who is able to attain a higher position, may be able to keep pace with the increasing cost of living, but this the pensioner cannot do. He has a fixed income. Even if it is not possible to increase salaries, the Government has a responsibility towards the pensioner. Some of them do receive the 2% increase, but not all of them do; only some of them do. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that all Railway pensioners should receive an annual increase of 10% to enable them to keep pace with the rising cost of living. Fifteen per cent would be more realistic, but I do not want to make too high a demand on the hon. the Minister. All I am asking is for something to be done for the pensioner to give him a chance to keep up as far as the rising cost of living is concerned. There are also some of the Railway officials who do not receive any incentive for increased productivity from this <span class="col_2195-2196" refersTo="page_1113"/>Budget. I want to analyse it a little further later on.</p>

<p>One is always able to learn something. Firstly, I want to consider in which way the Nationalist Party, when it was in opposition, approached the whole matter of Railways and Harbours.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I know it was a long time ago. However, I thought I could learn from history, from the manner in which the Nationalist Party Opposition of those days approached their responsibility towards this service and the country. I did some searching and found an official document, an official document drawn up by Mr. J. J. Hayward, M.P., and published by the Information Service of the Nationalist Party&#x2014;at the time the HNP, the Herenigde Nasionale Party. In this pamphlet one reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Livelihood of Whites on the Railways threatened.</block>

<p>Sir, after I had read this pamphlet, I decided that if I were to quote from it, South Africa would be so shocked that it would be better if I hid it away in the dark, shameless past of the Nationalist Party. But Sir, there are a few interesting things I want to refer to. I want to refer to the attitude of that side of the House, as an Opposition, adopted towards expenditure. This is what they said with reference to the United Party Government (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Government has recklessly caused Railway expenditure to increase to the tune of £50 million per annum.</block>

<p>Recklessly, Sir! Mr. Speaker, one of the other accusations levelled was the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Millions of pounds are being spent on harbour works from the Loan Account.</block>

<p>Sir, what an accusation! Wasting of money; millions of pounds spent on harbour works and that in support of the war effort! Sir, we shall later come back to the harbours and these millions which were spent by the United Party Government. I also want to quote what they had to say about a new post that was created at the time (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>The United Party Government has created a completely new post, that of Chief Superintendent (parliamentary) at a salary of £1 600 per annum.</p>

<p>In this way the United Party recklessly wasted the money of the taxpayer! But, Sir, there is another side to the coin and this, strange enough, is important, because in those days, as far as I know, there were no such phenomenons as the Reformists, and so on. After referring to the negrophiles and the liberalists, they quoted what was said by Mr. Sturrock in the Assembly and they quoted the Hansard column (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He declared himself wholeheartedly in favour of appointing non-Whites in graded posts on the Railways.</block>

<p>Sir, this party made its point of view clear as long ago as 1943. I want to repeat today that, after 32 years, we still adhere to that policy, i.e. that all South Africans should be used in the service of the Railways. I want to repeat what I said on Wednesday, and that is that where this Government does the right thing we shall give them our full support. Sir, just consider what a shocking thing the United Party was supposed to have done&#x2014;I quote from Hansard (column 2299), what was said by Mr. Sturrock&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to improve non-European conditions and wages.</block>

<p>Sir, after 33 years I say again that we welcome the fact that this Minister and his Administration, after all these years, are doing the things the United Party did in 1943. We congratulate them. It is a matter of better late than never. We shall continue to support them for as long as they are taking these forward steps.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, let me now come back to the specifics of this Budget. Last year we dealt with long-term planning. We called for an inquiry, a call which was rejected in very strong terms by the hon. the Minister. We called for a full inquiry into planning and the co-ordination of the South African Railways. The hon. the Minister, echoed by officials, said that there was no need for this at all; that all the planning that was necessary was taking place; that <span class="col_2197-2198" refersTo="page_1114"/>they were prepared to talk individually to individuals and organizations and that there was no need for an inquiry. Sir, this was only in September last year. Imagine my amazement when I read on 27 February that the General Manager of Railways had called for the establishment of a top-level planning body representing all sections of the economy to analyse major development projects and suggest priorities to the Cabinet. Was that not what we suggested last year, Sir? We suggested an inquiry into the co-ordination and planning of the Railways. I would refer the hon. the Minister to Column 3549 of the debate in September last year, where I specifically suggested that the Railway Board could be abandoned in its present form and that it could become a planning organization, a planning organization which I visualize as a body co-ordinating the Railways, commerce, industry, mining, finance, with planning experts and specialist advisers in different fields serving on it. Here we have a body which is ready-made to act as a planning and co-ordinating body. But when we suggested it last year, it was nonsense; now we find that it is a necessary requirement; that it is essential that we should have some such planning body to deal with shortages, scarcity of capital, priorities, etc., etc. Sir, as I said a little earlier, it takes time, but eventually some of our ideas do get through. I wonder whether we would lose much through that reconstruction. I have here the report of the Railways and Harbours Board, the latest one, for the year ended 31 December 1973. Except for the first chapter, which dealt with meetings of the board, and two paragraphs which dealt with disciplinary appeals, the whole of the rest of this report was simply a repetition of what one could read in the General Manager&#x2019;s report; it dealt with the carrying capacity of the Railways, the Operating section, Electrification, Airways, Finances, etc. This is all already in the General Manager&#x2019;s report. Why not convert this board from a duplicate rubber-stamp, or an advisory body to the Minister, into a real planning organization? Sir, 500 copies of this report were published and they were sold at R3-35 each. I want to ask the hon. the Minister how many copies of this report were sold at R3-35. I am prepared to take a bet that outside of relatives or friends and a few organizations which had to have the report, it was not a Government bestseller.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this question of planning is one in respect of which we do not seem to be on the same wavelength as the hon. the Minister. I am not talking now of the specific planning of a project, of the plans or the drawings of a station or a building or a specific plan for a harbour. I am talking of the broader spectrum; I am talking of the overall planning. Sir, the hon. the Minister in his Budget Speech this year repeated that the role of the S.A. Railways and Harbours was to provide an efficient infrastructure, an efficient transport system, and he emphasized that its welfare was determined by the economy. We, Sir, try to have a broader approach; we try to look beyond the mere meeting of specific demands. I want to be fair. Within the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s perimeter progress has been made. Mechanization, modernization, new methods, better labour utilization&#x2014;all these things have happened, and we congratulate the department on it. On would expect it. I want to say that there is an outstanding Management available to the Minister and to the department. There are people with the ability and the qualifications to keep the Railways up to date in most of these fields. So I am not criticizing the detail; I am looking at the broader picture. I say that whilst within the perimeter of merely being a service there have been improvements, we believe that it should go beyond that. Let them be fair too, even in this planning I think the United Party can claim some contribution. In the use of labour I have shown how way back from 1943 this has been the approach of the United Party. Then there is harbour control. Last year the hon. the Minister said in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to state categorically that I can find no valid argument for divorcing the harbours from other services.</block>

<p>That was in September 1974, but on 4 December, in the General Manager&#x2019;s report on page 61, we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<p>Last year there was absolutely no valid argument for any divorcing of the harbours. Yet within six months we find a port director, port managers and a Nasionale Raadgewende Komitee to co-ordinate all interests affected. In the Minister&#x2019;s speech last week we heard of&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Gespesialiseerde amptenare aan die hoof van alle aspekte van die werksaamhede.</block>

<p>In other words, what we pleaded for, not necessarily the breaking away under a separate port authority, but the divorcing of control to a specialized administration has taken place; in all material respects in the day to day running that has happened. There are other examples, which I do not have time to follow up, Sir, but to return to this idea of the overall role. I want to put our attitude very clearly by moving the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the <i>Railways and Harbours Appropriation Bill</i> because, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></block>

<ol>

<li>(a) it fails to reveal an appreciation by the Government of the role of the South African Railways as the dynamic in the development of South Africa and of Southern Africa as a whole; and</li>

<li>(b) it fails to stimulate morale or provide incentives to productivity for many grades of employees or adequately to compensate pensioners in the light of the ever-escalating cost of living,&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>This sets out our approach, Sir, the Railways and Harbours as the dynamic for growth. The question is what ought our objective to be. Is it simply to meet the demand, simply to be able to meet traffic demands, or is it to lead? Are the Railways to be the instigator, the leader of growth and development, or are they to follow along behind?</p>

<p>I want to give two examples, Mr. Speaker. I want to say at once that the Administration is bound by Government policy, which provides these two examples. One of the major development projects in South Africa, with far-reaching social and economic implications, is the Sishen-Saldanha development scheme, which includes a railway and a harbour. And yet here, in a major economic scheme, the S.A. Railways and Harbours are not even participating. It is essentially a rail and a harbour undertaking, and this illustrates what I mean. Are the Railways to be seen as a dynamic, or simply as a follower, as an also-ran? Here, in a field which is essentially their own field, they have been bypassed and pushed to one side. I believe it is unthinkable, if the Railways are to play their part as a dynamic of development, that this should have been possible. Now contrast this with Richards Bay, where the Railways are playing their part, and where this year R116 million is being injected into all the aspects of that work as a dynamic to development. This is what we mean by being the dynamic. Here the Railways have not been shunted aside as they were in the case of Saldanha. Here they were the instigators, the initiators, of growth and were not simply the &#x201C;agterryers&#x201D;. You only need to look at the railway map of South Africa, Mr. Speaker, to see that wherever there is railway development there is economic development. Or is it vice versa? That is the issue. That is the question posed by our amendment, whether railway development has followed economic development or whether it has initiated1 it. When you look at the railway map for the rest of Southern Africa, Capricorn Africa, you see the true potential of the part the Railways could play. Starting in South Africa, they could become the base for an integrated transport system throughout Southern Africa. When you look at the vast empty spaces on the map you think of the vast potential that lies there. Bearing this in mind. I hope I am making myself clear when I say that we see the Railways as the dynamic and not merely as the follower. But. Sir, the Railways are toothless and powerless because the Railways live on a hand to mouth basis. They are dependent for their existence on 2% of 20% of traffic&#x2014;the high&#x002D;rated traffic. A variation of 1% or 2% in high-rated traffic can make the difference between profit and loss on the Railways. That is the degree of sensitivity of the Railways economy. They can be crippled by a <span class="col_2201-2202" refersTo="page_1116"/>temporary economic slow-down. The harbours can clog up if Iscor imports steel. Ten per cent of the imports over the last year have been steel in Durban, enough to have a serious effect on the harbour. That harbour can jam up if a neighbouring port goes on the blink. This is all part of Government policy&#x2014;this making of the Railways so dependent on a very finely tuned traffic pattern.</p>

<p>Another factor, of course, is the capital structure. Other speakers will deal with this aspect. When you think that we have R3 228 million of interest-bearing capital investment and only R472 million of non-interest-bearing capital investment, then you realize the burden placed on the Administration. This is a field at which we have to look. If other State utilities need development, then the State buys shares and it can off-set those shares against the depreciation of its assets. There is a balance. Every time the Railways have spent R1 of capital since 1910 that capital has remained for ever an interest burden on the Railway user. Things bought for our grandfathers and long out of operation are still part of the capital burden, the interest burden on the Railway user. Because of this situation, the Railways are unable to really move out. They travel with half empty trains, because they cannot afford to gamble because passenger traffic is carried at a loss. The balance is so fine that they cannot play with this.</p>

<p>Why cannot we have in South Africa the same sort of thing as in Europe like the &#x201C;eurailpass,&#x201D; a ticket where for some £90 odd one can travel anywhere on the European rail service for 15 days? For £117 one can buy a ticket to travel anywhere within a period of 21 days. Australia is also introducing this system, a pass with which you can travel anywhere on the Australian Railways. But we cannot risk such imaginative ideas. We have an air-hotel tour, but this is about the only thing, apart from special trains and special tour parties. I believe there are so many things we could do if we really wanted to go out and look for business, if we were not perpetually looking at this fine balance of whether we can afford it or not.</p>

<p>We appreciate that the hon. the Minister has had problems. Other speakers on this side will deal with many of them, problems with capital and staff. I want to deal with only one other aspect, viz. some of the things&#x2014;I want to put it fairly strongly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">which I feel have been &#x201C;put across&#x201D; us. We sympathize where unforeseeable problems crop up, but we are not the Nationalist Party caucus and so we do not like &#x201C;quick ones&#x201D; being put across us. We are not a blind rubber stamp. I want to refer to one of these things. When one studies the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech again it is like the housewife who goes into the kitchen and finds a broken cup. It was not the girl who washed up, not the umfaan and none of the children. It is always the man who was not there. It is always Mr. Nobody&#x2019;s fault, it is the other person who is responsible.</block>

<p>Mr. W. V. RAW. Yes, Mr. I-do-not-know. How correct the hon. member is. So we find all sorts of excuses. We have some reasons, but also a lot of excuses. I want to refer to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech where he said that part of the problem in our harbours was the unforeseen volume of cargo. I quote the following:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Mens kan slegs &#x2019;n behoorlike beeld van die ongekende vermeerdering in gehanteerde vrag kry deur die 1974 syfers met dié van 1972 te vergelyk.</block>

<p>He then goes on to say what they are. But this is hiding the facts. The hon. the Minister has taken a valley, a low point in traffic, and has compared it with the highest point and then tried to indicate this as his problem. One does not compare a low point with a high point to get a true picture. This is what I call trying to put one across on us. It is not a true presentation of a graph or of a growth factor. I do not have time to deal with it, but other members will. However, this is the sort of thing that we do not like.</p>

<p>We are told of the tremendous delay due to the weather and that 3 128 crane hours have been lost in Durban as a result. I totalled up how many cranes there are in Durban and found there were 200, which means 15,6 hours, i.e. less than two shifts lost when allocated per crane. This is a responsible Parliament and we do not have to bluff each other with globular figures that give the impression that rain has held up the working, has slowed up ships&#x2014;in fact, has held everything back. &#x2026; [Interjection.] We find that the hon. the Minister laid great stress on planning in the harbours <span class="col_2203-2204" refersTo="page_1117"/>last year. This year, however, he says that he has no reliable information, &#x201C;geen betroubare inligting&#x201D;.

<p>No, we were told that it was an average of between one and two days. The hon. the Minister nods his head &#x2014;that is the delay. I want him to tell this House and South Africa why the Government allows the Conference lines to make a congestion surcharge which will run into some R80 million over a full year because of congestion when the average delay is between one and two days. Who is bluffing whom? The Conference lines? I believe that it might well be. I hope that the hon. the Minister will make this very clear indeed, because R80 million more out of the taxpayers&#x2019; pockets could have given us an awful lot more work on harbours and railways. So one can go on, but my time is running out.</p>

<p>I want to refer very briefly to the two-shift system, which was &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; a year ago and which is now working perfectly. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister in this regard, because one group has been left out of this. I was accused of claiming that railwaymen were dishonest when I said that if you paid them a decent basic wage, overtime would not be needed. What is happening now is exactly what we proposed. The railwayman who is working on the two-shift system is getting three hours &#x201C;free overtime&#x201D; and in eight hours is doing the same as he was doing in 12 hours, because when you work 12 hours a day you are too darn tired to continue at pressure but when you work eight hours a day, you can do a full day&#x2019;s work. That system is working, but the floating staff has been left out in the cold. In order to keep up with this two-shift system, the floating staff are still working a 48-hour week compared with the 40-hour week for quay staff, plus the 15 hours free overtime they are getting. I ask the hon. the Minister to put the floating staff on to the same shift basis, namely 40 hours per week, so that they can play their part and not be the people carrying the burden for nothing. Other speakers will develop our case; my time has run out.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has just transpired that the hon. member for Durban Point had no point to make and now I am expected to react to that. The only thing we heard from the hon. member was that there was a lack of something new in respect of planning and the Railway Budget. I see in that nothing but a sly projection of an obsession and a complex, because I know of a specific group to whose ranks nothing new has been added but from whose ranks a lot has been taken away. I am referring to the ranks of the United Party, the official Opposition. The hon. member made a condescending remark which I find very interesting. He said an increase in rates of only 1 % or 2% in respect of certain commodities determined whether the Railways was run on a profitable or non-profitable basis. The poor hon. member has forgotten, however, that on previous occasions in this House he was one of the strongest opponents of increases in rates. How is one to understand and comprehend the logic and the reasoning of that party? If hon. members will permit me, I want to repeat that the hon. member for Durban Point stood up without any point <span class="col_2205-2206" refersTo="page_1118"/>to make while the bugger-all behind him flourished.</p>

<p>As far as the Railways is concerned in contrast to the United Party, we are concerned with a giant in the South African economy and in the South African set-up. This giant is the South African Railways. This giant has proved, as is evident from reports and facts before us, that it is able to cope with all the work it is offered. It has proved itself as an institution which sees to the interests of its staff, both White and non-White, as well as an institution which is able to adapt itself to the demands of a rapidly developing world. This, in the true sense of the word, is in fact what we are concerned with this afternoon. As against this we heard from the hon. member about a stumbling mule on his way to nowhere, wandering about aimlessly, purposelessly and with a total lack of direction. This is something which is typical and symbolic of that party, i.e. a stumbling, scraggy mule heading straight for the desert. We heard the very same story once more this afternoon, one I know by heart by this time, i.e. the refrain, that the Budget and its planning were hopeless and that the poor pensioner was suffering so many hardships. That is what we heard. To my mind these people learn so slowly and so badly. I can recall what we heard from the predecessor of the hon. member in this House in the year 1969. He said the Budget was hopeless, so much so that it was not worthwhile presenting it to this House; the planning was hopeless and &#x201C;Why be so petty with pensioners?&#x201D; etc. I am referring to Hansard of 10 March 1969 (column 2189) and earlier debates, in other words exactly five years ago and longer today. So it is old fare that is being dished up here today.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. B. SCHOEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We shall come to the question of how right you were. I repeat that to my mind they learn rather slowly and are becoming boring now. The predecessor of the hon. member for Durban Point in the position of main speaker of the Opposition in this debate did at least learn a little bit. I corrected him slightly in the same debate on 10 March 1969 with regard to his faulty remarks concerning the Budget. After all, the Budget forms part and parcel of planning and is its basis. Budgeting, financing and execution are the soul of planning. We heard that the Budget was hopeless and that it was not worthwhile presenting it to this House. I pointed out to the predecessor of the hon. member for Durban Point in 1969 that it was generally accepted in the business world in South African and throughout the world today that, where a Budget showed a difference of plus 5 % or minus 5 % in the business world, it was regarded as a good Budget. Where there was a difference of 2%, the budget was regarded as a perfect budget.</p>

<p>But what story did we hear here? The Minister had announced that he was budgeting for a surplus of something exceeding R7,08 million. Since there now is a surplus exceeding R30 million this allegedly was such a black sin, such a swindle. They asked how efficient people could possibly go about things in this way. If one has regard to the fact that the turnover of the Railways according to the Budget amounted to R2 630 million for the past year, it appears that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s so-called blunder comes to exactly 0,72%. So it is a spot-on Budget, a 100% Budget. And yet those hon. members come along and wax lyrical about the Budget being ridiculous, haphazard and hopeless. Really, we are long past that stage! This makes me feel discouraged this afternoon. A former member for Yeoville is sitting with us now. He listened when I spoke to him five years ago. That is why he is sitting on our side of the House today and in a very respected bench. The second and present hon. member for Yeoville also left the official Opposition. So what can one expect from that party when it comes to an argument such as this which concerns scientific and professional standpoints?</p>

<p>The second refrain, one we know well, was: &#x201C;Why be so petty with the pensioners? &#x201D; In this regard, too, they gave a somewhat incorrect and slanted representation of the truth. They waxed lyrical about the increase of 2% while food prices in particular had increased by 20% and the cost of living in general had increased by from 14% to 15%. They went on to speak of the meagre, piggardly concession of 2% per year to the pensioners. They said it was an offence and a sin.</p>

<p>I object to the United Party dragging this sensitive and emotional matter of pensioners, of people no longer able to hit back through the application of energy, across the floor of this House in this manner for the sake of political gain. I think the time has arrived for the hon. members on the opposite side to grow up also as far as this is concerned. After all, they know that we have every sympathy with the pensioners. On behalf of this side of the House I want to say to the pensioners that we are only too aware of the difficult times, which they, in common with all of us, are experiencing, and I want to ask them to be patient and to trust the Government and this Minister. As he did in the past, he will see to the interests of the pensioners in his own time. After all, adjustments have been made very regularly. When salary increases take place, the interests of the pensioners are seen to as well. There is not only the 2% of this year. On several occasions these pensioners received increases of 10% and 15% so as to assist them to make ends meet. I want to repeat that in my opinion it is unreasonable and indeed a pity that the Opposition adopted this standpoint in this regard. If it is taken into consideration that a pensioner or an annuitant who left the service of the Railways in October 1958 received an increase of 131% up to 1974&#x2014;the ordinary 2% plus the adjustments that were effected from time to time&#x2014;and that during the same period according to the statistics of the Reserve Bank, the cost of living rose by only 83 %, in other words a difference of 50% in favour of the pensioner, why make this unreasonable, unjust and unaccountable dig? These pensioners are people who deserve our respect and sympathy. They are also people who have up to now received the hand of friendship of this Government in regard to Railway matters. It is no wonder that that party, while it adopts this standpoint in connection with Budgets and policy, had the experience they did in its most recent history. They cannot even budget for their own matters; they cannot even place the right evaluation on the will of the electorate of South Africa. Then they wish to join in the conversation in this company! I think it is a pity. I recall what D. F. Malherbe said in connection with something else (translation), &#x201C;How I am made to suffer till the small hours of the morning&#x201D;, and I add, by the ineffectiveness of an opposition party in the politics of South Africa.</p>

<p>There was a further accusation that was made in connection with the pensioner. It was said that the pensioner was not receiving anything of this unforeseen surplus of more than R30 million, because it was going to the Rates Equalization Fund. They said it was going to the Rates Equalization Fund and the Railway worker who had worked for it would not be getting any of it. I still recall how they exclaimed with clenched fists in the past, &#x201C;What are you doing now?&#x201D; When it was necessary in the past to use the Rates Equalization Fund so as to avoid increases in rates, and also, indirectly, in respect of salary increases for the Railway workers, the Opposition asked us, &#x201C;What are you doing now?&#x201D; They said this Rates Equalization Fund was the premium, the insurance policy of the Railway official, that we were making it bankrupt and that we were not allowed to do that. They said it was a swindle. Now the hon. Minister comes along and says that since the Rates Equalization Fund has a balance of just over R2 million, he is going to pay the surplus of R30 million into that fund, and now he is being reproached on that score. Now it is a sin whereas in the past their main plea was that this Rates Equalization Fund be kept as strong as possible. How they change their standpoint, and not only their standpoint, as far as policy is concerned. To me this seems to hold good of their arguments as well, hour after hour and day after day. Small wonder things are going with them as they do. I recall the days when they told us to implement the recommendations of the Schumann Commission to the effect that certain categories of traffic had to pay for themselves. They also said that the Railways was no welfare organization and that we should subsidize some of these things from State revenue. Arguments like these are still well-known to us. As though subsidies and support from the State Revenue Fund does not come out of the pocket of the taxpayer too! These are strange arguments which hold no water.</p>

<p>Sir, the Railways is generally accepted today as being the biggest single employer in this country, and we cannot but speak with great praise of its policy in connection with incentives, training and increasing productivity. Reference has already been made here to what the Railways did to increase the productivity of officials and the productivity <span class="col_2209-2210" refersTo="page_1120"/>of this institution as a whole. Sir, the staff of the Railways numbered 187 000 in 1948; in 1958 it numbered 231 000, and from 1958 to 1974 there was no improvement; they could not even make up backlog, but in spite of this the Railways probably is one of the few institutions in the country that is able to boast of having succeeded, through proper planning, through the mechanization of certain of their labour activities, through the introduction of computers, through the simplification of working methods, etc., in increasing productivity by approximately 2,5% per annum from 1958 to 1974. Sir, I ask the Opposition speakers, in their superficial cleverness, to give us in this debate a better example of efficiency. Sir, these are facts that can be checked. The Opposition makes the ridiculous accusation that there is no building up of morale; that there is no incentive to higher productivity.</p>

<p>When they are in power we accused them of wasting money. They obviously did not spend a great deal of money on improving the position of the staff, but they did try to waste money in other respects, for example, on the Hex River tunnel that was never built.</p>

<p>The difference is that we can afford it now. Sir, apart from the improvement of salaries that took place, the conditions of service of the staff were improved as well; the grades were improved; salaried status was awarded to station masters, signalmen, drivers, constables and sergeants, etc., and this improved their leave and other benefits in that they came on to the salaried payroll from the wage schedule. Sir, in view of the shortage of staff the Railways took other measures as well to meet this problem. <i>Inter alia,</i> it replaced Whites by non-Whites. We are aware of the fact that there are 4 500 non-Whites today who replaced Whites in approximately 40 different grades in the railway service. Sir, this is a realistic, practical policy testifying to planning, adaptability and a progressive view. Since a shortage of White employees existed, to the detriment of the Railways, other schemes were also implemented to meet this problem. This was done by employing non-White workers in White jobs temporarily with the approval, assistance and co-operation of the staff associations concerned. This policy is being implemented very strictly and Whites are not replaced by non-Whites without the approval of the staff associations concerned, and at head office a job allocation committee has been established to see to these matters. We have peace and harmony and prosperity for the sake of higher productivity. Other schemes have also been put into operation, such as assistant artisans&#x2019; schemes, train marshallers&#x2019;, schemes, trackmen&#x2019;s schemes, sorters&#x2019; schemes, in which connection 7 300 non-Whites have also been employed in jobs in which there was a shortage of White workers. And what impresses me. Sir, is that as far as these non-White employees are concerned, they, too, have now received a compulsory pension scheme. This is a further development of the compulsory saving scheme of several years ago, and now only casual labourers and foreign Bantu are excluded therefrom. In this connection the Administration contributes to the scheme on a rand-for-rand basis. This policy testifies to insight, good relations, goodwill and the creation of security in the ranks of the labour force of the Railways. Here we may just refer to the employment of women as well. As many as 1 000 women have already been appointed to jobs, such as checkers, crane drivers, constables, ticket examiners, etc., something which is meeting this problem with good results.</p>

<p>Then there is harbour handling. The hon. member said there had been no growth <span class="col_2211-2212" refersTo="page_1121"/>and nothing new, but we have taken cognizance of the fact that with the exception of East London there has been an increase of more than 50% in goods handled in all harbours. In Lourenço Marques there has been a decrease of 40% and in East London the increase has been 44,6%. Is this not something new? Is this not growth? Is this not development? Is this not proof of an endeavour to render service? You know, Mr. Speaker, in the days of the United Party Government one could still speak of the &#x201C;Railways&#x201D;, the &#x201C;Railways&#x201D; that could be covered with a khaki blanket on which was printed in bold letters &#x201C;Please do not tamper with or open this&#x201D; because &#x201C;Remember there is a war on&#x201D;. But we are long past that stage.</p>

<p>I said at the outset that we were concerned with a giant, a giant which made itself felt in more than one respect in the economy of this country. Sir, we need to quote only a few examples to prove this. We learnt from the reports that the record number of 591 million passengers were transported by the South African Railways this year. If this number of passengers were to stand shoulder to shoulder in one line, they would encircle the earth four times, and if one considers the distances these passengers were transported, it means that we could have taken 20 000 people to the moon and back. That is achievement. That is growth. It gives us an indication of what the activities are with which we are concerned. It is not an organization that is shrinking as the United Party is doing and from which nothing new emanates. The Railways as a whole is new, and its growth determines its newness and its youth&#x2014;its growth and not its stagnation, as is the case with that party.</p>

<p>The goods transported amounted to 119 million tons. This means, if one wants to express it in volume, that we could have loaded the houses of a whole city like Cape Town on a train and transported them. This is what the South African Railways did during the past year. If we had loaded all of this, it would, have given us a train 90 000 km in length. If the rolling stock owned by the Railways to render this service were to be coupled, it would give one a train stretching from Johannesburg to Cape Town. This is the giant we are concerned with. It is not a beetle&#x2014;I nearly said something else&#x2014;like that party. We are concerned here with a virile and extremely large organization. The South, African Railways is also one of the largest suppliers of working capital in the economy of South Africa. Its funds, it surpluses, the money in its funds such as the Reserve Fund, the Savings Fund, the Superannuation Fund, the Betterment Fund and the Rates Equalization Fund, is invested with the Public Debt Commissioners, from whom Government departments may raise loans. This giant I am speaking of is one of the largest suppliers of finance capital in this country. There is as much as R925 million in these funds at present. This is the giant we are concerned with, and this is the contribution this organization makes in South Africa. In addition, the South African Railways is one of the largest markets for local industries. Seventy-five per cent of its needs are supplied by South African industries. Last year the Railways spent an amount of R277 million on purchases alone. I compare this to R37 million in United Party time. That R277 million means more than our export trade to Japan, the United States and Canada. As a trading partner the Railways, which forms part and parcel of our national economy, is just as important to us today as three foreign countries. This is the giant we are concerned with.</p>

<p>The Railways supplies nearly 10% of our national income. In 1971 it was R1 202 million, and of that the Railways handled more than 62%, or R746 million. It is the only country in the world in which the Railways&#x2019; proposition of the transport activities of a particular country is still showing the potential to grow and is not decreasing rapidly. It is generally known throughout the world today that in these transport activities the proportion of the Railways as opposed to the rest is decreasing. apart from the financing problems and capital shortages they experience. With the energy problem here in our country, it will not apply to our Railways for a long time to come, as rail transport remains the most effective means of transport, especially over the long distances we find in our country. Sir, this gives one hope and faith as far as the future is concerned.</p>

<p>I have said the Railways is the largest single employer in South Africa. If the dependants of the 231 000 railway officials are taken into account, it means that the Railways is accepting responsibility for ¾ million inhabitants of South Africa, and is supporting them. This is not something small; this is not something unimportant; it is not indicative of an institution which can exist and survive without planning. I <span class="col_2213-2214" refersTo="page_1122"/>repeat: We must expose to public contempt this strange projection of a small party which it wants to apply to large institutions such as the S.A.R. and H. The South African Railways is responsible today for the maintenance and the employment of one out of every ten White inhabitants of South Africa. This is the giant I have referred to and with which we are concerned; it is indeed something to be justly proud of. Regarding this giant there is planning. We know of its planning section which occupies itself with physical planning, economic planning, with statistics and cost accounting, etc. The Minister said he needed no other sources of information, because he had his own department.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the parliamentary hierarchy, the hon. member for Witwatersberg is second in order of importance as far as railway matters are concerned. First there is the hon. the Minister and he is followed by the hon. member for Witwatersberg as chairman of the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours. I hope the hon. member does not take offence if I put him in second place. I know that he was very upset the other day when someone said that he was second in line for the post of Commissioner-General.</p>

<p>I do not know what the hon. member expected. The hon. the Prime Minister should have appointed three people simultaneously, I suppose, and then have let them draw lots. In any case, I hope he does not take offence. The hon. member spoke about the previous hon. member for Yeoville and said: &#x201C;Look where he is sitting now!&#x201D; I just want to tell him that he listened very carefully to his speech. I do not want to be derogatory, but if he convinced the former hon. member for Yeoville with that sort of speech, then that hon. member must have known very little about the Railways. Therefore, I do not believe that that was the case. Nevertheless I want to ask the hon. member a question. He says the Railways is the only enterprise of its kind in the world whose share of the transport market of the country, in comparison with other countries, is not declining. It is difficult for me to understand how the hon. member arrived at that conclusion. I asked the hon. the Minister recently whether he had the statistics to establish this position. Why did I ask the question? Because a few months ago the Genera] Manager of the Railways said the very opposite to what the hon. member said today. The General Manager said that the share of the Railways is in fact declining, if I understood correctly. I do not want to be emphatic about this because I might be making a mistake, but that is how I can remember his speech. Then I asked the hon. the Minister what the Railways&#x2019; share of the transport market of South Africa was. He said he did not know, but the hon. member for Witwatersberg, the second in line, knows. I really do not know where he got that from. I have trouble with the hon. member.</p>

<p>He says that we were opposed to the rate increases. Of course we were and we are certainly not trying to escape that. Surely the hon. member knows why we were opposed to them, viz. because we felt that in a situation of high inflationary pressure it would be fatal to increase the rates. The hon. the Minister said at the time that it would only bring about an increase of &#x00BD;% in the cost of living. We said that it would be more, and I am convinced that it did in fact mean an increase of far more than in the cost of living of South Africans.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that the Railways could convey all the carriage it was offered. Now I wonder whether I can be of any assistance to the hon. member in respect of what we mean when we say that the Railways must take the lead and not merely follow on behind. We see the matter in this light: A general store sells sugar or coffee; a supermarket also sells these commodities. However, one goes to a general store and they sell to you; a supermarket is just the opposite. If one is not careful, one does not only buy sugar, but coffee as well. The Railways must sell transport and must not wait for someone to come and buy it. The item which the Railway puts on the market, viz. its transport services, must be such that it can sell them to the public of South Africa and does not have to sit still and wait for people to buy from them.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made a great fuss about the fact that we say that pensioners are struggling. However, the hon. member admits it himself. We are sitting here with almost R30 million, which could in the end be almost R40 million. Can we not help those few thousand people from that source? It is not a political matter. How many voters are involved here? There is no prospect of an election. This is not the <span class="col_2215-2216" refersTo="page_1123"/>Langlaagte R60 million now. We are pleading for a few thousand people who are really struggling and the hon. member agrees. Why does he make such a drama of nothing? Why does he not rather say he agrees? Then at least he will be doing a good thing.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman tells us that we regard this surplus as deception. Now I want to tell the hon. member that I never know whether I should laugh, or cry about a surplus&#x2014;I regard it with mixed feelings. I do not think that there is much reason to clap hands about the R30 million. Perhaps we could have applauded if the hon. the Minister had come out exactly even. However, R30 million is a considerable amount.</p>

<p>However, we must also remember that a few months ago the hon. the Minister pushed up the rates from <i>5%</i> to 60%. Perhaps we should be grateful that the hon. gentleman has not raised the rates again. Perhaps we should be even more grateful when we bear in mind that these rates were pushed up as late as 1 November. Suppose he had pushed them up with effect from 1 April 1974&#x2014;just think of the millions we would then have had to pay. That is another reason for being grateful. So one must count one&#x2019;s blessings, even if one does not feel very happy about a surplus of R30 million.</p>

<p>There is another matter on which I want to pause a moment. Last year the hon. member for Parow in particular spoke very well indeed about it. He said that the increases last year were not made operative because more money was needed, but because an attempt was being made to implement the recommendations of the Schumann Commission. The Schumann Commission said that we must try to bring the transport rate closer to the actual transport cost. That is what the recommendation was. This time we hear nothing of this necessity. No one is saying a word about it. Note, suddenly, it is no longer necessary to implement that commission&#x2019;s report.</p>

A body such as the Railways&#x2014;and now I want the hon. member for Parow to listen carefully&#x2014;which plans ahead and has to have vision, cannot use &#x201C;stop-go&#x201D; methods: On one occasion one applies it and the next one does not. One cannot apply this only when one needs money.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>If the Railways want to plan ahead, they will have to look at the matter correctly and say that they will create a situation over the next ten to 15 years in which this organization&#x2019;s rates and actual cost figures will be brought as close as possible to each other. The public must be informed of this. The House must also be informed of this. The dealer and the consumer outside must be put in a position which will enable them to know precisely where they will stand in ten years&#x2019; time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotzé">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZÉ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, with all due respect, Sir, my time is very limited.</p>

<p>I can foresee that a time will come when the Railways will try to make specific rates equal to actual costs, but will be unable to do so. As an example I can mention the rate on livestock. The earlier rate was pushed up by 60% and even now only 65% of the cost is being covered. I cannot imagine that a time will come when the Railways will charge a rate for livestock which will cover the total cost, and that people will be satisfied with it.</p>

<p>In the second place there is the question of passengers who are conveyed at a loss of R100 million per year. If we should try to phase in the recommendations of the Schumann Commission, we shall reach a stage when we shall find that we are no longer able to raise the passenger fares for South African consumers any further. Even if one were to go out of one&#x2019;s way to implement the recommendations of the Schumann Commission, one would still find many cases where the Railways will simply be forced to convey specific items at a loss.</p>

<p>What I am asking, is that the Railways should ascertain that position as soon as possible. I do not think that the Railways should be expected to provide socio-economic services in South Africa. Now I am not repeating my own words. That is not a United Party view, but that of the hon. the Minister of Transport. The sooner we reach the point where we know precisely where the Railways stands in respect of <span class="col_2217-2218" refersTo="page_1124"/>every transport matter and the sooner we know what the loss is that it is suffering as a result, the better it will be for the Railways. Then we can go to the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Transport said that he would do this&#x2014;and say that we cannot go on like this any longer and that if he does not help us, we will find ourselves in trouble with the position in which we shall then be. As soon as we possibly can, we must try to obtain clarity about the implementation of the recommendations of the Schumann Commission. I say again that we must stop using the Schumann Commission&#x2019;s report as a pretext whenever we need money. We must take the nation into our confidence and plan ahead and we must stop hanging the Schumann Commission report over the head of the consumer like a sword of Damocles, a sword which is allowed to fall only when extra money is reeded.</p>

<p>I am very pleased the hon. member asked me that question. I should rather see that we make slight adjustments every year over a period of 15 years in respect of which the nation is informed ..</p>

<p>Increases?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, increases in respect of which the nation has been informed. I should rather see that than see that we have to make sudden and unexpected shocking adjustments as was done on the last occasion. That is what I advocate. Put us in the position where we know where we are. The Railways should take the lead.</p>

<p>There is another matter in respect of which the Railways can take the lead if it wants to be a dynamic enterprise. This problem has already been discussed and the hon. member for Witwatersberg will say that we are reviving old disputes, but we shall not get any further like that. The thorniest problem for an urban resident today is the tremendous transport problem which we are experiencing in the urban complexes. This problem is becoming increasingly serious year after year. It is a problem which requires deep consideration and it must be handled expeditiously because we know that each year which passes will cost us millions extra to do what might require a whole new transport scheme from us. It requires no imagination to realize what the position will be if we do not do something now. Our cities are literally being strangled by motor cars today. Every year more roads and more freeways are being built, and every year the cost involved in the building of those roads is increased. Every year it brings about increasing pollution and the amount of fuel which is consumed every year increases all the time and that in itself is already a crisis. We also face the familiar fact that the more roads one builds the quicker those roads are filled, and one simply cannot keep ahead. It is a sort of &#x201C;traffic Parkinson&#x2019;s Law&#x201D;.</p>

<p>What will the position be in 25 years time when many of us may still be here? At that stage the population of South Africa will have doubled to almost 50 million, of which almost 75% will be concentrated in the urban complexes. Can we imagine how great the problems will then be? The hon. member for Witwatersberg said that the Railways now conveys almost 600 million passengers per year. Only four years ago the Railways only conveyed 500 million passengers. This means that an additional 100 million passengers have been conveyed by the Railways within four years. If we apply the trend which we had over the past four years over the period of 25 years, we shall come up against the situation that the Railways may be required to convey 1 000 million passengers per year, while those who use motor cars will continue doing so unabated. Have hon. members ever thought what the position would be in the cities if the motor car user were to be discouraged from using his motor car and encouraged to use the Railways so that the bottlenecks might be alleviated? Have hon. members ever thought about the ten thousands of millions of extra passengers there will be as a result of this? Where do we stand in respect of these matters. <span class="col_2219-2220" refersTo="page_1125"/>We hear a great deal from the Railways and we know that the Railways are not keen to become involved in this matter, because they suffer losses. I am not very happy about the question of losses. I am not unhappy because there are losses, but I am unhappy about the extent of those losses. We know that there are losses, but we also know that there are thousands of people who make use of the Railways free of charge; we know that there are people who work for the Railways and for various departments who make use of the Railways every year free of charge. I have nothing against that &#x2026;</p>

<p>I ask again: How many people are involved in this? It is essential that we know. I also want to know what the amount is that is involved in this. I think the time has arrived for the hon. the Minister to ascertain these numbers and amounts and to see that the costs are correctly allocated by the passenger service. The costs which are incurred by letting a shunter go on holiday every year, are passed on to the passengers. Those costs are not met by his own section. Here is a situation which must be rectified before we can ascertain a true figure of the losses and passenger transport. As I have said the Railways will have to play their role if they want to be known as a dynamic enterprise in South Africa. The Railways must accept this role with alacrity.</p>

<p>I want to come to another matter in connection with which the Railways have done very little. I am still referring to urban transport. Let us take the question of the distribution of working hours. The hon. member for Parow raised this matter a few years ago. As long ago as 1969 a commission dealt with this matter, but only now, after five years, we hear that close attention is being given to the matter. In the meantime an excellent means of helping the Railways at rush hours has been ignored. I want to know why this has been delayed for so long. I think that this state of affairs is not good enough for an organization such as the Railways.</p>

<p>There are other matters in connection with which the action of the Railways is also not good enough. We know that a Driessen Commission on urban transport has been appointed. We know that the report of that commission has appeared and is being given attention somewhere, but definitely not in this Budget. I think this is pre-eminently a matter which ought to enjoy attention in the Budget. The Railways must play a leading role in respect of urban transport. This is a matter which intimately affects thousands of commuters and motorists. These people must be involved in the matter and informed timeously. If one can succeed in getting the enthusiastic co-operation of people who are involved, so much the better. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what is being done in this connection Has the time not arrived for him to inform this House and the nation outside and to tell them that he as Minister of Transport is prepared to take the lead in this thorny matter with courageous advance planning? His advance planning must indeed be so courageous that he can involve the public of South Africa with enthusiasm in his plans, so that the public will be keen to participate in any plan with which the hon. the Minister might come forward. After all, that is how one acts if one is keen on the matter.</p>

<p>Let us look at whether the Railways are giving the necessary guidance in other fields. I think there is another matter about which the Railways are far too humble, viz. the question of labour, about which a few words have already been said. As the largest single employer in the sphere of labour in South Africa, the Railways, who employ more than 230 million workers, ought to play a leading role in the labour market.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon. In the Railways one must be on one&#x2019;s toes to be able to distinguish between the millions and the thousands. Sometimes one cannot help a slip of the tongue. The Railways employ 231 000 workers, to be precise. On a previous occasion I told the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor that a particular labour pattern had been recognized in the Railways for years.</p>

<p>You have been saying that for many years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Transport, Mr. Schoeman, stood up and asked me: &#x201C;What pattern are you talking about?&#x201D; He &#x201C;switched me off&#x201D;, if I may use this term. At that time I did not go further into this argument, but if one does not simply want to score debating points, everyone will admit that for many years a particular labour pattern has existed in South Africa as far as the ratio of the number of Whites to the number of non-Whites in the service is concerned. Thus one finds that in 1960, 110 000 Whites and 108 000 non-Whites were employed. Ten years later, in 1970, 111 000 Whites and 111 000 non-Whites were employed. This is a pattern which has remained static and which has never changed. It is a pattern which has remained the same for all the years, in the Railways and nowhere else. It indicates an abnormal situation. It is a pattern which has not been maintained by natural laws, for example the laws of economics. The position has been maintained artificially by socio-political forces in South Africa, in spite of the fact that innumerable appeals have emanated from the hon. the Minister and his predecessor and the Management, that the Railways were experiencing a tremendous shortage of manpower, especially in the bread-and-butter categories.</p>

<p>It is well-known that changing times have brought changes. Well, now we have had a change. I just want to say that I am one of the people who have pleaded for this change for years. Therefore I am glad that it has taken place. I also want to tell the hon. the Minister that although I am known in politics as a verkrampte, I shall be the last one to make political propaganda out of this development. I say this because I believe that it is one of the best things which can happen in our country. Therefore I say that the Railways are hiding their light under a bushel. The change takes place with the co-operation of every trade union in the Railways. What is more, not a single White loses his job, and no White man has lost his White identity nor has his wife or child lost theirs. This is what I like about this change. There was universal approval of this change, and here is a good lesson, not only for the Railways, but for the whole of South Africa. I once said to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor that if there was one thing which I held against him, it was that he began this matter and that he, as senior Minister in the Cabinet of South Africa, never sold this matter to his fellow-Cabinet members. I hope the time will not arrive when I shall have to say this to the hon. the Minister as well. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister is engaged in something fine, something which has even fired the imagination of the trade unions. That is how a job should be tackled. Let us listen to what Mr. Johan Benade, Chief Secretary of the Federal Council of the Railway staff has to say. I quote from an article which puts the matter as follows (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">Speaking about training of Whites in the industry, Mr. Benade says that the White worker will have to adapt himself to continually making place as far as the entry of Black workers is concerned, but the Whites must always be moved to higher posts and better prospects.</block>

<p>How often have we not said this in this House? However, there have only been smiles when we have said it. Mr. Benade went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">Old forms of vocational and other training, which take progress through the ranks into consideration, are obsolete and planning for training will have to take place so that classification for higher ranks may be obtained more rapidly.</block>

<p>Here we have a man who is at the head of a large federation of work unions. He speaks with enthusiasm about the matter. Now I want to tell the hon. the Minister that we are glad that this is taking place, because it is happening both to the advantage of the human element and on the economic level. We have always said: There is no more expensive time than overtime. It is expensive for the people who have to work overtime and also expensive in the economic set-up. How glad am I that the days are past when my National friends on the other side asked, &#x201C;Do you want overtime abolished?&#x201D; They wanted me to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; so that they could make propaganda from that. I state my standpoint unequivocally and it is also the standpoint of this side of the House: Overtime, to the extent to which the Railways make use of it, is an absurdity. It is an expensive service which is given.</p>

<p>If we cannot abolish it, then we must reduce it to what is absolutely essential. Do not tell me that the worker cannot get by without it. Sir, I say it is a crying shame if an employee of the biggest organization in South Africa has to say that he must rely on overtime to be able to live. I say that we must reduce overtime to a minimum, and I shall tell the hon. member how it can be done. Let us look at the figures. The hon. member for Durban Point told us about the men, White and non-White, who worked 12 hours a day in Durban harbour, a shift of eight hours and four hours&#x2019; overtime, if my facts are correct. Suddenly they were told, apparently because they could not make the grade as far as productivity was concerned, &#x201C;Forget about the four hours&#x2019; overtime; work your normal shift of eight hours; we shall pay you for 12 hours&#x2019; work, but then you must work faster&#x201D;. And what happened when that overtime was abolished? The men&#x2019;s wages remained the same, but their productivity increased by 35%. Sir, is it not time for that attitude to be adopted over a wider front than just the harbour front? Should we not extend it to the Railways in its full scope of activities? Sir, I know that there has been a shortage of White workers throughout the years. But in South Africa there is no shortage of non-White workers. I ask the hon. the Minister to consider this matter very seriously; I ask him to look at the amount which is paid annually for overtime and to say, &#x201C;If I cannot get a White worker, then rather than go on to the slippery slope of overtime. I will be prepared to appoint a non-White to do this work.&#x201D; Sir, let us look at the position. In 1974 R57 million was spent on overtime; that does not include Sunday time. Sir, that is the equivalent of the salaries of 15 000 White workers for a full year. If we cannot get White workers, why do we not appoint 15 000 non-Whites? In this way we can get rid of overtime. It has been proved in the harbours of Durban. Cape Town and Port Elizabeth that overtime is expensive time for the Railways. Let us get rid of it. The hon. the Minister has already opened the doors and given a new dimension to the labour market in South Africa. He will never again be able to or want to close the doors since the adjustment work has been done by responsible people in a correct pro-South African way. It is a policy which we fully support. But I say to the hon. the Minister that he must also look to the economy; that he has nothing which he need fear, because he has the assurance that on this side he has a party&#x2014;the hon. member for Waterberg may scoff and say what he likes about a party which is small in numbers&#x2014;which is responsible, a party which will not exploit for political gain, a step which meets with our full approval, as such steps have been exploited in the past by other people. Therefore I say that the hon. gentleman has nothing to fear. In the interests of all workers in South Africa, White and non-White, and in the interests of the Railways of South Africa, the largest single employer, the great artery of the economy, the hon. the Minister, if he wants to create a dynamic image, must now open the doors and look at the human and the economic factors and say, &#x201C;We have an answer for the whole Railway and Harbour service and not only for the few harbours which we have&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland made quite a long speech. I should just like to react to three of the points which he raised. He referred to Railway planning, but only in general terms; he also attacked it in general terms. The hon. member kept on referring to &#x201C;urban transportation&#x201D;. I think the hon. member should understand very clearly that urban transportation is the responsibility of the municipalities and local authorities. Inter-city transportation is the task of the Railways, and not urban transportation, for that is the task of the municipalities.</p>

<p>Then, towards the end of his speech, the hon. member dealt with overtime and said &#x2014;it will be recorded in Hansard; he also represents Railway voters and they will get hold of that Hansard&#x2014;that overtime work should be abolished. He was discussing overtime for Whites and when an hon. member cornered him on this point, he said &#x201C;to a minimum&#x201D;. But did you hear, Sir, what he said towards the end of his speech? He said that in its place, non-Whites should be introduced; abolish overtime for Whites, and introduce non-Whites to render that overtime service; take away the overtime of the Whites, and put non-Whites in its place to do the overtime work of the Whites.</p>

<p><span class="col_2225-2226" refersTo="page_1128"/>Sir, I should like to return to the hon. member for Durban Point. I hope he will grant me just a moment. The hon. member for Durban Point thinks that the Railway Board could simply be abolished and should be replaced by a general planning council. Am I correct? This is a body, if I understood him correctly, which should apparently be made up outside the service. Am I still correct? I see the hon. member is nodding affirmatively. Am I also correct when I ask the member whether he means by that that other departments will be represented on that council, and perhaps private bodies as well? Very well, Sir. Now I want to put it in this way: The hon. member for Durban Point comes here this afternoon and puts forward a motion of no-confidence in the General Manager and his top men, implying that they are not competent enough to be able to perform in future the same task and the task which he envisages, tasks which they did in fact perform in the past. But apart from that it is also an absurd suggestion to make. The hon. member must tell me now: If there should be such a planning council, under whom should it fall? Surely it cannot fall under the Minister of Railways. It might have to fall under another Minister.</p>

<p>The two hon. members of the Opposition who have spoken up to now, really had to use a magnifying glass to look for criticism to level at the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech. There was very little criticism to level at it. They also used a magnifying glass to look for criticism to level at the Railway Administration in general. Sir. I read the comments in the newspapers, the English,-language and Afrikaans-language newspapers, and truly the comment there was very positive. For that reason I realize that the task of the Opposition in criticizing this Budget is a very difficult one. In this regard these two hon. members put me so much in mind of the old tale which we probably all know, of Don Quixote who without purpose and without any success charged an illusion and you need not have any doubts about who the attendant of this Don Quixote was. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Every inhabitant of South Africa, from whatever political party he may be, and of whatever population group he may be a member, ought to appreciate the Railways as our national conveyor and the cornerstone of our country&#x2019;s transportation system. Sir, it is a challenging and stimulating task of the S.A. Railways and Harbours to be able to meet its obligations and perform its task through a variety of services. Per rail, per road, through the gateways of our harbours, by air and even underground, where the pipelines have been laid, a constant stream of passengers, raw materials, manufactured goods, agricultural produce and livestock is being conveyed throughout the length and breadth of our country and even beyond our borders. This Herculean task is not the task of one person, or even the task of a group of persons gathered round a person such as the General Manager, although, there may be these as well. Sir, it is the task of and for thousands of loyal workers who co-operate harmoniously and in an inspired manner to carry out an enormous task. It requires vision, sound judgment, consultation, efficiency, skill, careful planning, penetrating research and competence, which can only be obtained through combining human resourcefulness to establish one integrated whole i.e. the Railway service. In this unity the talents of many individuals are combined and developed through study and research so that meaningful labour can be derived from them and so that the country can be provided with an effective transportation service.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to express a few ideas in regard to the staff. At the end of the report year, i.e. the year ending March 1974, the number of employees in all sections of the industry was 231 610. This represents an increase of 1,2% over the previous year. Of these 109 502 were Whites, and 122 108 were non-Whites. In comparison with the previous year the non-White staff increased <span class="col_2227-2228" refersTo="page_1129"/>by 4 219, while the White staff decreased by 1 571. It is logical that there will be constant resignations from such a large staff corps, and that there will also be a large number of such resignations. I always find the resignations and re-employment which occurs on the Railways very interesting. During the period 16.12.1973 to 15.12.1974 &#x2014;this is a calender year&#x2014;the number of resignations in the case of White staff was 15 984. This represents approximately 14,5% of the total number of White staff members on 31.3.1974. For the corresponding period &#x2014;and this is very interesting&#x2014;there were 18 479 applications for re-employment, 2 500 more than had resigned the previous year. Sir, these applications were made by employees who had resigned in previous years as well, and not only from those resigned in the past. Of that large group the Administration re-employed only 6 843. The Administration therefore re-employed only 37% of the people who had previously been employed on the Railways. From this information I extract two important facts. The first fact is that there is a strong desire among former Railway servants, even if it is after a period of many years, to return to the Railways as employer. In the second place it provides evidence of the strict selection which the Administration applies in the employment of persons, but pre-eminently of the selectiveness displayed by the Railway Administration in the reemployment of former Railway servants. They are not taken on again because the Railway Administration knows that they were unstable in their work, the fact that more applications for re-employment were received from former Railway servants than there were resignations during the calendar year, gives the lie to the allegation which we frequently hear on the part of the Opposition, of dissatisfaction among Railway servants.</p>

<p>Usually poor remuneration, unsatisfactory working conditions, excessive overtime&#x2014;the hon. member for Maitland has in fact referred to overtime work again now&#x2014;excessive demands made on employees and the unfair application of disciplinary measures are advanced by the Opposition as reasons for the resignations. This afternoon we have been offered another one in the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban Point. The Administration has allegedly failed to stimulate the morale of many grades of employees. This, then, is also advanced as a reason for people resigning from the Service. Those whose reasons for resignation have any real substance, are definitely minimal. Those who resigned as a result of the reasons advanced by the opposition are only the unstable characters who cannot last out or stay on with any employer. It is they whom we usually label as rolling stones.</p>

<p>The question arises why those ex-servants wish to return if the Railways is supposedly such an unsympathetic and callous employer. Those persons who resigned from the Service and applied for a second or even a third time for re-employment found that they could not find an Utopia elsewhere. They had realized in the meantime that the Railways offered greater stability than any other employer, that the Railways offered regular increases, a livable wage and opportunities for inservice training to enable them to occupy better positions later on and earn higher salaries. They realized that they have housing benefits, pay fair rents, have opportunites to acquire their own homes, and many other examples. In addition there are constant improvements to the salary structure and the status of work groups, apart from the ordinary salary increases. I should like to refer in particular to what the hon. member for Witwatersberg also mentioned, i.e. the recent granting of salaried status to workmen. Arising out of many years of representations by the staff associations, and <i>inter alia,</i> in view of the shortage of graded staff, salaried status was recently granted to station foremen, signalmen, trained staff, artisans and sergeants and constables in the Railway Police. Attendant on this were the higher overtime and Sunday time scales which were introduced for them, and then we can also conclude from that that these persons will receive higher pensions when they retire from the Service. It must also be borne in mind that they will of course, as a result of higher salaries, also make increased payments in the form of pension and sick fund contributions.</p>

<p>I have just referred to housing for Railway officials. This is probably a matter on which both sides of this House agree. We can also join in advocating more housing and an increased contribution to the various schemes. The matter of housing is also raised here annually, and as he also did last year, the hon. the Minister usually furnishes a very full reply in this regard. Last year I expressed the opinion, with reference to previous observations made by the General Manager before the Select Committee, <span class="col_2229-2230" refersTo="page_1130"/>that the pension fund could also be applied to support the housing scheme. The hon. the Minister announced last year, in reply to the Second Reading Debate, that a new housing scheme would come into operation. It would be supplementary to the already existing housing scheme. According to this scheme funds are made available by means of a loan from the home ownership fund on the basis of the servant&#x2019;s personal membership of the pension fund, at an interest rate which is charged from time to time on home-ownership schemes. In addition to that a loan for the balance is provided from the pension fund at a rate at which the pension fund earns interest elsewhere. In his Budget Speech last year the hon. the Minister announced that this scheme would come into operation on 1 April 1975. This scheme will definitely contribute to making more houses available. It will also be known as the housing scheme with pension funds. I believe that all railway servants, and particularly those who do not yet own their own homes, are very pleased about this additional housing scheme. I should like to convey my thanks to the hon. the Minister for having announced this scheme, and also to the General Manager who suggested the idea.</p>

<p>The S. A. Railways places a particularly high premium on good housing for its employees. As far as this matter is concerned, it far surpasses most other employers. If other major employers had followed the same pattern in the past, we would today have had far more people who owned their own homes. The Management feels convinced that if the railway servant has good accommodation, he has nothing further to feel concerned about in this particular sphere, and will also be a happy, positive and in particular a very productive employee. Particularly in these times of labour shortage, great priority is being given to the productivity of the employee. The ideal of owning one&#x2019;s own home is shared by all the officials on the Railways. It is as a result of this that there is such a tremendous demand for houses and that tremendous amounts of money are being drawn from the various housing schemes. We are familiar with the various schemes which are being applied, and I do not want to refer to them. I should like to furnish this House with a few statistics which will be a clear reflection of how extensive the efforts on the part of the Administration are, and how serious it considers this matter to be.</p>

<p>In respect of the 100% home-ownership scheme a total of 665 loans to the amount of R12,2 million were granted between 1 April 1974 and 30 November 1974&#x2014;these are the latest statistics I have at my disposal. Since the introduction of this scheme on 1 April 1956 a total of 21 417 properties to the amount of R173,7 million have already been purchased. The Railway officials, and particularly prospective home owners under this scheme, appreciate it very much indeed that the maximum allowance for a loan under this scheme, according to the statement of the hon. the Minister in his Budget Speech has been increased as from June 1974 from R17 000 to R22 000. We come now to the 10% homeownership scheme. Between 1 April 1974 and 30 November 1974 a total of 376 properties to the amount of R0,875 million were purchased. According to this scheme 10% of the purchase price of the house is guaranteed by the Administration while the Railway servants may negotiate a loan in respect of the balance from a financing body such as a building society. We know only too well that funds are not at present in abundant supply at building societies and other financial institutions. For that reason the number of 376 properties which has been purchased does not appear to be very impressive. However, if it is emphasized that an amount of R22,2 million has been appropriated from the fund since the introduction of the scheme on 1 April 1956 for the purchase of 17 816 properties, the picture definitely becomes a more impressive one. Naturally one is able to conclude that 100% scheme will for the present be far more popular among Railway officials, particularly because of the higher loan maximum.</p>

<p>Since approximately 50% of the White staff of the Railways are accommodated department ally, I should just like to say a few words about this type of accommodation. Of the staff accommodated departmentally approximately 90% are married persons. Unmarried persons are usually accommodated in hostels and communal dwellings. Since the 1948-&#x2019;49 financial year a total of 15 570 departmental houses have been built or purchased for an amount of R114,8 million. On 30 November 1974 a total of 24 458 houses were available to staff members. We learned with pleasure from the Budget that an amount of R10 million will be made available for the construction <span class="col_2231-2232" refersTo="page_1131"/>of 400 departmental houses. If one were to add together the number of houses constructed and the number of houses made available for Railway officials &#x2014;I mentioned the figures&#x2014;<i>we</i> would see that this amounts to the large number of 63 691 dwelling units. We in this country as such may, on the whole, feel very proud of this achievement of the SA.. Railways. In addition we can tender thanks to the Administration for the special attention they are giving to good accommodation for officials.</p>

<p>In amplification of what I have already said, I want to refer to the housing of non-White staff. On 1 April 1973 a housing scheme was introduced for the Coloured staff. Fifty loans involving a total amount of R348 000 have already been counted. With the introduction on 16 December last year of pension schemes for non-Whites, which include Indians it also became possible for Indian employees to participate in a home-ownership scheme. This scheme was established on the same basis as that for the Coloureds. Indian staff members shall have completed a period of at least five years&#x2019; service before they may qualify for a loan. I also want to mention the fact that the greatest percentage of non-Whites are of course being provided with departmental accommodation. I want to emphasize that the accommodation of servants, whether they are Whites or non-White is always of very great importance.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to deal with a few local matters, since I may not be afforded an opportunity of raising these matters during the Committee Stage. A few years ago I mentioned in this House that the inhabitants of the vicinity near the mechanical workshops at Koedoespoort, outside Pretoria, had complained about the smoke from the furnaces at the steel foundry. I also conducted a correspondence in regard to this matter. I am now particularly pleased to ascertain from the annual report that a new smoke arrestor has been fitted to the two electric-arc furnaces at the steel foundry and has been put into operation. This is apparently the first step which will be taken in this regard to eliminate atmospheric pollution. Although I no longer represent that constituency, I believe that those inhabitants will take cognizance of this with considerable gratitude.</p>

<p>At present I represent the Gezina constituency. The large shunting works at Capitol Park are located in the middle of that constituency. It is in the middle of residential areas. Apart from the tremendous noise caused by the shunting, there is also the vast amount of smoke this produces. Most of the locomotives in use there are steam locomotives. I receive a great many complaints about this matter. For that reason I am sincerely grateful to see in the annual report that various tests have been carried out with shunting locomotives to prevent black smoke and that instruments have been fitted in order to prevent it. However, only a small number of locomotives have been equipped in this way. I should like to address a request to the Minister and the Administration to the effect that the instruments eliminating the black smoke be fitted to al! those locomotives as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In the Budget Speech the hon. the Minister also referred in general terms to the proposed new railway line which is to be constructed in the Tswana homeland north of Pretoria between Wintersnes and Mabopane. Attendant upon that is the development of the railway station at Belle Ombre and of the accompanying railway network. The Minister did in fact mention that efforts are being made to expedite the details in regard to the planning, but I should just like to point out that this project was approved as long ago as 1973 and that it was regarded as a top priority development to bring alleviation in the road traffic of hundreds of buses conveying thousands of employees from the areas of Ga Rankuwa, Mabopane and Wintersnes to Pretoria and back. The traffic, i.e. the hundreds of buses and thousands of other vehicles flowing daily through Wonderboom Poort, is becoming so congested that the roads simply cannot bear it any more. This traffic flows right through my constituency. Consequently I receive regular inquiries in regard to the provision of a train service. On this occasion I should like to ask the hon. the Minister and the Administration to give particular preference to this project because it has become imperative for us in Pretoria that this matter be expedited.</p>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Gezina has seen fit to condemn my colleague for having suggested that the Railways should do away with overtime. I would like to ask him why he reacts in this way. Is it because he knows that there are thousands of employees on the Railways who cannot survive <span class="col_2233-2234" refersTo="page_1132"/>without having to work 12 or more hours per day? Surely this is an indictment of the Management of the S.A.R. in regard to its employment patterns and policies that so many employees have to work overtime in order to survive. I would like to ask him why this is necessary. If what the hon. member for Witwatersberg said regarding the increase in productivity is correct, why are these employees not enjoying the benefit of this increase in productivity by being enabled to earn a decent wage and not having to work overtime? We also heard the hon. member for Witwatersberg wax eloquent about the size of the S.A.R. He told us how big it was and that because it was so big it must of necessity have excellent planning operations and so forth. I want to suggest that the question of its planning being the best does not necessarily follow from the fact that the S.A.R. is a very large organization. I believe that many hon. members on that side tend to become complacent because they use figures and statistics which make them feel that everything in the garden is rosy. It was because of this fact that the hon. member for Durban Point mentioned certain figures that had been quoted by the hon. the Minister which lead us to believe that somebody was trying to pull the wool over our eyes. I want particularly to deal with this in detail this afternoon.</p>

<p>In spite of all that has been said we hear continual reports about the tremendous delays at our ports. As recently as last week there were dozens of ships waiting outside our ports. We hear of possible coal shortages during this coming winter because the Railways can't cope. We hear of higher surcharges now reaching 40% because of the delays at our ports. However, we hear from the hon. the Minister, as the hon. member for Durban Point also said, that most of these problems are as a result of the phenomenal growth in general cargo carried during the period 1972 to 1974. For instance, he said that Durban had an increased throughput of general cargo of 69,8% over this two year period. I appreciate that these are the facts but I certainly do not believe that they are all the facts. This will become clear later on when I go into details in this regard. What is being done to alleviate the situation at our ports in South Africa today? Excluding for a moment the massive capital development programme that is being put into effect in our harbours we find that it was only in 1974 that it was decided to introduce the two-shift system for handling general cargo at Port Elizabeth. This system was introduced early this year in Durban. Because of the success of this two-shift system we now hear that it is proposed to introduce a three-shift system in our harbours. This fact and the reported increase in labour productivity are presented to us as if this were a radical, new approach towards achieving higher productivity in respect of labour. Surely this is a basic concept? Surely there are hundreds of businesses and industries throughout the country which have been using the shift system for years and years? I believe that this basic concept should have been fed into the computers of the Railway planning team as long as ten years ago. If this had been done, it would have proved that at that time, in 1964, all our existing harbours in South Africa had a capacity of 1,62 million tons of general cargo which could be handled per month. This was on a two-shift basis. Had they investigated the possibility of a three-shift basis they would have found that the existing harbours in 1964 had a capacity of 2.4 million tons per month. This would have been the position using a night-to-day shift productivity factor of 80%. When one considers that the average monthly throughput of all our harbours in 1974 was only 1,6 million tons one is entitled to ask why the multi-shift concept was not planned ten years ago. Surely growth figures indicated a need for this? Surely one or two berths at Durban, for instance, should have been commenced on a shift basis years ago so that the people there could build up the experience which is required to ensure acceptable productivity levels for this type of work? We are led to believe that the department had planned to introduce this scheme a number of years ago but we also believe that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor would not accept these plans. I say therefore that the Government is to blame for the present chaotic situation which exists in our harbours today. We are told that one of the reasons for not introducing this system earlier was because stevedores and commerce objected to shift work. This was used as a reason for not introducing the system earlier. I find this extremely difficult to accept. Here we have a Government which had no qualms at all in using strong-arm tactics to move thousands of people from one side of the country to the other. Here <span class="col_2235-2236" refersTo="page_1133"/>we have a Government which locks up people without trial for months on end all in the furtherance of its ideologies. Yet it backs down from seeing and doing its duty in the interests of our South African economy because of objections from mere businessmen. No, Sir, the Government should have foreseen this and it should have seen to it that there was sound forward planning at that time, which should have and could have prevented the chaos which we now have. Sir, it is no good the Government giving us lame excuses at this stage. It is a fact that today the two-shift system is being employed in our harbours, and I believe that this should have been done years ago. I am correct in this because the Minister&#x2019;s own figures clearly indicate that there has been a lack of forward planning in this regard. As far back as January 1964, 330 000 tons of general cargo was moved through Durban which is our largest and most congested port. Six years later, in 1970, a total on 515 000 tons was moved through Durban during January. This was an increase of 56,1% in six years, which gives an average annual increase of 9,35%.</p>

<p>In June 1964, for instance, Durban handled 360 000 tons of general cargo; in June 1970, six years later, it handled 580 000 tons of general cargo. This was an increase over the six years of 61.1%, which gives an average annual increase of 10,2%. Sir, I firmly believe that these growth indicators over this six-year period were known to the Government, and I believe that they should have been used five years ago. Surely there should have been planning to meet the growth during the period 1970 to 1974. If the planning of the harbour had been done along the lines of these known growth trends, then the Durban harbour would have been planned to handle 708 000 tons by January 1 974. In fact. Sir, a total of 710 000 tons of cargo was handled, which is a mere 2 000 tons more than the tonnage that should have been foreseen way back in 1970 as the through-put in Durban in January 1974. And what did we experience in fact in January 1974? We had congested harbours. If they had used the June growth rate figures for that six-year period, they would have found that Durban should have had a capacity of 816 000 tons by June 1974. The actual cargo moved during that month was 780 000 tons. Sir, the figures which are available to us show a clear cyclic pattern and could and should have been used to avoid the chaotic situation which exists in our harbours today. Sir, it does nothing to instil confidence in us to have the Minister telling us that the major reason for this delay was the phenomenal growth in cargo handled in the Durban harbour during the 1972-&#x2019;74 period, when the general cargo increased by 69,8%, especially since we know, as the hon. member for Durban Point has mentioned, that these figures were taken from the cyclic low year of 1972 to the cyclic peak year of 1974. What he did not tell us, Sir, was that the average growth from the peak year of 1971 to the peak year of 1974 was only an average of 9% per annum. This compares very favourably with the growth during the six-year growth period from 1964 to 1970 of 9.35% per annum. Be that as it may&#x2014;and I am sure there are many hon. members on that side of the House who will say that it is all very well being wise after the event &#x2014;I would like to look at what is being done at present and what the plans are for the future. We have heard a tremendous amount about Richards Bay. This is a dynamic project. It will create a growth point in Zululand which is needed there, and I for one would not for one minute criticize this particular project, but I want to make it quite clear that this project was originally planned to handle bulk cargoes and mostly coal. Now we hear that this harbour is also going to handle general cargo, which means that this cargo must be diverted either from Lourenço Marques or from Durban. Yet we find that at Durban there are millions of rands being spent on No. 2 pier, all for the introduction of containerization by 1979. Here again. I should like to make it quite clear that I like containerization. As an engineer, it is very clear to me that ships are going to be turned around in a much shorter period, that there will be efficient handling of goods and cargo and that this will save a great deal of labour. But we are also told by the hon. the Minister that by 1979 70% of the general cargo handled in our ports will be handled in containers. No Sir, if we project an increase in general cargo traffic handled at our ports at a rate of 10% per annum from this year through to 1979, we will find that by 1979 we are going to have an average monthly tonnage moving through all our ports of 2,24 million <span class="col_2237-2238" refersTo="page_1134"/>tons. From the figures given to us by the hon. the Minister, 1,57 million tons is going to be handled in containers and it is going to be handled on new quays which are now being built in our harbours. Therefore the balance of all our general cargo, averaging 670 000 tons per month in 1979, will be handled in the conventional manner and with our existing harbour facilities. When one considers that last year, in 1974, all harbours handled, with existing facilities, 1.55 million tons per month and that as far back as 1964 850 000 tons of general cargo were being handled a month, one wonders what our harbours are going to look like in 1979 when they are handling only 670 000 tons of general cargo a month. And this is excluding any diversion of traffic from Durban to Richards Bay. Are we going to see large portions of our harbours becoming redundant, and if so, what forward planning is there in this regard? I ask these questions. Sir, because when one travels the world one can see harbours which are dying for various reasons.</p>

<p>What also bothers me is this question of labour. At present we are being told that one crane gang of approximately 15 men can handle on average 14 tons of general cargo per hour. We are also told that one mobile container crane can handle 200 tons of general cargo an hour. This is 14 times greater than the amount handled by existing cranes and by the existing labour force What I would like to know is what the expected reduction in the labour force is going to be. I refer now to the labour force presently handling general cargo. Using my calculations, with this equipment I can visualize a reduction of 70% in the labour being used to handle general cargo. This will mean that seven out of ten men will be redundant. But the question I should like to ask is whether we will see these reductions. Will the taxpayer enjoy the benefit of this mechanization? Over the last few years especially we have seen hundreds of thousands of rands being injected into modernizing and improving the facilities of the S.A. Railways and Harbours. I have nothing against this, but I believe all of us would like to be assured that as we become more capital-intensive there will be a commensurate increase in labour productivity. I ask these questions because I am particularly concerned with an article which appears in the General Manager&#x2019;s report on page 112. Here we see a photograph of a model of a hostel which is to be built at Umlazi. This hotel will house 9 000 Bantu employees and it is going to cost R14 million. What I would like to ask, in view of the questions I have put so far, is where these people will be working, and what they will be doing, bearing in mind all the mechanization, all the containerization equipment on which we will have spent money by that time in Durban, all the bulk cargoes which will be handled, and the diversion of cargoes to Richards Bay. Surely there should be a reduction of labour in this particular respect.</p>

<p>Having said that, I should like to say that I condemn this concept of housing 9 000 men in a single complex. We have heard so much of late about the need for healthy and proper housing for our Black people and yet we find this Government perpetuating what I believe to be a basically wrong concept of labour employment and labour housing. Only last week in the very chamber we had a snap debate on the unrest which occurred at a colliery in Natal, resulting in the death of 30 people and the destruction of many hostels at that particular colliery. Surely we must now be planning to move away from migratory labour and towards permanent employment and towards housing our labour in decent homes where they can have their wives and families round them. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister, right here this afternoon, to stop work on this project immediately until the matter has been fully investigated.</p>

<p>In my speech so far I have attempted to show that there is a need for long-term strategic planning, and that the Government has failed in this regard. I have also attempted to show that in spite of the capital expenditure in spite of the attempts that are being made to alleviate the bottlenecks at our harbours by the two-shift system and so on, progress has been poor. I believe I am correct in this because only last week we saw report after report in our newspapers about the congestion at our harbours. We saw headlines such as the following: &#x201C;Vessels take longer to turn around&#x201D;; &#x201C;Fewer ships but a longer wait&#x201D;; &#x201C;Rail jams can result in coal crisis&#x201D;, etc. I believe that this bears out what we have been saying for quite some time and especially what we said in this debate last year when we called for an inquiry to look into the overall needs and the economics and organization of transportation in South Africa. So far the Government has ignored this, and yet the Government has continued <span class="col_2239-2240" refersTo="page_1135"/>to expand its facilities. The Railway Budget, as has been said this afternoon, is one of the biggest in the world.</p>

<p>I should like now to proceed in more detail to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban Point. He moved that we reject this Budget because it &#x201C;fails to reveal an appreciation by the Government of the role the South African Railways has as the dynamic in the development of South Africa and Southern Africa as a whole.&#x201D; The amendment goes on to refer to the fact that there should be a stimulus to morale and incentives to productivity amongst our workers. The Oxford dictionary defines the word &#x201C;dynamic&#x201D; as &#x201C;the energizing or motive force&#x201D;. We submit this amendment this afternoon because we recognize and acknowledge the size of the Railways Administration and its power in the South African economy. It can be the energizing and motive force for progress and prosperity in South Africa and Southern Africa. We believe that South Africa is on the threshold of the open door to its ultimate destiny, i.e. being the powerhouse of Capricorn Africa. The development of South Africa is essential for the ultimate security of all our people and for the ultimate prosperity of all the people in Southern Africa. An essential factor in this development is transport and communication. Because of this we believe that this debate will clearly identify the size of the South African Railways. We believe that it has spare capacity and that this capacity could be used in the interests of promoting the progress and prosperity of the people of Capricorn Africa. We can see the challenge very clearly and we believe that it is our responsibility to our people and to the people of Capricorn Africa to cross this threshold and to get on with the job. We cannot vacillate. We firmly believe that this is the opportune time and we also believe that the Prime Minister has sensed this. We believe that he has timed his move to détente extremely accurately and clearly. He has done so at a time when the world&#x2019;s economic position favours such détente, when the burgeoning problems of Africa, with its expanding populations and rising aspirations, are taxing our neighbouring states as never before in their history This is taking place at a time when our own Black South Africans are emerging from peasant culture into that of an industrialized society, at a time when our own technology and economic position, relative to Africa and to the world, is favourable for such action and also at a time when the previously acceptable attitudes in respect of labour, remuneration, status and position must be altered to accommodate the economic and social emancipation of our Black fellow South Africans. Now is the time for action and not for shilly-shallying with outdated philosophies. We have all seen the Government in recent weeks battling with this dilemma, the dilemma of some of its leaders who realize the present-day needs of our great nation and who are being held back by the bigoted views of some of their more verkrampte colleagues.</p>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, but I feel I must say this because we find in a recent news report that 13 000 Blacks are now working in White jobs. I am just trying to indicate to hon. members that there is a reluctance on the part of the Government and some of its members to get on and to do the job which we quite clearly see needs to be done. There are some hon. members in this House who have said that job reservation will be disposed of over their dead bodies. But then this hon. Minister informs us, and we read it every day, that more and more Blacks are taking over the jobs of Whites. It is not just those of shunters; the thin edge of the wedge is already in the trades and in administrative jobs. Because of this I want to ask whether it is not time for all of us to get rid of these old hang-ups of the past. Is it not time we acknowledged the reality of South Africa and of Africa as a whole? Is it not time we accepted the challenge of Africa, which I believe is our responsibility? I believe we should dump all these out-of-date philosophies which still persist on certain benches on that side of the House. I believe we have to get on with the job and I believe this is the time to do so. We also believe that the S.A. Railways should be the dynamic, the energizing and motive force to spearhead the progress of Capricorn Africa into the future. The reasons for such a plan are very clear for all of us to see. In the Railways we have a work force of 232 000 people, which is almost equally divided between Black and White Here we have an organization with a network of branches which extend into every village of South Africa and which has daily contact with millions of Blacks and Whites throughout the length and <span class="col_2241-2242" refersTo="page_1136"/>breadth of our country. The Railways has daily contact with commerce and industry who want to and in fact have to move forward if they are to survive, and whom we believe should be led by the S.A. Railways and Harbours. The Railways has a Budget so large that its actions have a major effect on the economy and the lives and the way of life of all who come into contact with it and especially on the lives of its 232 000 employees. It may be asked what we suggest. Firstly we believe that the department must accept its competitive position in the South African economy and must plan to maintain its role, as the hon. member for Durban Point has said, as the leader in all its activities which affect the progress and prosperity of Capricorn Africa. Secondly, there should be an extremely high-level planning committee&#x2014; this has already been called for by the General Manager himself&#x2014;which has as one of its main and top priorities the progress and prosperity of all people in Southern Africa. Thirdly, there must be a review of all systems in operation. I have tried to indicate this afternoon how we are battling with antiquated ideas and that when we find something supposedly new we make a great song and dance about it even though this has been done every day for many years in many other businesses. It is essential for us to ensure that the Railways are up to date and efficient and are making the best use of their men and machinery. Fourthly, there must be a review of the roles of the White and the Black workers on the S.A. Railways so as to ensure that there is no discrimination in regard to opportunity and reward. This means an unequivocal acceptance of the principles of there being dignity in labour, of equal opportunity for all and of equal pay for equal work and responsibility.</p>

<p>Fifthly, we believe that this power of the S.A. Railways&#x2014;of its men, of its productive capacity, of its technology and its experience&#x2014;should be offered to our neighbouring States on a basis of mutual cooperation and assistance and in the interest of the security, economy and economic well-being of all our people. This is the challenge which we on this side of the House see facing an industrialized Capricorn Africa. Which other organization is better placed and more ideally motivated to take up this challenge than the dynamic S.A. Railways Administration?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Amanzimtoti referred to the alleged delay in the Durban harbour. The other day the hon. member had the opportunity of paying a visit to Durban with the Select Committee, where we had the opportunity to take a look and where the cause of those delays was very clearly stated to us. However, they are making an exception of the few ships that lay there a long time. The hon. member does not put it to this House that it is not only the Railways that are responsible for the landing of those goods. He does not put it to the House that private enterprise, industry, also has obligations as regards the loading and offloading of ships. He does not put it to the House that those people are also responsible for the delays. He forgets to tell the House that the documentation of the cargo is not always properly done. Those things he does not mention; he conceals them. That hon. member had the opportunity to go in, accompanied by a pilot, and see what a mess is unloaded from a ship which one is unable to identify because there is no tag on the goods. Consequently one does not know what the contents were or where the goods have to be sent. However, nothing is said about those things. The hon. member does not mention the circumstances and conditions prevailing as a result of the turning away of ships from Lourenço Marques to Durban and other South African ports. Those things are not mentioned. The hon. member knows that it was estimated originally that 400 000 tons of steel would be imported and that in the past year we have received altogether 900 000 tons. The hon. member, being a practical engineer, ought to know what a difficult and slow process it is to offload steel. It cannot simply be taken and thrown down. The steel has to be offloaded plate by plate and section by section. However, the hon. member does not refer to all these things.</p>

<p>The people who are now maintaining that we had done no planning are the people who foresaw no future for South Africa in 1970. I want to come back to the hon. member for Maitland. Last year, when we wanted to narrow the gap between the low-rated and the high-rated traffic, the hon. members on the other side of the House had the opportunity of agreeing with us. However, at the time they wanted to be popular with the voters <span class="col_2243-2244" refersTo="page_1137"/>and consequently they voted against high rates. Now, however, they come and moan about it. The hon. member for Maitland admitted today that we should increase the rates annually. However, has that hon. member ever considered what it would involve if the rates were to be adjusted annually? Does the hon. member realize the administrative burden that would be placed on every clerk at every station and in every office if the rates were to be changed every year?</p>

<p>If one were to have to make those adjustments every year, one would be placing an enormous administrative burden on the Railways. Probably the hon. member does not want adjustments to be made in a year in which there is a surplus. Last year the hon. member advanced the argument that the Railways should transport people gratis. Surely the hon. the Minister provided him with a very clear reply then, namely that there were certain concessions which the Railways received from other departments. The customs and excise concessions are an example and they need not pay certain taxes. Now the hon. member is maintaining that the Railways would have been better off if they had had that revenue. This is the kind of argument they employ from time to time as it suits them.</p>

<p>However, I want to come back to the speech by the hon. member for Durban Point. To my regret he is not in the House at the moment. One really does not know whether one should always take the hon. member seriously. However, I have decided that there is no one better able to interpret the role of a clown than the hon. member. He is the person who always has to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for that party. Now that it has become evident that there will be a surplus of about R28,7 million this year, the hon. member is the first to agitate for us to pay higher salaries and higher wages and for us to pay the pensioners more as well. We are all sympathetic towards the pensioners, but surely we know that there are bodies that see to those matters. Last year, when we introduced higher rates, when we proposed that the low rated traffic be increased by almost 20% and the high-rated traffic by 5%, it was those hon. members who opposed it. Now that there is a surplus, they want to come and skim it off the table. Those hon. members always want to be popular and that is the reason why they are such a disintegrated party. Actually they are not a party because they fall between two stools; they run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. That is why they look as they do.</p>

<p>Hon. members need not concern themselves about Waterberg. I now come to the hon. member for Amanzimtoti. He praised detente and what the hon. the Prime Minister is doing. Why did that hon. member not have the courage to do what Mr. Harry Scwarz did in the No Confidence Debate? [Interjections.] Those hon. members would do well to leave the issue of salaries, wages and pensions in the capable hands of the General Manager, his staff and the staff associations. We know that they have handled the matter properly in the past and that they will continue to do so in the future. I want to know how seriously we should take what the hon. member for Durban Point has said in this House.</p>

<p>Last year, when the hon. the Minister provided us with a survey of the activities of the year 1973-&#x2019;74, he said that we were experiencing sound economic growth and sound economic conditions and that at that stage expected the surplus to be not R7,8 million, but well over R38 million. The hon. the Minister said that in spite of the sound economic conditions he expected a levelling out. He said that he expected that owing to the increased salaries, the increased prices of steel and the increased prices of fuel, we would have to expect the Railways revenue to be about 12,7% higher. What did the hon. member for Durban Point do? He threw up his hands and reproached the hon. the Minister by saying that if the economic situation remained so favourable, then he was living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise if he were to budget for a <span class="col_2245-2246" refersTo="page_1138"/>surplus of R3,2 million for the year ahead. The hon. member for Durban Point said that the Railways was facing a crisis. That is the accusation he made. He asked the hon. the Minister whether the hon. the Minister would again sell his investments at a loss as in the past if there were to be an economic slow-down. He accused the Minister of dealing the Rates Equalization Fund a knock-out blow. In addition he accused the Minister of having plundered the Renewals Fund and of not having made sufficient provision for depreciation. How seriously then, must we &#x2026;</p>

<p>It was that hon. member. Hon. members might as well go and read the speeches he made last year. Now that there is a surplus, they want to come and skim off the cream. There is only one place to deposit that surplus. In terms of our constitution it must be deposited in the Rates Equalization Fund. After all, they are the people who are continually accusing us of having annihilated that Fund, I think it is necessary for us to stop a moment at this point and take a look at the Rates Equalization Fund. In 1962 we had R22 million in that Fund. Over the period 1962 to 1966 we deposited R33 million in it, but over the same period we paid R35 million in salaries. The next year we withdrew R14 million owing to a deficit. In the years from 1964 to 1970 we deposited R36 million and withdrew R13 million, but on 1 April 1968 we paid out R43 million in salary increases. In 1970-&#x2019;71 R27 million was deposited, but on 1 June 1970 we paid out R64 million in increased salaries. During the period 1971 to 1974 things did not go so well. During that period we withdrew R89 million, please note on 1 January 1973 we paid out R100 million in salary increases. Last year we deposited R33 million in the Fund, but on 1 July 1974 we again paid out salary increases of R111 million. In the years mentioned, therefore, a total of R129 million has been deposited in the Fund, R116 million has been withdrawn in respect of deficits and over R354 million has been paid out in salary increases.</p>

<p>Looking at the state of the fund, we see that if this surplus of R28 million which we expect is deposited in the Fund on 31 March, we shall have a favourable balance of R63 million. This, then, is the so-called annihilated and plundered Fund! It is evident that the Fund will be much higher at that stage than it has been in many years. Let us take a brief look at where the R25 million surplus we are expecting in the 1974-&#x2019;75 financial year comes from. Let us dwell for a moment on this point and consider from where we are expecting that extra revenue that has boosted our surplus from R3 million to R28 million. As far as the Railways are concerned, R4 million accrued from passenger traffic and R4 million from goods traffic. R2 million accrued from rent and storage fees, and R8,6 million from miscellaneous. Analysing the &#x201C;miscellaneous&#x201D;, one finds that R4 million of it comprises one-third more wharfage from the harbours. This is in consequence of the increased value of imports. From the period April to December 1974, imports rose by 54% and the value of exports rose by 43% over the same period. Then, too, there was an increase of R1,7 million in demurrage on trucks. I find it disturbing that we should have an increased income in respect of demurrage on trucks. We should much rather have seen those trucks being utilized to the full, enabling us to earn money from transporting freight rather than from demurrage on those trucks. When one makes this analysis, one sees that the Railways had earned approximately R8 million more than was originally estimated. In the case of the Airways, R20 million more was earned than had originally been estimated. One also finds that the expenditure over that period rose by about the same amount. In other words, the Airways balanced out. The pipeline&#x2014;this is one of the things they want to separate from the Railways&#x2014;provided us with an extra R9 million. In the same way the harbours provided us with an extra R8 million in wharfage. This is where the extra R25 million came from which enables us to have a surplus of R28 million at the end of this financial year. It is very clear that this additional revenue has accrued from harbour revenue and pipelines and that the Railways only made a minor contribution to this surplus. If we bear in mind that a revenue of R1 556 000 000 was originally estimated, and that an extra R25 million was collected, then it is very clear that the estimated Budget hit the bullseye, that it was as close as possible to the truth. I say that this constitutes proof that the hon. the Minister budgeted correctly last year, and was not living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. <span class="col_2247-2248" refersTo="page_1139"/>It was that party that was living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. The accusation made by the hon. member for Durban Point that the Railways was experiencing a crisis, was the biggest lot of nonsense because our Railways are nowhere near a crisis. I say that what is striking when one considers the present Budget&#x2014;so far no one has referred to this&#x2014;is that we should be grateful that an additional amount of R30 million is being deposited in the Betterment Fund. The amount was R40 million last year and consequently is virtually being doubled. I say that this is something to be taken note of in this Budget. We must also take note of the fact that a further amount of R9&#x00BD; million is being set aside in respect of depreciation This is a very healthy sign. What I like about this additional amount of R30 million is the fact that one is defraying one&#x2019;s capital expenditure on a cash basis. This combats inflation.</p>

<p>I referred to this fund that is supposedly being plundered. At the moment there is an amount of R165 million in the Renewals Fund. This was the balance of the fund on 30 November 1974. Does that look like a fund that has been plundered? Another striking item in the Budget is the fact that the interest rate that will have to be paid is R47 million more. The hon. member for Maitland referred to this. This is not disturbing. Last year the hon. the Minister told us that if we were to compare this with our revenue we should find that it came to about 13,8% of the revenue and that over the past 15 years, interest has varied between 12,9% and 14,8% of revenue. Consequently this is entirely realistic. Let us take a look at our expenditure, namely Head No. 5&#x2014;Expenditure. R43 million in respect of traffic, and vehicle running expenses. There is an additional amount of R41 million for working on the Airways. This is the additional expenditure we must look at in this Budget.</p>

<p>Now we have had the accusation made by the Opposition that this National Party, the Government, and the Railways in particular are shortsighted as far as their planning is concerned. On what does the Opposition base that accusation? I am sorry the hon. member for Durban Point is not present. He said that the capital programme for 1972-&#x2019;73 amounted to R250 million and that in 1975-&#x2019;76 it amounted to R526 million. In other words, the capital programme has doubled over a period of four years. But consider in how ridiculous a fashion he measures this. He states that the capital programme for 1963-&#x2019;64 was R126 million and in 1972-&#x2019;73 it was R250 million. Consequently the capital programme doubled over a period of 10 years, whereas it has now doubled over a period of four years. I say that it is ridiculous to come to such a conclusion. Those are the words he used last Wednesday. He said: &#x201C;The planning came all in one rush.&#x201D; He went on to say: &#x201C;There was no far-sighted planning.&#x201D; The Railways are shortsighted in their planning! He also said: &#x201C;I say it is no planning when suddenly out of the blue increases are thrown in.&#x201D; I say, what an idiotic (&#x201C;sottig&#x201D;) attack to make on the Government!</p>

We all know about the price increases that have taken place from 1972 to 1975. We all know how prices have risen. I want to give the hon. member for Durban Point an example. He would have done well to have done some homework. In 1963 we purchased 53 electric locomotives. They cost R6,3 million; in 1972-&#x2019;73 they cost R10 million, and now they cost R18 million. A thousand DZ-type dropside bogeys cost R3,8 million. In 1973-&#x2019;74 they cost almost R7 million, and in 1975-&#x2019;76 they cost R10 million. The Railways network, as the hon. member for Witwatersberg said, has not stood still like something one can cover with a tarpaulin. No, the Railways network has expanded tremendously since 1962. Just consider the capital investment in the Railways. On 31 March 1965 it came to about R1 900 million and now it comes to R3 700 million. One will, of course, have to make far greater provision for capital works and improvements. That is precisely what we are doing, but now, suddenly, this is not enough. On the one hand one is attacked because one has not made sufficient provision for replacement, for improvements and for capital works, and on the other the accusation is levelled that there is no planning. Sir, how can one argue with people like that? The figures I am quoting here prove conclusively that we have not been shortsighted in our planning; these figures refute that argument by hon. members opposite out of hand. They <span class="col_2249-2250" refersTo="page_1140"/>come along with these attacks, but why do they not tell the world at large and the man in the street about the achievements of the Railways? Surely they could give the Railways credit where credit is due now and again.</p>

<p>I should like to hear that. The hon. member will be given the opportunity to do so. Sir, I think that we all have reason to be proud of the Railways. Just consider how much is transported by the Railways in a single day in passengers and goods. Every 24 hours, 6 300 trains run, of which 3 445 are goods trains and 2 855 are passenger trains. They transport 1 600 000 passengers and over 400 000 tons of goods daily. Surely this is an achievement we can be proud of. If there had not been proper planning, would the Railways have been able to transport these passengers and these goods? Take the Airways. We have a fleet of 31 aircraft, which maintain 166 scheduled internal, overseas and regional flights, with a total carrying capacity of 10 160 passengers. Surely, Sir, this is something we have reason to be proud of; it is something we can tell the world with pride.</p>

<p>Sir, I was in Germany recently and there I was told by a German: &#x201C;When I fly to South Africa, I prefer to fly by the South African Airways; I even prefer it to my own Airways, Lufthansa.&#x201D; Sir, it is things like these that we can be proud of.</p>

<p>Let us go further and consider our harbours, in which hon. members opposite are so disappointed. Sir, 55 ships are handled daily. Over 100 000 tons are landed daily, and over 80 000 tons are shipped.</p>

<p>Sir, I have referred to a few of the problems; I have referred to the delays that take place owing to circumstances beyond the control of the Railways. The hon. member referred to the stevedores. Surely we know what the problems have been in this regard; we know that the stevedores went on strike at one stage; that is nothing new, but now the hon. member wants to blame the Railways because those people went on strike. This was something that was beyond the control of the Railways. The Railways was not to blame for the strike; on the contrary, we are grateful that the Railways stepped in and solved the problem by means of a two-shift system. When they have adequate staff, I am convinced that we shall not only maintain the two-shift system in full operation but that we shall even be able to introduce a three-shift system.</p>

<p>Sir, look at our road transport service. We see fine luxury buses transporting tourists daily across the length and breadth of South Africa, Sixty-six thousand passengers and more than 12 000 tons of goods are transported daily. Then there is our pipeline system. New capital must be made available for additional pipelines. Thirty&#x002D;seven million ton-litres are pumped daily. Now I ask: Who performs this daily task? These things, these massive figures I have mentioned here, who is it who performs this daily task? This daily task is performed by a labour force of 230 000 people. The hon. member for Amanzimtoti said that he is concerned because we are building a hostel in which we shall accommodate Bantu because, he asked, what would we do with them in the future? He maintains that when we have containerization we shall have to dismiss seven out of every ten of them. Now I ask you, Sir, what reason does he have to be concerned about that? Surely we know that we can accommodate those people. The Railways has expanded over the past ten years. Mechanization and automation has taken place and yet the number of staff has only varied by 3,1%. I therefore see no danger that these things he is so concerned about, will occur. These are matters which do not worry me in the least.</p>

<p>However, there is one matter on which I want to dwell for a moment. It is a matter which applies particularly, perhaps, to the Vaal triangle and surroundings. I refer specifically to the South Sotho Bantu territory. It is a fact that the people who live there, the South Sothos, constitute the fifth largest ethnic group among the Bantu peoples in South Africa. Those people live in a very small homeland, that will have difficulty in becoming viable. Consequently they will always be dependent on employment in South Africa. Today I want to make an earnest plea to the hon. the Minister to consider whether an investigation could not be made into the construction of a decent, high-speed railway link between that area and the Vaal triangle. Excessive <span class="col_2251-2252" refersTo="page_1141"/>distances are not involved. I even foresee that by means of modern transport we could take them home to their homelands, perhaps not every day, but every week. This would solve a cardinal problem for us, because then we should not have to accommodate them in our cities. Perhaps this should be linked to the development of the other homelands. Of course the Railways will have to create the infrastructure and they will have to play the most important part in this regard. I want to make an earnest plea here that we consider establishing an umbrella committee representing the Railways, Planning and Bantu Administration to investigate this entire matter of transport to and from the homelands.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to deal with the last point made by the hon. member who has just sat down, I think there is already a committee in existence which deals with the conveyance of non-Whites from their homelands to their places of work. It is, therefore, not necessary for him to plead for another committee to be established when there is one established already for that particular purpose.</p>

<p>The hon. member practically supports our amendment, that we need a much more dynamic outlook. The hon. member reminds me of a boxer who rushes into the ring and blindly throws punches all over the show without knowing what he is going to hit. All he knows is that he has to throw punches. Does he realize, Sir, that the objective in this debate is for the Opposition to level constructive criticism at the Budget which has been presented to us? We are fully aware of what is taking place in South Africa. We do not need to be read a homily on what the Railway Administration achieves in South Africa. We have a very excellent General Manager&#x2019;s report, for which the General Manager is always commended because it is a very clear and explicit statement, and we do not need to travel abroad to know what good things take place in our country. But nevertheless we have a responsibility, and that is to place certain issues before the hon. the Minister and the country, issues which we feel should be dealt with by the Government. Let me remind him further that a bad policy usually results in losses and surpluses occur despite the bad policies of a Government. Our objective is to deal with the policy of the Government, not with the actual achievements of the Railways which we know all about and which are presented to us from year to year. We have for years pleaded for an improvement in the position of pensioners. Many of our pleas have been accepted. Ideas which we have put have been found acceptable to the Government. We have continually lodged pleas for an improvement in the position of the lower grades. In this inflationary system in which we live, and with the general increase in the cost of living over the years, we have indicated that it is necessary to watch the lowest grades. In this House, on many an occasion, I have lodged pleas for this. The hon. member for Durban Point is justified in coming along, in the interests of those people, to lodge a plea for them to ensure that something is said in Parliament on behalf of these people who, unfortunately, are often completely voiceless except that they may possibly have representatives who may or may not put their case before the House.</p>

<p>There is nothing to criticize in what the hon. member for Durban Point has said. He has tried to analyse the Budget as well as hon members on the other side have tried to do. However, at the same time he has also talked about those real factors which mean so much in the life of the community and which mean so much realistically to human beings.</p>

<p>I want to deal with another matter which I find of great interest and which I think is important to deal with today. I notice something in the General Manager&#x2019;s report which I can use as an introduction to this particular discussion. It is stated that the capital amount spent on the construction of new lines during the year under review in the report was R28,8 million. In respect of existing lines it was R183,7 million. However, we shall focus our attention on the fact that over that year, 1973-&#x2019;74, the total spent throughout the country on the provision of new lines was R28,8 million. During 1973 an issue was raised, in the course of the Budget speech, by the hon. the Minister. He pointed out that it was essential&#x2014;following a report which he had obtained from the Railway Board, a copy of which I have here and which I have studied&#x2014;to bring about the satisfactory and efficient conveyance of the large number of non-Whites, who have been settled in the Tswana Homeland north of Pretoria, from the homeland to their place of employment to the north of Pretoria and in Pretoria itself. He pointed out that it was essential to commence almost <span class="col_2253-2254" refersTo="page_1142"/>immediately on this work and that eventually it would, involve an expenditure of R70 million. He further repeated what was stated in the report of the Railway Board, i.e. that this work would be completed within approximately four years. This was in the year 1973.</p>

<p>Thereafter legislation was brought before the House in the form of a Railway Construction Bill in which authority was sought from the House to proceed with this particular work. Authority was requested to spend the money necessary to construct the proposed line. The hon. the Deputy Minister introduced the Bill and stated that an eventual sum of about R62,4 million would be required. He gave specific sums. For example, about R20 million was required for the building of an electrified double line of railway approximately 20 km in length, about R15 million for the building of another link line and approximately R20 million for the building of another set of lines. It seemed that the Administration contemplated spending about R50 million on the building of the lines, with additional money being required for other facilities and equipment to provide the necessary rail transport. The main centre for which the lines would be built was the township of Mabopane in Bophuthatswana where there were at that time, according to the hon. the Deputy Minister, 45 000 people resident, and an additional 112 000 people living close by in the adjoining areas. He also said that it was expected that by the year 1978 there would be a total of 500 000 people. In fact, it is already believed, with some authority in certain quarters that that area has now approximately 300 000 inhabitants. Apparently this was a matter of great urgency, because not only was it the subject of a Bill introduced by the hon. the Deputy Minister at the time, but it was very well supported both on this side of the House and the other side. Some of the speakers seemed to know a little more about the matter because they were closer to the scene of operations. Although the hon. member for Gezina, who comes from the Pretoria area, spoke this afternoon, he never made any reference at all to this particular matter of which I am going to give a little more detail in a moment. The hon. the Deputy Minister went so far as to say in 1973:</p>

<block name="quote">As far as priority is concerned, it is estimated that the construction of the railway line will take approximately four years. The work is being tackled with great speed and urgency and this matter enjoys high priority. I want to tell the hon. member that I shall leave no stone unturned when dealing with, this matter.</block>

<p>He was using these very strong words in reply to a speech by the hon. member for Hercules. That was really a &#x201C;kragdadige&#x201D; statement from the hon. the Deputy Minister, one which is almost in line with our amendment. At that time it was also pointed out that a great number of people were travelling from these homelands by buses and other forms of private transport. In fact, I think 5 000 were travelling in private conveyances and another 15 000 or 20 000 in public transport. This was creating considerable over-crowding on the roads constituting a very grave danger. According to a statement made at the time it also caused enormous congestion. &#x201C;To my mind this is something which we should try and avoid in the interests of both the Whites and the Bantu&#x201D;, the hon. the member for Hercules said on 11 June 1973 Hansard, Vol. 44, col. 8784. He went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">In the near future at least 50 000 Bantu workers will have to be transported from the Mabopane area to Pretoria, where they are employed. It is in the interest of both the Whites and the Bantu that this congestion should be eliminated. The traffic problems in the northern part of Pretoria are assuming dangerous proportions. I have the greatest respect for the patience of both the Whites and the non-Whites &#x2026;</block>

<p>He continues along these lines. If the hon. the Minister would read this column he would realize that the hon. member was pointing out a state of affairs which could possibly lead to some acute and very serious situations by virtue of this form of road traffic and the lack of proper rail facilities prevailing. This would also lead to serious disruptions, etc. What do we actually find is the position? One realizes why there was almost a sense of panic at the time because here was the first big homeland, virtually on the perimeter of a big city like Pretoria a bare 20 km away, with big townships being built there as model townships for the world to see. This is a very commendable pursuit which we on this side of the House supported. It was essential to enable the orderly <span class="col_2255-2256" refersTo="page_1143"/>movement of workers to take place so that the Government could at least, to some extent, be able to justify the policy it had undertaken. It is interesting to see what actually occurred during that period. In those two years the electrified double line of railway, which was to run between Winternest near Pretoria North and Mabopane for the conveyance of Bantu employed in the Pretoria area and which, was to cost R20 million, already had approximately R10 200 spent on it up to 31 March 1975. In the present Estimates provision is made to spend for the year 1975/76 R451 000, which means that after 1976, in the next Budget for 1976-77 and onwards, provisions will have to be made to handle a balance of R19 286 200. With regard to the other issue, which is part of this whole complex of building a line for the conveyance of workers, involving as it does the building of a new station at Belle Ombré which would cost about R15 million, the position is the following: The estimated cost is R15 026 100. Up to 31 March 1975 R35 800 had been spent. Estimated expenditure for 1975-76 is an amount of R135 000, making up a total of R170 900 and leaving R14 855 200 to be dealt with from 1976-77 onwards. Now one comes to the remaining portion, the Hercules/Winternest section which is estimated to cost R16 047 600. Spending up to 31 March 1975 will be R1 100 and the estimated 1975-76 expenditure R111 600, making a total of R112 700 and leaving a balance of R15 934 900 to be provided from 1975-76 onwards. We therefore find that a considerable balance to be allocated for future years from the next Budget to meet this serious situation&#x2014;I do not use those words. I quote them from Hansard and the knowledge of hon. members who represent that part of the world, from the knowledge which the hon. the Minister has, from the report of the Railway Board, and from the policy of the Government which we know is to enable this form of conveyance to take place efficiently&#x2014;if not rapidly, at least efficiently. We find that the balance which is to be allocated for future years to be spent for the purpose will be R50 076 300. There will of course be additional works or equipment which will bring the figure up to the originally estimated amount of R62,4 million and which the hon. the then Minister thought at the time would perhaps reach R70 million. Look at this against the background of having spent R28 million in 1973-74 for all the new lines right throughout South Africa. What is the State going to do about it? How can they ever manage to get through all this money and be able to accomplish what was regarded as an urgent matter to be completed within four years when we are already almost at the beginning of the third of those four years and our total expenditure amounts to only R711 000 out of a total amount of nearly R52 million? I ask the hon. the Minister&#x2014;we are not blaming anybody&#x2014;merely to explain this matter to us. He is the man who runs the department and formulates policy. We have to come to him as he is the policymaker. When the hon. the Minister asks for the money, the Opposition is only too willing to fall in with these plans because they realize that it is necessary to provide expenditure for this particular essential service. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark stated that we make allegations which do not count and advance ideas which do not matter. We criticize increases in tariffs and when we see surpluses we indicate to the Government how the money should be spent. In other words, he suggests that we indulge in wild talk. Will the hon. the Minister please give us an answer on this particular issue?</p>

<p>I also want to raise the question of Soweto. I see that there is a reference to the provision of certain improvements in, I think, the signalling section. There are certain new works which have to be completed in order to improve the services at Chanador Junction. I do not think that sufficient attention is being paid to one of the most vital and important problems facing the country.</p>

<p>When I studied these figures, I was really intensely surprised to find that we had a passing reference to this particular issue in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget. Listen to the irony of it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every endeavour is being made to expedite the detailed planning of the several schemes for the provision of facilities to convey non-White passengers by rail from the Tswana Homeland to their place of work mainly in the Pretoria area.</block>

<p>Included in this project is the proposed new line to be provided. He quotes the very words: &#x201C;Between Winternest and Mabopane and the new station for non-Whites Belle Ombre on the associated railway network.&#x201D; When this matter was raised some years ago, I think it was in 1971 or 1972, the importance of dealing with this particular aspect <span class="col_2257-2258" refersTo="page_1144"/>was pointed out to the then hon. Minister. People in Pretoria, the industrial complex, the residential complex and the city commercial complex were very much concerned about this. A new experiment was being embarked upon and one wanted to know what would be the effect and result of it. Then a speaker on this side of the House who happens to come from the Witwatersrand was accused of poking his nose into areas which did not concern him. Someone on the Government side said: What do you know about this area? Why are you asking these questions? There is no particular motive but it is part and parcel of the whole overall picture. For years we have complained about the problems at Soweto and for years we have said that we in this country must rely on the emergence&#x2014;it is now an accepted fact in Government circles&#x2014;of the tremendous pool of non-White labour which we have had in reserve for many, many years. The time has come where we can follow no other course and in order to meet that position we need tremendous planning. I realize that we need tremendous planning to provide for containerization. We talked about containerization five years ago. We know that it is necessary to plan in order to enlarge the harbours of our country. We know it is important to plan for better bogies. Incidentally, I see that some very fine discoveries have been made by engineers of our staff with regard to bogies. It is necessary to plan for all these things but above all and despite the fact that it may be a tremendous undertaking it is necessary to plan for other vital factors. Perhaps the most vital factor in the whole country is the question of proper and efficient conveyance and the question of getting people to work in time and bringing them back home as soon as possible because the whole question of labour peace rests on this factor. Most of our unrest starts with the irritations that are caused among workers who have to earn their daily bread. I do not want to go through the gamut of people who have to get up at 3 o&#x2019;clock in the morning and who get home at 8 o&#x2019;clock or 9 o&#x2019;clock in the evening because we have discussed this <i>ad nauseam.</i> There is no hon. member in this House who does not know of this problem and who does not understand it thoroughly. What we are concerned about is that there should be proper planning on a realistic scale. Perhaps the hon. the Minister had no right to make a statement that this could be done in four years. Perhaps he had no right to say that this project needed the highest priority. Perhaps he had no right to say that he would leave no stone unturned. Nevertheless he said it. We as members of the Opposition as well as all hon. members of Parliament and the whole country must accept what has been placed before us. We must accept that the hon. the Minister is aware of what he says, that he is aware of what he promises and that he is aware of what he undertakes. We on this side of the House are not running the department; it is the hon. the Minister who dictates and directs the policy. It is principally along those lines that I feel we can answer the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark quite easily. I could spend another hour telling the hon. member many of the silly things that he said. Anyone can give a mass of figures. I can spend the whole allocation of time for this Budget analysing the figures for him as well. We have done that dozens and dozens of times. From year to year, however, there are certain occasions when matters of realism and matters of the day must be discussed. Those are the things that count and those are the things we have been tackling. We are concerned about the forward planning of the Republic of South Africa. We are concerned about our relationships abroad. We are concerned about what our Railways can do as far as Mozambique, Angola, Malawi and Zambia are concerned because we know that communications are a vital factor in any form of détente between countries. Do we not know what has happened in Europe and do we not know what has happened in other parts of the world? Communications are the most vital public relations factor in all our relationships with peoples and nations and that is why we have moved an amendment of this nature. We do not move an amendment of this nature to be destructive but we bring it to indicate what our viewpoint is, to indicate how we see the picture and to show what our approach is. We do not frame the Budget and we do not present the Budget, but we do give a point of view in regard to the Budget. We give a point of view as to what the vision for the future should be. This is the road that we have trodden in the debate today and we believe this road is a sound one, a responsible one and one to which the country should pay attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Jeppe, who has just resumed his seat, referred to an isolated complex or project. I am not going to try to react to that, but I am sure that reference will be made to it on a later occasion.</p>

<p>I find it very interesting that right at the start of his speech the hon. member for Durban Point should have referred to a National Party information document dated 1943. When we on this side of the House refer to the time when the United Party was in power, we are always told that that was really many years ago. This afternoon, however, the hon. member referred to a report dated 1943 dealing, <i>inter alia,</i> with the appointment of a Superintendent (Parliamentary) by the then Minister, Mr. Sturrock. I called for the Hansard of 1943 to find out exactly what had occurred. It is of interest that as soon as I opened the book, I came upon a question asked in 1943, viz. what was the wage paid to casual tradesmen in the service of the Administration at Kaserne, Johannesburg. Secondly, the question was asked what privileges these people enjoyed as casual tradesmen. The reply to the first question was 2/10¾d. &#x2026; [Interjections.] The additional benefits they enjoyed were 12 days paid leave after 12 months uninterrupted service. I looked up the appointment of the Superintendent to ascertain what all this involved. It was very interesting. The first argument concerned the post of the Secretary of the Railway Service Commission. The Minister at the time was in an awkward situation because a salary of £1 200 per annum was attached to this post. Eventually the Railways Board convened and decided hat the post was not worth more than £735. They reduced the salary accordingly. After a month the salary was raised to £840. It then appeared that a certain person had been groomed for that post and had to be pushed into it. Subsequently the matter of the Superintendent (Parliamentary) was raised. It is amazing that a maximum salary of £1 000 per annum was attached to the post of Superintendent (Parliamentary). I want to quote from Hansard of 27 April 1943 (Vol. 43, col. 6410).</p>

<block name="quote">Since 1919 the maximum salary attached to this post was £1 000 per annum.</block>

<p>In other words, for more than 20 years there were no salary increases in regard to that post. What happened then, was that an additional post with a maximum salary of £1 600 per annum was created. Mr. Haywood, a member of Parliament at that time, had the following to say in that connection (Hansard, vol. 46, col. 6411)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the time when the Government sends people to fight in the North, during the time that the Minister demands overtime from his people, at this juncture he creates another post with a maximum salary of £1 600.</block>

<p>This is apart from the normal post that was created. This is what happened after the maximum salary attached to the other post had remained unaltered for 20 years.</p>

<p>I delved a little further into the year 1943 &#x2014;I am taking the liberty of discussing this &#x2014;and I found it interesting to look at the salary scale that appeared in the 1943 General Manager&#x2019;s report. The maximum salary for a senior clerk was £525. I want to give the Opposition the opportunity to tell me what depreciation in the value of money has been since 1943. Is it 50%, or 70%? Just mention he figure.</p>

<p>The salary for the corresponding post is R6 400 per annum today as against R1 100 in 1943. The party on that side of the House came up with a motion this year in the Other Place&#x2014;we might as well have a little humour&#x2014;introduced by the hon. Senator Scheepers, in which she pleaded for the rights of women. The hon. member for Houghton also introduced a similar motion in the House. Senator Scheepers referred to the injustice done to women today under this Government. Then I looked at the difference between the salaries of the married and the unmarried railway worker. This was in respect of the lowest grade railway worker whose salary was recently placed on a minimum scale of R200 by the Government. <span class="col_2261-2262" refersTo="page_1146"/>That is when he is no longer being trained. The unmarried man in this category received he amount of 7/6d, per day in 1943 and the married man received 8/6d, per day. That is what that side of the House paid these people, and to them women were worth 1/-.</p>

<p>I think that there are few occasions on which one can take stock of the S.A. Railways more effectively than during this very debate on the Railway Budget. It is logical for there to be criticism in this debate. One believes that it is also the occasion on which to express appreciation for services rendered. When we take stock of the S.A. Railways and Harbours in all its facets in this way, it is as well that we should take note of how the international world regards the S.A. Railways today. It is also as well to consider what the railway official of today thinks of this organization. It is also very important to determine what South Africa must do about the S.A. Railways. How are we going to utilize the Railways and how are we going to relieve the burden of this organization. The S.A. Railways is known internationally today as one of the leading organizations entrusted with transport and transport development. There are a number of instances of practical proof of this and I should like to refer to them.</p>

<p>It is not only in South Africa that the General Manager, Mr. Loubser, is consulted as <i>the</i> authority on transport, but as General Manager of the S.A. Railways he receives invitations from virtually every continent each year to lecture on transport and transport affairs here in South Africa. We as South Africans are proud of the fact that in 1973, the General Manager had to give a lecture on transport and transport development in West Germany. This gives one pleasure and it is gratifying to be able to say that he was able to address that congress in its own language, German.</p>

<p>How does international transport see South Africa? I want to refer to the periodical <i>International Railway Journal.</i> In a survey carried out recently, they announced that the S.A. Railway Budget for 1975-&#x2019;76 was the highest in the world. In doing so they made a very important admission in regard to this expenditure by linking it to the striving for preparedness. I have before me the January edition of the <i>International Railway Journal</i> and in it the chief editor, Mr. John Levett, states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A second railway age has hit Africa. In South Africa an already buoyant economy could grow even stronger as a result of new railway construction now in hand or planned.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the most exciting developments by the S.A. Railways&#x2019; motive power department&#x2014;and in particular by mechanical engineer Herbert Scheftel&#x2014; has been a new three-piece bogie which dramatically reduces hunting and ensures good curving. We believe this is a major break-through on an international scale. The beauty of this design is that it is of almost universal application. You can use it on freight wagons, passenger coaches, locomotives. And you can use it equally well for two-axle or three-axle bogies. And for standard or broad-gauge passenger service, it can give the allround riding stability people have been looking for all over the world up to speeds of almost 300 km per hour.</block>

<p>Then there is the appreciation for the fact that the S.A. Railways give its engineers and developers the opportunity to set the pace in international transport, too. This pronouncement in <i>International Railway Journal</i> makes us as South Africans proud of this institution of ours. Sir, I also want to say that it gives one pleasure to read what the Railway official himself thinks of this organization. The saying &#x201C;once a Railwayman, always a Railwayman&#x201D; is well-known, and this saying attests to a greater degree of pride than is immediately obvious. On one occasion I heard our respected former Speaker, Mr. Klopper, saying that he, too, was a Railwayman to his fingertips, because once a Railwayman, always a Railwayman. But I think that I recently heard one of the most interesting references to this sense of unity from the present Minister of Transport, who referred in conversation to &#x201C;my staff association&#x201D; after all the years that have passed since his retirement from the Railway service. Consequently one realizes that there is truth, after all, in this proud saying, &#x201C;Once a Railwayman, always a Railwayman&#x201D;. I detect further proof of the pride of the Railway officials in their preparation and presentation of reports.</p>

<p><span class="col_2263-2264" refersTo="page_1147"/>I can only describe the Railways&#x2019; Annual Report for the report year 1973-&#x2019;74 that appeared last week, as a prestige edition. In my opinion the S.A. Railways has succeeded in publishing this edition as not only a report for national consumption, but also as a report concerning South Africa and the economy of South Africa and also development in South Africa. Sir, other reports, too, such as that provided to members of the Select Committee on the occasion of their visit to Durban harbour also testify to his pride on the part of the Railwayman. This is an outstanding report that was neatly prepared and speedily supplied and is one of which any organization could be proud. Sir, we also express our appreciation in this House of these extremely impressive and extremely comprehensive reports prepared by the S.A. Railways, often speedily but also, as a rule, with total dedication in order that it may be a prestige publication. In passing, Sir, those of us who take an interest in photography want to compliment the Railways on the photographs that appeared in this year&#x2019;s S.A. Railways Report. They are photographs of the highest quality. When one goes on to consider the pride that has developed within the community of Railway officials, one also takes note of the fact that during the past ten years the labour market has remained constant within 3,1%, while the ton kilometres carried by of the S.A. Railways have increased by 45% as against 55% for all services. This represents an increase in production of 2,2% per annum. Here again we have appreciation for the pace set by the Railways in this sphere as well.</p>

<p>Sir, in my opinion the debate on this Railway Budget should, for the most part, be concerned with the question of how effectively we utilize the S.A. Railways and how effectively it may be developed through correct utilization. I think that the time has come for people to get away from the old and petty approach that the Railways are there to transport parcels and cream cans and post, or even that persons have the right to receive a consignment of from 4 kg to 440 metric tons within two days after it has been sent. Sir, the S.A. Railways had developed in such, a way that it is one of the cardinal factors in the development of the South African and the Southern African domestic economy. It is the Railways, too, which, more than any other factor, determines the expansion of the existing infra-structure in South, Africa. It is only when the movement on the rail way lines is analysed that one really grasps the role played by this organization in the domestic economy. Sir, I made a few calculations and found that on average, either a passenger train or a goods train departs from a station in the Republic every 15 seconds. When one calculates the various amounts in terms of this same period of 15 seconds, one finds that the revenue earned in this period of 15 seconds amounts to approximately R180. But then we must also bear in mind that approximately the same amount of R180 is expended every 15 seconds by the Railways. The programme of expenditure for 1975-&#x2019;76 provides for the expenditure of about R2,4 million per day on capital and replacement requirements. When one makes a survey on what is spent on consumer goods and other items which this expanded transport already requires, one finds that in this brief period of 15 seconds, too, this expenditure amounts to R80. Now it is true that the statutory instruction to the Railways is to perform its task of transportation at the lowest possible cost. Although scientifically speaking, it is difficult to make justifiable international comparisons, the average revenue per ton kilometre, which is indicative of the cost, of the S.A. Railways is substantially lower than in countries such as Britain, Germany, France and Spain. In spite of these relatively low rates, more than one-tenth of the national income is earned from transport activities. The S.A. Railways is responsible for R746 million of the national income, or 62,1 % of the transport section. This percentage also indicates that despite growing competition and rivalry, the S.A. Railways continues to retain its share in the transport activities of South Africa.</p>

<p>Since the claim is made that the S.A. Railways represents one of the most important activities of the national economy, it is necessary for us to have a look at the local expenditure of this organization, and as a consumer the Railways also serves as a market for virtually every sector of the South African economy, because approximately 76% of all supplies are purchased locally. In 1974 this expenditure amounted to almost R280 million, which is more than the total exports to Japan, West Germany and the U.S.A, put together. But ever greater demands will be made on the S.A. Railways in the future, and although facilities are provided at the maximum rate, the rate at which loan funds can be made available, and this position continues to improve, the pressure will continue and <span class="col_2265-2266" refersTo="page_1148"/>there is every justification for the expenditure of these large amounts of which we have taken cognizance this year. It is also clear that the project will continue to demand enormous capital expenditure in the future. Now it is true that the Administration does not rely solely on the provision of capital assets in order to meet the demand; it also acts positively in order to find solutions to the many bottlenecks. But because the success of future development will depend on the way in which this development can be synchronized in all the various spheres&#x2014;and when I say that this development must be synchronized, then I am not only referring to the development within the S.A. Railways, but to the synchronization of the total development in South Africa&#x2014;it is of cardinal importance that the S.A. Railways should be borne in mind to a greater extent in the future when planning is done by the various sectors. I do not doubt for a moment that the S.A. Railways will be able to bear the responsibility of a growing South African structure in the future, but is probably asking too much, to expect the S.A. Railways to accept all responsibility in crisis situations that cannot be foreseen as well, and to absorb everything when there are complaints in this regard. A certain percentage of deviation from the normal growth is planned for, but when situations such as the closing of the Mozambique harbours develop, simultaneously with unexpected fertilizer imports, and all this with in the framework of the energy crisis, then we cannot expect all the responsibility and all the mistakes to be laid at the door of the S.A. Railways. The planning section of the Railways plays a key role in the domestic economy and it is this very section that takes the initiative in co-ordinating the various projects, and it also works very closely with them to such an extent that I believe the S.A. Railways, more than any other organization in the country, can claim to be aware of economic activities. That is why it is necessary for there to be greater co-operation in South Africa, whether in the field of agriculture, mining, building the textile industry or the motor industry. South Africa has become too big to suffer as the result of artificial shortages that have to be supplemented artificially within a short period. In the past, South Africa was to a very great extent crisis-free, as far as the provision of various commodities was concerned. Possibly this freedom from crises resulted in the failure to grasp the value of timely stockpiling on one hand, and regular supply to markets on the other. These problems can so easily lead to exploitation of one sector by another. We appreciate the timely warnings that have been sounded in recent months in respect of this timely planning. As long ago as last year, in his Budget speech, the hon. the Minister pleaded for a greater degree of cooperation, <i>inter alia</i> in the sphere of the improved utilization of trucks. He pleaded for the improved utilization of these trucks through improved loading and off-loading methods. This year the Minister made a further appeal for co-operation. I quote from the Budget speech (page 69)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The department&#x2019;s planning section is responsible for the necessary research, liaison with other sectors of the economy and the co-ordination of its projects. However, there would appear to be a dire need for a wider application of planning principles in order to ensure the equitable distribution of the country&#x2019;s resources. Enormous schemes have already been started or announced for the next decade or so and the optimism engendered by the expected buoyant economy will act as a strong stimulus for still further expansion. It is my view that all large projects in both, the Government and private sectors should be appraised on a national level in future so that priorities can be determined.</block>

<p>One also appreciates the fact that guidelines are being laid down with a view to the invitation to various bodies to strive towards greater co-operation and co-ordination. The private sector and the semi-State institutions will have to link up with the Railways management to a greater extent in the future. On the occasion of the opening of the annual meeting of the Federal Consultative Council of Staff Associations on 26 February this year, the General Manager of the Railways made a strong appeal for this co-ordination. I quote what Mr. Loubser said on 26 February (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is precisely when crisis situations develop that there is a pressing need for co-ordinated action by a capable organization. For this reason I have no doubt that, in the first place, planning must be a sifting process based on a detailed analysis of available capital and physical resources. All major schemes must be <span class="col_2267-2268" refersTo="page_1149"/>considered critically with a clear realization of inflationary pressure, which gives rise to excessive demand.</block>

<p>It is clear that we in South Africa will have to realize that the valueless and the valuable may no longer be taken together but these priorities will have to be carefully determined and that the projects will have to be tackled in logical sequence in the interests of South Africa. In times of problems, avoidable problems must be avoided. When there is a lack of co-operation in this respect, avoidable problems cannot be avoided in these times. Uncoordinated action, which is the result of a lack of overall planning, often gives rise to crisis situations. At a juncture at which South Africa faces the rest of the world with many plus factors in its favour, it will pay our country and our people to benefit the Republic as much as possible by means of co-operation and overall planning. Only this timely planning can put South Africa on a par with world structures at the international level. Increasing expenditure by the authorities on the South African infrastructure is taking place and this will stimulate the economy enormously. It must be borne in mind that this stimulus will also filter through to the S.A. Railways. This imposes a tremendous task on the S.A. Railways and Harbours. How ever, it also imposes an obligation on the private sector to gear itself to make the best use of this in the interests of the country. Possibly now is the time for all sectors to accept the responsibility of bringing about movement when the accommodation is available. Possibly, too, the custom of criticizing the S.A. Railways in and out of season for bottlenecks for which the S.A. Railways cannot carry the responsibility, should also cease. It is true that in the past the S.A. Railways has often had to serve as a shock absorber. It has occurred in the past that because it is such an enormous organization of tremendous scope, the Railways has had to make its sacrifices, owing to inflation or inflationary tendencies by transporting certain freight at an uneconomic rate for a long period, by postponing increases for officials or by having developments take place at a slower pace. In consequence of the development in South Africa the Railways, operating as it does on an economic basis, can no longer be a shock absorber in this way for the sake of other sectors and groups of people. A great deal is being said and written about the population explosion and, on the other hand, about the provision of food as well. Reference is so often made to the problems of providing food, but very seldom to the transportation of that food. I am sure that the S.A. Railways will also honour its responsibility to transport this food, which may be a source of strength to us in the future in the sphere of sound relations and in the sphere of sound nutrition. The Railways will provide an efficient transport service in the future in the interests of the country, but it deserves the support, the co-operation and the consideration of everyone, because if the Railways enjoys this co-operation and consideration, it will be efficient, as we all want it to be.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bethlehem made a strange speech. He started to prove the point made by the hon. member for Durban Point when he quoted certain things from a rather ancient pamphlet issued by the Nationalist Party. The passages quoted by the hon. member for Bethlehem from Hansard, I believe, firmly prove that there are certain variations of the truth in the pamphlet which was issued about the Railways at that time. I thank the hon. member most sincerely for proving this. The rest of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech is remarkably close to the amendment moved by this side of the House. He extended congratulations and said he was proud of the General Manager of the S.A. Railways. We are also proud of him and we believe he is doing a wonderful job. He spoke of research into new bogies and of centralized traffic control. We appreciate that. He said the Railways should cut out small parcels and consignments, but on this point I must disagree with him entirely. If this aspect of the operations of the Railways is well run, I believe it can be run at a profit. The hon. member represents a farming area and should realize that many of the small parcels and consignments are spares for essential agricultural and construction machinery. This cannot be cut out by the Railways because it is absolutely essential to the economy of South Africa that these small parcels and consignments should continue to be conveyed. Then, of course, the hon. member became positive again and talked about the total development of South Africa. He said that the Railways had to act as a shock absorber in times of crises. He mentioned Mozambique and the <span class="col_2269-2270" refersTo="page_1150"/>fertilizer imports that had to take place as a result of the fuel crisis. It really sounded as though he was speaking in favour of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban Point. He asked for overall planning and for logical priorities and this, in full, is what we are asking for. We believe that the Railways are the artery of South Africa and Southern Africa and that that artery is essential to the well-being of the overall economic state of the whole of this subcontinent. We believe that the Railways can play an important part, not only in our internal affairs within our multinational society, but also in our external relations with our neighbours of various races and nations. If this artery of the Railways is running efficiently, economically and is continuously spreading its further arteries to the subcontinent, there will be a mutual pride between all the peoples of Southern Africa in this great asset in the economy of everyone. This is the belief of this side of the House and this is what we mean when we speak about a new dynamic, that there should be some forward-looking in the Railways. That is why I appreciate it when the hon. the member for Bethlehem spoke about overall planning between departments. I believe that the Railways can play as important a role in our human relationships in Southern Africa as all the diplomacy carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and I say this without deprecating the Department of Foreign Affairs. I believe that this is an economic factor that connects us all physically to one economy. We cannot get away from this.</p>

<p>There are other matters I would like to raise in this debate. We were very pleased to note that the commercial section and the operating section of the Railways are being welded into one section. That is something exceptionally positive and we feel that we should&#x2014;as we have always done&#x2014;give credit where credit is due.</p>

<p>There has been a certain amount of prevarication as to the delays in Durban harbour. I believe that there must be a way of overcoming the problem. I have a very good friend in one of the shipping lines &#x2014;an officer&#x2014;to whom I bade farewell in Cape Town one week only to meet him again the following week in Port Elizabeth. I asked him what he was doing there as I thought he was going to Durban. He said that he had been to Durban to show his nose, but that he had come back to offload in Port Elizabeth before going to Durban to load again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Was that after he had loaded in Durban the first time?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>No, without going into Durban harbour. This is a South African shipping line. I believe that you cannot book by radio ahead of time; you may be shipwrecked or delayed along the line. As a result of this the practice amongst shipping lines at the present time is to proceed for example from Cape Town to Durban, show their nose, book their berth, come back to Port Elizabeth to offload and then proceed back to Durban. This is a complete waste of fuel.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Is this Safmarine?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deacon">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>This is Safmarine. It is a complete waste of fuel. The same thing is happening in Algoa Bay where ships go to East London to show their noses and then go to Algoa Bay, Port Elizabeth, to offload. There must be a better way of rationalizing this. The General Manager of the Railways has overcome many things with centralized control and I think he should have a look at this. We cannot have ships running up and down the coast. This is a waste of fuel because they have to run around and wait to get into port. This is a fact and I believe that this should be gone into.</p>

<p>There is another matter which may possibly appear to be a small one. With the advent of centralized control, there are going to be stations and sidings and houses which will become redundant and no longer be required by the Railways. I wonder whether any planning has been done in conjuction with Community Development&#x2014; there is a general shortage of housing and buildings throughout the country&#x2014; to ensure that these buildings are put to positive use or at least are not allowed to decay and go to ruin as certain railway villages or houses have been allowed to do in the past. In the past in the Eastern Cape, for instance, certain lines were relaid and many houses in Cathcart stood empty for years until better use was found for them. The whole village of the old Kommadagga became redundant. I believe that these places&#x2014;if it should arise because of centralization and because of the relaying of lines&#x2014;could be used to very good effect by Community Development in housing <span class="col_2271-2272" refersTo="page_1151"/>aged people in a community. This is a perpetual need in this country. I believe that this is also something to which the Railways could give attention so that there need not be a wastage of good and useful buildings. It is a known fact that when the Railways build houses or buildings they build substantial houses and buildings.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to the question of the scholars&#x2019; ticket concessions which were withdrawn last year. Apparently very good reasons were given for this, but I wish to raise the matter again. On 13 February this year a letter in this connection appeared in <i>The Argus,</i> signed by a parent in Muizenberg. I believe that these concessions should be restored to some extent especially on suburban lines. This lady says that any family with say three or four schoolchildren must find the increasing costs very heavy and difficult to bear. She also feels that it is a waste of paper and labour if one compares the issue of one ticket per pupil per term to the issue of one ticket per pupil per day. She says that it is exceptionally difficult for the Railway officials who sell the tickets to meet the demand at peak hours. We do feel&#x2014;and we complained about this at the time when the facility was removed&#x2014;that this concession should be restored.</p>

<p>Then I wish to refer to a major question which I raised the other day with the hon. the Minister of Transport and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, namely the supply of coal to the country in general. We are seriously concerned about the supply of coal and one sees headlines to this effect in some newspapers. The <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 4 March, which I have before me, has a front-page article with the heading: &#x201C;Rail jams can lead to coal crisis&#x201D;. The gentleman who was interviewed, Mr. Allen Sealey of Rand Mines and chairman of the Transvaal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association, said:</p>

<block name="quote">Last year the Railways were unable to meet the total call for coal transport and we had to use road haulage on a greater scale than anticipated. More than 4 million tons of coal were carried by road and the Railways carried 600 000 tons less in 1974 than in 1973 and some brick works and cement works were closed. Road transport saved the situation. Had it not been for this haulage the coal trade would have sold less in 1974 than in 1973.</block>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">The Natal coal industry is suffering from a shortage of trucks as serious as it has ever encountered. Normally through January, February and March a large quantity of coal is stock-piled by industrial consumers, power stations and traders.</block>

<p>This is a very serious position. The hon. the Minister confirmed this in his reply to me and he said that they were trying to overcome it by sending open trucks down to Natal carrying goods and sending them back loaded with coal. This is not all. When the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs was asked about this a few days before I put my question to the hon. the Minister of Transport, viz. on 4 March, he replied that the oil crisis was putting pressure on production. He said that there were problems in recruiting staff for the mines and that the general growth rate and a good agricultural season had put pressure on the Railways. Furthermore, he said that the floods had caused problems. The final paragraph of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply is, I think, significant. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because of the coincidence of these circumstances there has been a tendency amongst consumers since the end of the winter season to order considerably more coal and anthracite than their normal requirements in order to build up their stocks so as to avoid a possible disruption of their production activities. This tendency has likewise contributed to the additional pressure which has been exerted on the production capacity of our coal and anthracite mines and the country&#x2019;s available transport facilities.</block>

<p>That does not quite seem to meet Mr. Sealey&#x2019;s statement which he made to the <i>Natal Mercury</i> on the same day. When I read through the memorandum by the Minister of Transport I was quite inintrigued to find that the revenue obtained from coal had in fact dropped by approximately R1 million since 1969-&#x2019;70. The figures appear on page 20. I became even more worried. I noticed in Addendum No. 20 to the General Manager&#x2019;s Report, &#x201C;Tonnages of principal commodities railed&#x201D;, that the tonnage in respect of local coal and coke had dropped again between 1972-&#x2019;73 and 1973-&#x2019;74. It dropped by 4 228 tons, which admittedly is not very much. <span class="col_2273-2274" refersTo="page_1152"/>One would think that at a time of a fuel crisis when the energy produced from coal is used more and more to meet the country&#x2019;s demands, every effort would be made to move our coal and anthracite faster. If one looks at the figures for coal production in Addendum No. 21, one notes that the total coal production has steadily increased from approximately 48 million tons in 1965 to 62 million tons in 1973. However, if one looks at the succeeding scale which deals with coal and coke despatched from the provinces, one finds that there has been a decrease of the coal despatched from 29 million tons in 1964-&#x2019;65 to 26 million tons in 1973-&#x2019;74. There must be something wrong there. There must be some way of explaning this. Has road haulage taken up the differences? Is it because it is no longer being transported to power stations? Surely, if the production of coal has increased to such an extent, the Railways must commensurately move a larger tonnage of coal? Surely, if there is a fuel and energy crisis in this country and we are trying to cut down on the use of petroleum products, oil products, by using more coal, every effort should be made to increases the movement of coal and anthracite rather than admit to the fact that it is getting less, which is precisely what the figures in these schedules do.</p>

<p>It will be a very cold election then. The same thing once happened in Britain, too.</p>

<p>I will leave the question of coal and anthracite there. It is a very serious matter which we believe will receive the due attention of the hon. the Minister and of the General Manager of the Railways. I want to talk about another matter. Part of our amendment deals with certain categories of staff. I want to say that all the Railwaymen I have met have a very high regard for the General Manager of the Railways. I think he can be proud of the fact that he is a highly respected gentleman among his staff. There are some categories of Railwaymen in the lower grades however who suffer immensely, even when there are adequate increases. I shall never forget a little incident that happened some time ago while I was travelling by car. Mr. Schoeman, the predecessor of the present Minister, had just granted fairly substantial increases to the Railwaymen. I called in at a small café, having just heard of these increases over the radio. There were a number of Railwaymen in the café.</p>

<p>*I told them: &#x201C;Congratulations, you have now received a salary increase.&#x201D; Then they asked me: &#x201C;What were the tariff increases?&#x201D; Hon. members will remember that the tariffs were increased by the same percentage as the salaries. The men in the café then told me: &#x201C;What is the use of getting an increase like this, for within two months that increase will have been completely wiped out by the 20% tariff increase, because this is just going to push up our cost of living again.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>No, that is quite true. The Railwaymen told me so themselves.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, this is something which happens perpetually. It is a vicious circle. When salaries and wages are increased&#x2014; we often plead for this and I think we should&#x2014;we should be very careful about increasing tariffs to such an extent that they counterbalance completely the increase in the salaries and wages of the staff. This is an area where there should be closer planning not only in relation to the question of staff but in relation to the financial position throughout the country. Let me say that tariffs affect the farming community immensely. They are affecting the farming community to such an extent at the moment that if one lives at the coast&#x2014;where I do in the Eastern Province&#x2014;one cannot afford to buy lucerne from the northern provinces or from Oudtshoorn. The rail tariff is so high that it amounts to the same price that one pays for one&#x2019;s lucerne. One therefore has to pay double for it. There must be a way of moving this commodity at a lower price. Either this or we will have to <span class="col_2275-2276" refersTo="page_1153"/>revert to road transport with the resultant increase in fuel consumption. Tomorrow the hon. member for Newton Park will mention various other matters to indicate how the Railways can be used more efficiently and more economically in the agricultural sector.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the main theme of our story today is this: We must keep developing the Railways, we must keep moving them forward in the interests of our economy. The question of the Railways being the jugular vein of our economy is a very important one. I want to make a very sincere appeal to the hon. the Minister. I want to tell him that there are areas in this country where it is not possible to guarantee a railway line but where such a line is absolutely important in the interests of growth in a particular area in order to create jobs and to keep a damper on our population explosion. The Railways must assist in this. I do not say that the Railways should do this without a guarantee. I think that the hon. the Minister should approach the Cabinet for a guarantee, especially from his colleague there on his left. I have pleaded in this House with the former Minister of Transport for a line from Grahamstown through Peddie to King William&#x2019;s Town to assist in the development of the Ciskei. I have done this many times in the past. The answer I have always received from the Minister, however, is: Who will guarantee this line? I believe that the hon. the Minister should not ask the people of Grahamstown or the people of King William&#x2019;s Town to guarantee the line. He should ask the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development or the hon. the Minister of Finance or the hon. the Prime Minister to guarantee the line in the interests of development in South Africa. This area is lagging behind because there is no development there and yet there are many people there needing work. There is the possibility that such a line could become economic. I believe that there are probably many areas all over the country where this sort of thing could be done. I know that for many years there were pleas for the Sishen-Saldanha Bay line to be built and eventually it was built. However, it was not built by the S.A. Railways. It had to be built by Iscor. I believe that this is where overall planning comes in. It should not only be the hon. the Minister of Transport who is involved in this. It should involve the whole Cabinet and the Government. They should say to the hon. the Minister of Transport: We need a line through here. There is the hon. the Minister of Planning looking very interested in what I am saying. I think he agrees with me. I believe that this is a matter where a Cabinet should say: There has been an appeal for a line in a particular area. Let us look at the picture and find out whether it can be developed. Is it perhaps needed by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development for the development of homeland industries? Is it needed by the hon. the Minister of Planning for the development of a growth point or an industrial belt? This sort of thing should be planned from the point of view of the whole Government. That is how the overall planning should be done and not just from the point of view of whether the S.A. Railways are going to operate economically or not. That is the appeal from this side of the House. This is how the Railways can be a dynamic force in the development of Southern Africa. You cannot operate them in isolation. I can understand, from the managerial point of view, that one likes to run this thing as a business, but from the Governmental point of view&#x2014;and we must remember that the Railway Administration is a Government department&#x2014; there has to be an overall picture which takes into account every aspect, such as the development of new lines, new systems and new communications, of this great system which is the lifeblood of South Africa. Sir, I want to make this appeal very seriously, because I believe it is very, very important. Then I want to make a further appeal to the hon. the Minister. In the city of Grahamstown there is an industrial area. I do not know what went wrong with the planning there. I do not believe that the Railway Administration was consulted when the industrial area was declared, because there is no rail connection to the industrial area. There was once a spur line that went up to the military camp. It was constructed during the war. That spur line was subsequently removed, I believe, without thought to the future, because that spur line could have connected fairly easily with the Grahamstown industrial area as it is today. We sit at the moment with an industrial area set out in Grahamstown, with no rail connection whatsoever and no possibility at this stage of getting a rail connection. The city of Grahamstown cannot afford to provide that facility. I believe that there will have to be some assistance either <span class="col_2277-2278" refersTo="page_1154"/>at Cabinet level or from the S.A. Railways to provide a rail connection to that industrial area. The reaction of industrialists when they look at the area is to say, &#x201C;What is the good of it? I must have a siding.&#x201D; Of course, the unfortunate thing&#x2014;and I wonder whether I should say it very loudly &#x2014;is that in the overall planning we built the gaol where the industrial site should be and the industrial site where the gaol should be.</p>

<p>Sir, these are difficulties that arise in the overall planning and it emphasizes the need for far better overall planning in the overall picture of South Africa.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, whilst perhaps this matter does not fall under the Railways Department at this stage, although it did originally, we would like to hear what is going to happen about St. Croix. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us when he replies to the debate as to whether there are any new developments in connection with St. Croix; whether this is likely to start fairly soon; whether there are any possible delays &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I have not got the time to answer questions. We would like to know whether that scheme is likely to get off the ground during the coming year. I believe that it is important to our economy in the Eastern Cape to know these things. The hon. the Minister is looking very wise and I have an idea that he has something to tell us. It would be appreciated if, when he replies to this debate, he would tell us what the position is. The hon. member for Tygervallei can put his question now.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in my humble opinion the hon. member for Albany is probably one of the most honest members on that side of the House, and for that reason he is a very good barometer in respect of the criticism which is being levelled at this Budget. It was clear to us all that the hon. member for Albany moved away from the Budget as such. He had to make a speech in some way or another in order to make up time, and so he pecked here and he pecked there like a chicken. But because he is an honest member &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#acting_speaker">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">ACTING SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member may not imply that other members are not honest.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#aucamp">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. L. S. AUCAMP</person>:</from>

<p>Then I withdraw it, and I apologize to the other hon. members for the allegation I made against them. [Interjections.] The hon. member could not disguise the fact that there is really no criticism to level at this budget. He discussed the coal crisis, but I am convinced that the hon. member knows that he cannot lay the entire problem in regard to coal at the door of the Railways. After all, there are other sectors as well which deal with coal, and I want to predict here that when the Economic Affairs Vote is being discussed hon. members on that side, and possibly even the same hon. member, will lay all the blame for the coal crisis at the door of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>The hon. member also had complaints in regard to rates, but he and the hon. member for Maitland, who in my opinion made a very good speech, contradicted one another. The hon. member for Maitland said last year, and he repeated this in his speech this afternoon, that the Railways is not an institution that has to render a socioeconomic service. Do you agree with that?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#aucamp">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. L. S. AUCAMP</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says he agrees with that. The Railways is not in a position to render a socio-economic <span class="col_2279-2280" refersTo="page_1155"/>service. But the hon. member for Albany reproached the Minister because they have to pay so dearly for the conveyance of their lucerne. Surely that cannot be reconciled with what the hon. member for Maitland advocated. Indeed, the hon. member for Maitland requested that rates should gradually be increased each year and surely the rates on lucerne will <i>inter alia</i> then be increased as well. I want to suggest that the hon. member for Albany and the hon. member for Maitland should first settle this principle among themselves before laying accusations at the door of the hon. the Minister. Sir, it is interesting to take note of the discussions as they took place during this debate and during the debate last year. Last year the Opposition confined themselves strictly to the budget and its effect on the economy of the country as well as on the finances of the individual, and they were quite justified in doing so. They seized upon the increased rates to deal exclusively with the Budget and to discuss the implications of the Budget on the national economy. But what is interesting is that in the entire discussion this afternoon, since this debate began, not a single hon. member on that side ventured to discuss the implications of this Budget on the economy of South Africa. Every member who rose to speak moved away from the Budget itself and from the implications of the Budget as quickly as possible. But looking at the clock now, Sir, and after having listened to the contradictory speeches made here by members of the Opposition, I should prefer to move&#x2014;</p>
