<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Before I call upon an hon. member to address the Committee, I must point out that the principle contained in this clause was fully discussed at and agreed to at the Second Reading. In accordance with the practice of this House, I shall accordingly permit only one member of each Opposition party to state their party&#x2019;s objection to this clause and the Minister to reply. Further discussion will in accordance with Standing Order No. 57 be strictly confined to the details of the clause and amendments to such details.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment to this clause as printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 2, in line 13, after &#x201C;power,&#x201D; to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">except the power under section 21 to make laws,</block>

<p>During the Second Reading debate it came to my attention that as subsection (1) of the proposed section 22A reads at present, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister is satisfied that the chairman of the executive, the executive or the Council fails, for whatever reason, to exercise or perform, in terms of this Act, any power, function or duty conferred or imposed by this Act, the Minister may exercise or perform such power, function or duty, or authorize any other person to exercise or perform such power, function or duty &#x2026;</block>

<p>it has been too widely stated. I felt that the legislative power, which may be regarded as the most important power of such a Council, could possibly also fall under these provisions. It is because it was not the intention to restrict the legislative power of this Council that I am moving this amendment. It is true that the legislative power of this Council is limited to certain matters, but it is also true that the State President may confer further legislative power on the Council by proclamation. For example, as recently as two years ago the State President conferred on this Council the power to make legislation in regard to agriculture.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the amendments standing in my name on the Order Paper, namely&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) On page 2, in lines 8 to 10, to omit &#x201C;If the Minister is satisfied that the chairman of the executive, the executive or the Council fails&#x201D; and to substitute:</li>

</ol>

<p>Should the chairman of the executive, the executive or the Council fail</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) on page 2, to add the following subsection at the end of the proposed section 22A:</li>

<li>(3) Should any power, function or duty be exercised in terms of subsection (1), the Minister shall <span class="col_3525-3526" refersTo="page_0176"/>table in the House of Assembly within fourteen days thereof, or should the House of Assembly not then be in session, on the commencement of the next session, a report setting forth the power, function or duty which was not exercised, and who so failed, and what action was taken pursuant to subsection (1).</li>

</ol>

<p>I want at the outset to say that we are pleased to be able to support the amendment which has just been moved by the hon. the Minister, We do so after having expressed our very strong feelings in regard to the Bill as a whole. We feel, however, that in terms of the extensive powers the Minister has taken for himself in this Bill, this amendment is a definite improvement in that it at least excludes the exercising of legislative powers. In terms of the Bill as it now stands, the hon. the Minister retains complete powers in respect of the administration of the CRC. In terms of this amendment, however, he will at least be excluding from those powers the power to legislate.</p>

<p>It is clear that the Bill gives the hon. the Minister extensive discretion in deciding whether or not the chairman, the executive or the council has failed to carry out a function, a duty or a power in terms of the powers vested in that council I feel that it is very unfortunate that such extensive powers should vest in one person and that such a person should, firstly, have the power to exercise such an extensive discretion and, secondly, that he should be seen to exercise such an extensive discretion. Based on this, there will, of course, be extensive criticism of the reasons why the hon. the Minister found it necessary to exercise such a discretion. What we have here, then, is a programme of extensive powers granted to the Minister, made even more potent in the hands of that Minister by virtue of the fact that he has the discretion to decide when the council, its executive or its chairman has failed. We believe that that is most unfortunate. What is a &#x201C;failure&#x201D;&#x003F; What will constitute a failure on the part of the chairman, the executive or the council&#x003F; In what respect can a failure take place&#x003F; How will the Minister judge for himself that a failure has in fact taken place&#x003F; What action or actions on the part of the chairman, the executive or the council would constitute a failure&#x003F; Sir, there will be any number of different interpretations and attitudes as to what constitutes a failure. Will a change in the fiscal policy of the council in respect of the payment of salaries or pensions, even a minor change, if that does not meet with the approval of the Minister, constitute a failure on the part of the chairman, the executive or the council&#x003F; Will an appointment by the council that does not meet with the favour of the Minister be considered to be a failure&#x003F; If the council should appoint a person or personages of whose attitudes or policies the Nationalist Government does not approve, will the Minister then decide in his sole discretion that that constitutes a failure&#x003F; Will the promotion of an unpopular man in any part of the Service constitute a failure in the discretion of the Minister&#x003F; Will a controversial motion&#x2014;and many such motions may come before the council and may be adopted&#x2014;which is militantly critical of the Government be considered to be a &#x201C;failure&#x201D; and will the Minister in his discretion decide that because of that controversial motion, he has the right to intervene&#x003F; In fact. Sir, it can be said that if this council or its executive or its chairman in any of their statements at any time should go counter to the ideology or the requirements or the wishes of the Nationalist Government, this Bill in fact puts in the hands of the Minister of Coloured Relations the sole discretion to decide that that body has failed to carry out its powers or functions or duties. What will happen, Sir, in the case of a deadlock between the Minister and the chairman or the executive or the council&#x003F; We can conceive that many deadlocks could arise under the present system. The Government has already put the backs of the Coloureds up through his legislation, because the present legislation is an indication of the Government&#x2019;s intention and enables the Government to interfere with the actions of the council, and we can therefore expect that there will be many deadlocks between the council, the executive or its chairman and the Government. Will that be considered to be a &#x201C;failure&#x201D; in carrying out their duties&#x003F; All we need here is that the Minister must be satisfied that in some way or another the council or the executive or its chairman has not carried out its or his duties, functions and powers. This is an extremely wide set of powers to place in the hands of one man, a man who yesterday in this House expressed doubts about the ability of the Labour Party who are going to govern the CRC. What impression will it make amongst the Coloureds and amongst <span class="col_3527-3528" refersTo="page_0177"/>the other people in South Africa that here the Government is taking unto itself powers which will enable it, in the sole discretion of the Minister, to decide to take over the powers, duties and functions of a fully elected body of Coloured people, a representative body with a mandate from the Coloured voters, because the Minister of Coloured Relations does not like what they have done&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>In our amendment we say that should the chairman of the executive, the executive or the council fail&#x2014;not in the discretion of the Minister&#x2014;then you will have the situation that a test can be applied in an open court in South Africa, where both the Coloured Representative Council and the Minister can be represented and the court can exercise an independent and free judgment and test as to whether a failure took place or not. Sir, only under those circumstances can we have any confidence in such a measure&#x2014;if the matter can be subjected to a free and independent test in an open court of justice where both sides can be represented and where the judgment is then subjected to the scrutiny, the judgment and the test of public opinion. Sir, the next amendment is also very important indeed, and that is our request that the Minister, if such action is taken at any time, must report to this Parliament within 14 days if Parliament is in session and, if it is not in session, that as soon as the next session of Parliament takes place. We must accept that if the Government avails itself of these rights, it will create a situation which will cause concern and alarm and disappointment and disillusionment throughout South Africa and particularly amongst the Coloureds. This House, which has given the Minister these powers, has the right to ask the Minister to report on what action he has taken and to report, in respect of what duties, functions or powers a failure has taken place, in other words, whether he has acted in terms of a failure by the chairman, a failure by the executive or a failure by the council, and what action he has taken, and then we will have an opportunity to subject the actions of the Minister to an objective test. Our request in terms of the second amendment is that the Minister when he takes action of this nature, be asked to report to this House the nature of the action taken by him, in respect of what failure of a power, a function or a duty he acted and in respect of what person or what part of the council, the executive or the council, he took those actions. Here we are helping the Minister once again, because if that situation arises and if the Minister acted <i>bona fide</i> and in the interests of the Coloured people and if his actions were above board and free of any prejudice, then he will have this advantage that when this House publicly examines to the fullest possible extent the action that the Minister has taken, based on a full report with full data to be laid before this House, and this House then finds that the Minister&#x2019;s actions were justified, he will be in a strong position. I believe that if this House is given the power to judge the actions of the Minister on the basis of a full report submitted by him, then not only this House but also the Coloured people will have confidence in this measure.

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I too should like to move an amendment to clause 2 as it stands here. My amendment reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 2, in line 8, to omit &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;State President&#x201D;.</block>

<p>We all realize that when the word &#x201C;State President&#x201D; is used, it means the State President acting on the advice of the Executive Council, viz. the Cabinet as a whole, and we should like to see the responsibility to decide on the powers which the Minister will exercise here, being a decision by the Cabinet as a whole. Now, even were this amendment of mine to be accepted, I should nevertheless have to say that the powers contained in this clause are of such a scope and nature that we should not be able to accept them. I shall submit our reasons for this to you.</p>

<p>A number of reasons why this legislation, this clause, is necessary, have been advanced by this side of the House. The most important is, firstly, that it is the duty of the Government to ensure that there will not be a collapse of Coloured administration. The argument that the measure is necessary to prevent the progress of the Coloureds being checked, was advanced by the Deputy Minister. I want to contend that in spite of the fact that they attach great importance to them, these arguments do not really hold water. The hon. the Minister already possesses <span class="col_3529-3530" refersTo="page_0178"/>powers to ensure that the administration of Coloured Affairs will continue. According to the Budget for the new year and the amount that is being set aside&#x2014;we heard this yesterday and it is on our desks&#x2014;an amount of R153 million has already been set aside for the CRC and if they fail to utilize it, then the hon. the Minister is in a position to go ahead with that task himself. In the first place, therefore, the administration of Coloured Affairs can continue. There will be no interference with the welfare work, the pensions, the policy or as far as the rural areas of the Coloureds or the education of the Coloureds are concerned. Even the business of the CRC may be proceeded with because according to my information a quorum of only 20 is necessary to proceed with the business of this council. Then, too, I want to contend that even if circumstances were to arise in which the business of the CRC were to collapse entirely, the hon. the Minister would in any event be obliged, if not legally, then at least morally, to come to the Cabinet and to Parliament, too, and to report on the true state of affairs. We know that owing to its policy the Government is bound to the CRC and I do not believe that there is anyone on that side of the House who would want to see the CRC a complete failure. In the same way there are also some of us on this side of the House who would not like to see this Council becoming a complete failure. However, the CRC alone is no solution for the Coloureds and for the problem which the hon. the Minister faces, It is not a means whereby the Coloureds of South Africa can be afforded meaningful participation and a joint say. The powers given to the CRC will always be limited, at all times. The significance of this clause we are discussing now is purely political. The Government took fright at the political signs of frustration among the Coloureds. If, for example, the appeal that was made by a Tom Swartz and other members of the Executive had been listened to at an early stage, and if they had been heeded, the situation we are discussing now would never have arisen. I must say that the hon. the Minister acted immaturely as far as this measure is concerned. I believe that at this stage this measure is absolutely premature. It only aims to show the Coloureds that the hon. the Minister still holds the whip-hand. In the event of a deadlock he will have to negotiate, and I believe that by means of this specific clause he has weakened his case even before starting to negotiate with the Coloureds. It cannot enhance the status of the CRC in the eyes of the Coloureds. Everyone knows that the hon. the Minister desperately wants the Coloureds to accept the CRC as their own institution, but this step is not going to assist the Government in that regard. If the Coloureds are offered self-determination, this must at all times be accompanied by the following things, which I should like to enumerate. The first is that we, and the Government on that side in particular, should display confidence in the Coloureds, confidence that they are in fact capable of running their own affairs. In other words, the maximum responsibility and powers must be entrusted to them, as they have, in point of fact, repeatedly requested in the past. I believe that up to now, this point has not been taken sufficiently into account by that side of the House. Secondly, if a clear deadlock were to be reached between the hon. the Minister and the CRC, then participation and negotiation become essential and the iron fist of the hon. the Minister must be withheld. This clause is not an example of his being prepared to withhold his iron fist. Thirdly, the impression must not be created that the CRC is the final answer. Steps must be taken on evolutionary basis and we must not place a damper on that. This clause is an example of a damper, and it does not offer the Coloureds the necessary guidance in these circumstances.</p>

<p>Politically speaking, the Coloureds of South Africa have always displayed a political awareness. They are becoming ever more mature and this state of affairs will have to be encouraged. Fifthly, I believe that the Coloureds are asking for political recognition of their citizenship. These demands on their part will not diminish. In fact, in the years ahead, they will grow. The clause is no solution to the dilemma in which the Government finds itself, nor is it a solution to the Coloureds&#x2019; dilemma. We must not think that we shall cause the demands of the Coloureds to diminish by means of legislation of this kind. They will only grow, and consequently it becomes the task of the Government to guide these demands on the part of the Coloureds in such a way that clashes will be avoided.</p>

<p>However, what is happening as regards this legislation&#x003F; In this clause the Government is admitting that it is heading for conflict and that it is incapable of providing <span class="col_3531-3532" refersTo="page_0179"/>the correct guidance in these circumstances. It is my humble opinion that the most serious implication of the clause is that the Government is heading for a clash and that its approach thus far has failed. That is why we on this side of the House are unable in any circumstances to support clause 2 as it stands here.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we in these benches welcome the amendment by the hon. the Minister and in our opinion it is an improvement on clause 2, but even should the amendment be accepted, we find clause 2 unacceptable and we are unable to support it. If one were to speak in support of the amendment by the hon. the Minister, I find myself in something of a dilemma. It depends on the perspective in which one looks at this amendment by the hon. the Minister. Here I must rely on the hon. members on that side of the House who adopted conflicting standpoints in regard to clause 2 as such yesterday and dwelt on it at some length. I have here, for example, the warning of the hon. member for Johannesburg West who, in the course of his speech yesterday said: &#x201C;This measure, viz. clause 2, must also be understood in the context of the entire process of our policy in regard to the Coloureds.&#x201D; Later he also said:&#x201C;This text, or this Bill, must be read specifically in the context of the whole.&#x201D; At the moment I find this whole rather ambiguous. In this regard I want to refer to one or two points made by the hon. the Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Vereeniging. The hon. the Deputy Minister said that this was an innocuous piece of legislation. I concede that it may be an innocuous piece of legislation. Clause 2 could be entirely innocuous, but it depends on the perspective in which one sees it. For example, the hon. member for Vereeniging&#x2014;I want to quote him here so that it may be on record&#x2014;states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to challenge the hon. member for Rondebosch, the hon. member for Durban North and the hon. member for Durban Central to go and tell the civic councillors in their constituencies that city councils are inferior constitutional bodies even though they have limited powers, or that the city councillors are inferior because they are prepared to serve in such bodies.</block>

<p>Before one can assess this clause, and the amendment inroduced by the hon. the Minister, at their true worth, it seems to me important that I should now have clarity from the hon. member for Vereeniging on the question whether it is true that he places the CRC on the same constitutional level as a city council.</p>

<p>Order! Hon. members must not conduct a dialogue.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>To me this is an important point, because when one withdraws powers, as the Central Government may withdraw powers from a provincial authority, it means that the same electorate is involved. If one says &#x201C;No&#x201D;, it means that what we have here in a situation in which a controlling Government, as the hon. the Minister said, has jurisdiction over a body with limited power, without the members having access to that body, having any say in the controlling body. Looking at this from one point of view, it is in a certain sense, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, an innocuous piece of legislation, because what goes wrong at the lower level of authority may be rectified on the higher level of authority by people with the same access. But if it is seen from the other point of view, it means quite simply that that lower level of authority, the one with the limited powers, has no joint say in what is eventually decided here in regard to that lower level. That is why I must ask the hon. the Minister at this <span class="col_3533-3534" refersTo="page_0180"/>stage whether he, too, sees it in this light, viz. that this body is a transitional measure that will eventually lead to full autonomy for the Coloured population. Could the hon. the Minister perhaps give me an indication that he does in fact regard it in that light&#x003F; The question has been put repeatedly, but I am still to some extent uncertain in this regard. If it is true, then this is not such an innocuous piece of legislation, because then it means that this legislation has tremendous implications on the road to progress.</p>

<p>I concede that at this stage there is a fair amount of uncertainty in regard to this problem and consequently I think that one should look at the nature of the amendment which the hon. the Minister himself proposed. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment reads that he does not want to let this clause go through if it should mean that the legislative power of the CRC would be affected in any way. In his speech last night the hon. the Minister motivated the amendment as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In July last year there was a commotion in the CRC. Hon. members all know that we had a session after July but in November I was told that they considered that we should be able to control this matter even if these people did not compile a budget.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that some of us in the House who are lawyers&#x2014;here I do not include myself because I am not a lawyer&#x2014;know how long it takes to draft a piece of legislation, even if the legislation only has two clauses. A great deal of attention is given to it and one has to see it in various perspectives. Therefore, when a piece of legislation is submitted to Parliament, the legal draftsmen in particular are very sensitive in respect of their colleagues, that they should not be exposed to criticism. That is how the hon. the Minister motivates this. He then said: &#x201C;I can now tell hon. members that it took two months to draft that legislation.&#x201D; I accept that. The hon. the Minister states that we can believe it or not, as we like. I am prepared to believe it. However, I just want to put a question. Apparently the hon. the Minister went to the legal draftsmen and put his problem to them. He apparently asked them to draft a clause that would solve this problem for him because he did not want administrative suicide to be committed. If, then, it took two months to draft this clause, why is the amendment being introduced hastily now&#x003F; Surely it is clear that the CRC has legislative powers, however limited these may be. There are very clearly circumscribed executive limitations on the CRC and surely the hon. the Minister is well acquainted with the problems experienced by the CRC. In view of his one can form an idea of the nature of the legislation necessary should administrative difficulties arise. If this is, then, an innocuous piece of legislation, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, why is this amendment being inserted hastily&#x003F; After all, the nature of the legislation which the hon. the Minister was to introduce here was known two months before the time. Is it not perhaps possible that the hon. the Minister became somewhat concerned, not only owing to the reactions of this side of the House, but also owing to the general reaction against the wide scope of the proposed legislation, particularly clause 2&#x003F; Was it not felt that such an amendment should be inserted so that it could be clear that not all the powers would be taken away, even though the legislative powers which are now being returned, if this amendment is accepted, are rather limited. Surely, then, that is an indication that the severity of the legislation is being somewhat lessened. As far as I am concerned, this point is clear. If one is aware of the nature of the legislation that has been anticipated from as far back as last June, and if one has issued instructions to the legal draftsmen to insert a provision in the Act of 1964 to deal with any anomaly, then in my opinion it is obvious that in the course of the discussion of the legislation one does not hastily insert an amendment that has not been suggested by anyone apart from the hon. the Minister himself.

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Chairman, I should like to propose an amendment to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Bryanston, but before I come to that, I just want to put a question to the hon. the Minister in regard to his amendment. In his amendment he excludes the power to legislate. There can be no objection to such an insertion. However, as the Minister, he has, in any event, the power to make laws in regard to the Coloureds and any act passed by this Parliament overrules any act which may be passed by the Coloured Council. What significance, therefore, does the hon. the Minister attach to the concession he is making here, if it is in fact a concession&#x003F; I ask this because in this regard he is empowered to pass any act overruling the acts of the Coloured Council. Consequently he already has that power. Secondly, and this is really my question: Must any legislation introduced in the CRC have his permission&#x003F; Is it correct that legislation may not be introduced there without his permission&#x003F; Does that power still exist&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to resume my seat. I want to finish first, and I still want to move my amendment as well. The hon. the Minister may reply to it then. The amendment which we want to move to the amendment by the hon. member for Bryanston, means that we want to insert the words &#x201C;in what respect&#x201D; after &#x201C;&#x2026; and who so failed&#x201D;. All that this amounts to is that we also want the hon. the Minister to furnish. Parliament with reasons should he take steps.</p>

<p>Then I just want to add, and I need not stress it again, that we are opposed to this entire clause. Amendments are before the House and therefore we must, of course, consider the amendments and determine their value within the framework of the clause. We consider that it would be an improvement on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment if he were to accept that Parliament should be furnished with reasons. The hon. the Minister will concede that according to the clause it is left to his discretion to determine whether and when a dereliction of duty takes place. This places an enormous responsibility on the hon. the Minister, because he alone is going to decide whether a dereliction of duty is taking place or not. You will realize that if he were to apply this lightly, or without very cogent reasons, he could create an extremely serious degree of tension between the Government and the CRC. We are therefore of the opinion that the hon. the Minister owes it to Parliament and to the public to motivate his reasons clearly and inform Parliament of them when taking such a step. I think he will agree when I say that it would be in his own interest, too, to do so. I do not believe it is necessary to motivate this further because the amendment speaks for itself. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. the Minister should consider very seriously the amendment of the hon. member for Bryanston before he rejects <span class="col_3537-3538" refersTo="page_0182"/>it. What would the position be if the hon. the Minister decided in his sole discretion to take action in terms of the powers of this Bill&#x003F; The position would be that the bereaved people would feel that they had been deprived of their position as members of the CRC and that they would have no form of redress at all. The only redress they would have is to prove in a court of law <i>mala fides</i> on behalf of the Minister, Surely, there must be some form of arbitration in this matter to decide that there is a genuine feeling amongst the members of the CRC that they have fulfilled their functions properly or not. It is the hon. the Minister in his sole discretion who has decided that they have not fulfilled their functions properly. Surely, these people must have some form of redress. In the way this clause is worded at the present moment, they are prohibited from going to the courts because the only reason they can go to the courts is on the grounds of <i>mala fides.</i> This is virtually an impossible thing to prove and, furthermore, they will have to do it in their private capacity. They do not have the funds to do this kind of thing. If the hon. the Minister wants to avoid a confrontation, if he wants to be fair and just in the exercising of his discretion and if he has faith in himself that when he does take a decision, that decision will in fact be well-founded and can stand up in a court of law, then surely he should in justice to everyone concerned accept the amendment of the hon. member for Bryanston. If he refuses to accept that amendment and he wants the measure to remain as it is, he is in fact saying to the Coloured people: &#x201C;I have reasons why I do not want my personal motives and the motives of the Government for taking certain action to be disclosed. I do not even want you to have the right to go and prove your side of the story in a court of law. I want to deprive you of that and I want to keep all the power of discretion to myself.&#x201D; I think this is a slap in the face, if I can call it that, for the Coloured people. Indeed if I can refer back to the imperialism yesterday during the Second Reading debate, it is a sign of imperialism to say: &#x201C;What we say is law and you have no right of recourse against us.&#x201D; Therefore I want to say to the hon. the Minister that, if at this late stage he wants to redeem something of the Government&#x2019;s image amongst the Coloured people of South Africa, he should at least consider the amendment put forward by the hon. member for Bryanston. If he fails to do so, not only will he deprive the Coloured people of South Africa of the CRC for what it is worth, but he will also deprive them of the actual right to go to the courts to get redress for a wrong done them on behalf of the Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rondebosch has indicated that we in these benches find the clause unacceptable, even with the amendments that have been moved. Nevertheless the amendment moved by the hon. Minister does improve the clause to some extent. I believe that what is important, is for us to determine the reason for the hon. Minister having moved this amendment. So far the reason he has given has been that, after receipt of the draft of his Second Reading speech when the Bill was already prepared, he came to realize that this measure could include the taking away of legislative functions. I think the hon. the Minister should be more convincing and should take us into his confidence more than he has done to date on this clause. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if it was never his intention to take away legislative powers. If that was never his intention, was the hon. the Minister aware that legislative powers were included in the powers of the CRC&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he gave the facts. After having introduced this Bill and moving this amendment, he is now blaming the law advisers. He is saying he did not give them a brief; he did not say to them: &#x201C;I only want executive powers, I only want powers of appropriation&#x201D;. He is now saying that he was silent on whether they should include legislative powers or not. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that, if it never was his intention to have legislative powers in respect of the CRC, he had a duty to tell his law advisers what his intention was. He cannot, after having introduced a Bill, come to the House and say <span class="col_3539-3540" refersTo="page_0183"/>that he gave these gentlemen the facts and that it was up to them to draft the Bill. I believe that the reason why the hon. the Minister has moved this amendment is that the Government has suddenly taken fright. Instead of the Government showing confidence and showing that it knows how to handle the situation and how to draft the necessary legislation, suddenly under the impact of what it has done and the hurt it has done to the Coloured people, it has at this very late stage decided to redraft the legislation. Instead of the hon. the Minister saying he has changed his mind, he says he is aware that there were legislative powers involved and that it was never his intention to take such powers away from the Coloured people, but that he did not tell the law advisers this when he was drafting this piece of legislation. Can this really be&#x003F; I want to be fair to the hon. the Minister. Is this what happened&#x003F; Did the hon. the Minister just fail to tell them that&#x003F; Now, however, he says that the legislative power is a very important one and that he is, therefore, going to make a concession to exclude this from one of the areas of responsibility which he can take over. Although the Legislative powers do exist, they are extremely limited, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has pointed out. They operate under the general aegis of sections 21(2) and 23(2). Although the hon. the Minister indicated by his attitude that he was making a very significant exclusion from the powers which he may take over under certain circumstances, I think the hon. the Minister will be the first to admit that any piece of legislation passed by the CRC has to go to the State President in the form of a Bill in any case, and that the State President can say that he will not give his assent to it and he can then refer it back to the CRC. So in any case the powers which he is leaving with the council are limited to the extent that they will always have to have the approval of the State President acting on the advice of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Secondly, they may not introduce a Bill without the approval of the Minister. This means that the powers of legislation which the hon. the Minister is leaving with the council are very limited indeed. What do we have left in the form of powers&#x003F; Hon. members on this side of the House will deal with them in greater detail. We are left with executive powers, powers of appropriation and powers of an advisory kind, acting as a link between the Coloured people and the Government. It is against this background that I want to refer for a few minutes&#x2014;and I hope I can get some assurances from the hon. the Minister&#x2014;to the following provision in the proposed section 22A:</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister is satisfied that the man of the executive, the executive or the council fails, for whatever reason, to exercise or perform, in terms of this Act, any power, function or duty conferred or imposed by this Act, the Minister may exercise or perform such power, function or duty or authorize any other person to exercise or perform such power &#x2026;</block>

<p>I want to examine the meaning or possible meaning of &#x201C;any other person&#x201D; against the background of the functions to be performed by the various people who are mentioned in this Bill. First of all, it is not &#x201C;any other persons; it is &#x201C;any other person&#x201D;, in the singular. I think it is important to realize that that single person can replace either the council or its executive. One can have the situation of a single individual replacing the total council in its advisory capacity or its executive capacity, or one could have a single individual nominated by the Minister to take over the collective powers of the five persons on the executive. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he reads this clause in this way. Can he replace either the chairman or the executive or the council by one person&#x003F;</p>

<p>Secondly, in so far as the members of the council, the executive or the chairman are concerned, the parent Act provides in section 1 that no person other than a Coloured person shall be nominated or elected as a member of the council. I want to know from the hon. the Minister, to what extent that a person is going to exercise the powers normally exercised by either the council or the executive, and whereas the law says that that person shall be a Coloured person, whether he is prepared to give the undertaking that he will only nominate a Coloured person to do that work&#x003F; Will he give us the assurance that he will comply with the spirit of section 1 of the Act&#x003F; In other words, where he does replace either individuals or a group of functionaries with a single person, will he give us the assurance that that person will be a Coloured person&#x003F;</p>

<p>Thirdly, in sections 5 and 10 of the parent Act there are various disqualifications for voting and it states that nobody <span class="col_3541-3542" refersTo="page_0184"/>can hold office in the council or the executive unless he has all the qualifications to vote. I want to know whether the hon. the Minister will give us the assurance that the person he nominates in terms of this clause, will be a person who could ordinarily be elected to office in that council or to hold office as an executive member.</p>

<p>Section 11 of the Act requires that members of the council take an oath. It is a fairly general oath relating to their duties. Section 18 of the Act, however, provides for a much more specific and detailed oath in that it relates specifically to the duties of the members of the executive. This oath is specific in regard to the whole question of secrecy and confidence and in regard to the question of not divulging information. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under oath I do hereby swear to be a true and faithful adviser, not to divulge directly or indirectly any matters brought before the executive and entrusted to me to keep it secret.</block>

<p>Sir, where the hon. the Minister designates an individual to take over the functions of the executive, is this going to apply to that individual or not&#x003F; Is this going to be a Coloured man who would ordinarily be a registered voter and who is going to perform his duties under exactly the same oath as that taken by those people from whom he has taken over these duties&#x003F; Then, Sir, section 17 says that the members of the executive committee shall all be members of the council. If the executive committee fails to do its duty, although the council may do its duty, will the Minister see that it is replaced by other members of the council&#x003F; Or are we going to have the situation that if the executive committee fails to do its duty the Minister will appoint people who are not members of the council&#x003F; When it comes to appointing a replacement for the chairman, is the Minister going to go outside of the ranks of members of that council, either the governing party or the Opposition party, or is he going to apply what the law says, and that is that the chairman must be a member of that council&#x003F; Then I want to put this to him: Reference is made in the Act to an acting chairman of the executive committee. If the acting chairman of the executive committee fails to do his duty, can the Minister act under this Act&#x003F; As I read it, it is quite specific; it says: &#x201C;If the chairman of the executive, the executive or the council fails&#x201D;. At the moment there is no chairman of the executive; there is an acting chairman of the executive in terms of the Act. What happens if the acting chairman fails to do his duty&#x003F; There is no reference to dealing with the acting chairman in terms of this Act.</p>

<p>There is another area of conflict in this clause. The sole arbiter as to whether the chairman, the executive or the council has failed to do his or its duty or to perform certain functions is the Minister. The clause says &#x201C;if the Minister is satisfied&#x201D;. But let me put this question to the hon. the Minister: What happens if he is satisfied that the executive has failed to do its duty, but the executive is satisfied that it has done its duty&#x003F; What happens if the council is satisfied that it is giving the Minister advice but the Minister considers that it has failed to give him advice. What happens if there is this conflict of interpretation as who is failing to perform certain functions and duties or to exercise the powers entrusted to the council. Not all of these are mandatory; they are not all instructions. There are certain advisory functions which are left open to the council. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, our opposition to the provisions of the Bill was expressed clearly yesterday. We stated our conviction that a serious mistake was being made here in terms of the Government&#x2019;s own policy. In this regard, although we reject the entire principle of this measure, I just want to associate myself with the amendments proposed by the hon. members for Newton Park and Bezuidenhout. In this regard I want to comment in particular on the discussions of the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Bryanston. It is very clear that if such a decision has to be taken, someone will have to take that decision, and consequently it seems to me that it would not be useful to accept that amendment by the hon. member for Bryanston as printed. To come back to the argument by the hon. member for Randburg, I just want to say that we cannot wait until a court case has been decided before the execution of the functions of the Council are continued with, when in practice, on the basis of its own activities and conduct, the Council has become defunct. In other words, to me it seems abvious that there must be someone with the responsibility of proceeding with <span class="col_3543-3544" refersTo="page_0185"/>the functions of the Council. I want to repeat that while I reject the Bill in its entirety, it still seems to me a logical consequence of the actions of the Government in this regard, and therefore it seems to me that the hon. the Minister should give earnest consideration to and should accept the amendment by the hon. member for Newton Park, viz. that the decision whether any function should be taken over should be made by the State President-in-Council, which means on the advice of the full Cabinet. I say this for the simple reason that the importance of this legislation and of the actions which would give rise to the implementation of this measure are of such a serious nature that in my opinion it is essential that it should be seen that a decision to do this is a decision of the full Cabinet. I say that this must be seen to be the case, because it seems to me that there are three particular elements we should take into account in this regard. The one is that it affects the Coloureds and also the exercising of the functions of the Council, the majority of members of which were elected by the Coloureds in a democratic election, a Council which, according to legislation passed by this Parliament, possesses certain functions and powers. What is more, everything that was said here yesterday by the other side of the House emphasized the fact that this Council itself was regarded by the Government and members opposite as an extremely important body and that it was not the intention to place unnecessary restrictions on the exercising of the functions of the Council or on the existence of the Council. If that is in fact so, then it seems to me logical that we should let it be seen by those voters, the Coloureds who elected those people that the matter is, in fact, taken so seriously that it is the State President-in-Council, thus including the full Cabinet, that accepts the responsibility of taking a decision of this nature. In the second place it is very clear that in terms of the Government&#x2019;s policy itself, as we indicated yesterday, the Council constitutes a particularly important and substantial principle in the Government&#x2019;s Coloured policy, viz. it is the entire Government policy that is at stake here. It is not merely by coincidence that this is a function carried out by a Minister. There is a great deal of legislation under which a Minister has a specific function entrused to him by legislation. If a local management or other body does not carry out its functions, it is then said that the Minister may do so. This, however, is a matter of policy, a fundamental matter of policy, in which the Government&#x2019;s entire Coloured policy is at stake. To me, therefore, it seems obvious that a decision in this regard should be taken by the Government as a whole and not solely by the Minister. In the third place I want to add that the entire White population is also affected by the decision in this regard because it affects the entire question of the relationship between White and Coloured, and for this reason, too, this is a matter that should be dealt with by the whole Government. I therefore want to ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to add a few words to what the hon. member for Edenvale has said about the amendment whereby we ask the hon. the Minister to accept that the State President will be the motivating agent in deciding when a failure to act has occurred on the part of the executive of the CRC. Sir, this thing is viewed so seriously by the hon. the Prime Minister that relationships between this House and the CRC are conducted on a special basis by means of a special committee which has been appointed and which reports directly to the Prime Minister himself. This is based primarily on the concept that there are peoples involved. The Coloured people and the White people of South Africa are involved in the situation here which demands under certain circumstances a decision being taken to take over and to enforce activities which legitimately lie in the field of the CRC. My problem is that it is not necessary that there should be an overt action on the part of the hon. the Minister and the department. It may happen that a period of inaction goes by when actions are not taken although they are urgently called for and that this may seriously embarrass people&#x2014;like the salaries of teachers and that kind of thing&#x2014;and consequently force the hon. Minister into taking the sort of action which is contemplated in this legislation. We would be far happier if the Cabinet as a whole took such a decision. We have the principle of collective responsibility and any decision which is taken by the hon. the Minister is obviously one which it is encumbent upon the whole Cabinet to accept. The entire Cabinet must look at the situation, assess it and take a decision, which is going to be a very serious step indeed, one which the hon. the Minister himself hopes that he will never have to <span class="col_3545-3546" refersTo="page_0186"/>take. I think that we must understand and express the seriousness of the action which is contemplated in terms of this clause. We on this side of the House will be far happier to know that the full Cabinet has taken this matter into consideration and has taken the decision which is going to lead to this particular clause being implemented.</p>

<p>May I draw to your attention, while I am engaged in speaking on this clause, to a problem which has arisen which may require an amendment to the Standing Rules and Orders of this House. We have before us two amendments on this clause: Our amendment in which we ask that the State President should act and the amendment of the hon. member for Bryanston in which he asks that &#x201C;the Minister&#x201D; and certain other words should be deleted. We on this side of the House, as the official Opposition, would obviously vote for our amendment and as the hon. member for Edenvale has stated, we do not support the amendment of the hon. member for Bryanston. We find ourselves in the position that we do not support the hon. the Minister or the Government on this clause. There is at this stage no mechanism whereby a party may abstain from voting on a clause where it finds itself neither in support of the Government nor in support of an amendment which has been moved. The remedy would be for all of us to get up and walk out of the House, but this is a procedure which is adopted only in very serious cases indeed. I merely mention this. It is not an important or vital matter which should be debated or anything like that. I merely draw it to the attention of the Committee, because we will seek an opportunity to find a remedy to that particular situation. I want to again urge the hon. Minister to favourably consider the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Newton Park namely that the State President-in-Council&#x2014;in other words, on advice of the whole Cabinet&#x2014;should be the body of people who will take a collective decision when the provisions of this clause are implemented.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to direct the attention of the House to certain specific words in the clause which is before us. I refer to the words &#x201C;any power, function or duty&#x201D; which can be taken over by the hon. the Minister under certain circumstances if this Bill becomes law. I want to suggest not only that this is an undesirable clause, but also that it is one which is impossible to fulfill. It is impossible of fulfilment when one considers the exact powers, functions and duties of the council as they now exist. If it is impossible for the hon. the Minister to fulfill what he is asking for, then it suggests to me that it becomes redundant. Therefore I want to refer specifically to section 20 of the Coloured Persons Representative Act, Act No. 49 of 1964. In section 20 the general functions of the council are listed. We also have specific reference to the liaison with the Government. The section states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the council shall have power&#x2014;(a) on request to advise the Government in regard to all matters affecting the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured population in the Republic.</block>

<p>The very reason for the existence of the council is that in the mind of the Government there ought to be a representative and duly elected group of Coloured leaders who can advise the Government in relation to section 20(1)(a). For example, if it is the council&#x2019;s duty, and it has the power, the responsibility and the function to advise on economic matters, it is because the hon. the Minister and the Government feel that they need advice from the Coloured people themselves. When this goes by default what we have before us is not merely the hon. the Minister taking the place thereof, but the impossible situation of the advice not forthcoming from the council itself. The council must also advise the Government in respect of the social interests of the Coloured population. It is the Coloured people themselves who have been given the opportunity to express their needs to the Government in this field as well and once this falls down, it is impossible, I suggest, for the hon. the Minister to take the place of that council in this regard. One could also speak about the educational interests of these people, but let us rather go on to the political interests of the Coloured population. It is impossible for the hon. the Minister to advise himself and, through himself, the Government as to the political interests of the Coloured people when the Coloured people themselves are not given the opportunity to give that sort of advice. I suggest that it is inherently impossible for the hon. the Minister to carry out the duties, functions and the powers of this council. If that is so, it would be ludicrous, <span class="col_3547-3548" refersTo="page_0187"/>to say the least and to put it mildly, for this House to pass this particular clause.</p>

<p>One could then go on to section 20(1)(b) where it is provided that part of the council&#x2019;s function is to make recommendations to the Government in regard to all matters affecting the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured population. If the Coloured leadership themselves are not giving these recommendations, is it really seen to be possible for the hon. the Minister&#x2014;I speak now in terms of his post as Minister and not of him personally &#x2014;to make that kind of recommendation&#x003F; I suggest that it goes by default, because he cannot fulfil this function. It is inherently quite impossible for him to do so. It is further provided in this section that the council is required generally to serve as a link and as a means of contact and consultation between the Government and the said population. In each case where you read the word &#x201C;Government&#x201D; you of course read the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;, so that once again we have the hon. the Minister serving as a link and as a means of contact and consultation between himself and himself. It just does not make sense and therefore this is a bad Bill and a clause which we cannot support.</p>

<p>Section 20(3) provides that by the mediation of the Minister members of the executive shall have direct access to any Minister in connection with any matter affecting the Coloured population of the Republic. Once again this clause is an actual negation of the present law. No one can take the place of the Coloured leaders who shall have direct access to the Ministers concerned, because it is now the hon. the Minister who seeks access to his colleagues, which he has in any event. Therefore, it seems quite useless to have this kind of legislation before us. According to section 20(5)(a) the council may, with the approval of the Minister, granted after consultation with the Minister of Finance, acquire and dispose of property, appoint servants, etc. Of course, reasonable people will realize that if in an emergency situation there are certain administrative functions which should take place, it should be possible for them to be carried out. However, we have to go far beyond that because the functions, duties and powers of the CRC go well beyond certain administrative functions. Indeed, I would suggest to this hon. House that by far the most important aspect of its function, duty and power is to interpret the overall needs of the Coloured people in terms of their economic, social, educational and political interests, and it is such powers, duties and functions which the hon. the Minister simply cannot fulfil. If that is so, then I suggest that this clause before us is a contradiction in terms by its very nature.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have difficulty with two key words in this clause. The first is &#x201C;satisfied&#x201D; and the second is &#x201C;fails&#x201D;. The clause in question reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister is satisfied that the chairman of the executive, the executive or the council fails, for whatever reason &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here I am seriously seeking some information from the Minister. How is he in fact going to satisfy himself&#x003F; Is he going to do so in consultation with anybody and if so, whom is he going to consult&#x003F; What kind of criteria is he going to apply&#x003F; I am asking this because I do not think one can assume that there is necessarily going to be anything particularly clear-cut about the failure of the chairman of the executive, the executive or the council. This can happen, obviously; there can possibly be a clear-cut failure. However, I think one is going to have to take into consideration the contingency that the failure can take place in stages. What is going to be involved here. I feel, is the question of the Minister&#x2019;s timing. It seems to me that it is an awesome responsibility he is assuming. Is he going to do so on someone&#x2019;s advice, and if so, whose advice is he going to take&#x003F; This decision he will have to take is going to be an irrevocable one and it seems to me to be an awful responsibility for one individual to take. This could, of course, affect the whole future of relationships between the CRC and the Government and so, of course, relationships between the Government and the people, i.e. relationships between the White and Coloured people. It would therefore be preferable, I feel, for this responsibility to be shared, as has been suggested by the hon. member for Newton Park. Similar considerations apply, I feel, to the word &#x201C;fails&#x201D;. The clause reads:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the chairman of the executive, the executive or the council fails, for whatever reason &#x2026;</block>

<p>What happens in the case of the chairman&#x2019;s absence&#x003F; There is no provision here for a <span class="col_3549-3550" refersTo="page_0188"/>deputy chairman, though presumably there would be contingency arrangements. What degree of failure, however, is going to be the criterion&#x003F; I think this is a very serious point because this legislation is obviously aimed at a very extraordinary situation that may arise. Let us assume that there is not going to be any clear-cut break in the activities of the CRC. Let us assume that the CRC is going to decide to work to some kind of rule, in other words, that there is going to be some kind of go-slow strike situation. The CRC may decide to go so far and no further. At what stage would the chairman of the executive, the executive or the council itself be deemed to have failed&#x003F; One obviously hopes that this kind of situation will not crop up, but a state of bloodymindedness could of course arise if the contingencies envisaged in this legislation do come about. If the CRC decides to go a little slow, a situation of great subtlety can develop. They might decide to adopt some policy of attrition. It seems to me this is going to be a failure one is going to have great difficulty in judging. Consequently one wants to know precisely whom the Minister is going to consult, if anyone at all. I feel again that the Minister should widen the base of his decision in this case because this seems to me to be an awesome responsibility he has taken upon himself in two areas of such uncertainty as we have in these two cases.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED, REHOBOTH AND NAMA RELATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I have now listened to so many arguments that the danger exists that arguments may be advanced which I shall really be unable to take seriously. I have in mind in particular the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Pinelands. Does the hon. member not realize that we are faced with administrative problems that could arise, and that the question of consultation and all the other aspects are matters which will not necessarily come into the picture&#x003F; If it becomes essential, it is the duty of the Government, and that of the Minister in particular, to decide how he is going to do it. This is not something which is essential or which affects the people&#x2019;s lives to such an extent that their interests could be prejudiced during the period in which Parliament was not sitting. Parliament may decide on such matters if it is essential to do so. Since what we have here is a series of administrative actions of which we are all aware, I really cannot take the splitting of hairs in this regard seriously.</p>

<p>As far as the amendments that were introduced are concerned, there is, firstly, the amendment by the hon. member for Bryanston, who wants to omit the words &#x201C;If the Minister is satisfied that &#x2026;&#x201D; and substitute the word &#x201C;should&#x201D;. Inserting the word &#x201C;should&#x201D; in the clause would remove the Minister&#x2019;s discretion entirely and that is not the aim of this legislation. It is not the aim of this legislation to subject every item in respect of which problems arise to the drawn out procedure of a court inquiry where administrative action is necessary to facilitate matters. That is why I simply cannot accept recommendations of this kind. In many cases the Minister decides, and this is laid down by way of legislation. For example, where there is dereliction or a failure to carry out measures, the Minister may decide what has to be done. For example, there is a similar provision in the Transkeian constitution. Hon. members need not compare the bodies concerned now, because this still amounts to executive action. There is a similar provision in the Bantu (Urban Areas) Act and if any local management in the country should fail to carry out certain duties, steps of this kind may be taken in that regard, too. We are dealing here with a body which is still at a comparatively low level at this stage, as I said last night. The Minister must have this discretion, which is also exercised in many other instances by other Ministers. If the Minister regards a decision concerning a particular matter as a very serious or important one, he takes it to the Cabinet. Consequently I am unable to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>Nor can I accept the amendment which involves the State President in all decision-making of this kind. This is politically undesirable. In 90% of the cases which would crop up in terms of this clause, we should be dealing with administration and the State President is not concerned with administrative decisions. We could insert it there if we wanted to, but in any event it would give rise to a further delay because the Minister does, in any event, go to the Cabinet when a matter is serious. Do the hon. members now want me, as the Minister, to go to the Cabinet with every case in which, for example, the promotion of a teacher is involved&#x003F; Surely I cannot do that; it is out of the question. In that regard hon. members must leave the discretion <span class="col_3551-3552" refersTo="page_0189"/>to me. If it should become necessary to apply the measure, in the amendments there is &#x2026;</p>

<p>No. This is a matter which must be acted in accordance with the specific circumstances involved.

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You need reasons to decide on anything, whether one or two facts are involved. That implies the use of one&#x2019;s discretion.</p>

<p>*What the second part of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Bryanston really amounts to is that it is expected of me to report to Parliament in detail on administrative matters. That is quite unheard-of. Furthermore, in this specific instance it is impracticable as well. We are dealing not only with ordinary administrative matters, but also with a number of delegated powers. For example, we are dealing with approximately 23 000 teachers. Surely it is understood that if important decisions have to be taken in such instances, I shall in fact issue a statement if it appears to be necessary to do so. Surely it is understood that hon. members may ask me questions here. Do they expect of the present executive that they should report to the CRC in the fullest detail concerning the administrative functions they have carried out&#x003F; Nevertheless they expect me to report to this House every time. It is impossible to tabulate activities that are legion. I am now referring to matters such as the promotion and appointment of teachers, the appointment of administrative staff, the awarding of pensions etc. Hon. members now expect that because I took over those powers I have to submit details in all these instances.</p>

<p>Then, too, the idea was expressed that I should have to state what action I had taken and through whom&#x2014;I replied to that a moment ago&#x2014;and who omitted to do those things. I just want to say that where the Cabinet decides, it is the whole Cabinet that decides; if the CRC decides, the whole CRC decides; and if the executive decides, it is the executive as such that decides. I cannot say who omitted to take a certain step; there is no such, thing. We cannot indicate the specific persons individually. Surely the hon. member is aware of that aspect of State administration. Surely it is unnecessary for me to point that out. I do not know why the hon. member should introduce such an amendment before the House if he thinks that he is <i>au fait</i> with this aspect of the matter. I think that Coloured administration would become a political football for White politics in this Parliament if I were to have to table these matters every time. Sir, I have tried to reply to those arguments to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>Specific arguments were raised by the hon. member for Rondebosch, for example concerning the matter of legal draftsmen. I think that the hon. member listened with half an ear. Legislation as such is already limited by the House. It is also true that I cannot pass new legislation for the CRC. Up to now they have passed two laws; they have passed many motions, but up to now they have not really passed many laws. I cannot make laws for them in regard to social welfare, education, rural areas, or those aspects of local management entrusted to them. If they do not want to make laws, there is nothing I can do about it. This part of the original Act has not been altered and the aim of our amendment is to ensure that that aspect of the Act is not altered. We cannot change the Act in such a way that if they want to repeal or extend Acts, I have to do it. This is dealt with in a different section of the Act. Nor have we experienced problems necessitating our changing this at this stage. This can form part of our future discussions. They have limited legislative authority and it has never been my express aim to interfere with that limited legislative authority. What did happen&#x2014;and the hon. member for Sea Point can listen to this now&#x2014;was that as <span class="col_3553-3554" refersTo="page_0190"/>far as financial administration was concerned, I was under the impression throughout that this, too, was a legislative aspect of the CRC. However, it is not. It is now evident that the financial legislation we pass here every year does not have to be passed by them as well. That is why I said initially that the legislative power need not be deleted from the Bill in its entirety, because I took it that they too would have to pass an Act in this regard every year. I admit that I was unaware of that aspect. I said that I did not want to take over everything from these people, but that I only wanted to prevent them from committing administrative suicide. Before the start of the Second Reading debate, I was informed that this provision in the Bill could be lifted out in its entirety because finances as such do not fall within the legislative power of the CRC. I should just like to explain this aspect to the House, since that is the position.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point asked who I was going to nominate to carry out the functions which these people fail to carry out. I could nominate anyone. I could also nominate a White person. This is an administrative matter. I could also nominate the head of a department. This is not subject to section 20. I could nominate him to carry out the administrative aspects of the Act on behalf of the Minister. Such, a person need not necessarily be a voter for the CRC.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As far as the confidence clause is concerned, if one nominates any person to perform a function on one&#x2019;s behalf I do not actually see where the provisions of this clause come in. The Minister should at all times be able to require from a committee of this nature to inform him of their decisions, or whatever the case may be. A confidence clause is therefore from a practical point of view not involved as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>*I could even nominate a member of the CRC to act on behalf of the Minister. That is true. However that is impractical. After all, one has to nominate someone who knows the work and who can do the work. What the hon. member is really doing, therefore, is raising theoretical possibilities. As far as the acting chairman is concerned, we all know that one has to read &#x201C;acting chairman&#x201D; for &#x201C;chairman&#x201D; when the chairman is not there. If the hon. member wants to raise judicial arguments in this regard, he can take the matter further in court. As far as I am concerned, there is no difficulty as far as the acting chairman is concerned.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Randburg wants the court to decide where the personal problems of a teacher of the lowest order are concerned. He wants the court to decide on such a person&#x2019;s grievances. Those are the absurd extremes to which one can go with arguments of that nature.</p>

<p>*I do not think I have to reply to that any further. That, and nothing else, is what it amounts to. That is what he wants to draw me into. I do not mind replying to that. I am quite willing to accommodate hon. members if their own thought processes do not allow them to, or render them incapable of, realizing what is going on here.</p>

<p>I do not think that there is much left. The hon. member for Parktown asked what criteria would be employed in determining &#x201C;satisfaction&#x201D;. Good heavens, Sir! Once again this is a case of splitting hairs. After all, we are living in a world in which, people act and in which people take decisions, and when people use certain criteria, then there may be very minor differences. All one has to decide here is whether a man has done a thing he had to do or not, and whether he is doing it so slowly that one has the right to dismiss him. Let me give this example: If one employs a man and he refuses to do what one tells him to, then one may dismiss him. But say for example he does in fact do the work, but does it at a snail&#x2019;s pace; one tells him then that he will have to work faster, that he has to complete the work within a certain time, and he does not complete it within that time; undoubtedly one is then justified in dismissing him. He has, in fact, done the work, but he has taken his time doing it. To expect of me that I should define &#x201C;satisfaction&#x201D; in the fullest detail is, to say the least of it, a ridiculous demand. Hon. members also referred here to the Afrikaans term &#x201C;in gebreke bly&#x201D; (English: &#x201C;fails&#x201D;). The term used in all the other Acts was &#x201C;versuim&#x201D; which is actually the same as &#x201C;in gebreke bly&#x201D;. &#x201C;In gebreke bly&#x201D; is merely a new legal term which the Legal Advisers have been using recently. It is the best legal term to indicate that a person has not succeeded in carrying out a given task. It is not being said here that the task must be <span class="col_3555-3556" refersTo="page_0191"/>carried out to my satisfaction; all that is said here is that I may act if he fails (&#x201C;in gebreke bly&#x201D;) to carry it out. This is a term which is much, easier to understand, and all its means is that the person has not performed a task which it was his duty to perform. If he does not perform that task, then I may act with, discretion. Sir, the hon. member for Sea Point said: &#x201C;This is a bit of useless legislation.&#x201D; If this legislation, comprising only two clauses, is so useless, why are hon. members opposite taking two days to fight it&#x003F; If it is so useless, then surely it will collapse and then it would not be necessary to fight it here for two days. Why, then, do those hon. members not leave us to stew in our own juice&#x003F; Sir, this legislation is not useless. It will prevent administrative suicide being committed by this Council. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry to have deviated slightly here.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not feel that there is any justification for accepting any of these amendments. I feel that I ought to be able to exercise my discretion to make the necessary administrative arrangements where necessary. The responsibility to justify my dealings with the Coloureds will rest on me; to satisfy them that my actions are in their interests, and hon. members will continue to have the right to call me to account in this Parliament from year to year, whether in the debate on my Vote or in general debate, if they consider that the discretion I have to exercise in terms of this Act and the discretion which others have to exercise is being exercised in an incompetent way. Sir, I have already moved my own amendment, as printed, and have explained it briefly. It is not a question of preparing legislation for two months. The legal draftsmen do not have only one Act to prepare; they have a great deal of legislation to prepare. I did not hurry them on, and I did not do so for the important reason that there was no reason to have this legislation on the Statute Book before the election. If one had introduced this legislation in the middle of the Coloured election, it would have been unfair towards many of these candidates. Sir, I think I have said enough to explain why I am unable to accept any of these amendments.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister in his reply spoke of the Government&#x2019;s sincerity and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will allow us now to test the Government&#x2019;s sincerity in this very clause. There are two very simple tests I would like to put to the hon. the Minister. The first is: Postpone this debate and consult with the Coloured leaders and come back to us and let us discuss this matter later in the session. The second test I want to put to the hon. the Minister is this: If you find the first test unacceptable, then what you should do is to give us an undertaking now that whatever happens when you come back to us in the Third Reading you will not come back until you have consulted with the Coloured people. The hon. the Minister said that he could not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Newton Park in relation to the State President being incorporated in the Act. The hon. the Minister also felt that it would not be constitutionally proper. I would like to say to the hon. the Minister with all respect that it is obvious to me that he has not looked carefully at the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, No. 49 of 1964. If he looks at that Act carefully, he will see that there is a precedent for the State President being incorporated. In fact, if the hon. the Minister looks at section 17 of the Act, he will see that the State President has the power <span class="col_3557-3558" refersTo="page_0192"/>to appoint the chairman of the executive and he has the power to dismiss the chairman of the executive. In addition to that, if you look at section 19 of the same Act, the State President can also determine the salaries of members of the executive of the CRC, and of the members of the CRC itself. Sir, if he looks at those factors, then obviously the Minister must realize that he has no argument at all on which to reject the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Newton Park. I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that we made it clear right at the outset that we opposed this clause. However, the hon. member for Newton Park has also made it abundantly clear that we prefer the responsibility in terms of this Act to be a collective responsibility of the State President-in-Council and not the single responsibility that will be placed on one single Minister. The amendment moved by the hon. member for Newton Park is, in our opinion, the lesser of the two evils as it creates more authority and it provides for more responsibility for decisions than that of a single Minister. We made it clear that we consider this to be the lesser of the two evils.</p>

<p>The second amendmest introduced by the hon. member for Bryanston, as amended by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, is acceptable. This makes the Minister responsible and accountable to Parliament. The hon. the Minister should have no problem in accepting this amendment, as it will at least show some good faith. It will act as a possible brake on the powers of the hon. the Minister and a brake against his interfering with the powers of the CRC and of the executive committee. I must say that even this amendment is not exactly what one would want, because obviously, even if the hon. the Minister reports to Parliament, it means that we can only discuss his actions in retrospect, but even though it is not as desirable as one would like it to be, we believe that in this case it is the only solution to the insoluble problem we are faced with. It just goes to show that when you introduce thoroughly rotten legislation &#x2026;</p>

I would like to hear from the hon. the Minister if that is the extent to which he will exercise his powers in terms of this Act.

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the replies he furnished to the representations made by this side of the House, the hon. the Minister displayed unnecessary suspicion concerning the motivation of this side of the House. He is unnecessarily suspicious about the motivation of this side of the House as regards the amendments we introduced. We want to assure the hon. the Minister that we introduced those amendments with the sincere intention of effecting some slight improvement to extremely poor legislation. I want to venture the statement that the hon. the Minister summarily refused to accept those amendments and that he did not really go into the merits of the matter. I just want to mention a few points in this regard. The first point, which is very important&#x2014;I should also just like to reply to a misunderstanding with regard to the hon. member for Edenvale&#x2014;is that we believe it is unjust both towards the Coloured community and towards the hon. the Minister himself, that he alone should have to exercise a discretion in regard to these wide powers given to him. It must be accepted that the Government surely cannot intend to apply this legislation even in respect of the most unimportant administrative aspects which may arise. The impression I received from speakers on the other side of the House was that this was emergency legislation which the Government is placing on the Statute Book in a situation of emergency in order to intervene during a situation of emergency, for example if there should be large-scale failure on the part of the chairman, the executive or the CRC itself and that the Government would only use these wide powers&#x2014;I could go so far as to call them excessive, extraordinary powers&#x2014;in the event of large-scale failure on the part of that Council or its officials to carry out their duty. We understand that the motivation behind the legislation is the possibility that the entire CRC could collapse owing to the attitude of certain elected politicians. If that is the case, each minor instance of rebellion is surely not going to be taken to court, although, of course, there is nothing wrong with a teacher at the lowest level, who feels that he has been wronged, having the fundamental right to resort to the courts of the country. In those instances where the Minister intervenes in terms of these wide powers, whether it is in respect of the Council itself, the chairman or the executive, it would inspire confidence among us on this side of the House, and among the Coloureds themselves, too, and would also afford the Minister justification to act, if this were subjected to an objective test in open court where both sides are afforded the opportunity to state their case. The ruling of that court could then be the ruling on which the Government could react. I should like to tell the hon. member for Edenvale, who apparently misunderstood the meaning of our amendment and argument, that we are not asking that it should be necessary to wait for a court verdict before the Minister acts. All we are asking is that the action of the Minister must or may be subjected to an objective test in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>I can understand the hon. member not understanding the amendment. I think that the hon. the Minister will in fact understand it. I just want to add that we accept with pleasure the further amendment to our amendment which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout moved, because we feel that it brings about an improvement. I think that the motivation of the Official Opposition for the amendment moved by the hon. member for Newton Park is to inspire further confidence among the Coloureds in regard to the action taken by the Minister, should steps have to be taken. This is not for nothing. There is a specific motivation for it. These are far-reaching powers; they are extraordinary powers and if these powers are exercised, there could be general dissatisfaction when the Minister has to intervene at one stage or another. There is going to be disillusionment with the system, the Minister and his department. Because that will be the case, these powers will have to be given the highest possible status in terms of the amendment moved <span class="col_3561-3562" refersTo="page_0194"/>by the official Opposition. In other words, the decision must be taken by the highest possible body in the country and it must be given the status of a decision by the State President himself.</p>

<p>One of the points made by the hon. the Minister caused me some concern. He stated that these powers were to be used even for unimportant appointments, even for the appointment of a teacher at the lowest level, the remuneration of a teacher at the lowest level, promotion and the payment of a pension to a person. This is unthinkable and I cannot conceive what the Minister or the Government&#x2019;s motivation could be. They are requesting powers which they intend to use, not for a crisis, not in the case of the general collapse of their system and policy, but solely in respect of a minor administrative aspect. This is evident from an admission which the hon. the Minister has just made, viz. that the Government is itself quite prepared to intervene in regard to such an unimportant aspect, something that could easily be carried out administratively by the existing order. If I am correct in my analysis of this admission by the Minister, this legislation and the motivation behind it is more suspect than ever before. If that is so then the legislation is not as innocuous as members on the other side of the House want to imply. The legislation is not so innocuous if it is really the aim of the Government to utilize it to intervene in the interests and administration of Coloured affairs in regard to such an unimportant aspect of administration.</p>

<p>Then it is a pity the hon. member did not understand.</p>

<p>*I must apologize to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout for not having replied to his question. I thought he had concluded that I replied indirectly when I indicated that the legislation would remain the same as before. The people will still have the same limited powers of legislation. Perhaps he did not infer that from what I said, and therefore I concede to him that the position as outlined in section 21 remains unchanged. Legislation which the CRC wishes to pass still has to come to me for approval. The council is therefore limited in its legislative powers, but I mentioned yesterday that all these matters will be extended in the future. But this is the position in which we find ourselves at the moment and we can do nothing about it. However, I am not removing those rights. Secondly he asked that we should insert the words &#x201C;Coloured person&#x201D;. I regret that I am unable to do so. I have to keep that discretion. If a situation such as this were to continue for a long time and there were to be a Coloured person outside the council, a Coloured person in a senior administrative post whose training qualifies him for this, it would perhaps not be difficult to do so. But if I were to take someone from the council, surely it <span class="col_3563-3564" refersTo="page_0195"/>would mean that I would be interfereing again, because the council would already have taken a decision. If it has been decided that the people should not do their work, should I go and poke my nose into the council&#x2019;s affairs&#x003F; To restrict the Minister by inserting the words &#x201C;Coloured person&#x201D; here&#x2014;and I am not saying that a Coloured person cannot be appointed, because he can be appointed&#x2014;is asking too much, because this in itself limits the possibility that I shall be able to succeed in avoiding administrative chaos.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with reference to what the hon. the Minister said, there is a specific question which I want to ask him. The hon. the Minister said that the Government, or the Minister, was not in a position to remove people one by one from their posts in the CRC. Section 17 of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act provides that the State President may appoint and dismiss the chairman. If we look at the new section 22A, which is being inserted by clause 2, we see that if the Minister is satisfied that the chairman of the executive fails to carry out his duties, he, i.e. the Minister, may take over the functions of the whole council. What I want to know from the hon. the Minister is whether we are not dealing with a contradiction here. On the one hand, the existing legislation already makes provision for the chairman to be dismissed in any case if he&#x2014;so we accept &#x2014;fails to carry out his duty. But this Bill, too, specifically includes the chairman of the executive. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he can provide clarity in this connection. We could end up in the practical situation that when the State President is of the opinion&#x2014;on the advice of the hon. the Minister, of course &#x2014;that the chairman is no longer competent to carry out his functions, or that he has failed to do so, he may dismiss that person and appoint another person to the post. It would create confusion if the hon. the Minister were to make use of this new section rather than section 17 of the Act. I therefore ask the hon. the Minister whether we should not perhaps omit the word &#x201C;chairman&#x201D; from this provision, because such a situation is covered in any case by section 17, in terms of which the State President may appoint a new chairman so that the CRC may continue to function. I should appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could explain to us, when the opportunity presents itself, whether there is not a contradiction in these two provisions. I should also be pleased if he could tell us in what circumstances the chairman may be dismissed without the functions of the council having to be taken over by the Minister.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED, REHOBOTH AND NAMA RELATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to answer this question. I do not intend to prolong the debate, and therefore I am not going to react to arguments which I have already dealt with. However, I do regard this question as a fair one, and for that reason I want to reply to it. We are dealing here with a question of degree. Sometimes the State President, too, takes action pursuant to the recommendation of a single Minister. I want to mention an example. When I admit patients to or discharge them from State institutions, a single Minister&#x2019;s signature is sufficient. Such a matter need therefore not be taken to the Cabinet. But when a matter is important, the term &#x201C;State President-in-council&#x201D; means not only the Minister, but the Cabinet as a whole. However, it is in the discretion of the Minister. Cabinet government presupposes co-ordination, and a Minister must therefore consult his colleagues in determining policy and in matters of importance. The hon. member was actually concerned with the problem of the dismissal of a chairman. I think that when a chairman is dismissed, it is an important matter. It would be very peculiar, to my mind, if such a matter were not raised at Cabinet level. In terms of the Act the Minister does in any case have the discretion to do so. Hon. members must understand that the chairman may be dismissed in terms of section 17. However, that is not related to his failure to carry out his administrative functions in terms of the Act. A chairman may be dismissed for many other reasons. I do not want to go into those reasons. Hon. members know, after all, that there are even certain conditions to being a voter. For example, a person cannot be a voter if he is insolvent, if he is out of his mind, if he is mentally ill, etc. In the same way there are also different reasons which are contained in section 17, but they are not relevant here.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I listened very attentively to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to the amendment <span class="col_3565-3566" refersTo="page_0196"/>moved by the hon. member for Newton Park. I must honestly say that one gains the impression that the members on the opposite side are unyielding to the point of ever refusing to accept amendments moved with honest intentions. We proposed that the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;, where it appears in line 8, it should be substituted by &#x201C;State President&#x201D;. This does not apply to the rest of the clause. In other words, it only has a bearing on the taking of the decision whether certain functions should be taken over by the Minister. We ask that that decision be taken by the Cabinet and not by the Minister alone. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s answer to this was that he did not want to involve the Cabinet in every little function to be exercised by him in terms of the Act. However, that is not what we are asking for. Our amendment merely asks that the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D;, where it appears in line 8, be substituted by &#x201C;State President&#x201D;. In other words, the fundamental decision whether the Minister should exercise certain powers in the place of the executive, the chairman or the CRC. is a decision which in our opinion should be taken to the Cabinet. Perhaps the hon. the Minister has not had time to consider this amendment. Surely the amendment does not imply that the Minister must obtain the approval of the Cabinet for every step he takes. We ask only that the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; in line 8 be substituted by &#x201C;State President&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I have the same problem with the second amendment as moved originally by the hon. member for Bryanston and amended by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. As I see it, the Minister is not being asked in this amendment to report to Parliament on every little detail of the action taken by him. It is only asked in the amendment that the Minister table a report in the House of Assembly &#x201C;setting forth the power, function or duty which was not exercised &#x2026;&#x201D;. After all, it cannot logically be expected that the Minister should in terms of this amendment tell the House of Assembly that the executive refused, for example, to promote Mr. A to the post of principal of a school. What the executive will have refused to do in such a case is to carry out its functions in respect of education. We expect of the Minister that he will report this to us and not the cases of the individuals affected by the action taken by the executive. This is how I interpret the proposed amendment. The amendment has therefore been phrased in the negative. It says: &#x201C;&#x2026; the power, function or duty which was not exercised&#x201D;. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout moved that &#x201C;and in what respect&#x201D; be inserted after &#x201C;who so failed&#x201D;. Once again it does not affect the minor details to which the hon. the Minister referred. What is more, the words &#x201C;and what action&#x201D; do not, to my mind, include the details which the hon. the Minister advanced as an argument as to why he does not find this amendment acceptable. It does seem to me, though, as if the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and perhaps this is our fault because we did not place it on the Order Paper&#x2014;has not had time to really give proper consideration to these amendments.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to ask a question in connection with the interpretation of the law. The hon. the Deputy Minister pointed out yesterday that there were measures which would fall by the wayside if provision were not made for enabling the Minister to take over certain powers in the event of the chairman and the executive not wanting to function. I should like to refer to one particular aspect. He referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the powers of local government in respect of which delegated powers had been transferred to the executive of the CRC and which relate to the ordinances of the various provinces. My question is purely a question in connection with the interpretation of the law. The proposed section 22A refers only to Dowers, functions or duties conferred or imposed by this Act. If there are other measures, such as an ordinance of a provincial administration, which are not covered by this, the hon. the Minister will have to go back to his law advisers &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, section 17 is the comprehensive section which makes provision for action under this Act. In this Act provision is also made for the Administrator&#x2019;s power to make ordinances so that he may delegatec ertain powers in precisely the same way as the Minister may delegate them under the Group Areas Act. The Administrator may delegate these powers as part of his provincial powers, and everything falls under this Act. That is why one finds a form of double delegation here. However, all of this is still under the umbrella of this Act.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during the Second Reading debate yesterday, the hon. the Minister indicated that he would be more explicit during the Committee Stage about some of the issues raised on this side of the House. Under clause 1 I merely want to draw his attention to the inclusion in the definition of a &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x201D; of the words &#x201C;or a counting by means of gravitation&#x201D;. I believe it is important that the trade, who is rightly concerned, and also the users should know specifically what is intended by the inclusion of these words. The fact that they are now included must have had some cause. I only asked the hon. the Minister to indicate graphically whether it is a meat scale, a rule scale or a yard scale or a burcher&#x2019;s scale so that we can have it on record in Hansard and both the user and the trade can be quite certain what the meaning of the inclusion of these words is.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot give a definition, and therefore it is better for me to explain exactly what is meant by the insertion of this particular measuring instrument. Unfortunately I shall have to give a lengthy explanation to make the matter clear. All that is happening in this clause is that the words &#x201C;or a counting by means of gravitation&#x201D; are being inserted. This amendment is necessary because the existing definition of &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x201D; can be interpreted in such a way that counting measuring instruments which bring about a counting by means of gravitation can be excluded from the application of the Act. Regulations in terms of the Weights and Measures Act of 1958 have existed for many years in regard to the composition and certification of the measuring instruments concerned. I shall name them presently. As it is undesirable for these instruments to be used in the trade without being subject to certification, it was never the intention that instruments of this kind should be excluded from certification. I want to emphasize this point. The reason why these words are being inserted into the definition of &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x201D; is to ensure that these specific instruments will also be subject to certification. The insertion that is now being made in the clause will ensure that any doubt that may exist is removed. According to the regulations in terms of Act No. 13 of 1958, the old Weights and Measures Act, the expression &#x201C;counting scale&#x201D; means an instrument which, on account of its design, indicates by means of a weighing process when a number of articles of an equal weight, placed on a loading platform or in a bowl, are equal to a predetermined multiple of one or more identical articles which are placed on the scale in proportion.</p>

<p>Last night the hon. the Minister did not have a chance to reply to the question we put in connection with clause 3(g) where the words &#x201C;any person&#x201D; are being omitted and the words &#x201C;the purchaser of such goods&#x201D; are being substituted. I can quite understand why the words &#x201C;any person&#x201D; are being changed to &#x201C;the purchaser of such goods&#x201D;. Referring to the purchaser, however, one assumes that the purchasing has already been done. Is it not possible for the Minister to draw a line to include a category of people who in good faith are intending to make a purchase&#x003F; Under those circumstances presumably they would want to have the goods weighed before they made the purchase rather than after. I say this because if there is possibly anything wrong which could result in an appeal either to the courts or to the department, this could prove to be a considerable difficulty. If attention could be given to this matter in advance, one could perhaps avoid the difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if the hon. member would refer to the particular provision, he would find that at the moment any person can require the certificate of certification to be produced; in other words, a person can call for the instrument to be produced so that he can see that it has been certified. In clause 3(g) it is proposed to substitute &#x201C;the purchaser of such goods&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;any person&#x201D;. What the hon. member wants to know is why we do not refer also to the prospective purchaser. How does one prove that someone is a prospective purchaser&#x003F; I should like to repeat that the provision of this particular clause is to ensure that this particular instrument has been certified. It would be very difficult to prove that a person is a prospective purchaser while it is easily proved that a person is a purchaser because the action of purchase has been completed. It is then an easy matter for the purchaser to satisfy himself that the instrument has been certified. The hon. member will understand that it is most difficult to differentiate between the person and a prospective purchaser.</p>

<p>Clause 9:</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause seeks to amend section 30(2) of the principal Act and deals with a very important aspect of modern merchandising, namely the concept of prepacking. A large institution can pack goods in a warehouse and then distribute the goods to many outlets. One can take a major organization such as O.K. Bazaars or Pick-&#x2019;n-Pay which will pack such articles as tea, bacon, cold meats, etc., in their warehouses and distribute those goods to their many outlets. I understand that clause 6 alleviates the position of the actual retail distributor. Previously, it would appear, any person at any stage could demand that on those particular premises the goods should be weighed in front of him on a scale which correlates with the scale where the original packing took place. Is it correct that the intention of this is to indicate that only a purchaser may make this demand and that he may only demand that the goods should be weighed, not necessarily on a scale on the premises, but on the original scale&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I just want to explain again what the provision in the existing Act means. It should then be easier to understand the meaning of this clause. The provision of section 30 of the existing Weights and Measures Act is confined to weighing instruments. The wide definition of. &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x2019; in the provisions of the Act will however mean that dealers, in order to comply with the provisions of section 13(4) of the principal Act, should also have available, apart from weighing instruments, other instruments for example instruments for measuring length, surface area and volume in terms of those provisions. Experience has shown that purchasers seldom, if ever, make use of the said kinds of measuring instruments to ascertain whether the contents or length is correct. Furthermore, section 20(2) of the principal Act requires anybody who sells any prepacked goods in the retail trade&#x2014;this is what the hon. member has referred to&#x2014;to keep available certified measuring instruments for the use of any person dealing with him. In other words, it relates to the person with whom he does business&#x2014;in other words, the purchaser. That is my reply to the first question. Because such goods are often packed at a place other than the one where it is sold&#x2014;a dealer is compelled under these circumstances to keep a set of measuring instruments at the packing area as well as the place of sale. What we are providing for here is that it will be sufficient if these are kept at the place of sale, because the purchaser will then be able to satisfy himself at that point that everything is in order. In summary, the proposed amendment will therefore mean that the burden on the dealers, namely to keep measuring instruments at two places, would be alleviated, but at the same time the purchaser of the prepacked goods who wants to measure the quantity he has bought from such dealer, would not be <span class="col_3575-3576" refersTo="page_0201"/>caused any inconvenience because the dealer would have to make available a measuring instrument to such purchaser.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from> 

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Local authorities have for almost a decade now been complaining, through the United Municipal Executive, that they do not have the financial means to provide community facilities such as halls, swimming baths, recreational facilities, etc., particularly in the new, rapidly developing Coloured and Indian areas. It has been argued by quite a number of Government bodies that this problem does not fall within the scope of their activities, with the result that the provision of these very important facilities in the life of a community has constantly remained in abeyance, except in so far as local authorities have, with their own means, been able to accomplish this to a limited and unsatisfactory extent.</p>

<p>On the first occasion on which this matter was brought to my attention, I considered it necessary to appoint a commission of inquiry to institute a thorough investigation into the problem and possible solutions to it, and to advise me in this regard. The committee functioned under the guidance of my Department of Community Development, and included the four directors of local government, the president of the United Municipal Executive and other very senior officers of the Department of Indian Affairs, the Administration of Coloured Affairs and the Department of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations. The unanimous recommendations of the committee, which also heard evidence from members of the CRC and National Indian Council, were, as I announced in this House on 9 October 1974, accepted by the Government. With that the responsibility of lending a helping hand to local authorities in the provision of community facilities, particularly in the rapidly developing and newly established Coloured and Indian townships, has been entrusted to me and to my Department of Community Development. This measure creates the legal machinery enabling us to do this, and since my announcement of 9 October 1974 met with such enthusiasm and approval from all, and sundry, I have every confidence that this measure ought to meet with the same reception, for everything contained therein as far as community facilities are concerned is in keeping with my announcement and with the unanimous recommendations of the committee to which I referred.</p>

<p>The financing aspects of this legislation are the most important, and consequently I shall deal with them first. As I have already said, the areas that have to do without these facilities, are those townships in which the lesser privileged people are establishing themselves in great numbers. Many of these inhabitants are hardly able to make ends meet, with the result that they are able to make little or no contribution to community facilities. Therefore the facilities have to be provided, with the least possible direct additional financial burden being placed on the shoulders of the inhabitants. Financing resources which could meet this requirement very appreciably are the maintenance funds and rent reserve funds of local authorities which they have accumulated over the years in respect of existing housing schemes, as well as surplus rentals on leasing scheme in regard to which the loans have already been redeemed. Profits which local authorities make from the sale of land could also be applied for the financing of facilities, and the amendment of the Act as proposed in clause 7 deals with this. Since local authorities already have an aggregate amount of <span class="col_3577-3578" refersTo="page_0202"/>almost R50 million available in the maintenance and rent reserve funds, and have invested a major portion of this elsewhere in internal funds, I am convinced that these sources in themselves could already go a long way to providing those facilities which could be commenced at the present juncture. The reaction of local authorities to my announcement in this regard was very promising, and my department has already received a large number of inquiries and even applications for approval to apply some of these reserve funds for the establishment of community facilities from a number of local authorities. For the sake of completeness I could just mention that an additional financing source has been created by loading actual rentals from schemes by only 1%, which will progressively swell the funds for these facilities. This addition to rents should not cause lessees any inconvenience, and enjoys the support of both members of the Coloured Persons Representative Council as well as members of the National Indian Council. Apart from the sources which I have mentioned, however, it should also be possible, as a supplementary financial resource, for local authorities to provide community facilities with loans from the National Housing Fund, and consequently it is being proposed that the definition of &#x201C;scheme&#x201D; be expanded to include &#x201C;a proposal for the provision of facilities for community development&#x201D; (clause l(b)(d)). This would authorize my department to consider and grant loans for the establishment of community facilities. Of course these loans will only be considered after local authorities have proved that other sources such as surplus, reserve and maintenance funds, profits from the sale of property&#x2014;to which I have referred&#x2014;and surplus rentals are inadequate to finance such facilities. Because local authorities have to keep this money which accrues to them for community facilities, and to which I have just referred, available in a special account for application where necessary, I deem a prescription such as the one contained in clause 3 to be essential.</p>

<p>I think you all agree with me that the provision of community facilities is a very desirable step forward in promoting the development of happy, independent communities. My department and I are enthusiastically intent on ensuring that nothing should curtail or delay this step. Consequently, whenever a case may occur where a need exists and a local authority does not regard it in this light, there has to be a measure in terms of which that local authority may be encouraged. For this reason it is being proposed that the National Housing Commission should be able to call upon a local authority to present a scheme, and if this encouragement evokes no response, it must be possible for such a scheme to be carried out and the costs defraged from the local authority (clauses 5 and 4). The fact that local authorities are in the first place to apply money which is being internally invested elsewhere, makes this measure even more necessary. It is important that there should be uniformity throughout the country in the provision of community facilities, and some local authorities have consequently advocated that authoritative guidance should be available to them in this respect. To achieve this object it is consequently necessary for a committee to be appointed representing not only local authorities but all population groups as well, a committee which is able to determine the necessary standards when the facilities are established with the funds to which I have just referred. My intention is that this committee, which is being requested in clause 6, will consist, <i>inter alia</i> of representatives of the provincial administrations, the departments of Indian Affairs, and Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations, the United Municipal Executive, etc. I have already taken steps to constitute the committee, which will be a representative one and which will determine standards for effective community facilities throughout the entire country, and as hon. members will observe, local authorities are represented on this committee by the president of the United Municipal Executive. Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to the approval of these measures, by this Parliament, and I should like to make a very serious appeal to local authorities, as soon as the measures come <span class="col_3579-3580" refersTo="page_0203"/>into operation, to give my department their full co-operation and to make a maximum effort without delay to provide these community facilities. My department is only too eager to be of assistance in word and deed.</p>

<p>There are, as hon. members will observe, a few other amendments to the said Act as well. The principles contained therein I shall, for the sake of clarity, elucidate by dealing with each clause separately.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> l(<i>b</i>)(<i>c</i>)(i)</p>

<p>It is a normal need of elderly persons to maintain their independant way of life and remain members of the ordinary community as long as possible. Growing older in modern times is a process which is, however, associated with specific circumstances and needs. For example, it is usually attended by a falling-off in professional labour and a consequent loss of social contact. In this way there are elderly people living isolated and lonely lives in their flats or rooms.</p>

<p>The object of the making available of service centres, as is being proposed in this paragraph, is to prevent such circumstances as far as possible by creating opportunities for elderly people to have pleasant and sustained social intercourse, and to have at their disposal a variety of auxiliary and support services able to meet the primary needs of these people.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> l(<i>b</i>)(<i>c</i>)(ii)</p>

<p>A great need for cr&#x00E8;ches exists among the middle income groups because it is these mothers in particular who enter, and who have already become an integral part of, the labour market. To prevent the children of these working mothers, as well as fathers who have to care for children, being exposed daily for long hours to the care of strangers and to undesirable care, provision is now being made in this paragraph for the making available of funds for the construction of cr&#x00E8;ches.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions in the case of Whites, the Administration of Coloured Affairs in the case of Coloureds, and the Department of Indian Affairs in the case of Indians, will establish the need for such institutions (as happens at present when applications are made for a loan for an old-age home) and that the Department of Community Development will then, on the basis of a recommendation of the abovementioned bodies, consider and grant loans to local authorities for re-issuing to utility companies and registered welfare organizations.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 2</p>

<p>The amendment which is being proposed here, is in accordance with certain reorganizations which have taken place in the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, and consequently it is necessary that the representatives of that department on the Bantu Housing Board should now be indicated only as two officers of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 8</p>

<p>Section 75c of the Housing Act, 1966, allows a person who qualifies to be assisted from the National Housing Fund to purchase a completed house which has been built by private initiative. However, it is a condition that it has to be a new dwelling, which has not yet been occupied.</p>

<p>However, it so happened during the 1974 flood disaster that a person&#x2019;s whose house had been devastated by the flood waters could not be assisted from the National Housing Fund to purchase an existing house which was available because it was a house that had previously been occupied. The prohibition on the purchase of old houses with loans from the Fund was intended to stimulate the construction of new dwellings, and in this way meet the growing need for dwellings. This object is not being overlooked, but it neverthless appears that cases do occur where the prohibition causes major deprivation, as in the case mentioned above.</p>

<p>The amendment which is being proposed in this clause, therefore seeks to enable respective home-owners qualifying for assistance <span class="col_3581-3582" refersTo="page_0204"/>from the National Housing Fund to purchase with a loan from the fund, at the discretion of the National Housing Commission, dwellings which have already been occupied previously.</p>

<p><i>Clause 9</i></p>

<p>Section 76 provides that the National Housing Commission, on such conditions as it may determine, may approve of a loan not exceeding R500 to the registered owner of any land, who has any water available, to enable him to make provision for an adequate supply of such water for domestic purposes on such land.</p>

<p>The determination of an amount in this section therefore necessitates the amendment of the section concerned as soon as it should be decided to increase the amount, as did in fact happen recently. In order to eliminate this procedure, the amendment as contained in this clause is being proposed.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 10</p>

<p>The amendments being proposed in this Bill, particularly to make provision for the establishment of community facilities, also necessitate the amendment of the long title of the Housing Act 1966, as contained in this clause.</p>

<p>Sir, before I resume my seat. I should just like to say, for the information of hon. members, that as a result of representations that have been received I shall move amendments in clauses 3 and 7 in the Committee Stage to make provision for prior consultation with local authorities before the steps envisaged there are taken.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mrs. Speaker, I find it a great pity that so few of us are present in this House this afternoon at a time when important legislation such as this is being introduced here. [Interjections.] Sir, I distinctly said &#x201C;of us&#x201D;; I did not say anything about the Nationalists. I spoke of &#x201C;us&#x201D;, and when I speak of &#x201C;us&#x201D;, I speak of all the members of this House. I do not know why the hon. members in that corner on the opposite side feel so badly about that, for they are all here. I am only sorry that this important legislation was introduced by the Minister in a virtually empty House. I hoped that more of us would be here when the legislation was introduced.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister gave us a detailed account of precisely why this legislation was being introduced. He started by saying that it was to enable him to make arrangements for the provisions of facilities like halls, swimming pools and facilities for recreation. I think we all agree that facilities of this type are what we should like to have. We should like to have such facilities for every population group and in every local authority throughout the country. But I think we should consider these facilities for a moment simply to ascertain whether they are facilities which will be used by the inhabitants of that local authority only. I do not think the hon. the Minister has in mind, for example, a huge Olympic swimming pool or a big hall in which a political meeting can be held. Nor do I think that he has in mind the type of facilities for recreation that we usually find in big cities. I should appreciate it none the less if the hon. the Minister would indicate in his reply the size of the halls, the swimming pools and recreational facilities he has in mind.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that these facilities would be provided in the various townships in which the under-privileged settle in vast numbers. We know that the hon. the Minister has a very good case in this regard and we gladly concur in the proposals he made this afternoon. We should like to make sure, however, that where there are under-privileged people in a local authority area, the provision of the facilities will take place in consultation with them. Shortly before the hon. the Minister resumed his seat, he said there would in fact be consultation with, the various local authorities, but we should like to know on what basis such consultation will take place. As far as housing for under-privileged people is concerned, we know that it happens that townships are not very keen to provide them with, housing. On what basis will the hon. the Minister select the townships in which these facilities are to be provided&#x003F; I can foresee even at this stage that when such facilities are provided <span class="col_3583-3584" refersTo="page_0205"/>in a township, the under-privileged will also be settled in that township. This is a difficult matter, for we know that there has been trouble in the past regarding the housing of people who cannot make the grade on their own. Subsidized housing had to be provided for them at the time.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House are very interested in the financing of these proposals, I see that the financing will, in the first place, be affected from the profits on the sale of land by the local authority. The reserves in the funds of the local authorities for the maintenance and rentals of schemes may also be used for that purpose. The hon. the Minister also referred to the loading of rentals by 1%. I do not know whether this is something that has already been put into operation, or whether the hon. the Minister only envisages doing so. Nor do I know whether the loading of rentals is done in terms of other legislation or by means of proclamation by the Minister. Is it perhaps so that the Housing Commission does the loading&#x003F; We should like to know on what basis and by whom the loading is done. It seems to us as though a local authority must first satisfy the Minister or the Commission that it does not have sufficient funds from the sources I mentioned a moment ago, before it will be able to obtain loans from the National Housing Fund. In other words, only if there is not sufficient profits from the sale of land and there is not enough money in the reserve fund and if sufficient revenue is not derived from the loading of 1%, will loans be available from the National Housing Fund. The question which poses itself to us, is what <b>of</b> the interest and redemption in respect of these loans&#x003F; For example, will the rate of interest be very low and will redemption take place over a very long period&#x003F; If this is not so, we are going to place an additional burden on the shoulders of local authorities as a result of these loans from the National Housing Fund. In that case authorities will most probably have to increase their rates and taxes so as to enable them to pay the additional interest and redemption I think that it is very important to take notice of this, because this is legislation we should like to pass. There is, however, another principle, and that is that we on this side of the House who feel the same way&#x2014; are of the opinion that local authorities should manage their own affairs to a large extent without interference from the commission or Parliament. We now have these two contradictory principles in the legislation. We are now going to give the commission the right to order a municipality or any other local authority to establish these facilities. If the local authority is not so inclined we give the commission the right to oblige that local authority to provide the facilities.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I know that there are certain municipalities in the Cape Province that do not want to know anything about this and I also know that there are some of those municipalities whose councils do not consist of United Party people, but of Nationalist Party people. They, too, are as opposed to this. This matter of being obliged is something that worries me. It is also something about which, we have misgivings. We have misgivings about the fact that the Minister and the commission will now have the right to oblige these municipalities to provide the facilities, when those municipalities perhaps do not have the funds to create those facilities and to maintain them. Therefore, the question as to how the financing is going to be done by means of loans is a very important one. Suppose that these loans are made on the basis of a rate of interest of &#x00BD;% and that these loans may be repaid over a period of 50 years. In that case I should say that there would be very few municipalities that would raise objections to accepting a loan of this kind. But if the loan is for a period of 15 years at a rate of interest of 10%, for example, I can understand that there will certainly be many of these local authorities that will refuse to have anything to do with this. We now give the Minister the right, however, to oblige those local authorities to undertake such schemes. I think the hon. the Minister should inform us very clearly with regard to this point. The hon. the <span class="col_3585-3586" refersTo="page_0206"/>Minister used a very fine word in his speech. He said that local authorities would be &#x201C;encouraged&#x201D; to do these things. Encouragement is an excellent idea and we all agree with that, but when encouragement becomes obligatory we are not so sure any longer whether we are happy with that.</p>

<p>In addition, the Minister spoke about the Committee that is now being appointed to look into the matter and to establish what type of scheme it should be, what standards should be maintained, and so on. According to what I have heard from the Minister it seems to me as though this committee is to be constituted from all population groups. I am not sure whether I understood the matter correctly, but it seems to me that it is a committee which is being appointed by the National Housing Commission. Therefore this is a sub-committee of the National Housing Commission. This sub-committee will then make recommendations and decide what standards should be maintained, what those facilities should be like, etc. It seems to me as though this committee will have to co-operate very closely with local authorities, because there is an additional requirement in this legislation that when a local authority is required to undertake such a matter and does not do so within six months, the Commission has every right to do so and to recover the costs from the local authority. It is important to know what type of co-operation and consultation there will be and it is important to know how this committee is actually going to do its work. This is not clear to us. I think the hon. the Minister should inform us about that aspect. We all agree that there is a need for service centres for elderly persons. There also is a need for cr&#x00E8;ches for children. These are facilities the hon. the Minister now wishes to provide and we agree with that. In this case, however, it seems to me as though the funds may come from sources other than those I mentioned a moment ago. When I examine the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech, it seems to me as though funds will most probably come from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions as a contribution towards maintaining these service centres and cr&#x00E8;ches. I am not sure of this because it is not clear from his speech. I should like to know whether this is, in fact, the case. If it is not the case, it will be another financial burden on the shoulders of the local authority. Although we agree that those service centres and cr&#x00E8;ches should indeed be established, we do feel that the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions should also do its duty in this respect. We feel that matters of this kind actually belong under the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister has already had consultations with the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions. As far as I am concerned, before we can clinch this legislation, we shall have to know to what extent the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions will be prepared to co-operate and to what extent it will be prepared to provide funds. I do not think that this burden should be accepted solely by the inhabitants and taxpayers of a local authority area.</p>

<p>We are very glad to see that the Housing Act is now being amended so as to allow a person who wishes to acquire a house to obtain a loan from the Housing Commission to buy a house that has been occupied previously. It is not clear from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech whether this is intended for the victims of floods only or whether it is a general principle which will apply in the future.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I believe there has been a great improvement in the attitude of the National Housing Commission and the department towards local authorities and towards people in general. I am wondering how this change in attitude came about. I can remember the days when the National Housing Commission was a most dictatorial body. It laid down the law in all respects. As a result of its attitude it had very little co-operation from local authorities. One of <span class="col_3587-3588" refersTo="page_0207"/>the favourite sayings of the Commission and the Minister at that time was that people should not come and talk to them about housing but that they should go and talk to their municipalities who did not want to build the houses. Their attitude was that the municipalities should build the houses. They asked: &#x201C;How much did they ever ask us to give them&#x003F; Have they applied for loans&#x003F;&#x201D; I see a great change in this attitude. I do not know whether I am right or not, but it seems to me that one of the reasons for the change in attitude may be that the department has had another Minister since that was the attitude of the Commission. If that is so, I must say that I am very grateful for the influence of this hon. Minister. As a result of the change in attitude we find that there is much better co-operation between local authorities, the Department of Community Development and the National Housing Commission. I notice that the hon. the Minister of Defence thinks that it is a great joke that I should be praising one of his colleagues.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am trying not to do that, but I am afraid that I was rather put off by the hon. the Minister of Defence.</p>

<p>The only other observation I wish to make in connection with the attitude of the Housing Commission in the past and how it has changed today, is that it was dominated entirely by some of the rather nastier aspects of the Group Areas Act, namely the removals. I think that that is probably what dominated the scene. In those days the Housing Commission was only interested in providing housing for those people who were displaced as a result of the workings of the Group Areas Act. There seems to have been a change in policy now. This new idea of providing something for the benefit of the community is an idea which we on this side of the House welcome. We should like to be satisfied only on the few points on which I want to sum up. I hope we are not going to interfere with the autonomy of the local authorities by passing this Bill. It seems to me that an inquiry is to be made by the Minister if a local authority does not come up to scratch. If a local authority is told that it must get on with a scheme&#x2014;this is provided for by this legislation&#x2014;it is given a period of six months within which it must plan the scheme. It is then given a further period within which the scheme must be put into operation. If it does not do so, according to the amendment it seems as if an inquiry is carried out. In the proposed new section 15(3A) as set out in clause 4 of the Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may, after due inquiry, direct that the Commission shall forthwith, in a case referred to &#x2026;, prepare and carry out any such scheme &#x2026;</block>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister could probably allay a number of doubts in our minds if he told us just how this inquiry is going to work. Is he only going to inquire whether the local authority has been diligent or is he going to inquire into all the surrounding facts of the matter such as why the local authority does not want to enter into the scheme&#x003F; Is he also going to inquire into the fact whether the local authority merely defaulted because it could not see its way clear financially to enter into the scheme&#x003F; I believe it is important that the hon. the Minister should tell us just what inquiry he has in mind. I know that it involves a principle that has already been accepted and is to be found in other sections of the Housing Act, but I do not think the House has ever been told what that inquiry entails. I think the hon. the <span class="col_3589-3590" refersTo="page_0208"/>Minister could clear the air very considerably if he told us just what he inquires into in such instances and how he proposes to have this consultation with the local authorities. He told us this afternoon just before he resumed his seat that he was going to make an amendment to the Bill before us in which he was going to provide for consultation. I think he should tell us in his reply to this debate what sort of consultation that is going to be. If it is merely the sort of consultation we have had from the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, I do not think we shall be interested in it. When that hon. Minister consults, he simply writes a letter to the Bantu Authority concerned, saying: &#x201C;We are going to do this.&#x201D; If he does not get a reply within a month, he says: &#x201C;They have not written to me, so I have consulted.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall try to reply to the questions the hon. member for Wynberg put to me as quickly as possible. Firstly I want to convey my appreciation to the Opposition for their support of this measure. The hon. member for Wynberg expressed the hope that no extravagent facilities will be created. For that very reason a standards committee is being constituted, something I am working on at the moment. The committee will consist of the head of the Building Services Division of the Department of Community Development, a member of the National Housing Commission (NHC), the Director of Housing in Port Elizabeth, Mr. Cleary, the president of the UME, as well as representatives of the Departments of Indian Matters and of Coloured Affairs. The latter representatives may be Whites or Coloureds. The departments have to appoint people themselves. Then there will be representatives of whichever province the activities are taking place in. The function of this committee is to lay down standards and to guide local authorities so that the best results may be obtained at the minimum cost and so that there may be uniformity and a standard which will be applied.</p>

<p>The hon. member elaborated on the basis upon which consultation will take place. There is only one basis upon which consultation will take place. Consultation will firstly take place on an official level. If uniformity cannot be achieved there&#x2014; each side reports to his Minister or local authority&#x2014;the Minister and the local authority meet, as often happens in my department for example. In that way problems will be sorted out. I just want to say in parentheses that it is my experience that, when one sits down at a conference table with a local authority and discusses their problems, after one has also presented one&#x2019;s own problems, an answer is normally found which satisfies both parties.</p>

<p>The loading of rentals is done by the institutions which administer the housing schemes, sub-economic and economic. It will be either my department or the local authority that will load rentals with. 1% to make those funds available for community facilities. I pointed out that both representatives of the Indian Council and the CPR who gave evidence, welcomed it because the burden is very light. It gives those people the feeling that they are also making a contribution towards what is being made available. The funds from this source will, therefore, not be a loan; in other <span class="col_3591-3592" refersTo="page_0209"/>words, it will not be repayable by the local authorities. Thus funds which are, for instance, derived from profits on the sale of properties and business premises will not be a loan; it is money which came from the community. Moneys that come from reserve funds&#x2014;rent reserves and maintenance funds&#x2014;will be a loan and will go back to those funds, just as moneys of the National Housing Commission will be a loan. If the community is predominantly sub-economic, the rate of interest will be 1%. If the community is predominantly economic, there will be an economic rate of interest.</p>

<p>The hon. member expressed concern about the commissions right to compel. I can hardly imagine that cases of compulsory action could occur. The possibility exists however that local authorities might be tardy. Therefore a provision exists in the Bill by which the commission can make a housing scheme compulsory on a local authority. In that way these schemes can also be made compulsory in this instance. In my opinion something like that will occur very seldom, if ever, but the provision has to be made.</p>

<p>I have already dealt with the composition of the committee. The hon. member made inquiries in connection with the funds for service centres and for places of safety for children. This does not impose any additional burden on the local authority. These institutions are created in co-operation with the Department of Social Welfare, as institutions are at present created in co-operation with that department, for example homes for the aged. It is undertaken by utility companies and welfare organizations which then receive the funds and recover it in the same manner in which funds are being recovered today in respect of old-age homes for example.</p>

<heading>CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when we discussed this Bill last week, we saw that it was a rather simple measure which only sought to rectify the position since there had been a judgment in a court case which decided against the co-operative societies. It is a fact that the words &#x201C;subject to such reasonable restrictions as the society or company may in general meeting impose&#x201D;, were incorrectly inserted in the English version only, which was the signed version, and the object of this Bill is simply to rectify this matter. These words are merely being inserted in subsection (3)(b). They mean exactly the same thing. Only it goes a little further, by stating that an annual general meeting also has to determine the nature of the books of account now. Sir, it was suggested by the hon. member for Newton Park that it is being made even more difficult for a member to have access to the books of account. I want to contend that this is not the case, because the annual general meeting has had the right to determine the nature of the books of account in any case, and for that reason the position will be virtually the same because, according to the provisions of this clause as they read at present, the right is being granted quite specifically to the annual general meeting to determine the nature of the books of account, while, according to the English version, it only determined the hours and office hours.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Bethal suggested here that, while amending the Co-operative Societies Act, we may possibly consider deleting section 46 altogether. This idea was supported by the hon. member for Yeoville. Sir, I think there is a great deal to say in favour of this suggestion. However, one will have to consider a few matters in this respect. One wants to retain the principle that it should not be possible for an interfering member to obtain information which may be to the detriment of officials of the co-operative society or members of the co-operative society or in connection with the contracts or business <span class="col_3593-3594" refersTo="page_0210"/>dealings of the co-operative society. If this principle could be retained, it could possibly be inserted in another section of the Act&#x2014;possibly in section 45&#x2014;So that those provisions will in fact be retained and it will not be possible for a meddlesome member to interfere unnecessarily with the books of account of a co-operative society. Sir, I want to suggest that experience over the years has proved that co-operative societies report in a proper manner and very fully on their activities. Usually, it is the experience of co-operative societies that, when submitting to their members an abridged version of their balance sheets, they find that not one out of the hundreds of members asks for an inspection of the detailed financial statements of the co-operative society. Therefore it seems to me that this Bill, although it serves as a guarantee to the member who wants to have access to the books of account, does not curtail the rights of the member unnecessarily.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to attempt to clarify in the minds of hon. members opposite precisely what our object is in speaking to this Bill. We are supporting the Bill and I want to make it quite clear that we have no objection to the principle proposed to be adopted at Second Reading. This arises out of a specific occasion, mentioned by the hon. member for Oudtshoorn, and against the background of a court case which was recently decided and which I do not want to touch on. We had a specific case where a member of a co-operative, attempting to establish his right and interest in the business being conducted by the board of directors elected at a general meeting, was prevented from doing so by an official of that co-operative. That is the background to the legislation. There is, as has been said, a difference of interpretation between the Afrikaans text and the English text, and the proposal here is to set that right and to clarify precisely what was intended in the English text, which I understand was the text which was signed. Now, what we want to make clear is that a co-operative general meeting is entitled to lay down certain restrictions to be imposed upon members as to which books they may see in any case in which they may wish to establish their own personal rights and interests in the business of the co-operative, and this applies to every single member of the co-operative. That general meeting of the co-operative is going to impose certain restrictions upon every single one of its members. This will apply to every member. What we are anxious to see, however, is that that annual general meeting shall be so instructed by this House that it shall not limit beyond what is regarded as reasonable the rights of a person who wishes to establish his own interest in the business being conducted. It was for that reason that the hon. member for Newton Park told the hon. the Minister that he proposed to move an amendment at the Committee Stage which will define the books which may reasonably be made available to a member of a co-operative. It is surely quite reasonable for us to say that members of a co-operative at a general meeting should not impose unreasonable restrictions upon themselves. This is all that we are asking for. We are trying to get this home to the hon. the Minister and hon. members opposite in supporting the legislation. We want it to be quite clearly laid down by this House that members adopting restrictions which will apply to all of them should not be led in their enthusiasm or for any other reason to adopt restrictions which will be unreasonable and which will in any measure limit the right of a member to inquire into the proceedings and the business in his own personal interest. Sir, I wish to make it quite clear that we do not wish all the books to be thrown open so that members of the co-operative can go there, and, as one hon. member said, &#x201C;dit deursnuffel&#x201D;, to find out what other people&#x2019;s business is in the co-operative. We want to know that an individual member of the co-operative can have reasonable access. It is our proposal that the books should be defined as laid down in a sworn statement produced in the court case which was recently decided here in the Cape Province. That is all we are asking the hon. the Minister to accept&#x2014;that the sworn statement which was regarded by an accredited <span class="col_3595-3596" refersTo="page_0211"/>accountant as being the minimum number of books which should be available to a member, should be laid down here so that the general meeting, when they meet, will know against that background that they may take any decisions they wish limiting themsleves. All we want to do is to say that this is a reasonable set of books, sworn to by an accountant in a court case which has been decided. That is all we ask the Minister to accept.</p>

<p>It is not of a retrospective nature. This is not going to interfere with the decision of the Judge. It is merely for the purpose of rectifying the Afrikaans and English versions. I know what your concern is, and I know who paid you a visit, but let me say quite frankly that at one stage these 1 800 members of this co-operative society were on their knees because they did not have a protective one-channel co-operative society such as this. I am telling you now that an attempt is being made to break this kind of thing, an attempt by people who do not appreciate that when there are 1 800 people who organize themselves in a co-operative society in order to save themselves, there are such people &#x2026; The hon. member referred to wool. Any person is in a position to ascertain the quantity of wool in stock in the country; the whole world knows how much wool there is. Wool is quite a different story. An attempt is being made here to do certain things to harm those 1 800 farmers. They are my customers. All we are asking&#x2014;you have been satisfied with the English version since 1939 because that was the signed version; the Afrikaans version, which is different, was not the signed version&#x2014;is that the two versions be brought into line. What is the spirit of a co-operative society&#x003F; 1 800 people come together and say that they unite in a common front, that they convene an annual meeting and such a meeting lays down that people may have reasonable access to the books of account.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members know, agriculture was one of the matters which were placed under the legislative jurisdiction of the legislative assemblies of the homelands when those areas were granted self-government. That meant that the function of regulating marketing affairs in the homelands was transferred to the Governments of the homelands, as a result of which the agricultural authorities of the Republic have no longer had any say in these matters in those areas. The Marketing Act is still shaped to the mould of the previous dispensation and therefore suffers from certain deficiencies, which make it difficult to apply marketing schemes in an effective way. This Bill therefore seeks to co-ordinate the provisions of the Marketing Act with those of the constitutions of the homelands and to make further provision for the granting of assistance by control boards in the marketing of homelands products. The Marketing Act already recognizes the principle that control boards may grant assistance in the marketing of products produced in neighbouring states. In this connection I refer to the provisions of the Act in terms of which importers of products from neighbouring states are deemed to be the producers of such products for the purposes of the marketing thereof in the Republic. Therefore, such importers, as far as a particular marketing scheme is concerned, are subject to the same obligations and are entitled to the same advantages as local producers. In the second place, control boards are authorized to undertake exporting schemes in respect of the products of neighbouring states. In the third place, control boards administering one channel schemes may enter into agreements with the Governments of neighbouring states concerning the purchase or marketing, in an agreed manner, of products produced in such neighbouring states. These arrangements work especially well in respect of the member countries of the customs union. The Bill envisages making possible the application of all these provisions in respect of the homelands as well.</p>

<p>Although the abovementioned measures entail far-reaching advantages for homelands in the long term, these are inadequate because of the Republic&#x2019;s special responsibility towards the homelands. Therefore, it is proposed further that control boards be authorized also to carry on activities, at the request and with the consent of the Government of a homeland, within their sphere of action as an agent for such government. Here it is being envisaged that it be made possible for control boards to assist, even within a homeland on an agency basis, in the execution of a marketing scheme for the products of a homeland. I want to make it quite clear that it will depend on the homeland Governments <span class="col_3599-3600" refersTo="page_0213"/>themselves whether or not they want to avail themselves of this assistance. However, I might mention that requests in this connection have already been received from homeland Governments. As hon. members know, the marketing of agricultural products is not a matter which can be tackled in an unco-ordinated way, and in order to be successful in marketing, producers have to act in a spirit of unanimity. This Bill therefore provides the necessary incentive for South African producers to liaise with each other in pursuance of common objects and to undertake the marketing of their products in a co-ordinated way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that the hon. the Minister concluded with the most important point when he said that the main object was to promote the common interests of producers in South Africa and the homelands. We on this side of the House have no objection to the Second Reading of this Bill, because the principle contained therein is a good one. I do not intend to cause the blood pressure of the hon. gentlemen to rise as has been the case with the previous legislation. However, this Bill goes to show that although one can go a long way with self-government as far as homelands are concerned, it is still essential that there should be the highest degree of co-operation in different spheres. We also know that the homelands are for the most part dependent upon us to sell on our markets the products they produce there, even though this is not done on a large scale. This proves to us that the co-operation which should exist in the economic sphere, is to a great extent embodied in this legislation. Because we realize this irrefutable fact of the South African set-up, we believe it is essential for us to make available this assistance to the homeland Governments. The provision which is being made in this Bill that a control board itself may act as an agent in a homeland in connection with the control, sale and marketing of products, is a sound step. Therefore, the provisions which are being made in this Bill, are sound. One can only express the hope that the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing will be able to render the highest form of service to the homeland governments by means of these control boards, because one can hardly foresee the time when they will be able to act completely on their own. It is also essential that we should not have a surplus of products in our own markets from time to time. In other words, there has to be proper control. If this is the object of this legislation, I believe that it can be supported to establish orderly marketing for those people and, at the same time, to protect the South African farmer as well.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the attitude of the Opposition. I do not foresee that the homelands will become completely independent in this respect, because of their production and the present marketing methods overseas. This does not only concern the homelands. Lesotho is selling her products through our Wool and Mohair Administration. The overseas marketing system is a sophisticated concern and many of our control board have to carry out research in this respect overseas. Many foreign countries are marketing under our auspices today. I think it is quite correct that we also involve the homelands, and therefore I am glad that the Opposition also supports this matter.</p>

<p>On 20 July 1970, during the session of the South African Parliament, I announced that scientists of the Atomic Energy Board at Pelindaba had developed a unique process for the enrichment of uranium and that a pilot plant to prove the process in practice was being erected. Since then the Uranium Enrichment Corporation of South Africa has been established as a State corporation to undertake research and development in connection with uranium enrichment, including the erection of the pilot plant at Valindaba.</p>

<p>At the end of last year the Minister of Mines, Dr. Koornhof, announced that the stage had been reached where part of the plant was put into operation. He gave details of the magnitude of the task involved in putting into operation a system of uranium enrichment based on a new process, taking into consideration the sophisticated nature of the technology involved in uranium enrichment.</p>

<p>It now gives me pleasure to announce that the part of the pilot plant, to which the Minister referred, has been brought into operation successfully. As can be expected with the bringing into operation of such a highly complicated and sophisticated system, problems have been encountered on the way which, however, have been solved and the final phase of putting it in operation was accomplished on Saturday afternoon, 5 April 1975, a few weeks before the scheduled date.</p>

<p>What is even more remarkable is the fact that the performance of the system conforms in all respects to the theorectical forecasts. The new South African process has therefore not only been proved in practice but it also enables us to proceed with confidence with the erection of a large scale plant with a view to the marketing of a large portion of our uranium supplies in enriched form for commercial purposes. Further announcements on this subject will be made by me in course of time.</p>

<p>For this outstanding achievement I wish to express my sincere appreciation to the engineers and scientists and all those who assisted them as well as the many South African industries and consultants who were involved in carrying out this task. That this achievement could be reached without any assistance from foreign countries inspires enormous confidence for the future scientific and technological development of our country. The trust placed by South Africa in its nuclear scientists has been completely vindicated and the result is cause for much gratitude.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was adjourned on the 26th of last month, reacting on first impressions of the Budget speech, I indicated that while we on this side of the House approved the increased expenditure on defence and the provision of finance for an adequate infra-structure, the two priorities which the hon. the Minister of Finance set forth in this Budget speech, we felt at the same time that sufficient emphasis had not been placed in the Budget on other priorities which we considered to be equally if not more important, namely the stimulation of growth in the economy, the combating of inflation which has reached a critically high level approaching 15% and the alleviation of the crushing pressures which high prices present to so many of our population who can ill afford them. Mr. Speaker, after the 12 days we have had to study and analyse this Budget, let me say that in very few respects has it improved with closer acquaintance. Sir, let us be quite frank about it. This Budget fails to pass the vital tests which any budget should pass. It fails to give a clear indication of what its objectives and what its priorities should be, and having failed to give that clear indication of objectives and priorities, it fails to contain the measures which Would be required to meet those priorities had they been clearly laid down. Put in other words, words which hon. members on that side of the House can understand, this Budget fails to provide a stimulus for real growth; it fails miserably to fight inflation&#x2014;in fact, the effects of this Budget are likely to begin the opposite direction of adding fuel to the fires of inflation&#x2014;and it does precious little for <span class="col_3603-3604" refersTo="page_0215"/>the man in the street to help him in his struggle to make ends meet. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I move the following amendment to the Minister&#x2019;s Second Reading proposal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill because the Government has failed, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) to introduce measures which will effectively reduce the present high rate of inflation;</li>

<li>(b) to give effective relief from the crushing burden of high prices, particularly those of foodstuffs; and</li>

<li>(c) to take steps to ensure a satisfactory rate of real growth in the economy and rising living standards for all our people.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as I said before the adjournment, we on this side of the House had hoped that with a new chairman of the board in charge of our finances we would have had fresh approach, some new thinking and some new initiatives. We certainly thought that we would have from a new chairman of the board a policy laid down, a strategy laid down, and an indication as to how the new chairman proposed to reach the objectives and the strategy which he should have laid down. That and then controlling the situation, after all, is what management is all about. Perhaps, Sir, we were expecting too much. Perhaps we did not make sufficient allowances for the fact that the hon. the Minister has had a relatively short period in his office, but I must express, on behalf of the official Opposition, deep disappointment at the overall picture presented by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s first Budget. This is an <i>ad hoc</i> Budget. This is a Budget that does not look ahead. This is a Budget that fails to meet realities and fails to come to grips with the real problems of the country. The Minister, by not doing these things, by not looking ahead, is only piling up problems in future years, not only for himself but also for the country as a whole. He was fairly liberal in his quotations, at the end of his speech, from Abraham Lincoln. I believe, Sir, that the following quotation from Abraham Lincoln would have been much more appropriate than some of those which the Minister actually used: &#x201C;I claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I propose discussing this afternoon the three legs of my amendment in the order in which they are set out The first is the impact which this Budget is going to have on the rate of inflation. I believe that the most serious aspect of this Budget in so far as inflation is concerned is without any doubt the estimated level of Government expenditure. Overall, if you take revenue expenditure plus loan expenditure into account, this expenditure this year is expected to increase by no less than 19%. In a year when the real growth in the economy is expected among a consensus of economists to be between 3&#x00BD;% and 4%, when real growth, in other words, is at a low ebb, to have an increase of 19% in Government expenditure means only one of two things. It means either that the Government is planning, and planning deliberately, to spend the larger slice of the economic cake and to leave the smaller slice to the private sector or it is anticipating an inflation rate of 15 or more which, when applied as a value deflector to the proposed increase of 19% in expenditure, would mean bringing the increase in real terms into line with the real growth of the economy. Now in either case, whichever of these two alternatives you choose, the prospect for this year is a grim one. The Minister has been silent as to what he expects the growth rate and what he expects the inflation rate to be, so that we on this side have to make our own assumptions. If, as I believe, the Government is planning to spend a higher proportion of the national income, then we can only reach the conclusion that this is a wickedly inflationary Budget. I believe that the figures of expenditure contained in the estimates are potentially even more inflationary than appears on the surface. This is a year when increases in civil servants&#x2019; salaries are not going to be a major factor accounting for the increase in Government expenditure. The current level of civil servants&#x2019; salaries were paid for three-quarters of last year and as no further increases in the level of these salaries is budgeted for this year, only one-quarter of the increase which was granted last year actually affects the increase in Government expenditure this year. For that reason, the 19% increase estimated for Government expenditure this year, is a disproportionate <span class="col_3605-3606" refersTo="page_0216"/>drain on resources other than civil servants&#x2019; salaries,</p>

<p>I believe too that the increase in expenditure is more than appears on the surface and is likely to have a more inflationary effect than appears on the surface, because this 19% estimated for this year comes on top of two years when we have had exceptionally high increases, in 1973 of 20% and in 1974 of 23%, so that this year we are already putting our increase on a very enlarged base. And this is not the end either. There are bound to be estimates of additional expenditure and the hon. the Minister also foreshadowed in his Budget the possibility of additional expenditure in connection with the Commission of Inquiry into Urban Transport. Mr. Speaker, the time is arriving in the history of Western countries these days where Government expenditure so alters the structure of the economy of countries and the society in countries, that they get caught up in the web of Socialism, and there is no going back. Several European countries have had that experience already. I hope that South Africa is not going to follow that line, but the way in which Government expenditure is expanding every year places us in grave danger of following a line towards Socialism. Let there be no doubt that part of the price of the high Government expenditure which we have had for the past two years and which is now estimated for this year is going to be a further dose of inflation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are other features of this Budget that are inflationary, besides the feature of increased expenditure. The Minister quoted again from Abraham Lincoln when he said:&#x201C;You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.&#x201D; And then he proceeded to do just that. He proceeded to spend the tidy sum of R254 million out of the kitty, R29 million from the Stabilization Account and R225 million in reducing the Treasury&#x2019;s cash balances. The &#x201C;trouble&#x201D;, to quote Abraham Lincoln again, out of which the Minister is not keeping, is yet another twist to the inflationary spiral.</p>

<p>Following very closely on increased Government expenditure as a major factor causing inflation, we have had in this Budget the 2 cent imposition on petrol, coupled with a 3,7 cent per kg imposition on liquid petroleum gas. Already we have had experience in this country of how sensitive inflation is to fuel prices. There is a snowball effect because fuel is such an important ingredient in the economy as a whole. Now we are going to have another dose of fuel injected inflation, and unnecessarily so. I believe that it would have been perfectly possible to finance Sasol No. 2 from Loan Funds. This is how Sasol No. 1 was financed; this is how the Railways are financed; this is how Escom is financed; this is how Iscor, while it is making losses, is financed; this is how the pipeline was financed. I believe it would have been perfectly possible to finance Sasol No. 2 in the same way. This view is reinforced by the very welcome increase, which we have seen in the Statistical Survey, in domestic savings which, although they are, I believe, to some extent artificially created at the moment on account of paper profits, nevertheless reflect an increase in personal savings. I should like to say to the Government that if it is not possible to finance Sasol No. 2 and the other huge programme of capital projects on public corporations from Loan Account, then the whole position of priorities should be rethought, and we should rethink whether we are not overdoing capital expenditure in respect of public corporations. I cannot condemn too strongly this method of financing Sasol No. 2, at a time when every possible step should be taken to reduce and not to encourage the rate of inflation and when every possible step should be avoided which does exacerbate the inflation rate, as does this imposition of an additional petrol tax.</p>

<p>This Budget is equally notable, or should I say notorious, for what it fails to do in the fight against inflation. Apart from the increased abatement for married working women, the increased investment allowances to industry and the increased plough-back for private companies in respect of undistributed profits tax about which I am going to say something a little later, there is absolutely no encouragement in this Budget to greater productivity in the economy. Primary and secondary education and technical training for our non-White population remain hopelessly inadequate. Herein lies the real long-term answer to productivity and to our fight against inflation. The provision of these facilities should be regarded as a matter of urgency and of top priority, and should not be treated in the pedestrian manner in which this Government is treating it. What we need is what my leader has so often described as a crash training programme.</p>

<p><span class="col_3607-3608" refersTo="page_0217"/>There is something more I want to say about productivity. If we are to attain the economic development programme&#x2019;s projected growth rate of 6,4% over the next five years&#x2014;and we already have leeway to make up&#x2014;we have to train our Black population to do skilled work at a much faster rate than is happening at the moment, because there are just not going to be the Whites available to do the work. We also need to expand our tax base. At the moment less than 10% of the population are paying income tax. If we were to expand our working population through training, and especially our skilled working population, we would at the same time be expanding our tax base and giving ourselves the opportunity of making the tax concessions which are so necessary if we are going to effectively fight inflation. Yet on this subject the Budget is completely silent.</p>

<p>This Budget is also silent on another tax angle, another factor which I regard as important and as inhibiting productivity, viz. the high rate of marginal personal tax and the tax drag which comes into play as a result of the ascending tax scale. It is a fact that the high marginal rate of tax discourages additional effort by many taxpayers, particularly professional men in the higher tax brackets, who find it just not worth while making the effort to get the reward which is available to them after taxation. It is also a fact that the ascending tax scale means that in order for real incomes to keep pace with the rate of inflation, monetary incomes have to rise at a higher rate than the rate of inflation, because they continually get into higher tax brackets. This in itself is a highly inflationary feature of our economy.</p>

<p>There are still other anti-inflationary steps which the Government should take and I would like to come back to one which we on this side of the House have advocated on several previous occasions, viz. the appreciation of the rand. By world standards, our currency is a strong currency, a currency backed by a strong and certainly potentially a very strong economy, by a relatively healthy balance of payments situation and by adequate currency reserves, particularly if the gold content in them is valued at a realistic figure. Why do we not use this strength of the rand to help neutralize the effects of high import prices, which speakers on the Government side are continually blaming as being the main cause of our inflation&#x003F; I do not agree with that but it is a fact that they do so blame them. I am not advocating a sudden upward jump in the value of the rand. This would hurt exporters. What I am advocating, however, is a gradual phased appreciation of the rand over a period, a situation which would allow exporters to adjust their businesses and would allow time for the cushioning of any side-effects.</p>

<p>While I welcome the announcement which the hon. the Prime Minister made recently to the Press that the Government was going to look into the functioning of our anti-monopolistic legislation and was going to appoint a commission to see whether any adjustments to the anti-monopolistic legislation were needed, I do believe, in relation to inflation, that this is an area where the Government has been culpable in that it has been dragging its feet. I raised this subject under the Commerce and Industries Vote in October last, i.e. nearly six months ago, when I indicated areas and industries where I believe that investigation into anti-monopolistic situations was justified. Yet until now there has been virtually complete inactivity on this front.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that there is every reason to suspect that cartel arrangements, collusion over price fixing and monopolistic situations are a major factor causing prices to remain high and therefore a major factor in our inflationary situation. There is nothing&#x2014;I repeat, nothing like competition for keeping prices down. The fiercer the competition, the better it is as far as I am concerned. On the other hand, there is nothing like a monopoly for keeping prices up. If our legislation needs sharper <span class="col_3609-3610" refersTo="page_0218"/>teeth, it must be given sharper teeth. For God&#x2019;s sake, however, let us stop this dillydallying on this important aspect of inflation. I would like to ask the Government whether they are happy about the situation, the situation prevailing in the newsprint industry for example. Newsprint is not subject to price control, nor has there been any investigation under the monopolistic regulations Act into the industry. Between 1973 and 1974 the price of newsprint rose from R140 to R202 per ton. Now it is R269 per ton and a further rise is reported as probable later this year. In the past year the price of newspapers has doubled. There are only two producers of newsprint in the country and during this period of rising prices the profits before tax of one of the producers rose by 148% to a level at which, by any person&#x2019;s standards, the handsome return of 40% on shareholders&#x2019; funds was earned. There is a significant passage in the report of the chairman of this company which expresses &#x201C;appreciation for the co-operation of our fellow newsprint producer&#x201D;. This to me smacks of collusion. I repeat: Is the Government satisfied that such a situation is in the public interest&#x003F;</p>

<p>I come to the next objective at which the Budget should have aimed and that is to provide relief from the crushing burden which high prices put on those members of the population who can afford it least. We on this side of the House welcome the improvement in the social pensions, modest though it is, as well as the other improvements contained in the Budget which affect the aged. There are, however, many people in South Africa who will not benefit from these concessions. Civil pensioners do not benefit and many people who are having to struggle to make ends meet are excluded from social pensions by the means test. In our view the position calls for increased food subsidies to try to cushion the effect of the increased costs of producing food. We need food subsidies on bread, on maize and on dairy products and I think we need a new subsidy on milk. We need a reduced rate of sales tax to keep the prices of necessities on which sales tax is paid lower than they are at present. I refer to items such as household goods. This House should take note, as should the country outside, that these concessions, which are so highly desirable and which would be welcomed by all, are precluded only for the reason that Government expenditure has risen to a level which allows no room for making concessions.</p>

<p>Now I come to the third objective which this Budget should have contained, namely the stimulation of real growth in the economy. In a country like ours where we have poverty on such a wide scale&#x2014;and who can argue with the fact that we have it on a wide scale when the latest figure for the average per capita income of africans is R10 per month&#x2014;where we have a rapidly growing population which needs to be fed and to be housed and which needs jobs, where we have the ever present possibility of racial friction and where we need the funds to sustain a strong defence force, it cannot be sufficiently emphasized how important the need is for real economic growth. The only way to improve our standards of living and the only way to ensure a contented population through better standards of living is through economic growth. For that reason I find the prospect of a year of low growth&#x2014;such as we are going to have this year where the rate is estimated to be between 3&#x00BD;% and 4%&#x2014; to be very disturbing. I do not under-estimate the problem of stimulating growth particularly in a situation where our trading partners are going through a recessionary period but for that reason I find it even more disturbing that more positive steps were not contained in this Budget to do just that. The hon. the Minister reached the conclusion that the Budget should be a moderately stimulatory one. I find it very difficult to see on balance how this Budget is stimulatory at all. This Budget seems to rely for stimulation firstly on the increase in Government expenditure, but let me say that the main effect of the increase in Government expenditure is going to be an inflationary effect; the multiplier effect of Government expenditure on growth is very limited. The Budget, as a stimulant for growth, also seems to rely, hopefully, on increased real investment as a result of the higher investment allowances and the larger plough-back allowed to private companies under the undistributed profits tax. In the opposite direction, that of dampening down growth, we have an additional tax imposition of R184 million. That is bound to have a dampening effect on growth. One wonders how much effect the investment allowances on which this Budget seems to depend so heavily, will have when businesses have to consider their cash flows and the availability of finance to finance investments and have to weigh up the effects of the investment allowances against the additional loan levy burden <span class="col_3611-3612" refersTo="page_0219"/>which has been placed on them. I doubt very much whether there will be many companies that will be better off cashwise after this Budget than they were before. I believe that as far as stimulating growth in the economy is concerned, if this Budget it taken in conjunction with the monetary policy that is being followed by the Reserve Bank and the Government, this Budget is woefully inadequate as a stimulatory measure. I believe there is a need to stimulate real investment, but with spare capacity developing in our industries I believe there is also a need to loosen the reins on demand. The main stumbling blocks as far as investments are concerned, are both financial and psychological. There is a lack of liquidity and funds and a lack of confidence. For this reason the position as far as business is concerned, calls not for additional impositions which mop up liquidity, impositions such as the added loan levy, but it calls for some assistance to help the liquidity position of businesses, assistance in the form of a reduction in the rate of company tax or in the already imposed loan levy. I do not believe the Government should leave it to the banking system alone to help businesses overcome their liquidity problems. Few businesses have capital structures of a kind that allow them to borrow <i>ad lib</i> without getting into trouble. The Government should have made some concessions to meet what is probably one of the most critical business problems facing the business community, and that is low liquidity. Here again, as with every other aspect of this Budget, it has been the high level of Government expenditure which has precluded concessions being made that are so badly needed by the business community.</p>

<p>To sum up our views on this Budget, I would like to say that it is a Budget that scores very few points as a fiscal policy measure designed to solve the country&#x2019;s economic problems and to promote the prosperity and welfare of our people. That, afterall, is what the objective of any major economic measure should be.</p>

<p>At the very best this Budget can be described as an accounting exercise. It is an accounting exercise which sets forth the level of expenditure the Government would like to apply, a level which, I maintain, must be very closely examined at the Committee Stage. It then provides ways and means&#x2014;through taxation, through loans and through deficit budgeting&#x2014;of financing the expenditure required.</p>

<p>During the Third Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill earlier this session, we on this side of the House put forward eighteen proposals which we foreshadowed the Budget should contain. As far as we are concerned, the hon. the Minister has not covered himself with glory because out of our eighteen points the hon. the Minister has scored four and a quarter. We give him one point&#x2014;and this I must admit is a doubtful point&#x2014;for the concessions in regard to social pensions. We give him another point&#x2014;hopefully the hon. the Minister is going to earn this point&#x2014;for narrowing the gap between the rate of social pensions of the different races. We give the hon. the Minister a full point for the increase in investment allowances and we give him another full point for the increased plough-back allowed to private companies under the undistributed profits tax. I am afraid, however, that we can only allow him a quarter of a point for the miserly relief he has given to married working women. We on this side of the House sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will score better on the next scoring board.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I would like to remind the hon. the Minister of one further Lincoln saying, namely: You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the most unpleasant consequences of the fact that the Opposition has remained in opposition for 27 years is that this has utterly destroyed its ability to think positively. This afternoon the hon. member for Constantia spoke of an &#x2019;&#x201C;<i>ad hoc</i> Budget&#x201D;. In the process he allowed a very good opportunity of paying tribute to Dr. Ampie Roux and his brilliant team of scientists, technologists and engineers, who made the announcement of the hon. the Prime Minister here in this House this afternoon possible, to pass. We were dealing here with an announcement which would have the most extensive repercussions, but in his blindness of negative thinking caused by 27 years in opposition, the hon. member for Constantia did not even see it. Allow me then, on behalf of this side of the House, to pay tribute to a Government which made this brilliant work possible, and to Dr. Ampie Roux and his team of engineers, technologists and scientist, who accomplished this magnificent achievement.</p>

<p><span class="col_3613-3614" refersTo="page_0220"/>Sir, I listened with scrupulous attention to the hon. member for Constantia to hear whether any new positive sound at all would come from the Opposition this afternoon, but I was bitterly disappointed for in the entire speech of the hon. member for Constantia there was not a single positive new thought on the Budget speech. Talk about an <i>&#x201C;ad hoc</i> Budget&#x201D;, Sir! Here one has an <i>ad hoc</i> Opposition levelling <i>ad hoc</i> criticism at the Budget. Take, for example, the question of the increased excise duty on petrol to help pay for the financing of the second Sasol. My father tried to impress upon us, as children from an early age that one can measure the extent of a person&#x2019;s patriotism by his reaction to the amount of tax he has to pay. Touch a person&#x2019;s pocket, and his patriotism flies out the window. [Interjection.] In fact, here we again have the annual lamentation. I have seldom seen an Opposition and its Press allow such a golden opportunity to slip through its fingers, as we saw here in this case of the increase in the excise duty on petrol. Sir, a few days before the Budget I had a couple of visitors from Spain. As it happens, they were two brothers who are the biggest champagne makers in the world. These two men, on their way back after a visit to New Zealand, arrived in this country to pay a visit to my farm. At the D.F. Malan Airport they rented a motor car to drive out to my farm, and one of the first things that struck them was the very fair price of petrol in this country. That was the very first thing that struck them. Their immediate reaction to that was to say to me: &#x201C;How on earth are you going to win this oil crisis struggle with such a low petrol price&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, I did not go to the Minister and tell him what these two overseas visitors had said to me, but it does fit very nicely into my argument: &#x201C;How on earth are you going to win the struggle in this oil crisis with such a low petrol price&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>We are dealing here with an oil crisis which was forced on us by the outside world, and it is probably having a more serious effect on us than on most other countries of the world because at this stage we are still on the official boycott list of the oil producers of the world. Sir, at the end of last year the Government announced that in the face of the oil crisis it had decided to cause a second Sasol to be established. This announcement was universally welcomed, by the Opposition Press as well; it was very enthusiastically welcomed by everyone in our petro-chemical industry. They welcome this announcement very sincerely. The hon. member for Johannesburg-North will be able to confirm what I am saying here, for he is associated with the petro-chemical industry himself, or if he is not personally associated with it, he could ask his father-in-law. Then he would be able to say to what extent the announcement was welcomed by the petro-chemical industry. The hon. member for Constantia stated that they welcome it, but that the cost should be financed from loan funds. The same hon. member for Constantia quoted this afternoon from the White Paper which we received with the Budget. If he had examined it a little more closely, he would have learned something from it. I want to refer him to page 27 of this document. There we find the profit appropriation of certain groups of companies. We find that in 1971-&#x2019;72 the retained earnings of companies in manufacturing was 30,9%. Two years later this had risen to 37,7%. In the case of commercial companies this figure was 29,5% in 1971-&#x2019;72. Two years later this had risen to 39,6%. What do these figures teach, us&#x003F; Simply this; In times of high and rising interest rates, the private sector turns to an increasing extent to undistributed profits for its capital expansion requirements. It is a simple financial principle in the private sector that in times of high interest rates a company makes increasing use of undistributed profits to finance its expansion programme. Ask the hon. member for Johannesburg North; he will know what I am talking about. I think the hon. member for Constantia will also know. The Government is now applying this principle to the expansion of a sector of industry, i.e. to the establishment of the second Sasol, therefor, it is making use of undistributed profits to meet its capital requirements. The Opposition finds this an unforgivable sin. But when the private sector, such, as the companies of the hon. member for Johannesburg North, uses this technique, there is nothing wrong with it. If the Government uses it, however, it is complete anathema. This is just another typical example of what happens when one has been sitting in opposition for so long; one is no longer able to think positively.</p>

<p><span class="col_3615-3616" refersTo="page_0221"/>With this Budget and with this method of financing the second Sasol, a second bird is being killed with one stone. The low petrol price which we have enjoyed up to now has most certainly not contributed to our using petrol economically. May I give you an extreme example. A certain elderly lady, with whom I am acquainted, drives 100 km each way every year to fetch five boxes of apples in the apple-producing area of Grabouw, for in Grabouw she can buy apples at 80 cents per box cheaper than she is able to buy them in her home town. Oh well, it is probably commendable if a person tries to see where he can buy something at the most advantageous price. On those five boxes of apples she saves five times 80 cents. If my arithmetic is correct, this amounts to R4, but at the same time that trip costs her R14. Now is that a judicious use of petrol&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, you will tell me that this is a ridiculous example. Yes, it is indeed ridiculous, but I wonder whether we should not, each one of us, again examine our own conscience and ask ourselves whether we are using our motor vehicles judiciously. Are we using this extremely scarce and strategic material, viz. petrol, judiciously&#x003F; I am certain that once we have looked into this matter ourselves we shall find that we are able to use petrol far more judiciously. I am convinced that this increase in the petrol price as a result of the increase in the excise duty on petrol will contribute to helping us to reflect carefully once again on whether we are really using this strategic material judiciously.</p>

<p>Recently I read a report of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the West German Government in which it was stated that when the petrol saving measures were introduced in their country, they had hoped for a 5% saving on oil, but that, after these measures had been in operation in that country for just over a year, it was a pleasure for them to announce that their public had reacted so well that the saving was not 5%, but in fact 10%. Now I ask you, Sir: Is our public less patriotic&#x003F; Do we pay less heed when appeals are made to us by the authorities, in the face of an international crisis, to use fuel more judiciously&#x003F; Sir, I do not think that our public is less patriotic and consequently pays less heed to an appeal by the authorities. This is where the Opposition can, and indeed does, exercise such a major influence. If everyone, the Government, the Opposition, the Press and the radio, all work together to create a psychosis among our public that we are dealing with an international crisis situation, our people would react far more easily and far more favourably to such an appeal on the part of the authorities. But what do we find&#x003F; Instead of the Opposition emphasizing this crisis situation with us to ensure the greatest possible saving, we simply have senseless, negative criticism from the Opposition. Last session a great deal was said and this session a great deal has been said in this House about the matter of patriotism. The Opposition is very sensitive when it is being insinuated that its patriotism is suspect. Here we now have an example where the Opposition may demonstrate its patriotism and show the world that in the face of an international crisis situation it is willing to contribute its share to encouraging that patriotism among our people.</p>

<p>I want to leave the hon. member for Constantia at that because, as I have said, I did not hear from him a single new, positive sound, a sound which had not previously been raised <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House. Therefore, in the second part of my speech, I want to turn to the hon. the Minister of Finance with what I hope will appear to be a positive contribution to budgeting. I want to discuss the cumulative effect of inflation on our finances as a whole. The high inflation rate is bringing more and more of our people into the higher categories of income tax payments. I do not want to elaborate at length on the effect which the higher marginal rate has on our taxpayers, for a great deal has already been said about this in the past. When I refer to the higher marginal rate which taxpayers in the high income groups have to pay, I include at once the joint income of a husband and wife. One could become dramatic about the effect of the higher marginal rate on the taxpayer, but, I do not intend doing so. All I want to say is that on an income, joint or individual, of R22 000, the marginal rate is already 50,4%. From there it increases very rapidly until the marginal rate on a taxable income of R28 000 is already 63%. As I have said, I do not want to dramatize the effect this has, but perhaps I should nevertheless point out that it is in fact the people in the &#x201C;competent&#x201D; sectors of our economy who <span class="col_3617-3618" refersTo="page_0222"/>are affected by this and whose productivity is prejudiced. It is the married woman in the more &#x201C;competent&#x201D; sectors who is now asking whether it is worth her while to go out to work. It is the professional person who does not even have the advantage of a company to acquire tax benefits, who asks himself whether he should not play golf two or three times a week instead of only once a week. I am merely mentioning these things in passing. They have been spelt out so frequently here that it is not necessary for me to elaborate on them. This afternoon I want to make a suggestion to the hon. the Minister of Finance. I know that I cannot at this stage suggest that changes be effected to the Budget, nor do I want to do so, but I want to ask him to instruct the Permanent Committee on Income Tax to institute an investigation and establish whether it is not perhaps desirable for greater concessions to be made to income tax payers in respect of donations to universities and similar institutions. This is the first request I want to make. At present individuals may donate R500 per annum, or 2% of their taxable income, to such institutions free of tax. I want to request that this amount be increased considerably. Secondly, I want to ask for an investigation into whether we should not expand this principle to other institutions, for example to welfare institutions doing welfare work. I realize that we are dealing here with a very thorny issue, and for that reason I have laid down two criteria for myself which we must apply if we wish to extend this principle of tax-free deductions from income in respect of donations to universities to other institutions. The first of the two criteria which I shall apply is that the donation should entail that the State&#x2019;s contribution to that institution may consequently be reduced. The donation which lays claim to a tax concession should make it possible for the State&#x2019;s contribution to be reduced to the same extent. If a university, for example, receives an amount of RX from the State and quite a number of donors are going to donate an amount of RA to that university, the university should then receive an amount of RX less RA as the State&#x2019;s contribution. The second criterion I want to apply, is that the functions of the institution receiving the donation, whether a university or a welfare body, should be to make people better equipped for their task. This will entail their being able to earn a larger income, on which they will then in turn pay more tax. Criterion No. 1 therefore excludes all non-State aided institutions, for only an institution which receives State aid can benefit from the donations of individuals. Included in this are universities, colleges, welfare organizations, etc. The benefit to the State here is a direct benefit. As the taxpayer makes donations to these institutions, the contribution by the State could be reduced. Criterion No. 2 is necessary to ensure that the State receives value for its concession in an indirect way as well. Every person who is being better equipped for his work is a potential higher tax payer. The concession which is being made is therefore nothing less than good business for the fiscus. I have good reason to believe that the hon. the Minister and his staff will give the necessary attention to this proposal of mine. My reason for putting forward this suggestion is my deep concern at the many-tentacled grip which creeping socialism is getting on our freedom throughout the entire Western world, It is to an increasing extent depriving the free individual of his initiative and incentive to the greatest efforts. It is regrettable, but not all of us are altruistic to the highest degree. Each of us wants to be rewarded for the greater efforts he makes. Give the husband and the wife who are prepared to make greater efforts a greater say in the application of his/her increased earnings, which he/she can relingquish for the benefit of the community. In that way one would have many more satisfied taxpayers. After all, we all have our interests. For me it is the support of a university out of gratitude for what a university education has meant to myself and to my children. Another person may, on the other hand, have a greater interest in welfare services. According to these two criteria which I have indicated for the granting of tax concessions, registered welfare services qualify for the concessions I am proposing. Firstly: Because they are State-aided institutions they can manage with less money from the State if they receive these donations from the public. Secondly: They put the fallen back on their feet again, and equip such people more satisfactorily for the economic community. For example, a person who is an alcoholic could be saved by welfare work. He then makes a greater contribution to the economic life, and he would find it gratifying to make a greater contribution to similar welfare care. I could continue in this vein, but time would catch up with me, and for that <span class="col_3619-3620" refersTo="page_0223"/>reason I shall have to content myself with these few examples of what I mean when I say that we should make greater concessions on income so that State-aided bodies could attract greater contributions from the public. The motive for this I should like to formulate as follows: Give the husband and the wife who are prepared to make such greater efforts a greater say in the application of that part of his/her increased earnings which he/she has to surrender to the community. Because time did not permit, I mentioned only a few examples to indicate what I had in mind. In the sphere of welfare care these examples could be multiplied, but there are several other bodies which could also be included under the umbrella of the two criteria which I mentioned. The application of these criteria will of course not be without problems. Consequently I ask, firstly, for the acceptance of the principle that far greater income deductions in respect of donations to a wide series of institutions which satisfy the above two criteria should be allowed. Secondly. I am asking for an investigation to be instituted by the Permanent Committee on Income Tax in order to ensure its feasibility. For the formulation of conditions under which particular institutions will be accorded a right or a claim to such concessions, the assistance of the institutions will have to be called in. I realize full well that my proposal is a drastic one, but hon. members will agree with, me, and I am convinced that the hon. the Minister of Finance will also agree with me, that it constitutes sound financial policy, for what applies to private bodies also applies to the State, namely that every action should be aimed at evoking an economic counter-reaction or counter-achievement. I am firmly convinced that these proposals of mine will evoke the desirable counter-reaction. The central idea is that it should promote productivity while it creates more satisfied taxpayers. In these days of high inflation rates, there is probably no more important aspect which could be emphasized than this aspect, that whatever we do in the fiscal sphere, it has to promote productivity.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the business world who will be watching this debate as an historic one in the closest detail, will be gratified to realize that today we are bringing under the microscope an examination of the plans of the hon. the Minister of Finance to spend some R6 000 million of the money of the people of South Africa. I think that we as an Opposition have a responsibility to ensure that those moneys are properly spent. Too often, I think, we believe that Parliament is the only body which is relevant and that those who are outside must merely take their medicine and smile and come to the polls. It is against this background that the hon. the Prime Minister recently after a meeting of the Economic Advisory Council forestalled the announcements of the hon. the Minister of Finance by indicating, prior to the Budget speech, his concern at the serious situation which faced our economy because of what we may now describe as &#x201C;rampant inflation&#x201D;. Then we have no less important an individual than Mr. Van der Horst, the chairman of the Old Mutual, in the weekend Press warning against hyper-inflation as one of the dangers facing this world. When we go further and find that in both the Afrikaans and English Sunday newspapers political news has been relegated to the background and that the concern of the people of South Africa is the uncontrollable inflation which is now wrecking our country, we as politicians must examine our position and ask ourselves once and for all whether the time has not come for this Government not to advise palliatives but to declare total war on inflation. I believe that with this project it has the right to demand, expect and receive the support of all Opposition parties and I can assure the hon. the Minister that we of the finance and economic affairs groups of the United Party will give him every possible support.</p>

<p>When one examines the ravages of inflation, it becomes more and more apparent <span class="col_3621-3622" refersTo="page_0224"/>that if we are to support a Defence vote of over R1 000 million, which we readily do, to ensure the safety of the State and the individual and if we are to support the spending of many millions of rand to expand our infrastructure in order to help the less fortunate people in South Africa, we must be realists and accept that this can only be done if our economy is strong and progressive and is not in a state of recession. I would submit, Sir, that food is probably the most important weapon that we have in South Africa to win friends and to support the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy of d&#x00E9;tente. We can do more to save the starving millions of Africa by being strong economically and by making optimum use of our own population&#x2019;s ability and initiatives than we can by endeavouring to damp the economic growth of this country. However, if we are to do this, we have to face up to economic facts, such as the fact that private enterprise and private initiative are the only source from which we obtain real tangible wealth in South Africa. I want to compliment the hon. the Minister of Finance on the stand he took in his speech when he indicated that it was the philosophy of the Government to back and to continue to back the concept and philosophy of private initiative and private enterprise. In one of the more recent speeches made by his predecessor, Dr. Diederichs, he indicated that he believed that both official parties in this House had joint motives for accepting the fact that we South Africans are proud of the fact and accept that private initiative and private enterprise, which has as its mainspring the profit motive, is the oil that turns the wheels of our economic machine. But it is not sufficient for the Government merely to indicate that it supports private initiative and private enterprise when, sadly, we have to highlight the fact that so much of the Government&#x2019;s industrial legislation is binding not only the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Economic Affairs, but also the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Restrictive regulations which place restraints on our labour mobility, our endeavour to trade and the rights of the individual to trade freely and economically, are a cause for great regret. This is so much so, that no less a South African and Afrikaner than Mr. Len Abrahamse, when speaking in London only recently, indicated that it was his genuine belief that we in this country stand on the verge of an economic boom, but that he had to admit that if we were to proceed with this boom, we must first of all develop a mentality where we as a country regard ourselves as a potential market of 24 million South Africans and not merely four million South Africans. He indicated that what was stopping the progress of this boom was the fact that we still regarded skilled labour as the prerogative of the Whites and that we were being too tardy in bringing along the non-Europeans, the Indians and Africans, to become a full contributive source of economic wealth in South Africa. He felt that this was the one factor that was our Achilles heel in any negotiations with the outside world. He also indicated that our internal policies were the one stumbling-block in the path of our becoming a really great nation. I want to say to the hon. the Minister of Finance, therefore, that we are disappointed that he has not given more positive guidelines, more inspiration to the industrialist and the commercial man in this country. We go along with the hon. the Minister in the belief that in South Africa we have a great country with a great economic potential which has in the past been rivalled only by countries such as West Germany and Japan and, more recently, the South American States. If the Budget would only permit us to have the economic growth rate necessary to make maximum use of all our population groups, we will have a future to look forward to which will be the envy of most countries in the world.</p>

<p>We must not allow ourselves to be blinkered. The majority of our population in this country is still living at, near or below the poverty datum line. In this regard I am referring not only to the Whites but to all our people. Those people who are earning fixed incomes, the professional classes, teachers, pensioners, the aged and the ordinary wage-earner are seeing the purchasing power of their money being eroded daily by our great enemy inflation. I believe it is the responsibility of any Government in any part of the world to protect the purchasing power of money. This it should do by ensuring that the economy itself does not become overstimulated through the creation of unnecessary moneys by the State itself and by ensuring that the economic cake is of such a size that all sections of the population can enjoy a slice of it. I believe that at the moment one of our problems is that our Civil Service has grown too fast in relation to the size of our country. Let me say immediately <span class="col_3623-3624" refersTo="page_0225"/>that we on this side of the House regard the senior civil servants in all departments as dedicated men. We have no criticism of them; we have only the highest praise for them. However, when we realize that between 28% and 30% of the viable White population in South Africa is employed in Government service then, in relation to other countries such as America, Britain, Germany and France, we are top heavy. The time has come for us to put our Civil Service under a microscope and to prune it where necessary. We must increase the wages of those who do the work but free those who can be spared so that they can become part of our economy and take their place as leaders in trade, industry and commerce. I think it must be realized that as far as the lower income groups among our population are concerned the present rising cost of living has become almost insupportable. We have the rises which were announced only a week ago. There is the potential rise in the price of milk and the rise in the price of white bread, butter cereals and maize. With these in mind we realize that our cost-of-living index which is influenced heavily by rising food prices bears more heavily on the less fortunate sections of our population than on our richer sections.</p>

<p>I want to deal specifically with the intimation of the hon. the Minister that petrol prices are to be increased. We accept his motivation for the increase but we learn now that the motor industry as such will be calling for a higher increase. I think that we should deal with the position of the motorist <i>in toto</i> today. The motorist would appear to be milked too heavily at all levels.</p>

<p>We must realize that South Africa is not a country of motorists simply because we are a wealthy country. We are a country of motorists because the State has not been able to provide adequately a public infrastructure of transport to enable us to leave our cars at home. Because of this, we in commerce and industry in the private sector use our motor cars as a necessity. When we see the growth of the second-hand car market as our non-Whites become owners of these vehicles we realize that these people are not simply buying these motor cars because they want them. They are buying them because they need them as a form of transport. All along the line Government policy in the motor industry has rightly or wrongly decided that we will have an industry of our own and that we will manufacture cars as fully as we can in this country. Because of this policy the price of motoring to the public, with few exceptions, has increased inordinately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it may be argued, as the Government does, that this has been a drive to create economic viability and to create job opportunities in South Africa. Sir, all too frequently the motorist is taxed either by means of additional excise duty, additional duty on imported vehicles, sales taxes, taxes on tyres, taxes on petrol and taxes on batteries, and now we have an additional tax on fuel. We have reached the stage where it has become almost impossible for the working man to run a motor-car, because whenever the Government requires additional revenue the first person to be hit is the motorist. Sir, to say that the man in the street has had a poor deal in this Budget is to say the least, because although the system of indirect taxation allows a man to avoid taxation by not using commodities such as cigarettes or beer or liquor, it is nevertheless a fact of life that South Africans enjoy their beer and their cigarettes. As a sportsman, it makes me sad to see to what extent beer is being taxed. The tax on beer has been increased to such an extent that today it is more expensive than brandy and whisky. I believe that this is driving our young sportsmen away from beer to hard tack, which does them no good at all. I think the hon. the Minister should take this into account in any future Budget before he pushes up the price of beer any further.</p>

<p>Sir, I believe that I must also refer to the great concern which has been expressed by businessmen at the inroads into private enterprise presently being made by the Government itself and by State corporations When I talk about businessmen, I refer not to businessmen on this side of the House but to the leaders of industry such as the chairmen of the Chamber of Commerce, the Federated Chamber of Industries, the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, the Johannesburg Afrikaanse Sakekamer and others. It is not good saying that this is a hardy annual. We on this side of the House have expressed our belief that State corporations are necessary in those instances where private enterprise either cannot or will not play its part, and we give full credit to such great corporations as Iscor, Escom and others for the role that they have played in promoting industry. But, Sir, there are indications today that the <span class="col_3625-3626" refersTo="page_0226"/>efforts of private industry to increase productivity in the national interest are being stifled because of the fact that scarce capital, scarce labour, scarce skills and scarce resources needed by private industry are having to be diverted to the State itself for the purpose of increasing the size of the State corporations. In these circumstances, the time may have come, as the hon. member for Constantia has said, for us to get our priorities right. Can we have everything that we want at the same time&#x003F; Can we have Richards Bay, Saldanha Bay, a second Sasol and a third Iscor at the same time unless we are prepared to make the necessary arrangements for more effective training of our labour force&#x003F; Sir, we want to express our regret that in this Budget almost no provision is being made to allow imployers the advantages that should accrue to those employers who are prepared to institute a crash training programme for our non-Whites. It is not right for us as Whites to demand that the non-White worker should work harder. We must realize that the White worker, too, most work harder. Unless we are prepared to do so, the Whites will gain no advantage from merely raising the wages of the non-Whites as an act of charity. There is every indication, as the hon. the Minister mentioned in his speech, that non-White wages are today rising faster than White wages, but they are not rising fast enough in relation to their increased productivity, and unless this is put right we as White workers will merely be getting poorer instead of getting richer. I would therefore appeal to the hon. the Minister to realize, in any future Budget that he may present to this House, that our biggest investment for prosperity will be an investment in education at all levels&#x2014;in our universities, in our schools, in our technical colleges and particularly in training institutions for Blacks, Coloureds and Indians. If we then achieve our objective, we will be able to look upon this country as one where we have an effective, viable working population of 24 million people, and we will immediately come out of the small-time league and emerge as one of the large industrial countries of the world. I think this is one of the hopes being expressed by the rest of Africa, who realize that we as South Africans, when we can establish the d&#x00E9;tente which is the earnest endeavour of the hon. the Prime Minister, can become the workshop of Africa. We can also produce all the skills necessary for Africa. These skilled men will not only be White, but also non-White; they could provide the skills for Africa. In fact, Africa, which today is in such a desperate situation with starvation, poverty and malnutrition facing millions and millions of Africans, may well yet come to realize that its association with South Africa could be its salvation. So I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to accept the fact that the criticism we voice today is not destructive. We believe he should have been more specific in his speech in dealing particularly with the subject of gold. We all recall that the hon. Dr. Diederichs was known as &#x201C;Mr. Gold&#x201D; during his brilliant and long career in this House. It was a disappointment to me that the hon. the Minister of Finance did not tell this House more about his initiatives, about his endeavours and his intentions in so far as securing the present price of gold is concerned and about his fears that it might drop in price. I see that a London economist has indicated that it may well drop to 148 dollars an ounce within the next three months. Now, our economy&#x2014;and we are fortunate&#x2014;depends for its prosperity on the price of gold, as well as on the price of our industrial products and our other mining articles and our agricultural products. But we cannot go faster than we are going at the moment if we do not know what role gold will play in the international sense. I only hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and make frequent visits to the World Bank and to the International Monetary Fund to continue our endeavours to secure gold as an instrument of exchange in world commerce and industry. If we do this, if we proceed with the enrichment and benefication of the minerals which are available to us, if we make use of the resources available to us, and if we use the time available to us more productively than we are doing at the moment, then we in South Africa will have a wonderful future. But I do reiterate that I believe two things must be done if we are to be able to grow at the necessary rate. The one is that there must be a lowering of the private income tax rate so that the marginal rate does not remain 63% for the professional man. I believe, too, that we must examine every item of Government expenditure in detail, and I recommend to the hon. the Minister that he proceeds with the Cabinet Committee in regard to the investigation of State finances, so that before any amount is passed for submission to this hon. House, it is <span class="col_3627-3628" refersTo="page_0227"/>pruned to the absolute maximum before it is proceeded with. I took one look at the report of the Auditor-General for 1972-&#x2019;73 and I was amazed to see just how many funds were returned to the Treasury as unused after official sanction had been given by the Government and by Parliament for the expenditure of those funds. I found that in that year some R150 million was unused. In one case I think 56% of the funds voted for the Department of Economic Affairs was returned unused. That is a high figure. It had to do with our export promotion programme which was not as successful as it could have been. I believe that when the hon. Ministers of various departments submit their budgets they themselves should use the utmost caution in order not to over-estimate, for these moneys after all are frozen for the purposes for which they are voted, and if R150 million lies unused in the Government coffers for one year, then the taxpayer is being unduly burdened.</p>

<p>I want to speak for a few moments on behalf of the pensioner. The hon. member for Constantia has indicated that he has only recently been given an increase of some R7 a month. But can we not make hon. members on that side of the House realized that on the small amounts that accrue to pensioners, and particularly to the non-Europeans, the African, the Indian and the Coloured pensioner, the addition of R7 only prevents the man from starving and keeps him alive a little longer&#x003F; I do recommend to the hon. the Minister that he should investigate the possibility of creating a State pension fund. This is a hardy annual which we, and my friend, the hon. member for Umbilo, in particular, have motivated over many, many years. I believe that if we study the position in other countries, it should not be beyond the ingenuity of this Government to devise a pension scheme to which all workers throughout their working lives can contribute. When they change from one job to another they will not have the contributions to their existing pension fund returned with a mere increment of 2% or 3% on the capital less the amount contributed by the firm. We shall then have a national fund which will ensure that when a man goes on pension in his later years, he will go on pension as a senior citizen and will receive a pension as a right and not as a charity or a privilege. If we achieve this, then the Budget which the hon. the Minister has presented this year will at least have served some purpose. It is my pleasure to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia did not say it. We are also grateful that the hon. member mentioned that food is a major weapon in the hands of the Government. Later in my speech I shall have a great deal to say about that. These are aspects concerning which one expects an Opposition to act positively. The hon. member also conveyed his thanks to the hon. the Minister for stimulating private initiative. This is something which the Government is always doing and we are grateful that the hon. member said, on behalf of his party, that they support us in that. It is surely in the interests of South Africa that we do these things. I shall talk to the hon. member for Constantia later. However, I want to point out now that he made totally unfounded statements. He said that only 10% of the inhabitants of South Africa pay tax. He then said that if many more people were to pay tax, we should be better able to combat inflation. From where does the hon. member get a statement like that&#x003F; It is not only those who pay direct tax who pay tax: indirect tax is paid by everyone. I should like that hon. member to explain to us how we would combat inflation merely by having more people pay tax.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the hon. the Minister. There is something which, I think, cannot go by unnoticed. I want to thank him for an outstanding Budget, but I shall have more to say about that later. When the hon. the Minister of Finance entered the Cabinet as Minister of Economic Affairs, one of the first things he did was to <span class="col_3629-3630" refersTo="page_0228"/>pay a visit to France and other countries in Europe. There he held discussions with ministers and others. What was the result of that visit by the hon. the Minister&#x003F; What did it mean for South Africa&#x003F; As a result of that we found that one of the biggest trade deputations ever to come to South Africa from France visited our country. As a result of the visit of this deputation, major economic links have been forged and major trade transactions concluded. That, however, is not all, because in the past week, when the hon. the Minister of the Interior was making a speech at a banquet in France, we heard that the French Minister of Information paid tribute to South Africa for the sound economic links and trade existing between the two countries. This morning we heard over the news that one of the French Ministers will head a trade mission that is coming to visit South Africa. This is the first occasion in history that a French Minister is coming to this country at the head of a deputation. This is as a result of the actions of this Government, more specifically the Minister of Finance, who visited that country in his capacity as Minister of Economic Affairs. I think that we should thank him and pay tribute to him for this.</p>

<p>I should now like to come back to the Budget and say a few positive things in this regard. In the past. Budgets were often described in a single word. Budgets have been referred to us &#x201C;growth Budgets&#x201D;, &#x201C;neutral Budgets&#x201D;, &#x201C;moderate Budgets&#x201D;, &#x201C;stimulating Budgets&#x201D;, and so on. I want to describe this Budget as an insurance Budget. This Budget will go down in the annals of the economic history of the country as a Budget that created security for the future and as one that will establish and create greater prosperity for South Africa and for all the population groups of this country. A Budget must be seen against the economic background in which it appears and also in the light of the priorities with a view to the future. These two factors, namely the economic background or economic climate, and the priorities or objectives, form the basis on which this Budget must be judged. We cannot ignore certain facts. There are certain facts about the economy that are very important. In this regard I want to mention four such facts.</p>

<p>The first is that South Africa has an unfavourable balance of payments. Secondly: South Africa tends to import a great deal. Last year the Republic imported 49,7% more goods than the previous year, an indication of South Africa&#x2019;s enormous tendency to import. Thirdly: As is the case with all other countries of the world, South Africa is also faced with inflation, although our rate of inflation is the lowest in the world. Fourthly: South Africa is at present going through a phase of contraction. We must not lose sight of these four facts. In some circles it is being said that the Government has not stimulated the economy sufficiently. The hon. the Opposition, too, accused the Government of this this afternoon. It is being said that the Government should have risked greater stimulation of the economy because, so the argument goes, if the economy were stimulated to a greater, degree, the benefits that would be derived would outweigh the disadvantages. The fact that the Government did not do so indicates that it did not want to kick against the pricks. Surely the facts cry out against any effort to stimulate the economy excessively at this stage; we simply cannot do that. The recent experience both here in South Africa and abroad is that too strong an expansionary programme would only result in a higher rate of inflation. The hon. the Opposition will agree with me on this score. Secondly, it would bring about a low real growth rate which, in turn, would exercise unnecessary pressure on our production factors. Let us analyse this Budget and look at the motive behind it and what it means to us. The hon. member for Constantia levelled the accusation: &#x201C;That it is not a Budget that looks ahead.&#x201D; As far as I am concerned, this is precisely what it is: a Budget that secures the future for us. Instead of stimulating growth, the course adopted has been the creation of an adequate infrastructure, with a view to future growth and South Africa&#x2019;s ability to be self-sufficient. That is of great importance. In this regard we should bear in mind the old Chinese saying, namely: &#x201C;Give a man a fish and he will only eat for a day; teach him to fish and he will eat every day.&#x201D; This Budget could have stimulated the economy to enable us to have a good growth rate this year, but establishing the infrastructure, as the hon. the Minister has done, will enable us to maintain an extremely high growth potential in the future. This, too, is of importance. To use the language of the insurer, one could say that an insurance policy has been taken out to ensure that the most important economic objective, namely continued growth, will <span class="col_3631-3632" refersTo="page_0229"/>be possible in the future as well. Inflation had to be constantly borne in mind, and this the hon. the Minister has done in this Budget as well. The premium on this policy is not being financed in an inflationary way. The financing could have been done by means of high personal tax but in this regard, too, responsible action has been taken. This method of financing would decidedly have had an influence on productivity, viz. if it had been derived from higher taxation. Financing could also have been effected by means of domestic loans, but this, in turn, would have caused unnecessary pressure on the domestic capital market. I could point out that only ten companies<i>&#x2014;inter alia,</i> Escom, Iscor, St. Croix, Sasol, the Durban refineries, Centrachem, Triomf, Fedmis, A.E. &#x0026; C.I. and Foscor&#x2014;alone require R1 100 million as their estimated expenditure for 1975. The amount from the authorities is not included in this figure. If we were to have borrowed even more, we should have disrupted the domestic capital market entirely. The financing could also have been aquired by means of foreign loans, and here, too, we want to thank the hon. the Minister for his very responsible action in not borrowing abroad. South Africa&#x2019;s incomparably good position in regard to its foreign debt is therefore being maintained. In his Budget speech the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the past two years South Africa&#x2019;s total net capital inflow averaged less than R300 million per year, which is less than 1,5% of the gross domestic product, as against a post-war average of nearly 3%</block>

<p>We in South Africa are self-sufficient in this regard and we must remain so. We must not enslave ourselves to foreign loans to such an extent that later we are unable to repay them, because that capital has to be repaid, with interest. What has occurred here now&#x003F; The course has been adopted of financing from our own resources and the premium that is being asked, is slight. It is a premium that is aimed at future growth and stability, something which we surely all want. South Africa wants growth and it wants stability and security.</p>

<p>How does our economy compare with those of other countries in the world&#x003F; The growth pattern of our economy differs substantially from those of other large industrial countries. What is more, one cannot have only continual and unfailing growth. There are trade cycles and the upward and downward curves. It is true that in developing economies the periods of prosperity are followed by periods of negative growth, for example in regard to industrial production, joint economic activities and consumer spending. We have a typical example in the USA which has now been experiencing a negative growth for three consecutive quarters and is going through a serious recession. In addition they are experiencing the highest rate of inflation they have ever had and the highest unemployment rate, too, namely 82%. The United Kingdom and Japan, too, have no growth prospects for 1975. France and Germany, two mighty countries, are still experiencing problems owing to a tendency towards recession in the world. In contrast, South Africa does not have these problems.</p>

<p>It is in this light that we should judge this Budget. We are therefore grateful that the hon. the Minister should have come up with such a fine Budget. South Africa has never, in any of the post-war contraction phases, shown a drop in the real gross domestic product, in contrast to the position in certain other countries. Where a drop in industrial production and consumer spending has occurred, it has been minor, and furthermore this has only been for fairly short periods. The Government is aware of the fact that over the past decade, the downward phases of the business cycle have only lasted for 16, 8, 7 and 21 months respectively. These are fairly short periods. Thanks to a thoroughgoing stable and economic policy which was followed by the Government and the hon. the Minister and which is being continued with, with this insight and knowledge as a background, a premium is being asked of us which is a contribution towards the further expansion of our infrastructure. We are grateful for that. This premium will give rise to the emergence of a strong underlying growth pattern as soon as the appropriate moment arrives when the Government can again release the forces of growth. The Government with all its departments, the Reserve Bank and all the officials who co-operate will do this when they realize that the time is ripe for it to be done.</p>

<p>This Budget has been introduced against the background of inflation, which continues to be one of our most vexatious problems. Recently the hon. the Prime Minister made a very clear appeal to <span class="col_3633-3634" refersTo="page_0230"/>South Africans, and I want to quote what he said in that part of his statement which was released after the 38th meeting of the Economic Advisory Council. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Owing to the seriousness and the magnitude of inflation, that section of my statement which deals with it is now being released in advance. The aim of this is to make an earnest appeal to businessmen and employees&#x2019; organizations to display great responsibility during 1975 with regard to price increases and wage negotiations since the interests of the country require every group in the economy to make a contribution now towards the combating of the evil of inflation. The statement as a whole will be released as usual after the Budget speech.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens associates himself with this in part and we are very grateful for that. It must be realized that we in this country need, within the socio-economic programme that has to combat inflation, the co-operation of every employer, employee and every living soul within the borders of this country. Everyone must contribute towards this.</p>

<p>I want to differ with, the hon. member for Constantia who, unfortunately, is not present at the moment. I want to tell him that our imports constitute one of the most important components of our rate of inflation. He cannot come along now and say that he differs with us. As I have said, in 1974 South Africa imported 49,7% more than in 1973. Each 1 % of the increase in the price of imported goods results in an increase of 0,02% in our consumer index. During the year November 1973 to November 1974 the wholesale price index of imported goods rose by no less than 28%. Consequently this signifies an increase of 6.16% in the domestic consumer index. After all, this is an extremely high percentage. Our present rate of inflation is about 14% and imported inflation is responsible for about 44% of this rate of inflation. This shows us that we shall have to undertake an urgent investigation into South Africa&#x2019;s imports. Why should we import so much&#x003F; Can nothing be done about it&#x003F; I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider whether he can do anything for us in the future. We have had a Green Heritage Year and a Water Year. I now want to ask that we should launch a &#x201C;Buy South African&#x201D; year or a &#x201C;Buy locally manufactured products&#x201D; year. South Africa can manufacture virtually everything it is importing at present, itself. Our people have the know-how, the ability and the entrepreneuring spirit to do this. I ask myself the question whether the time is not already ripe for the benefits of &#x201C;Buy South African&#x201D; to be spelt out clearly and unambiguously to our consumers. This is an opportunity for the authorities, for organized trade, for the Opposition, for the Government&#x2014;in fact, for all of us&#x2014;to launch a major project. By adopting this course there is a chance that we shall be able to combat one of the most important components of inflation and also to make a contribution towards realizing our long cherished aim of full employment, because by selling and using our own product, we create a far greater internal market for the local manufacturer. It goes without saying that in this way we can also save a great deal of foreign exchange. In this way we could achieve a great deal for South Africa. This is a positive step we could take to combat inflation. I advocate a socioeconomic programme against inflation, to complement the traditional instruments of fiscal and monetary policy. To an increasing extent, leading world economists are expressing doubt about the effectiveness of these old measures of combating inflation. This problem has become too complex in a world in which the operation of economic forces, political instability and power groups have continually disturbed the orderly course of affairs and in which economic laws no longer apply, either. I therefore say that if the old measures no longer work, we shall have to think up new measures to combat inflation in a more pragmatic way, measures which will support the overall monetary and fiscal measures. In this way we, and the world, could perhaps attempt to combat inflation. The arsenal of non-monetary measures must be supplemented with new weapons to combat inflation.</p>

<p>How can all this be done&#x003F; Within this programme of action there must, firstly, be a purposeful programme of information for the consumers, a programme of information which, just like inflation, will be continuous. The consumer must be informed at all times about the dangers of inflation. I feel that we speak about inflation far too lightly. We must inform the people far more forcefully about the dangers of inflation. The dangers to every adherent of capitalistic norms that are inherent <span class="col_3635-3636" refersTo="page_0231"/>in inflation, for example the freedom of consumption, of saving, investing, possession and training, are not always recognized by the man in the street. The man in the street does not realize that inflation-destroys the being of capitalism. According to the economist Keynes, Lenin said that the best way of wringing the neck of capitalism was to cause people to lose their confidence in money. What was the argument Keynes advanced against this&#x003F; I also want to quote what he said. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lenin was certainly right; there is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which no man in a million is able to diagnose.</block>

<p>We must bring these dangers to the attention of the public. Only through a purposeful and continuous programme of information will the trade union leader be prevailed upon to oppose excessive or unjustified wage claims, will the voter be prepared to accept unpopular measures and will the Government be in a position to take steps to combat inflation. Instant solutions simply do not exist. There is no such thing. We shall have to do something else to expedite this matter.</p>

<p>I could tell you that the community will only co-operate if it is fully informed about the dangers threatening it In addition to such an information programme, there is another means we could adopt. I want to call it a controlling function that would also have to be continuous. This function would be to do something which has thus far been done by the Price Controller to a certain extent, but which, is not, however, adequate. Price determinations cannot be effected <i>ad hoc.</i> This is something which must be studied continuously. This function must be performed by an autonomous council, a council comprising experts who will continually receive voluntary reports from the public, the Consumer Council and other interested organizations and consumers. A council of this kind must have the employer to investigate wage increases and profit margins. It could also have the function of acquainting the public and the Government with the information programme to which I referred, and so on. I do not know whether our people are aware of this, but a cost of living council as already operative in the USA. That there has already been some movement in this direction in South Africa is proved by the fact that we have a South African Co-ordinating Consumer Council. However, this is not enough. We must do a great deal more. The council which I am advocating must have more powers. Technical social and economic expertise must be made available for utilization by this council. Only in this way will authoritative publications concerning consumption and consumer matters be published. Research and information programmes that are fragmented owing to bodies and individuals operating separately can never combat inflation.</p>

<p>I just want to refer hon. members to what President Johnson of the United States said in 1964 when he established the President&#x2019;s Committee for Consumer Interest. That committee attempted to do something and achieved some real success. His words were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This committee would ensure that the voice of the consumer would be loud and clear, uncompromising and effective in the highest councils of the federal Government. For the first time in history the American consumers&#x2019; interests, so closely identified with public interests, will be directly presented in the White House. The committee will in particular keep consumers informed, so that they are not completely at the mercy of those who exact unfair prices or levy unfair charges.</block>

<p>All this we can do.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to point out to the hon. the Minister, as regards my proposal that we have an export year, that next year we have an industrial exhibition at the show grounds at Milner Park from 20-28 February. The Government has announced that the Transvaal Chamber of Industries will arrange this exhibition in conjunction with the major employer organizations in the Transvaal. South Africa has never yet had a really large-scale industrial show representing all sectors. South Africans are not yet aware of everything that is and can be manufactured here. Nor are they aware of the quality products being produced here in South Africa by our own people. Furthermore, South Africans are still unaware of the fact that we ought to produce a sufficient amount to be able to export as well.</p>

<p><span class="col_3637-3638" refersTo="page_0232"/>Another big show, too, is going to take place, namely the international food and products Expo which will be held in Pretoria from 13-22 May 1976. This is to be the most highly specialized show ever presented in the Republic of South Africa. The attention both of South Africans and of the rest of the world will be drawn to the value of food as well as to other agricultural products and everything required to produce sufficient food. We must produce sufficient food to be able to export, as the hon. member said. This is an instrument and a weapon in our hands. It is calculated that at present there are 500 million hungry people in the world, and this when 40%, or R500 million, in agricultural products is wasted in South Africa annually. If South Africa could only waste 1 % less food, this would result in an annual saving of R5 million. It was said by Mr. J. W. Marais, Director of Agricultural Information at the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and I too want to say that South Africa must not be satisfied with a 12% utilization of agricultural capacity. There must be further development.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the question whether, with reference to these two exhibitions, we could not make a further small joint effort next year by making 1976 a major export year for South Africa. By doing so we should be able to combat inflation, promote exports, save foreign exchange and, what is more, show the world that South Africa is prepared to provide the world with food.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to appeal to every South African to work for this fine country, South Africa, with might and main, with inspiration and enthusiasm, whatever his job or field of work&#x2014;whether he produces or whether he does administrative work. Internationally speaking we can become a great asset. We can become providers of raw materials, we can become exporters of food and we can be a country in which large investments can be made which can be profitable for the outside world. I think that the hon. the Minister presented his Budget in this light. This is how I see this Budget and this is how I see the future of South Africa and this is how I see what the Opposition and all of us can do. I therefore say, thank you very, very much for this fine Budget.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not intend to follow the hon. member for Sunnyside directly, but I will in the course of my speech touch on a number of points raised by him, such as the necessity for private enterprise, the expenditure of public corporations and the question of inflation. Sir, our initial reaction on these benches to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget is that of grave disappointment and indeed alarm. It may be, of course, that we had expected too much, but it is to be regretted that after further careful consideration and analysis we can find no reasonable cause to change our view. This Budget clearly sets out&#x2014;and there can be no gainsaying it &#x2014;the picture of this Government as remaining bound within its ideological strait-jacket, and there is minimal, if any, evidence that it has set its priorities with a view to building the prosperous and productive country where all South Africans, irrespective of colour, could enjoy the increasing real standards of living that would then be available to us. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, it seems to be intended more as a deterrent to those who live without rather than to give satisfaction to any of us who live within the country.</p>

<p>Sir, this Budget, like any other&#x2014;though of course its constituent parts are estimates of the future through to March 1976&#x2014; sets out factually as the Government now sees it the answers to the following questions: Firstly, where and on what the Government intends to spend money; secondly, how much it intends to spend, and, thirdly, how it intends to make up the shortfall, if any, between its total expenditure and its anticipated revenue. It therefore strips bare the priorities as determined by this Government and as such should be brought to the attention of every one of us living in this land. It is an accurate and cold, factual image of the economic policies that this Government intends to pursue within our country, and as such it will directly affect the life of every one of us both immediately and in the longer term. We on these benches, as a result, would like to examine this portrait of the future by the Government, as they see it, as it is one of those rare occasions when the figures produced by this Government itself speak louder than any exhortations, any declarations of intent or any speeches or, indeed, barracking from that source. We intend to do so, Sir, by analysing its size, the main elements of its composition and the <span class="col_3639-3640" refersTo="page_0233"/>method by which the hon. the Minister intends to finance his deficit, as he now sees it, and then measuring what we find against the following criteria, which have been set out by this Government itself: Does it serve to dampen or increase the fires of inflation; does it accord with the policy of separate but equal development within South Africa; will it improve our standing and relations with Southern Africa and elsewhere and, finally, is it the correct medicine in the interests of the majority of us who live in this country in either the short or the long term&#x003F; Most of the factors that we shall look at cannot, of course, be totally separated the one from the other but must rather be seen as reacting upon each other to produce a composite picture. At the same time it will be possible to identify the major factors at work and to reach a judgment in terms of the criteria we have set out. Finally, we shall put forward certain concrete alternatives both in regard to what has been proposed by the Minister and, of equal importance, what he has omitted, and which amount to the pursuit of a quite different course of action which should be followed and which would be in the best interests of all those who live within our country&#x2019;s borders, both now and in the future.</p>

<p>On a cash basis this Budget estimates an expenditure of R6 562 million. There is to be an increase of expenditure on Revenue Account of 16%, and on Loan Account of 25%&#x2014;an increase of no less than R997 million or nearly a billion rand. This, of course, represents an overall increase on last year of 18,5.% There is no way that this can be seen as an exercise in self-discipline on the part of this Government. In fact, as has happened so often in the past, it is noticeable only for its absence. This is no demonstration by example&#x2014;no model that can be held out to others to exercise self-restraint. Yet the hon. the Minister stated in his speech, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Once again, however, I want to stress very strongly the basic premise of the Advisory Committee, namely that inflation is a matter not only for authorities or for this or that group in the community, but for everyone&#x2014;employers, employees, the Government and the private sector, producers and consumers.</block>

<p>True words indeed, but they do not square with the facts. It is of no use for the Government to make pious statements calling upon others to exercise forebearance, when at the same time it commits deeds which expose that, in so far as it itself is concerned, it has no intention of doing so.</p>

<p>It is a mockery which can be seen for what it is. It serves to highlight yet again that a major cause of the inflation from which we are now suffering is the level and increase of expenditure by this Government. This is unfortunately not new, as we on these benches have pointed out. It has been so each year with few, if any, exceptions since 1960. The fact that the Government pays no heed to the fact that the current level of inflation is 14,7%, if you take February 1974 to February 1975, and must even on an average basis, to use the Minister&#x2019;s favourite way of calculation, be around 12%, but carries on regardless, must now be seen by every South African for what it is. It is a tragic crime of omission for which we are all going to have to continue to pay and, what is more, at an increased price. It is not only that such expenditures by the Government have more or less continuously outrun the growth of the gross domestic product, but they are overall of course not as productive either in the short or the long terms as compared to what we might have enjoyed if the Government&#x2019;s policies and priorities were different. I am not arguing that essential infrastructure should not be provided, but expenditure for that, its timing and the priorities attached to the various projects, must be seen in the context of the interest of the majority of all who live here. I do not want to let pass unnoticed either two other factors which may result in still further significant increases in the level of Government expenditure. One of these was mentioned by the hon. the Minister, but the other was not except possibly by implication.</p>

<p>The first is Iscor, where a further R70 million is to be appropriated from the taxpayer and the Minister also said that a substantial further amount might have to be provided. As I have said before, I appreciate the difficulties that Iscor faces now as in the past in carrying out the role ascribed to it by the Government, but this is simply further evidence that the time is overdue where the consumers of its products should pay a realistic price and not be subsidized by taxpayers.</p>

<p>The second point is that there is no explicit mention of salary increases for those <span class="col_3641-3642" refersTo="page_0234"/>who work in the public sector. Sir, those who work in the public sector, if you include within that category those who depend on it for their living, now constitute some 40% of the White male working force in our country. In our situation, in so far as the Whites are concerned, there is of course little, if any, unemployment, but these people are bound to want compensation for the fact that their cost of living has risen and that they will now have to-pay more for petrol, cigarettes and drink. It would not be unreasonable for them to ask, in view of the Government&#x2019;s performance, why they should pay the price by accepting a lower standard of living. If they do not, it will simply be left to the remainder to do so, and that would both be grossly inequitable and indeed intolerable for both the Whites and the majority in numbers of Black and Brown South Africans who work in the private sector. The simple truth is that so long as the Government itself fans the fires of inflation, it cannot expect others not to do what they can to avoid being consumed by the flames. Does the hon. the Minister really believe that his concessions amounting to some 68% over the last five years have succeeded in keeping the old and the aged, irrespective of colour, from suffering at least third degree burns from inflation&#x003F; If he does, let him go and ask them. The answer will be an emphatic &#x201C;No&#x201D;. It is their past labours which have built this country, and it is an obligation upon all of us to look after them when they are, as they now are, defenceless and unable to protect themselves. I was delighted to hear from the hon. the Minister that further steps have been taken to narrow the gap between Black, Brown and White pensions, but I would like to ask the hon. the Minister in his reply to this debate to be specific and say by how many rands a month this has been done.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I should now like to look from another aspect at what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposals amount to. Given that defence expenditure has to rise by R300 million, a supposition which we do not accept and will come back to later&#x2014;nevertheless for the moment let us take it for granted, together with the fact of the priority given to increases in infra-structure expenditure what is being made clear to us&#x003F; It is the fact that the private sector, unlike the public sector, is being asked to accept a period of consolidation. Within that sector it will be a cause for dissatisfaction that corporate income tax has effectively been increased by 2<i>%</i> due to the imposition of the loan levy, and this at a time when the Government is reaping substantial increases from the effects of inflation which has produced the illusion or fiction of very large additional profits which in reality are not there. The hon. the Minister will no doubt be aware of the recently published survey by the University of Stellenbosch, on 139 South African companies quoted on the Stock Exchange, to whose annual reports the principles of current purchasing power were applied&#x2014;even given the limitations at this point in time of that particular device&#x2014;with the result that 96 of them, 69% of them, showed a decline in real earnings. The hon. the Minister will also be aware that Iscor has for a number of years recognized the effects of inflation by, in addition to depreciation, charging against annual production costs an amount based on the current wholesale price index, to provide for the estimated increased replacement cost of its fixed assets arising during the year. In this context the increases in investment allowances are to be weland certainly they are neither an immediate nor significant remedy for the problems of corporate liquidity which are being experienced with the prevailing rate of inflation.</p>

<p>It is evident that the hon. the Minister has decided that the only way he can try and balance his books&#x2014;and let us be clear, he has not done so&#x2014;is to get the private sector to cool off. The fact that he has not succeeded in balancing his books can be seen form the fact that he has had to provide some R274 million from past surpluses and treasury bills. It is a moot guestion as to the extent this will bring comfort to the private sector, because we do not know, as we have not been given the information, how the money will be spent as between here and elsewhere in the world. To the extent that it is spent abroad on submarines or aircraft, and particularly if that is the major portion, it will serve as no stimulus to business confidence as it will simply reduce our reserves. Indeed. I would have hoped to see a greater degree of borrowing abroad, but I should like to come back to that later, as I suspect it may be the necessity for the public corporations and local authorities to borrow in that sphere which underlies the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposal to borrow R140 million overseas.</p>

<p><span class="col_3643-3644" refersTo="page_0235"/>No, Mr. Speaker, it appears that the hon. the Minister has taken a gamble in that his proposals to finance the increased expenditures of the Government by the injection of R274 million of new money&#x2014; whichever way, too, that it is spent either here or overseas&#x2014;can only come off if certain other things happen which will improve the balance of payments, business liquidity and therefore confidence. If these things do not happen then the nerve and initiative of the private sector will suffer grave injury. For the Minister&#x2019;s strategy to succeed, we will require reasonable prices both for our gold and other exports&#x2014; something to be desired by all&#x2014;but there do not appear to be any immediate signs of economic recovery on which to base such a presumption&#x2014;leaving gold on one side for the moment&#x2014;and in any event there is likely to be a time lag before it works through to our economy. It will also require a levelling off in imports both in regard to quantity and price, in the sense of a decrease in the rate of inflation overseas, but that in general is not unreasonable in the light of the huge increase we saw last year. Finally, it will require a continued capital inflow and, most important of all, the acceptance, as I have said earlier, by the general public of a cut in their standard of living. If there is a renewal of demand inflation, if people succeed through wage or price increases in getting the compensation they will surely want to maintain their standard of living, then the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s gamble will fail. The petrol price is an excellent example. Motorists are now being asked to pay R1021 million for Sasol No. 2. That figure is in 1974 money terms; in other words, it does not include an estimate of any escalation in costs over the period in respect of its erection. The motorists will have to pay it whether they like it or not, but if they succeed in getting compensation through wage demands so that they can use their cars in the same way as they have in the past, then the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s gamble will fail. If that happens we shall simply find ourselves in the position that we have to pay a far greater amount even than that which we are already paying for excessive Government spending; because if demand inflation returns and the private or Government sector for that matter puts the reserves under pressure, then inevitably it will subsequently lead to a further clamp-down&#x2014;lower growth, or increased taxation, or both.</p>

<p>I should like to turn to the constituent parts which highlight the main thrust of this Budget as opposed to the overall picture with which I have just dealt. Here, of course, we find that the striking increases lie in defence, including the Armaments Board where expenditure will rise by near enough 40% to R1 055 million, and in the S.A. Railways and Harbours where the increase is 47,5% to R472 million. The actual increase in expenditure for these two alone amounts to some R450 million. This should be compared with the aggregate increase of expenditure on education, health, housing and community services of R124 million. The hon. the Minister will no doubt argue that there was no increase last year whereas there was a big increase in the private sector&#x2014;12% as compared to 8,5% overall. But it is important for us to remember that the increase in real fixed capital stock of 6.4%, which has been cited by the hon. the Minister, was the first in three or four years and that in last year&#x2019;s increase in spending overall real private consumption expenditure rose by only 5.2% as compared with the Government&#x2019;s expenditure on consumption of 10,9%, rather more than double. These are illuminating figures and underline for all to see the dilemma in which this Government finds itself. This is the divide between the political ideology of the Government and the economic development of the country. No one of the 25 million people who live within the borders of our country is going to deny or fail to support the idea that we should be in a more than adequate position to defend ourselves against aggression, real or threatened, from without. Let us be clear, however, that the real reason which underlies the fact that the Government has felt impelled to quadruple expenditure on defence within three years and bring it in excess of R1 billion, is that its policies are unacceptable to any country or Government without our borders. The figures amount to no more and no less than that. They also amount to an admission by this Government, though no doubt they will deny it, that even if d&#x00E9;tente is successful&#x2014;by d&#x00E9;tente I mean the establishment of harmonious relationships between the countries which comprise Southern Africa &#x2014;for it to have permanence it will require changes in the Government&#x2019;s policy internally. Is the hon. the Minister telling us that even if the policies of this Government were acceptable elsewhere, he would still propose expenditure at such a level&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_3645-3646" refersTo="page_0236"/>We on these benches would also like to question, as we have in the past, whether, given the recognized necessity to be able to defend ourselves, expenditure of this nature will produce the optimal return. The best bulwark against aggression is surely to give those who live within our borders an increasing stake in the development of our country. It is not only in the economic sphere that this must happen, but this is the first need. But there is no evidence at all in the Budget of the Government&#x2019;s determination to move in this direction. As such, it has got its judgment wrong. In addition to the additional R1 billion of expenditure presaged by the Budget, the following expenditure, which has already been announced in respect of the public sector, must be borne in mind&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">R1 021 million for Sasol No. 2;</block>

<block name="quote">R3 400 million for the South African Railways and Harbours;</block>

<block name="quote">R3 200 million for Escom and Iscor;</block>

<block name="quote">R2 000 million for the Sishen/Saldanha project and for Richards Bay;</block>

<block name="quote">R2 400 million as additional expenditure for Sasol;</block>

<block name="quote">R800 million in respect of uranium enrichment; and R1 000 million for the new telephone system.</block>

<p>This gives us a total of R17 billion. It may be that it was after the consideration of these figures that the hon. the Minister decided only to include the raising of R140 million from overseas in his estimates, so that that sphere of potential finance could be left open to provide help for the cost of these projects.</p>

<p>We quite agree with the cost of these projects.</p>

<p>We quite agree with the hon. the Minister when he says that the impression held by some that we have borrowed too much from abroad is mistaken. We would think that in fact South Africa&#x2019;s total foreign borrowings are conservative as compared with those of most other countries. Indeed, we would have thought that the quality of South Africa&#x2019;s earnings of foreign exchange, primarily based as they are on gold, metals and minerals and agricultural produce, are such that leaving aside the undoubted potential to increase them, they give us the standing and ability to substantially increase the level of our borrowings. Indeed, except for the possible reason we have mentioned, we are surprised that the hon. the Minister did not assume that he would raise much more from overseas to cushion the risk that may be imposed on the level of reserves by defence purchases, as presumably one of the purposes of such expenditure it to give the foreign investor further confidence in our land through the maintenance of its reserves at an adequate level, and also to the extent that he succeeds, reduce the constraints under which the private sector will have to operate.</p>

<p>I want to return to the figures of expenditure both within and without this Budget, though I accept that the latter will, to some extent, be financed internally although ultimately all of us will have to pay for them, in one way or another, and to put them alongside the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposals for expenditure for the benefit directly of Black and Brown South Africans. I calculate the following from the Estimates that have been tabled: For the Coloured population R171 million; for the Black South Africans R600 million&#x2014;and I include in that the Education Vote from Bantu Administration; for South African Indians R61 million. That gives us a total, including education, of R832 million or between 11% and 12% of the Budget or 3% to 4% of the gross domestic product.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from> 

<p>I appreciate that those groups of the population receive further indirect benefits, but the contrast is quite striking. I wish to highlight that aspect again, and this time I intend to quote:</p>

<p>The figure for the expenditure on the education of Black South Africans is to rise by the princely sum of R9 million to nearly R69 million or just over 1% of the Budget or just over one-third of 1% of the gross domestic product.</p>

<p>Is it possible to describe that in any way except as being grossly inequitable&#x003F; It certainly is not separate but equal development. <span class="col_3647-3648" refersTo="page_0237"/>The Government has of late&#x2014;and this is, of course, long overdue, but better late than never&#x2014;laid great stress on the need for greater productivity. This is a most notable omission from this Budget, however, in that no provision is being made to create this greater productivity. It is, of course, common cause that we face a critical shortage of skilled labour, a shortage which will increase in time unless the appropriate action is taken. The prerequisite, however, for producing skilled workers, or to increase the productivity of our labour force is formal and technical education. The hon. Minister, however, is notable only for his silence. The increase of R150 in the deduction allowed to married women cannot be seen either as having anything but a marginal effect. It is therefore to be hoped that the hon. the Minister will be in a position to announce the result of the inquiry which he has already announced and to incorporate its recommendations into his next Budget.</p>

<p>To sum up, the Budget will give no comfort to anyone. It takes from the public&#x2019;s pocket an amount of the order of R244 million and gives concessions in return which will amount to some R13 million in this financial year. It is highly inflationary in that it injects into the system some R274 million in new money and it is grossly inequitable. The hon. the Minister asked me, in the course of the debate on the Part Appropriation Bill, to be specific and to put forward concrete proposals. He asked us to do our best to help. We are now going to try to help him because there are, of course, huge problems to be solved. A start must be made now, however, and we would therefore recommend the following course of action to the hon. the Minister. Firstly, cut back present Government expenditure as set out in the Estimates, as I shall indicate presently. This will release money which can either be used for other purposes or be in effect a genuine reduction. Secondly, divert from the other public expenditure of some R17 billion, which is in any event ultimately borne by the general public so that 15% of it becomes available for other uses since it will, in any event, either be raised internally from the public or externally, in which case it will rest on the country&#x2019;s financial standing. Thirdly we would like to recommend to the hon. the Minister that he use the moneys that will thus become available either to replace revenues at present received or to implement the following: Firstly, he should remove the tax differential as between Black and White South Africans. Secondly, the expenditure on formal and technical education for Black and Brown South Africans should be increased by R70 million per annum. That will in effect mean that the expenditure will be doubled. This amount should come off the defence budget. Thirdly, a housing programme should be financed to reduce and eradicate the shortage which is being experienced at present. Fourthly, any wage differential between people of different colour should be removed where the people carry the same responsibility and it should be applied on the basis of scientifically evaluated wage scales. Fifthly, recognition should be given to the permanence of Black and Brown South Africans in the urban areas. He should realize the need to create a social infra-structure for them within those areas to make life at least bearable for them. Sixthly, expenditure on social welfare and pensions for White, Black and Brown South Africans should be increased by 50% overall at a cost of some R140 million. The hon. the Minister should state in public that he intends to remove the differential within a certain time. The last recommendation which we should like to make is to allow, under appropriate safeguards, married people who are both in employment to choose if they wish to be taxed separately on their earned income. Items 3, 4 and 5 should be financed by the moneys raised by the Government but which are diverted from their original purpose, be it for Escom, the Railways or whoever. The sixth item should be financed from the money raised by the increased taxation which would otherwise be held back to finance Sasol 2 which is in any event not required immediately. Once this year&#x2019;s defence expenditure has been incurred, which we assume includes a number of one-off items, the revenue could in future years be used for the other purposes.</p>

<p>This list is by no means perfect or exhaustive, but it would serve to demonstrate that we, unlike the Government, have our priorities right and it would give proof that a start has been made on the road which will build an increasingly prosperous South Africa for all. This is the best bulwark against aggression from without and against frustration and discontent within.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. I wanted very much to follow what the hon. member was saying, but the Lord knows, it was totally impossible to understand anything of it. I do not envy the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s task of saying something about it at all. The hon. member for Johannesburg North made me think of the days when he was still a fly-half and when he was continually off-side. All that I can remember of his speech of today, is his &#x201C;off-sides&#x201D;, his offside remarks when he had to fall back on his old and only theme. He plays in one place only and he cannot get away from that. The old theme is to fall back on the idea of &#x201C;ideological policies&#x201D;, the &#x201C;colour policies&#x201D;, etc.</p>

<p>With that I want to leave the speech of the hon. member. I should like to associate myself with what the hon. member for Sunnyside said in respect of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s activities, also with reference to what the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens said. The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens expressed the hope that this hon. Minister would follow in the footsteps of his predecessor by making contact with the outside world. I want to tell the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens that he is completely old-fashioned and that he is completely behind the times when he says something of this nature. If the hon. member had listened to the news today, he would have known that our hon. the Minister met the French Minister of Trade at Jan Smuts Airport this morning. That meeting was the outcome of an invitation which this hon. Minister made to France when he visited France last year in July. Therefore we have a wide awake Minister who knows his priorities and who knows how he should approach his work. Therefore we are dealing here with a Budget which, in the light of the present world business cycle, is extremely refreshing. Other countries are at present caught up in an uncertain, gloomy monetary situation. They have landed in a recession, in an oil crisis, and with an unfavourable balance of payments. Some of these countries have reached the verge of bankruptcy. Others have found themselves with obligations in respect of their oil accounts, obligations which they will probably never be able to meet from their national incomes in their entire existence. Some of these countries owe up to 90% of their national income for the fuel which they had to buy at high prices in these times. In spite of the serious monetary problems which the rest of the world are experiencing we find inherent in this Budget that which is worthy of a mature, leading country with a stable economy which is equal to the best in the world. It is indeed a model of stability and of equilibrium. Therefore it is fitting that I quote what Dr. De Kock of the Reserve Bank said in this connection, according to <i>Die Volkshandel</i> of September 1974, viz. (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The South African economy has emerged from the unstable national monetary situation of the past few years in a strengthened position, both absolutely as well as relative to other economies.</block>

<p>This is indeed a testimonial to the stability and steadiness of the economy of this country from one of the experts, a testimonial by one of the specialists in the monetary sphere in South Africa.</p>

<p>This Budget stimulates, in fact, that which has to be stimulated, regardless of what was said by the hon. member for Constantia and other speakers after him. This Budget stimulates investment in this country. Thus one has already been able to read in the local Press in the past few days that the money market has expanded and that there has been an increase in the liquidity of banking institutions. That is the logical consequence of the stimulatory effect which this Budget has already had on the economy of South Africa. It has already brought about an expansion of capacity and of the liquidity position. Furthermore, this Budget makes provision for concessions where these are appropriate and deserved. We think of the investment allowances for the replacement of capital assets, as is being envisaged in the Budget; we think of the ploughing back of distributed profits which has been increased from 45% to 55%; and <span class="col_3651-3652" refersTo="page_0239"/>we also think of the expansion of pension benefits for the aged for which this group of people are extremely grateful.</p>

<p>It might have been a century ago, but it still remains true. We are also grateful for the concessions which have been made in respect of estate duties.</p>

<p>This Budget is not restrictive in the sense that it is negative; in fact, it contains no restraining, enforced fiscal measures. As the hon. the Minister said in his Budget speech, the Budget is moderately expansionary in respect of productivity and makes provision for the infrastructure which is so essential to this country, especially in order to stimulate the economy. We think of the expenditure by the South African Railways; we think of Iscor; we think of Sasol No. 2; we think of the expenditure and appropriation of funds for roads, hospitals, education, Bantu administration, and so on. These are tremendous undertakings in South Africa and bear witness to a spirit of enterprise in this dark monetary world in which we are living at the moment. Now, not only the Opposition, but also bodies such as Assocom, say that this is a neutral Budget and has a strongly inflationary tendency. I can regard that as a complete overstatement. A Budget which is stimulatory, however moderately, has to be inflationary to some extent. If it is expansionary, there must also be a degree of inflation inherent in it. It is a commonplace and a recognized norm in finance that if one can keep inflation moderate and stimulate it moderately, that is actually advantageous for one&#x2019;s economy. That is exactly what this Budget envisages in the phase of the business cycle in which we are at the moment, i.e. in the phase of the business cycle where it is necessary for us to consolidate and for us to eliminate tensions. Therefore I say that it is advantageos. I say that it is moderately stimulatory and because is is moderately stimulatory, because it stimulates growth moderately and because it stimulates productivity moderately, it will influence the inflation spiral moderately and it is possible that perhaps&#x2014; we hope that this will appear to be the case&#x2014;we shall be able to say in the course of time that we have reached the turning point of our inflation spiral.</p>

<p>This Budget also states its priorities, regardless of what the hon. member for Constantia said. Our major priority, which is obviously staring us in the face, is defence and the funds which have to be spent on that. That is priority number one in the Budget. This fact is emphasized by the colossal amount of R948 million. We are grateful that we in South Africa are in a position and have the means at our disposal, in these times in which we are living, to be able to spend this money in the promotion of our defence. In the same breath I must say that we are grateful that we have a Defence Force in respect of which and on which this money can be spent. We are also glad that we have a Minister who can utilize that money to the fullest extent. Other nations will probably envy us this. We think of a nation such as Israel, which at present has to spend about 30% of its national income on military preparedness. We also think of how our expenditure in this connection in the year 1973-&#x2019;74 was merely 2.6% of the gross national product, merely 3.2% in 1974-75 and is estimated to be merely 3,7% for 1975-&#x2019;76. Therefore we say that this is a Budget with a very sensible approach in the present phase of the business cycle, sensible in this respect that it takes into consideration the problems with which not only we, but the whole world today, are struggling. In this connection we think especially of the oil crisis. We say that if we are able to overcome this oil crisis through the establishment of a second Sasol, and if we are able to do this by increasing our petrol price by two cents per litre&#x2014;which would cost the ordinary taxpayer about an average of approximately R75 per year&#x2014;it would be the best contribution the taxpayers of South Africa will ever have made or could ever make in respect of the economy. I think that the question which the Opposition asked in this connection, viz. why this financing cannot take place by means of a loan account, is a very poor question. It is not a good question at all. In any case, it can be answered very easily. Have they calculated for us what the interest on it would be&#x003F; Have they calculated what a colossal obligation it would mean for us&#x003F; Have they calculated where and how we should obtain the money&#x003F; I think it is short-sighted <span class="col_3653-3654" refersTo="page_0240"/>to make a proposal of this nature. It is completely clear that this a very sensible Budget and I think that it will be seen in this light by South Africa.</p>

<p>In its reaction to the Budget, Assocom asks for the purposeful training of our labour force. This has also been requested repeatedly here this afternoon by the Opposition. But if there is any Government which is moving absolutely purposefully in this connection, it is this very Government. I want to point out that the real increase in wages for the year 1974, as against 1973, was 4% in respect of all population groups. The increase of the wage of the non-White workers alone was over 9%. In addition to that, opportunities are being created which assure all sections of the population of work. I refer especially to that part of the Budget speech of the hon. the Minister in which he said that although the number of registered unemployed persons increased slightly after August, it is still very small. Let us compare this position with that of foreign countries. Here in South Africa the hon. the Minister tells us officially that we have practically no unemployment and that the number of unemployed persons who are registered, is very small. One should compare with this the United States of America where seven or eight million people are unemployed, about 7% of its total labour force. Austrialia&#x2019;s figure of 3,5% is the highest in 40 years. Germany shows an increase in one year of 250% In Denmark, in one year, there was an increase of 110%. In France the increase was 50%. One should compare that with the position we have in this happy, flourishing and prosperous South Africa. Then we accept the risks which are attached to this. We accept that we might not even be able to maintain this growth rate of 4,5%, but in that phase of the business cycle in which we are living and in which we have to consolidate and prepare for the upsurge which is coming, it will not be disastrous.</p>

<p>In the time at my disposal there is something else I want to mention. I want to say that recently&#x2014;it has already been mentioned here this afternoon&#x2014;a great deal of criticism has been expressed by the private sector. It is being alleged that there is too much State control. In fact, in an article I read recently the Government is openly accused of bureaucracy in this connection. I read in <i>The Star</i> of 19 March of a speech made by Mr. C. R. Bisschoff of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut in which he supposedly said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that State participation and control of the economy is going too far.</block>

<p>Sir, when these things are said, and especially when they are said by Afrikaans businessmen, they enjoy tremendous prominence. This varies from the rubbish which is sometimes written by &#x201C;Ferdinand&#x201D; of <i>Tegniek</i> to the assertions of many responsible businessmen. This criticism is aimed in particular at the activities of the State corporations, linked with the allegation that politics prescribes to economics, to a large extent. As far as State corporations are concerned, I do not think that we need to argue with each other about the right of such corporations to exist in the public interest. Good examples have been mentioned here: Escom, Iscor, IDC, etc. My present task. Sir, is not to hold out the prospect of demarcation of the functions and activities of State corporations either. Effective machinery has already been created in this connection, viz. the Standing Advisory Committee on State Competition. As far as the allegation that politics prescribes to economics is concerned, I just want to say that these State corporations are indeed linked to the implementation of the political motive. Therefore, it is logical that their functions will be prescribed to a very great extent by the political motive. After all, it is the practical implementation of Government policy which is concerned here. It is, in fact, the purpose and the reason for their creation, viz. to create the necessary capital structure in this connection. This concern is also expressed by economists who say that the economic discipline does not carry enough weight in the running of our country. Sir, I want to allege that the reverse of that is also true, viz. that orderly discipline, in the implementation of Government policy, is sometimes totally disregarded and negated by the economy. Therefore, if it is advanced, as is being done, that we should approach these problems in co-ordination and in co-operation with emphasis on the hard economic facts, then I say that it is indeed true, but that the emphasis should also fall on the hard political facts with which we are concerned in this country. Therefore, although I am appreciative of the achievements of the economy, although I accept that the economy is important, I say that when one determines one&#x2019;s priorities, the <span class="col_3655-3656" refersTo="page_0241"/>running of one&#x2019;s country is priority number one, and this is followed by the economy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have listened with some interest and perhaps a degree of impatience to the arguments of hon. members on that side of the House. Sir, we are engaged here in a debate dealing with the Budget, not as an arithmetic exercise, but essentially as an instrument of policy, and it is as an instrument of policy and with regard to its effectiveness as an instrument of policy that it needs to be judged. A Budget is a very powerful mechanism. It is perhaps the most powerful mechanism that the Government has in its possession in order to direct the economy, in order to create an equilibrium between the ups and downs of trade cycles, and generally to produce conditions in which the economy of the country will flourish for the benefit of all the citizens of the country. It is most important that a Budget should ensure that there is stability of money in relation to prices and that this relationship or this equilibrium of money and prices should exist in conditions of adequate employment. Sir, in all these respects we find that this Budget is entirely inadequate. It does not touch these essential qualities; it does not attempt to meet these essential needs, and I find myself in total agreement with the hon. member for Constantia when he condemns the Budget on three main grounds. Sir, it has done nothing to contain inflation; it has done nothing, or very little, to relieve people of the burden of inflation, and it has done very little to promote growth. I propose to deal with these three items and to show exactly in what respects the Government has failed and to give some examples of its more extravagant failures. But before doing this I would like to refer again to the dangers of inflation. We have heard speeches here today from hon. members on that side, and not least from the hon. member for Ermelo, who talk of inflation in the sense of gardeners discussing the irrigation of their gardens, when in fact there is a tidal wave coming along that is liable to wipe out the entire agricultural plan. Inflation is the most destructive factor in our economy today. It will destroy our economic, our social and eventually our political system if something is not done to control this terrible scourge that is eroding our wealth and our prospects for the future. It is impossible, Sir, to state too seriously, to underline too heavily, the nature of the danger which, our economy faces. But here we have this casual approach to inflation as though it were nothing of very great importance. Even the hon. the Minister uses words such as these; he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Inflation in South Africa remains an unsatisfactory characteristic of the economic situation.</block>

<p>Sir, this is a most masterly understatement. Of course inflation is an unsatisfactory characteristic. He does not say, however, that it is a scourge, that it is a destroyer, that it is going to wipe out our way of life and indeed possibly our civilization in this country unless it is brought under control. That, Sir, is the measure of the danger. It is not merely an unsatisfactory feature. We find that recently certain conservative businessmen directing conservative firms have started using the kind of language which we on these benches have used consistently for the last three years since inflation started running its devastating course. I quote from a statement made by one of these gentleman this last weekend&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Inflation at a mild level is at best a capricious and unfair method of redistribution of wealth, harming the aged, the poor and the weak in bargaining power as well as the independent middle-class people who are economically the most responsible in a free society.</block>

<p>Sir, this is what is done by inflation running mildly, but&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Inflation, when it gets out of hand, becomes a most vicious destroyer of economic, social and political norms, in the process ruining whole classes of people at different economic and social levels. The reason why nothing was being done by Governments and business to stem the tide was that for the first two decades after World War II inflation went hand in hand with what appeared to be a genuine and continuous increase in prosperity to the more vocal and powerful sections of the population.</block>

<p>Sir, the more vocal and powerful sections of the population sit in this very House. They have been vocal and powerful; they have in fact based it on the splendid Budgets <span class="col_3657-3658" refersTo="page_0242"/>produced by the Minister of Finance while inflation gathered for the spring, while inflation gathered for its destructive task. What we see now, Sir, is not the first phase of inflation described by Mr. Van der Horst of the Old Mutual and which merely destroys the means of distribution of wealth; we are in the stage of hyperinflation where the social, economic and political system is being destroyed. Sir, this is the measure of inflation.</p>

<p>I want to come now to a few examples of the way in which this very grave problem is being handled in order to illustrate that the Government does not in fact have the measure of the danger. The first point I want to raise is that of the control of the oil situation. Sir, I believe that the oil problem in South Africa has been most clumsily and inefficiently handled, and I use these words in measured terms; it has been clumsily and inefficiently handled. When the oil crisis first arose it was seen briefly as a crisis of supply. It was believed that a situation had arisen in the Middle East in which the oil taps would be closed and the West would be deprived of its oil, and none the more so than South Africa for certain political reasons. At that time, very briefly, it appeared to be true and there was in fact some truth in it. We had reason to accept that a crisis of that nature had arisen. However, it became clear over the succeeding months that the crisis was not a crisis of supply or of quantity; it was a crisis of price. The crisis which the West now faces is not that of a shortage of oil; it is a shortage on balance of payments. Sir, this is the nature of the oil crisis, and if one does not understand that, there is no remedy for any country against the oil crisis. This is what it is about. Now, the public of South Africa were in fact called upon to make a patriotic contribution, to help save South Africa from the shortage of oil, from the alleged boycott.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I said it in the past tense. There was a boycott, but it is now little more than an alleged boycott, because oil is pretty freely available. However, the public have never been fully informed by this Government or taken into the confidence of the Government as to the real nature of the oil crisis as it now exists. The public has had to suffer the imposition by the Government of a series of punitive measures, a series of threats, a series of compulsions, to oblige it to save oil and petrol in support of an attitude or a policy or an explanation that is no longer valid. I believe there has been a complete breakdown in communications between the Government and the public. The Department of Information, which should have played a major role if this thing is important, and I believe it is important, broke down completely and it has not in fact informed the public of the true nature of the crisis. The true nature of the crisis, Sir, in simple words is this, that the more you waste oil and petrol the higher you push inflation; the more you disrupt the balance of payments, the more difficult you make it for this Government to contain the economic disorder which is growing through, inflation. Now, if it were put to the public in these terms, then it would surely be obvious to the public that they could make a real contribution and that it would be worth while making that contribution. I believe, Sir, that the public is fed up with the Government&#x2019;s handling of this thing. It is not playing ball with, the Government any more since it knows that the Government has not played a straight game with it. This last Easter we had scenes of the pre-OPEC slaughter on our roads. It is a fact that the public is driving fast; it is driving recklsssly and it is wasting petrol and oil at a time when we cannot afford it. I would be the first to support this Government if it tried to control the situation by rational and fair dealing. It will not succeed by creating animosity in the minds of the public. It will not succeed if it alienates the public. The public simply does not believe that there is not enough petrol available to enable it to motor at speed.</p>

<p>I say that your system has broken down. The public are not co-operating with you; you have played this thing entirely wrongly and it serves you right because you should have realized that the problem was of a different nature. [Interjections.] Now, if we look at the statistical tables, on which in parenthesis I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and the Ministry of Finance because <span class="col_3659-3660" refersTo="page_0243"/>they are extremely well presented, we find that in the composition of our imports, our consumption, that part of our consumption which relates to oil, petrol and greases, is about 3% of the total. Now, the costs of these imports have increased. They have increased by about R100 million in the past year. Sir, if one allows for natural growth, the natural tendency to grow, consistent with what happened in previous years, the actual increase is of the order of R50 million. Now, in terms of the order of money the Government talks about, this is not a great deal, but nevertheless it is important in relation to our balance of payments and it is certainly important in relation to our cost of living, that is to say, imported inflation. I believe that the Government has the entire thing out of proportion. It should deal with this matter on its merits. It should instruct and inform the public as to what the real nature of the problem is and it should enlist the co-operation of the public. Maybe then we will not have the kind of slaughter caused by irresponsible and wanton drivers we saw during the past Easter weekend. In so far as the Government&#x2019;s attitude is concerned, I believe it has been wrong in logic, costly in method, clumsy in execution and disastrous in the result</p>

<p>I come now to another aspect of the Government&#x2019;s policy. I come to the question of the lack of skilled labour. I believe that at this stage in our debate nobody will question any longer that one of the major causes of inflation in South Africa is in fact low productivity. This is surely common ground now on both sides of the House. Low productivity is caused very largely by the inadequacy of skilled labour. In fact, the two terms are virtually synonymous. Sir, if one reads the Economic Development Plan, there is eloquent reference throughout to the grave problems that will be caused if in fact there is not full employment and the employment, in particular, of skilled, properly trained labour. On this rest our plans for the future. On this rest our hopes for a prosperous future in South Africa which is essential to d&#x00E9;tente, to peace and to progress. Sir, what has this Budget done about this particular problem&#x003F; We know from the Economic Development Plan and from the figures of the Department of Statistics that the population of South Africa is already over 25 million people and that it will be 50 million people within 25 years. If we have 50 million people in this country, as we will, we will need at least 5 million skilled people to occupy the main managerial, technical and other jobs of that calibre&#x2014;5 million to serve 50 million in skilled jobs. The White population will be 6 million, of whom at best 2 million can be economically active. Let us assume that the whole 2 million will in fact be in top managerial jobs. This still leaves 3 million skilled jobs to be filled by Black and Brown people, managerial jobs, technical jobs, scientific jobs and professional jobs. These will have to be filled by Black and Brown people. So we will need 3 million such people by the year 2000. Let us assume that their age at their highest level of productivity is 40 years by the year 2000. What age are those people now, in 1975&#x003F; They are already 15 years old if they are going to be 40 years old in the year 2000. Sir, how many people. Black and Brown, of 15 years of age in South Africa at present, are provided with facilities for secondary education and for technical education&#x003F; That is the measure of the problem and I recommend that every member on that side of the House should go home tonight and think about it, because unless that demand is met South Africa will not be able to meet the demands of her population, she will not meet the rising expectations of her people, she will not meet the economic demands and she will not in fact meet the economic development plan.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>It is all very well for hon. members at that end of the House to say &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;, but it is equally easy for me to prove this. I have done so before in this House and I can do it again. To put it very briefly on this occasion I shall put it as a proposition, which I challenge anybody on that side of the House to contradict, that the diversion of scarce and valuable means in this country into areas of low yield is inflationary. Is there anybody on that side of the House who is prepared to stand up and contradict <span class="col_3661-3662" refersTo="page_0244"/>the statement that the investment of valuable and scarce means, the investment of hard earned money, in areas of low yield is inflationary&#x003F; Surely, that is a contention that nobody can deny. It is simple economic fact. If we look at the kind of investment which is going on, the quantities invested and the kind of yield that is coming from that investment, then we have, in fact, before us living and visible proof that the implementation of apartheid in this country is inflationary. Let us take the example of the Transkei. It was stated this weekend over the radio&#x2014;it comes from the SABC and therefore it must be correct &#x2014;[Interjections.]&#x2014;that the Xhosa Development Corporation have announced that if private enterprise played its full part in the investments planned for the Transkei, then the additional employment opportunities to be created in the Transkei would be 80 000 extra jobs in two decades. This is official&#x2014;SABC. If that is not a low rate of return, then I have yet to hear of one, because if we turn to the Economic Development Plan, we find that the figures of people requiring employment are infinitely higher than the kind or the order of figure which I have just quoted. We find that the economic development plan is now demanding that there should be a growth rate of 6,4% per annum in this country in order, not just that South Africa should survive economically, but in order that sufficient jobs will be created to maintain social order and progress in South Africa. We have heard people boasting of 3,5% and even 5,5% which is, in fact, what we have produced over the past 10 years, but we expect a fall in the next year. But we have got to maintain&#x2014;not just achieve at the peaks but maintain&#x2014;a growth rate of 6,4% in this country in order to achieve the minimum requirements imposed by the economic development plan.</p>

<p>These are the things which cause one to wonder what exactly this Budget is about. The Budget has not touched on these problems; it does not mention them. There is no provision whatsoever in the Budget to remedy these matters. Where are we going&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to deal with yet another aspect. Let us look at the exchange rates policy of the Government. The hon. the Minister says he is very happy that we have a strong rand and that the rand is doing the job that we should expect of it. I have been looking at some of the figures. The first remark I want to make is that according to the figures in the <i>Statistical Survey</i> the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada combined&#x2014;that is the dollar and sterling areas&#x2014;now take one-third of our exports and export to us one-third of our imports; in other words, one-third in and one-third out. For a number of years our currency had been tied to sterling and then it was tied to the dollar. We have allowed the rand to fluctuate helplessly in a kind of financial colonialistic relationship, first with sterling and then with the dollar&#x2014; with the currencies of countries which, in fact, have a declining trade with South Africa. It is perfectly true that this happened after the Smithsonian Agreement had been entered into. However, since then we have tied our rand to a mixed bag of currencies. We have what is now, euphemistically called managed floating. The effect of managed floating has been that during the past couple of years the rand has been moving steadily down. It is true that there were a few minor upward adjustments, but the net effect has been to move down.</p>

<p>We find now that our trade with the European Common Market, the EEC countries, has moved up to something like 32,4%. We bought 32,4% of all our requirements from the EEC countries, that is from the Western European countries. The rand in relation to the currencies of those countries has been growing steadily weaker.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>No, Britain is not included. According to your own statistical tables Britain is excluded from the EEC complex mentioned here. I have used the tables produced by the Department of Finance. The EEC countries, excluding Britain, now send us 32,4% of our imports. This is an increase of 60% compared with 1973. The EEC is now the biggest source of South African imports. Therefore, the relationship of the rand to the EEC currencies is most important if we are concerned about importing goods for South Africa at reasonable prices. Obviously, if the rand is weak in relation to the Deutsche mark, is weak in relation to the French franc, is weak in relation to the Swiss franc, as it is, then we are paying very high prices for goods which comprise 32,4% of our imports from abroad. Why is this happening&#x003F; We know that only last week again the Reserve Bank <span class="col_3663-3664" refersTo="page_0245"/>announced a further weakening of the rand against the dollar. Why&#x003F; Because the dollar suddenly shown an upsurge, it had grown stronger against the European currencies.</p>

<p>Instead of accepting that this strengthens the rand against European currencies that if we move up with the dollar we shall be buying 32,4% of our imports more cheaply from Europe, we panicked immediately and dropped the value of the rand by 1,34%, thereby, of course, weakening the rand once again against the Deutsche mark, against the French franc, and against the Swiss franc and so on, thereby increasing the cost of goods in South Africa and assisting inflation to make yet furthere strides ahead. I want to ask the hon. the Minister when he replies to tell us please what the basis is of this managed currency. How does the managed float work&#x003F; What is the percentage of the dollar, the pound sterling and the European currencies in this mixed basket of currencies&#x003F; It seems to us that this managed float is something like a lottery run in Pretoria. It seems to us to be a very arbitrary thing. Why is it that if the dollar moves up, shall we say 1&#x00BD;%, and other currencies do not move up equally because the dollar has grown stronger in relation to them, the rand should then be weakened by approximately the same amount&#x003F; After all, we are supposed to be dealing with a basket of currencies. We are supposed to be dealing with a selection of currencies and I would have assumed that this selection of currencies would have been weighted roughly according to our trade with the countries concerned. This is the only kind of valid weighting that would make sense. We would like to know some more about this. What are the percentages&#x003F; Why are these sudden adjustments made&#x003F; What is the end purpose of all this&#x003F; Are the percentages, that is to say, the currency components of this basket of currencies, changed arbitrarily on each occasion or are they in fact constant&#x003F; We would like to know how this thing works, because it seems to us to be a most extraordinary procedure.</p>

<p>I have a number of other things I would like to raise the hon. the Minister, but my time is short. First of all, I would like to deal with the second point raised by the hon. member for Constantia, and that is that the Government has done so little to relieve the hardships of inflation. We would have hoped that this Budget would at least have made some attempt to relieve the impact of inflation on those who were hardest hit. I have spoken in this House before on the merit of some degree of indexation. I do not refer to indexation as a universal practice, because I know that indexation as a universal practice will not in fact cure inflation. Nevertheless, I look upon it as a means of relieving the hardship on taxpayers who, because of the falling value of the currency, are in fact seeking higher salaries and are being paid higher salaries. As they move into these nominally higher salaries which have the same original real value as was the case a few years before, and into higher tax brackets they are pursued by the tax collector to the extent that they are paying ever higher proportions of their salary into the hands of the tax collector. Inflation linked to a fiscal policy of this kind, gives a most marvellous free ride for the Treasury. It means that inflation pays the Treasury, inflation is the Treasury&#x2019;s best friend. Here we have a secret kind of taxation since no laws have to be passed and one does not have to come to Parliament to impose new taxes. The Government merely rides on the back of inflation. I believe that some degree of indexation to protect the taxpayer is now necessary and we would like to see this. We greatly regret the fact that there is no mention of this in the Budget.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to subsidies for the low income groups, food subsidies in particular. We have a cost-of-living index which consists of various components. For the ordinary well-to-do person, the person with a moderate income in this country, food is but a modest proportion&#x2014;I do not know the exact figure, let us say 20%&#x2014;of the total weighted cost-of-living figure. Black people, Brown people and very often even White people, pensioners for example, spend up to 75% of their income on food. We all know that food prices are the biggest component of a cost-of-living increase. The major contributor to high costs in the cost-of-living index is foodstuffs. Therefore the person who is being hit hardest by the rising cost of living is, in fact, the poor man. He is spending almost the whole of his income on basic foodstuffs to keep alive. I believe that a subsidy on these basic foodstuffs, including bread, milk wheat, etc., has now become an indisputable necessity. We find it astonishing that this Budget does not seriously even look at that possibility.</p>

<p>There will be an opportunity during this parliamentary session to go very fully into that question.</p>

<p>I have very little time left and I still want to refer to the question of growth. This is the third missing factor in the Budget equation. Geoffrey Crowther in his book <i>An Outline of Money</i> points out that inflation is usually associated with rising activity, and employment and deflation with the reverse. The association, however, is not an absolute one. It is possible to have rising activity and employment, for which we may use the word recovery, without inflation, and we can have inflation without recovery. In fact, in South Africa we now have the highest inflation in our history and we also have a falling growth rate. We have got the worst of both worlds. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. J. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at this stage I do not intend following up on the arguments of the hon. member for Von Brandis, although I shall also, in the course of my speech, touch upon most of the matters which he raised and shall probably contradict him on quite a number of points.</p>

<p>I believe that we have a Budget before us today which was drawn up in the interests of this country and its people. When one has to assess a Budget, one has to apply certain norms. In my opinion these norms may be academically financial or politically financial. In fact, I am of the opinion that the speaker who has just resumed his seat assessed the Budget primarily from a politically financial point of view. When it is alleged that the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development is geared to inflation, I say that it is a purely politically financial view. Before one passes judgment, one has to consider the local economic background against which a Budget is drawn up, and subsequently the international economic background. In general, I would say that the hon. the Minister of Finance had a tremendous task when he drew up this Budget because certain accepted economic principles simply do not hold good any more in our modern times. I want to mention examples of this. The first is that it has always been an accepted principle that in times of inflationary conditions the economy did not have to contend with unemployment. What do we find today&#x003F; We find an alarming situation of unemployment in most of the Western countries. We are linkeed to the international economy and what is happening in the U.S.A. or in Europe today, could therefore happen in our country as well. This is a phenomenon we have to take into consideration when we examine a Budget. I want to mention a further example. A recession has always been accompanied by surpluses, a decline in demand and drop in prices. What do we find, in 1975, in the international sphere&#x003F; We find that there are shortages of raw materials, and that import prices are continuing to rise. We could quote further examples of economic anomalies which exist today. These are questions with which economists throughout the entire world are struggling and to which answers have by no means been found yet. Nor do I think that any hon. member on the opposite side of the House who spoke today gave us any answers whatsoever to these problems.</p>

<p>This is the international background against which the hon. the Minister had to draw up his Budget. One could also say that he had to contend with international pessimism concerning the world economy. When one reads economic periodicals, when one studies economic journals from abroad, one sees there is almost no doubt that the spirit abroad in respect of economic conditions is one of pessimism. Countries are struggling with balance of payments problems which, as we know, arose from the shock which was caused by the quadrupling of oil prices, which in its turn paralysed production in many countries. In this way, for example, there was a negative growth rate of 2,2% in the U.S. last year, while a developed country such as Germany was only able to maintain a growth rate of 4 %. Balance of payments problems as a result of the instability of monetary units is a factor which has to be taken into account. People who occupy responsible positions are grabbing at the proverbial straw to solve this problem. On 25 March 1975 an article appeared in which it was reported that Senator Barry Goldwater of the United States had made an appeal to his Government to restore the dollar to the old <span class="col_3667-3668" refersTo="page_0247"/>gold standard for the sake of economic stability. After America had left the gold standard as long ago as 1933 and very little attention had probably been given since then to a return to the gold standard, Senator Barry Goldwater comes forward in 1975 and says: &#x201C;Let us return to the old gold standard; perhaps this will bring us economic stability.&#x201D; This is proof that the world is seeking solutions to its economic problems. It is doubtful whether the appeal made by Senator Goldwater will meet with much approval, but it is nevertheless a demonstration to us of the search for stability in the economic sphere. The economic leaders of the world are facing the problem of inflation on the one hand and recession on the other, and what is good for the one is harmful to the other. It is against this background of international economy that the hon. the Minister had to draw up his Budget.</p>

<p>When we consider the national background, it is a fact that the hon. the Minister, in drawing up this Budget, has to take certain economic facts into consideration. For example, he had to take into consideration that we are not isolated in the economic world. He also had to take the specific problems of South Africa into consideration. This is what he did. In addition, he had to take into consideration that the defence and the protection of our national borders is of the utmost importance. For that purpose a large amount was appropriated for defence. This is something in regard to which we have no quarrel with the hon. members on that side. But the hon. the Minister also had to take into consideration the fact that South Africa is a developing country with a great future, provided the necessary infrastructure is established. We need great projects in this country and we are in fact working on great projects. We are safeguarding the economic future of this country. That is why it was necessary to make provision for the financing of a great new project such as that of the second Sasol. Hence the priorities, as he clearly stated them.</p>

<p>As regards the first priority of the hon. the Minister, namely defence, hon. members opposite do not differ with us. As regards his second priority, there is, however, a difference of opinion between this side and that side of the House. The cry of the Opposition is that production should be stimulated. We are not opposed to that; It is simply that the Government wants to do this in a responsible manner, responsible in the sense that a Budget is not drawn up for one year only. The principle of budgeting for longer periods has been recognized by economists for many years. Years ago Prof. Jacob Viner said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a mouldy fallacy that, regardless of circumstances, the Government must balance its Budget in each year.</block>

<p>This Budget is a Budget for the future of South Africa. It is also a triumph for and the confirmation of the National Party Government&#x2019;s policy for South Africa over 27 years.</p>

<p>Let us consider the figures for our gross domestic product. In 1964 it was R7 209 million and in 1974 it was R22 382 million. Let us consider our real gross domestic product <i>per capita</i>: In 1964 it was R366 and in 1974 it was R477. Let us consider private consumer spending. In 1964 it was R4 463 million, and in 1974 R12 963 million. The Government has ensured over the years, and has done so this year as well, that the structure of private consumer spending remains in equilibrium. It is important that private consumer spending remains in equilibrium. In 1964 the nation spent 10,4% of its total consumption on durable goods. Ten years later, in 1974, he percentage was 10,2%. As far as semi-durable goods are concerned, the nation spent 17,9% in 1964 and 17,6% in 1974. On non-durable goods the nation spent 42,9% in 1964 and 42,7% in 1974. On services 28,9% was spent in 1964 and 29,4% in 1974. It is a responsible Government which ensures this equilibrium in the spending of a nation.</p>

<p>What picture does our foreign trade present&#x003F; Firstly, the constant upward tendency in the export graph is a triumph for the National Party Government. Unfortunately it is also true that our volume of imports has increased&#x2014;and if I may say so has increased excessively&#x2014;but there are reasons for this and these have already been indicated. We have already been given the reasons for the high import rate. There was, for example the enormous increase in the import price of fuel, and there was the increased prices of other imported goods as a result of inflationary conditions abroad. What I find to be particularly important, in the present situation is that our volume of exports to the African states, which I regard as the natural market for South Africa&#x2019;s products, increased from <span class="col_3669-3670" refersTo="page_0248"/>R113,9 million in 1964 to R451 million in 1974. It is an achievement for the National Party to have succeeded, in spite of a hostile world and in spite of all the problems, in increasing our volume of exports, particularly to the African states, in this way.</p>

<p>The National Party Government takes good care of South Africa and its people. This, taking good care of South Africa and its people, is the principal requirement in regard to a Budget and a financial policy. The hon. member for Ermelo referred to the amounts which are being apportioned in the Budget to the various sectors, and I therefore do not want to repeat this. I want to state today that the country&#x2019;s citizens are proud to be able to pay tax. Economists and politicians are agreed that although taxation is usually seen as a nuisance, something we do not like&#x2014;no taxation is ever popular&#x2014;it nevertheless engenders a measure of pride in the payer that he is a citizen of a country and is able to pay tax.</p>

<p>The combating of inflation is a matter for each one of us and not only a matter for the Government. There are many ways in which each citizen and each business concern, each entrepreneur, in this country could combat inflation. The recent Easter week-end proved to be another revelation of how extravagantly our people live, how they drive on our roads and how much money they spend. It was worse than Christmas. Saving is the only way in which capital may be created. If we have a task, then it is to encourage our people to save, and it is possible to save in spite of the high cost of living.</p>
