<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. D. TERBLANCHE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned yesterday I was replying to what the hon. members opposite had said. While the hon. member for Newton Park was becoming vehement about the price of bread yesterday, I wondered what his party would have done in similar circumstances. I think they would do what the Filipinos do. Every time it has become necessary to increase the price of bread in the Philippines, they have reduced the size of the loaf a little. That makes it unnecessary to increase the price of bread. The Filipinos have been following this line of action until they have now reduced the loaf by half. Half a loaf of bread ought to suit the half an Opposition sitting here in front of us rather well; an Opposition of half-truths. I do not think they deserve more than half a loaf of bread for their share in developing the economy of South Africa.</p>

<p>Yesterday, while listening to the speeches made by members of the Opposition on inflation, they reminded me of the Hollander who wanted to escape from inflation. He bought himself a wheelbarrow, went to the bank and said to the teller, &#x201C;Please give me all my money in cash.&#x201D; He loaded his wheelbarrow with the cash and left. When he was passing the post office he decided to collect his mail and left his wheelbarrow outside the post office door. Upon his return the notes were still there but not the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia said yesterday that South Africa had a strong economy, which was not attributable to the efforts of this Government but to South Africa&#x2019;s resources. Surely this is a ridiculous statement to make. Had it not been for the enterprise and energy of this Government, these resources of South Africa would still have been unexploited today. How did the United Party not oppose the establishment of Sasol and Iscor? And today they want to know why there are not more Sasols. I still remember how the National Party met with a barrage of criticism, scepticism and suspicion-mongering at the time that Sasol was announced.</p>

<p>South Africa is grateful that it gained a Government in 1948 which stood for &#x201C;South Africa first!&#x201D; and which left no stone unturned in its efforts to develop South Africa&#x2019;s resources to the full. In the 26 years which have elapsed since then, the National Party has developed South Africa into an economic giant in Africa and into a country which is able to take its place among the leading countries of the world. While the Opposition very often sat in sackcloth and ashes along the way, this Government was planning and undertaking projects with glowing enthusiasm and contagious optimism without its ever losing confidence in the future of South Africa.</p>

<p>The courageous struggle waged by the previous hon. Minister of Finance to win for gold its rightful place in the monetary world economy was disparaged and ridiculed by members of the Opposition in this hon. House at one stage. When the present hon. Minister of Finance predicted two years ago in the Other Place that the price of gold would rise to $80&#x2014;and you must bear in mind that the price was only $40 at that time&#x2014;he was derided by the Opposition in the Other Place. And today gold is fetching $180 and more. Now we want to know from the Opposition whether they <span class="col_1095-1096" refersTo="page_0563"/>are still laughing. No, they are no longer laughing, but the people of South Africa are laughing at them because their faith was so weak. The people have reason to laugh at them for just look at what remains of the once proud party of Gen. Smuts. Gen. Smuts would turn in his grave were he to see what they have done to his proud party.</p>

<p>Prior to 26 May 1948 the United Party and its allies had 107 seats in this House. How many of them are sitting here today? One must take a count every day to know what the latest figure is. It really seems as if there is something that is whisking them away at night. They are sitting here today, a pathetic Opposition party consisting of only 37 members. I hope I am correct in saying 37, for I have not yet read the newspaper this afternoon.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia said South Africa&#x2019;s strong economy was not attributable to the Government; but I want to ask the hon. member what his party&#x2019;s contribution was to the development of South Africa&#x2019;s economy. While the National Government was creating golden years of prosperity and peace for South Africa, they were being consumed by fraternal strife. They have squandered 26 years on quarrels without their having anything to show for it but half a dozen or more unsuccessful policies, and yesterday we heard of yet another one. [Interjection.] This Opposition has never had a share in the great adventure in which the National Government is engaged in this country. The Opposition stands accused before the people of South Africa for not having done its share as the official Opposition to develop South Africa&#x2019;s economy. It stand accused of always having been a drag as a result of the fact that it has squandered a quarter of a century on internal strife. Here we have the official Opposition today, surrounded by its splinters, which continue to be a thorn in its flesh. And the end is not yet in sight. It still has people in its ranks who render it impossible for the Opposition to have any permanent guarantee of peace. Sir, I just want to say this to the hon. member for Constantia: This Government deserves full credit for the favourable conditions in this country. South Africa is in the particularly fortunate position of having virtually no unemployment, not even among unskilled workers, and this, Sir, while unemployment is assuming alarming proportions in other countries. This Government must get full credit for these favourable conditions. It sets about one major undertaking after another with courage and vision. Sir, according to estimates approximately R250 000 million will be spent in the next five to six years on the most important capital projects in the Republic. Sir, this is a breathtaking figure. This money will be spent on Sasols, Foscors, Iscors, Escoms, television, etc., and this amount does not even include the capital expenditure of the Railways and the Post Office, which will spend approximately R150 000 million themselves. Sir, this is a sign of vigorous growth and prosperity. It cannot but be a strong stimulus for our economy. It will create work for everyone who wants to work. Sir, it brings prosperity and development; yes, it even brings d√©tente among the multiplicity of peoples within the borders of our country. Sir, South Africa&#x2019;s vigorous economy is of the utmost importance to us at this time. To us it has become one of the strongest instruments for making break-throughs to the outside world, building bridges to other countries and making friends. The peace offensive of the hon. the Prime Minister has already opened numerous economic doors in Southern Africa to the Republic&#x2014;we thank him for that&#x2014;and more will come. Sir, I foresee a burgeoning trade with the countries of Southern Africa. Yesterday the hon. member for Constantia said in this regard: &#x201C;I think that we in this country must back the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s efforts to establish political co-operation in Southern Africa with real effort also to establish economic co-operation.&#x201D; Now I should like to put this question to the hon. member for Constantia: Why did he vote against the amendment of the hon. the Prime Minister in the no-confidence debate? The very thing the hon. the Prime Minister asked for in that amendment was the promotion of good relations among peoples, and surely this is exactly what the hon. member was asking for here? But the hon. member and his party allowed this wonderful opportunity to pass, this wonderful opportunity they had of demonstrating their attitude in this regard actively and earnestly. Sir, only one of them had the courage not to vote against the amendment and that is the hon. member for Yeoville who walked out and, Sir, had to pay for it: he was kicked out of his party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, international trade is becoming the corner-stone of co-operation <span class="col_1097-1098" refersTo="page_0564"/>among countries to an increasing extent. Countries can no longer manage without one another, particularly in the sphere of trade. But I want to assert that the countries of Southern Africa have to look more to one another than any other countries have to do. There is no reason, Sir, why we cannot co-operate very closely with these people in the field of trade. It might not be far-fetched to repeat the optimism of Dr. the hon. Diederichs in this regard when he envisaged the creation of one great economic community in Southern Africa. Sir, at the present time we need optimum economic results in South Africa; we need exceptional economic achievements and sacrifices. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on this occasion I will not deal with financial and economic matters. I should like also to be permitted not to respond to questions in view of the shortness of time available to me. Sir, I speak from the most junior section of the back benches, relegated from my position in this House, stripped of my office as the chief Opposition spokesman on finance, removed from my position of provincial chairman and expelled from a party that I had served for 27 years with body, with spirit and with my financial resources, like many of my erstwhile colleagues, and the question must be asked &#x201C;Why?&#x201D; The answer, Sir, is because I did not have it in my heart to vote against a proposal calling upon all South Africans to assist in improving race and international relations and commending the Government for those actions which have effected and will effect these improvements. Mr. Speaker, I have no regrets, as I abstained from voting on a sincere evaluation of the wording of a resolution which was in accordance with what I had stated in this House only the previous day. Mr. Speaker, South Africa offered me a home when I was a child and had none. It has been more than kind to me, and I have tried to repay that debt and have served it to the best of my ability and in accordance with my beliefs. I will continue to do so as far as I am able. The Prime Minister may feel that he needs to help to remove discrimination and to improve our international relations, but the least that we can do is not to obstruct him, nor to play petty politics. Opposition politicians in particular, in times which are crucial in the country&#x2019;s history, have a responsible role to play, and their words and actions can do immeasurable harm both internally and externally. We want discrimination removed but, Sir, we do not care who does it or who gets the credit. It is in the interest of our people, who come first. Sir, what is more important, that the plight of millions of Black people be improved because the Government need fear no backlash, or that a debating point be scored in this House or a few politicians&#x2019; careers placed in jeopardy? We who sit in these benches and those who followed us in other legislative bodies and councils are content to risk careers in the hope that our actions will bring about some consciousness that in crucial times such as these the old sterile political debate must end and that a new approach to South Africa&#x2019;s problems must be adopted. I commend the hon. the Prime Minister again for his action in travelling to other parts of Africa. We do not know if his endeavours will succeed; we hope they will, but if they do not succeed, then at least he will have tried, and for that I commend him. Peace in Africa is necessary for our survival and whoever can bring it about should not be hindered. Our approach does not mean that we do not differ from the Government on other fundamental policies and ideologies and actions. Where we do, we will oppose the Government. This opposition is as much in South Africa&#x2019;s interest as the support we offer when they do what we believe is right. This is a fundamental belief of those of us who belong to the new Reform Party. Political divisions have in the past been based on a variety of grounds. The war issue created the United Party in its present form and the striving of the Afrikaner people the present Nationalist Party. The political divisions in South Africa are still historical and to a considerable extent artificial. There is no longer a need for a political party to be an Afrikaner-&#x201C;volksbeweging&#x201D; as the Afrikaner has established himself culturally, economically and in every other way, as he has been entitled to do. The war issue is today no longer relevant, though naturally it affects sentiment and old associations and loyalties, of which I am in no way contemptuous, and still keeps people in the United Party. But, we are now living in times where survival is at issue. There are broadly two approaches to the problems which face us at the present time. Firstly there are those who feel that the only hope is to stand <span class="col_1099-1100" refersTo="page_0565"/>firm on White privilege and domination. Every concession is regarded as a sign of weakness, in any case only to be made as a last resort. Secondly, there are those who wish to bring about an accommodation by peaceful means in terms of which all people, irrespective of colour or race, can live in security and in harmony. This, is the true political division in South Africa and which will come about in South African White politics. This is the choice, between enlightened and reactionary. What is significant, is that in the present political situation, the party divisions are not on this issue. The non-compromisers, who wrongly describe themselves as conservatives, are found in both the National Party and in the United Party. In the National Party there are those who regard changes, however limited they might be as the road to disaster, and they are kept in line by the benefits which they see in being in the party in power and by their adherence to the concept of belonging to what they consider to be the political wing of the Afrikaner national movement.</p>

<p>This latter fact also keeps in the National Party those who wish to move faster on the road of change. Those in the United Party who are anxious to find true and honourable accommodation&#x2014;and I say there are some who remain in that party who have that belief&#x2014;remain there out of personal allegiance to the leader, sometimes based on old comradeships, and in the hope that the road on which we helped to set the party in the last three years will be followed and that the verkramptes some of whom are believed to be negotiating with the National Party, will weaken and will seek to join the Nationalist Party. And the latter is not unlikely in respect of some people as you may believe. Those who seek peaceful co-existence and accommodation in all the political parties might differ on the method of achieving it but they all agree on the final objective which eliminates discrimination, ensures respect for human dignity, creates equality of opportunity, permits the exercise of basic freedoms and allows all to exercise political rights in the determination of their own destiny.</p>

<p>Should this not be the political division in South Africa? Both major political parties, and particularly the United Party, at this crucial time of our history consist of people of irreconcilable views kept together by lip-service to carefully phrased aims and principles, vague policy statements, personal ambitions and other issues such as personality adherence irrespective of policy. [Interjections.] We believe that if South Africa is to be put on the right road, the verligtes in all political parties should seek to come together. No one can claim the monopoly of infallibility; no one can claim that he has all the answers. There can be good in the ideas of all sincere individuals that in fact an accommodation can be found for all races, or call them nations, in South Africa, found, however, not alone by Whites and imposed by them on others, but arrived at together with Black, Coloured and Indian people. Enforced solutions cannot be effective in the long term. Only agreed and just solutions can bring lasting peace.</p>

<p>We believe, therefore, that despite our present small numbers in this House we can act as a catalyst to bring enlightened, sincere thinkers who are free of anachronistic party bonds, together to work sincere to resolve the constitutional, social and economic problems which our country faces. We are willing to talk to any others, irrespective of their present party affiliations, who share with us these beliefs and will work together with them to find the solution. We seek no offices, we seek no benefits but wish to be free from reaction, free from the exploitation of colour prejudice and free from petty politics. If we can be a catalyst to bring enlightened people together, we will have served our purpose. We believe that there are sitting in this House and that there are hundreds of thousands outside, who think as we do and this is why, to discharge our duty, we cannot retire from the political scene. We who sit here, as well as our colleagues in the Senate, in the Transvaal Provincial Council and in the Johannesburg City Council and elsewhere had a choice. We could have retired from politics and to attend to our families and to our careers, but if we did this we felt that we would have failed in our duty. We know how difficult the road is. We face vituperation and abuse. But we have had it inside the United Party for so long; now it is outside in the open. Viciousness is nothing new to us. We know what our duty is and we will try to do it.</p>

<p>Let me now state what are the basic concepts of the Reformists. Firstly, there must be security through a genuine sharing. Secondly, there must be protection of civil liberties and the safe-guarding of the freedom of the individual. Thirdly, there must <span class="col_1101-1102" refersTo="page_0566"/>be equality of opportunity and the creation of conditions under which these will and can occur. Fourthly, there must be a removal of discrimination based on skin colour or race and a genuine removal of that discrimination, not a sham and not lip-service. Fifthly, we have a genuine love of our country and of all its people. Sixthly, we believe in not imposing policies on people but evolving them by consensus with all our people in this country. We will seek to be sincere and we will seek to be credible in putting forward our policies. We will avoid double talk and will seek to act as a catalyst for verligtes to act together to find a solution for our peoples&#x2019; future. We will always be available to act as a bridge between the races of South Africa and to ensure that dialogue never ceases.</p>

<p>May I now deal with a campaign which has been launched against us with its characteristics of smears and personality attacks and insinuations. Sir, they speak at closed meetings where Reformists cannot put their case. They seek to entice people back and hold them by promises of office in the Johannesburg city council. [Interjections.] They allege that there are no policy differences. These are all signs of desperateness, for by holding on to public representatives they hope to retain a grassroot support which they are losing like an avalanche.</p>

<p>I do not want to get involved in the mudslinging. I want to deal with the alleged lack of differences in the policy which there is. Let me give you some very clear examples. We have had talk of the federal policy and you will remember, Sir, that last year in this House the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was questioned by the hon. the Prime Minister on whether the White Parliament could disappear or whether the White Parliament should disappear. The hon. the Prime Minister, who had not forgotten his days as a lawyer, succeeded in extracting from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that it would disappear. That was on 9 August 1974. But it did not take until September 1974 for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to go on record by confirming &#x201C; &#x2019;n uiteensetting van partybeleid wat onverbeterlik is&#x201D;, when this was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Blanke-parlement mag verdwyn ingevolge die federale konsep van die party, maar dit is nie die beleid van die party dat dit sal verdwyn nie.</block>

<p>That was within days of speaking in this House and being questioned by the hon. the Prime Minister. Where do we go from there? We get the hon. member for Durban Point who is so anxious to say everything that can be said that he says it &#x2018;&#x2018;would&#x201D; disappear, it &#x201C;should&#x201D; disappear, it &#x201C;could&#x201D; disappear; and nobody knows in fact what the policy is. I want to say this to the members of the United Party: You talk about double talk and credibility in the United Party and you say that there are no differences of opinion in the United Party, but the whole country knows it; all of you who are sitting here know it, and yet you go on with the pretence and sham &#x2019;which has destroyed your credibility. [Interjections.] This is the truth of what you have done. You cannot pretend that there are no differences of opinion. You cannot pretend that in the United Party you speak with one voice. You call us high-jackers; you take our ideas, you take our labour, you take our money, and then you throw us out on technicalities and you speak of high-jacking. Mr. Speaker, they set out to destroy a cause by destroying men. They have forgotten that men may perish, but causes live on. We have been sent, so they believe, into the wilderness. But if they will read Isaiah, they will see that he said that the wilderness and the thirsty can be glad and that the desert may rejoice and burst into flower. Isaiah said: &#x201C;Say to the anxious, &#x2018;be strong and fear not&#x2019;.&#x201D; We will not fear and we will go ahead with the job which we see for ourselves in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have in my hand a Press cutting that appeared in <i>The Star</i> of 19 April 1974. That was a few days before the general election which was held last year. I shall just read a few short pieces from that Press cutting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At Bedford View last night, Mr. Schwarz put his political career at stake and challenged Mr. Vorster to do the same on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s prediction that he, Mr. Schwarz, would form a new party after the election.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Yeoville has given an adequate reply to that. He also said categorically that his party would seek to avoid double talk. This rings a bell. I seem to remember <span class="col_1103-1104" refersTo="page_0567"/>those words coming from him before. I think it was when he was elected leader of the United Party in the Transvaal. I also seem to remember that not very long after that he was again very hesitant to say certain things and that he was, in fact, accused in the Press of double talk. I trust that now that he is no longer provincial leader but the national leader of a party, he will be in a better position to carry out his undertaking not to make himself guilty of double talk. However, the question arises why the hon. member for Yeoville does not join the Progressive Party. If I remember correctly, it was the hon. member for Yeoville who enticed the hon. member for Edenvale to leave his job at a university and to come to the Transvaal to get a seat there. He was not the only one. Another person was also enticed to leave his job at a university and to stand for election, viz. the hon. member for Rondebosch.</p>

<p>I would certainly not. He was enticed by the hon. member for Yeoville to leave his job, but for some reason he must have decided that the United Party is too guilty of double talk and that he would rather join the Progressives. Now for some reason these blood brothers, viz. the hon. member for Edenvale, the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Rondebosch, are in fact in three different parties. The only opposition party that is not represented here&#x2014;at least not yet because I do not know what the court case in Umhlatuzana is going to lead to&#x2014;is the Democratic Party. We therefore have four opposition parties. These parties are all parties to the left. The Progressive Party can possibly be classified as the &#x201C;far left&#x201D;. To be kind, one can say that the Democratic Party can be classified as the &#x201C;reject left&#x201D;. Then&#x2014;I will put it very kindly&#x2014;we have the Reform Party which can be called the &#x201C;Schwarz left&#x201D;. Then we have the rest; they are &#x201C;what&#x2019;s left&#x201D;. But many of them will probably object to the term &#x201C;left&#x201D;. Some of them would probably like to see themselves as the conservative centre or even as the right. If they regard themselves as the right, the picture we have here is of an opposition on the march. What we would then hear is left &#x2026; left, right, left &#x2026; left, right, left &#x2026; Seriously, what is left of the four lefts of the Opposition, is no longer taken seriously by the electorate of South Africa. In fact, they are merely an anamoly in this House. The people of South Africa&#x2014;I am absolutely convinced of this&#x2014;have tremendous confidence in the National Party under the leaderhip of Mr. John Vorster.</p>

<p>I withdraw that, Mr. Speaker. Sir, this whole escapade is not finished yet. Here we have a situation where a member of the United Party&#x2014;I think he is still a member: probably until Tuesday of next week&#x2014;challenges the Prime Minister that he will resign his Senate seat if the Prime Minister appoints a Black man to fill the vacancy. If that is not a publicity stunt, I do not know what it is, because this member of the United Party knows full well that the Prime Minister does not fill seats in the Senate which are the responsibility of an electoral college. The Prime Minister appoints two Senators for each province and those positions have been filled. There is no vacancy. The member concerned is not one of those who was appointed by the Prime Minister. If he wants to make such a gesture and resign his seat in favour of a Black man, he must present that fact to the United Party&#x2019;s electoral college in Natal which put him there. If he is honest he must ask the hon. member for Durban Point who has just been described in <i>To the Point</i> as the joker of Parliament. He must ask the hon. member for Umhlatuzana if they would be prepared to nominate a Black person if he were to resign his seat.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Durban Point gave us an insight into the United Party&#x2019;s federal policy. Not only is this federal policy not being taken seriously by the other Opposition members and by this side of the House; it is going to be of historical interest only to collectors of Africana because it is only of academic interest whether they say that this Parliament will phase out or not. They will never be in a position to have to make that decision because it is a fact that under the conditions prevailing in South Africa, in Africa and in the world, it is evident that in any country consisting of many different nations, i.e. a multi-national country such as South Africa, the policy of separate development, of recognizing the human dignity of peoples and nations, has been proved undeniably to be the most effective and most stable policy to maintain peace and good relations. I seem to remember, in 1961, that the United Party claimed: This federal policy of Cyprus is our ideal. That was when Britain put forward that policy.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>It makes no difference even if it was Mr. Marais Steyn. He was the spokesman for the United Party at the time. He has since seen the light. I shall come back to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout presently. The United Party said that the federal policy in Cyprus was the ideal policy, in fact their policy. What did we have in Cyprus, however? We have had tension, occupation by the United Nations and war, and now Turkey has even intervened and conquered about 40% of the island of Cyprus and the Turks are thinking in terms of declaring their independence. A federal policy relating to minorities and majorities which differ inherently on national views and aims, will never succeed. The whole history of the world is littered with failures of federations consisting of such different peoples. For the United Party to say that they are serious in wanting to impose a federal system&#x2014;or a federal idea as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout calls it&#x2014;on the people of Southern Africa is an absolute fallacy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question? I want to ask the hon. member whether he will elaborate on how they are going to dispose of discrimination in their unitary system.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">V. A. VOLKER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s question first, before I come back to the Cyprus policy. The question of disposing of discrimination is a matter of the intention to dispose of those aspects that are hurtful to the dignity of individuals. That can be done, but to make an issue of the difference between discrimination and differentiation and to say that both will be abolished is an absolute figment of the imagination. Nowhere in the world, neither in the United States which officially opposes discrimination, nor in Britain or anywhere in the world will you find a lack of discrimination. There might be a lack of official discrimination, but discrimination is practised throughout the world by individuals. The most hurtful discrimination in this country is not discrimination that is official policy; it is discrimination which is effected by one individual towards another. It is the policy of this Government to try to do away with official discrimination that is hurtful to the dignity of human beings.</p>

<p>I shall not be distracted unnecessarily by a red herring, or is it a pink herring, coming from the source it has come.</p>

<p>Let me get back to the federation policy of the United Party. The United Party came with the idea that they wanted this Parliament as the White leadership organ which could in fact phase itself out after the United Party policy had been carried out. In their policy they make provision for four White Parliaments, viz. the provincial councils, and then they want to form two separate Coloured Parliaments, eight Bantu Parliaments for the homelands and&#x2014; though they are not quite sure themselves of how many&#x2014;a number of Bantu Parliaments for urban Blacks, and an Indian Parliament. The hon. member for Durban Point, who has now left the House, said that they will have a regulating factor in the federal assembly. He said they will have <span class="col_1107-1108" refersTo="page_0569"/>a regulating factor of 120 members who are to be elected on the basis of their contribution to South Africa. That is the very crux of the question. What is to be the basis of the election of these people? What is to be the basis on which the contribution of these people to South Africa is to be determined? Will it be by means of taxes, by contribution to the culture of the country, the amount of labour they provide for the country&#x2019;s industry and mines, or what is it going to be? How will they determine on what basis those 120 people will be elected? This is purely an academic practice or game that has been played in politics. There is no reason whatsoever why the United Party&#x2019;s federal policy should be taken seriously. What is important is that in the multi-national situation in South Africa where there are many different peoples in different stages of development and with different ideals in life, the country should be governed in a way that is most beneficial to all people concerned. This can be done on the basis of separate development, because there can only be real development of the various groups of separate peoples such as the Bantu, the Coloureds, the Indians, etc., on this basis. It is only on the basis of separate development, whereby their development is specifically guided because their restricted progress is being taken into consideration, that there can be justice for them in respect of what is being done for them. If there were no restrictions on what White people could do I am convinced that if all the areas in South Africa were thrown open to them, it would not be very long before the Bantu instead of having 13% would be left with 3% of South Africa. It is because their interests are being protected and special measures are being taken to provide industry and commerce to them in protected circumstances, that there can be real progress and real development Obviously there are also various restrictions. In the same way people are being brought from Africa and Asia by development aid to study at the universities of Cambridge and Oxford and at various universities in France, Germany and other countries. They are brought there for the purpose of development, the prime intention being that, after they have completed their studies, they should not as individuals remain behind in Paris or Berlin, in Britain or any other country and enjoy the fruits of the developed society there. The intention is that after they have acquired that knowledge, they should go back to their countries and act as leaders in the political and social fields, in education and in industry to uplift their own people. The development taking place in South Africa is a protected development which must obviously include certain negative measures. If those negative measures were not applied, the Bantu would never want to go back to their own areas to uplift their own people. For that reason it is essential that, apart from the protective development being given to them, there must also be some negative measures, measures which make it possible to carry out the protective development policy in respect of the various non-White peoples.</p>

<p>In Europe there is the European Common Market in terms of which there is economic co-operation and economic interdependence between the countries. The question is frequently asked whether the various Bantu areas in South Africa are economically viable. They may not be economically viable on their own, but they are economically viable in economic cooperation with the rest of Southern Africa. In exactly the same way not a single country in Western Europe, including West Germany, would be economically viable today were it not to lean heavily on economic co-operation with the other countries in Europe such as France, Holland, Italy and Britain. The economic viability of every single nation in the world today depends on economic co-operation. It is on the basis of this economic co-operation that Lesotho and Swaziland have reached a degree of viability; that the Transkei will be economically viable in co-operation with South Africa and that Mozambique becomes economically viable in co-operation with South Africa. Therefore, in terms of economic interdependence or economic cooperation, there is the possibility of various people, various nations, co-operating with one another while they remain politically sovereign and independent of one another, as France is independent of Germany and Lichtenstein is independent of Europe. However, it would be folly to expect any single country in Europe to be so politically independent that it could act on its own without liaison or co-operation with other countries in Europe. There must obviously be dialogue; there must be discussion; there must be agreement. However, the final effect given to any agreement made by means of discussion in the (European Council) has to be sealed by the decision of <span class="col_1109-1110" refersTo="page_0570"/>the Parliament of each independent sovereign country. In South Africa, too, we have the suggestion by the hon. the Prime Minister of a Cabinet council in which members of various nations in Southern Africa will discuss matters on common interest and reach agreement or fail to reach agreement thereon. The final approval, however, in respect of any decision taken will have to be given by each separate Parliament of each separate nation. By means of separate development and on the basis of discussion or of dialogue; on the basis of economic co-operation, there can be real peace and progress in South Africa. However, under the policy of a unitary political State, a state with unitary political power, be it federal or whatever form it may be, this co-operation can never be forthcoming. Yesterday the hon. member for Durban Point spoke about a Progressive Party policy reflecting in microcosm the same problems of the whole nation. Those problems would be exactly the same if a federal assembly or a federal Parliament, having final control over the destinies of all the peoples, were to have the final decision. In the same way it would be folly if America or China were to agree that the United Nations should become a sort of super parliament. I am convinced that neither America nor Russia nor China would agree to the establishment of a super world Parliament. There are discussions and decisions are taken. Some of those decisions are made binding provided that the individual nations agree thereto, but they can also opt out. For this reason the federal policy of the United Party, or for that matter of the Reform Party or the Progressive Party, is unpractical in terms of the Southern Africa situation.</p>

<p>Before I resume my seat, I think it is necessary to join issue on one point with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. It has been said that he is the spiritual father of the Reform Party. We saw the cartoon in the Press recently in which he denied fatherhood of the baby that had been born.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I think one could possibly compare this case with that of a gelded goat. A gelded goat is the goat which leads a flock of sheep to the slaughter-house, but just before it enters the slaughter-house the gelded goat turns back. That is what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has done. At the moment there are only four of them here. He led them to the slaughter-house, but then he decided, &#x201C;So far and no further; now I am turning back.&#x201D; I wonder if this is not analogous to the example we have seen in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom there was an esteemed political figure in the Conservative Party. He quarrelled with his leader. He waged such a fierce campaign against his leader that he even went so far as to tell his supporters during the last election that they should vote for the Labour Party, and he did so himself. I am referring to Mr. Enoch Powell. Because he did so, he has now been repudiated by the Conservative Party, including those members who used to support him. I recently spoke to a member of Parliament of the Conservative Party. He said that if Enoch Powell had not done this, he would undoubtedly have stood a very good chance of being elected leader of the Conservative Party recently. Because he broke with his leader at that stage, however, he is an outcast and was not elected leader of the Conservative Party. Mrs. Margaret Thatcher was elected. I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout learned the lesson of what had happened to Enoch Powell, and then decided, &#x201C;No, I shall not break away so finally that it will not be possible for me to be elected the next leader of the United Party.&#x201D; Last year he was asked whether his tender was still open. I wonder if his tender for accepting the leadership is still open at this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the United Party&#x2019;s problems are not over. The remaining conservative part of the United Party will win in the caucus; they may also win at the national congress; they may also win at the provincial congresses of the Cape Province, the Free State and Natal. They would probably have gained a narrow victory in the Transvaal as well if the conservative rural supporters of the United Party had been a little better organized than they were on the occasion of the previous congress. But, Sir, the tragedy of the United Party is the tragedy of the Opposition. The tragedy is that they will not win in the Press, and on the Witwatersrand and in the Peninsula, where the core of the members sitting here come from, they will probably not win in the next election either because they do not have the Opposition Press behind them. Consequently they will, lose there. Natal, Sir, is a different province. There was a time when Natal was regarded as the outsider in politics; in fact, it was a thing apart, because at one stage all the political bugs of the country came from Natal. But Natal has now had political stability for quite <span class="col_1111-1112" refersTo="page_0571"/>some time, and today we have only two parties left in Natal. The real instability in politics, provincially spoken, is now to be found in the Transvaal. You will recall, Sir, that Bailey Bekker&#x2019;s party also originated in the Transvaal. The Progressive Party originated in the Transvaal; Mr. Cor du Preez&#x2019;s party originated in the Transvaal; the HNP also originated in the Transvaal; even Mr. Gerdener&#x2019;s Democratic Party only came into being after Mr. Gerdener had left Natal and gone to the Transvaal, and the new Reform Party also originated in the Transvaal. Therefore I think I may compliment Natal on having achieved political stability, and for that reason the National Party is now on the road to success in Natal as well.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my predecessor. Adv. Pik Botha, is a youthful, energetic young man who, in the short time he represented the voters of Wonderboom in this House, and afterwards, has taken long strides in national and international politics, strides which will probably not be easy to equal. Sir, to have been able to work with him was a privilege; to tell the truth, it was in fact an experience. We thank him for that privilege. We pray that he will receive much wisdom and guidance in the long road which lies ahead. Sir, owing to the specific location of Wonderboom, its voters have to live from day to day with the growing pains of the national economic development of our policy. In some facets they are experiencing these pains in all their intensity, but in spite of that voters of Wonderboom are people with an unshakable faith and confidence in the guidance of the hon. the Prime Minister. These people also believe unshakably and confidently that it is the task of every citizen of this country to follow the example of President Kruger and in these times in which we are living and in this era which we are entering, to find for themselves a place of seclusion where they can go down on their knees every day to pray for guidance and that this great peace effort in Africa will proceed successfully and lead to a peaceful conclusion. This is the message which the voters of Wonderboom want to bring to the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, please allow me to refer briefly to Prof. Samuels, to Mr. Lutsch, the manager of the Armaments Board, to the Armaments Organization, and I should like to include here the hon. the Minister of Defence himself. To them I want to say thank you very much for the privileges which I enjoyed on the Armaments Board Thank you very much for the opportunities which were created for me and which enabled me to make a humble contribution to the preparedness of the defence forces of the Republic. Thank you very much, too, for the privilege I had of being able to make many friends for South Africa abroad in the process. Usually, when we discuss the preparedness of the Defence Force, the immediate reaction of the ordinary man in the street, of the ordinary member of the public, is to ask whether the Defence Force has enough people with which to protect our country and whether the Defence Force has enough arms and ammunition for these people. These are perhaps questions which are quite justified and correct in view of certain elements which constitute a threat to our country, but the question which one cannot help asking is whether this is in fact the essence and the substance of preparedness. With preparedness it is not so much a matter of people and their arms and ammunition. Does the general public understand the situation and appreciate the extremely important contribution and role which it can and must play in this regard? In order, perhaps, to obtain more clarity in regard to this matter, I should just like to indicate quickly the most important concepts of preparedness which we can ponder. The first is strategic preparedness; then there is physical preparedness; mental preparedness; preparedness against threats or, in correct Defence Force parlance, appraisal of threats; operational and tactical preparedness; and lastly technological preparedness.</p>

<p>When we consider strategic preparedness now, we could state it in the following way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When we talk about strategy the traditional concept of strategy was the art of employing military force to achieve the ends set by political policies. This, however, is completely outdated. The present day practice, although the methods still includes military force, must ensure that all coercive methods are employed and that the most effective use is made of all available resources. It is, therefore, no longer considered as the exclusive right of the military alone.</block>

<p>Sir, what this amounts to is that there should be a strategic plan in which all the <span class="col_1113-1114" refersTo="page_0572"/>elements of the national economy have to play an effective role. Perhaps we could now consider these elements briefly. They include a national and international economic plan, an available manpower plan, a transportation system plan, a communications plan, an industrial plan and a financial plan. It is, after all, the practice to express the defence appropriation as a percentage of the Government appropriation and as a percentage of the gross national product. Then there is the energy plan. After all, we have taken cognizance of this effective action because there was an energy plan which enabled the Government to deal to a certain extent with the energy crisis. In addition there is a diplomatic plan. Sir, the world is taking cognizance and is aware of the attempts being made by the hon. the Prime Minister in Southern Africa and in Africa in this regard. What it amounts to is that there is a strategic philosophy in which all these elements are combined to make certain that it is possible to ensure the security of the State in peacetime conditions and under physical threat. If this philosophy is played correctly and if the strategic plan is planned correctly and is a good one, it might be possible to achieve the political objectives of a nation without military action. When it comes to physical and mental preparedness, I do not want to discuss the question of physical preparedness at all; that goes without saying.</p>

<p>However, I do want to exchange a few ideas on mental preparedness. The question which immediately arises is for what reason a nation arms itself. Is it to serve as a deterrent? Yes, certainly, Sir. Is it to be able to ward off the physical onslaughts on a State and nation? Yes, certainly, Sir, that, too. However, it is also very important to maintain the self-respect of a nation and our national pride and honour and the will to protect what is our own. That is the essence of mental preparedness. No Defence Force is an isolated compartment or an island in the ocean. The members of the Defence Force are part of the nation. The will of the individual is the will of the nation and the will of the nation is the will of the Defence Force. The mental preparedness of the Defence Force therefore has its origin in the mental preparedness of the people and the mental preparedness of the individual. Another important factor related to this is that a part of mental preparedness should also be the faith of the individual in his Creator. If we do not have that, then we do not have mental preparedness. Let us take cognizance of the fact that the mental preparedness of the Defence Force grows out of the nation. Let parents in South Africa take cognizance that they should inculcate love for what is one&#x2019;s own and the will to protect it in the child from his earliest days. The child should imbibe this with his mother&#x2019;s milk. It is our bounden national duty. Our educational bodies and institutions should take cognizance of the fact that it is their calling to inculcate and develop national honour and pride in the young people. Our churches should continue to proclaim the love of Christ purely and without any fear. Our parents, educational institutions and churches should accept the mental preparedness of the nation and the Defence Force as a national command, in the knowledge that mental preparedness is a prerequisite and an essential quality of good and responsible citizenship.</p>

<p>In respect of the last concept of technological preparedness, section 3 of the Defence Act lays down the defence objectives of the South African Defence Force. This is a defence mandate emanating from the people through the Government to the Defence Force, and it states briefly: The defence of the RSA, prevention and suppression of disorder as well as coping with national disasters. Knowledge of the elements posing a threat to a nation is a vitally important prerequisite, for without it there cannot be a strategic plan or a concept of preparedness. A defence Force may exist, but it will not meet the objectives of the South African Defence Force as defined. Operational preparedness amounts to the ability of the Defence Force to be able to carry out these instructions, and to be able to do that, the Government has to place means at its disposal. In practice these means are known as the four M&#x2019;s: Manpower, material, money and machinery.</p>

<p>You will recall that I said that the traditional concept of strategy is &#x201C;the art to employ military force&#x201D;. This is tactical preparedness: The purposeful development of these needs to satisfy the objectives of the Defence Force in the most effective manner. When one discusses means, two ideas immediately emerge. The one is quantitative and the other is qualitative. Unfortunately it is the case in the world today that no nation has an over-abundance of means. Means are scarce, and only obtainable <span class="col_1115-1116" refersTo="page_0573"/>at a premium. When the quantitative concept has a limitation, the emphasis shifts to the qualitative&#x2014;in other words, the fewer the materials, the better they have to be. It is to this that I should like to couple the idea of technological preparedness.</p>

<p>In the defence situation there are two approaches. The one is technological preparedness which has to do with the quality of the skill of the armaments operator. In this modern century this is becoming increasingly important because armaments are technologically becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated. The other is technological preparedness which has to do with the quality of the armaments, the industrial potential to manufacture and to service, and the skill of engineers and technicians in the industry. No country, with the possible exception of the USA, can be self-sufficient in these skilled fields of military technology. It is therefore imperative for any nation, and particularly South Africa as well, to be able to be self-sufficient in carefully selected fields which have to fit in with its strategic plan and with the available means. This entails technical equipment and facilities for the manufacture and servicing of armaments, which is primarily a financial problem. In addition it also comprises the building up of technological skills, which is on the other hand a manpower problem. This is something which one finds in the fingertips and in the minds of people. However, one can never develop these technological skills if the opportunities for doing so are not created. I am thinking of opportunities of manufacture, production and servicing. Let us glance briefly at the opportunities which exist in South Africa.</p>

<p>According to Unisa&#x2019;s Market Research Bureau there are 4 258 mechanical industries, 505 electrical industries, 580 chemical industries and 260 plastic industries. Including miscellaneous and textile industries, the total amounts to 6 600 industries, which on the face of it seems to present wonderful opportunities. But let us consider the manpower which is available according to the HSRC. There are approximately 12 300 technicians, of whom only 9,4%, or a meagre 1 200, are available for the industries. There are 11 674 engineers in all professions, of whom only 9 200 practise the profession. Twenty percent of them are mechanically and electrically qualified&#x2014;in other words 1 800. When we collate these figures, we see that there is one technician for every 3,9 industries, while there is one engineer for every 2,5 industries. I am aware of the disturbing factors in these particulars, but the picture which results from this is one which arouses great concern. In view of this pattern it is clear that it is an impossible task to establish armaments skill in the country. The heart of the problem lies in the fragmentation of the available manpower as a result of an unrealistic fragmentation of the industries.</p>

<p>I conclude. If the Republic wants to be technologically prepared within the specified limitations, and also wants to make a fundamental contribution in Southern Africa and in Africa, this matter will have to receive serious attention, and thought will have to be given to the rationalization and co-ordination of industries with special reference to the fields of armaments technology.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to congratulate the hon. member for Wonderboom on his maiden speech. He has entered a debate at an early stage after his election to this House. I have listened with interest to what he had to say and was gratified to see with what care he had prepared himself for what he had to say. I should like to congratulate him on having made a speech which has treated this House seriously, if I may be permitted to say so. He put forward a serious argument on the basis that this House is a place for serious debate, a happy contrast with the hon. member for Klip River who spoke before him. I wish the hon. member for Wonderboom a happy stay in this House. As a politician he will understand if I do not wish him a lengthy stay in this House, but nevertheless, the good wishes of this side of the House&#x2014; and I dare say of the whole House&#x2014;go out to him on his election to Parliament.</p>

<p>I should now like to address myself to the speech of the hon. member for Yeoville. In his address to the House he used expressions, with regard to my party, the United Party, which I should have thought he would have been wise to avoid. There were references to &#x201C;personal ambition&#x201D;, &#x201C;personality differences&#x201D; and there were allegations of &#x201C;double talk&#x201D; in our ranks. There were references, with great emotion, to &#x201C;smear campaigns&#x201D; and to the denigration of individuals. I believe that I am in duty bound to deal with some of these matters, I being the first spokesman for the <span class="col_1117-1118" refersTo="page_0574"/>official Opposition after the hon. gentleman has spoken. One of the greatest difficulties I have had with the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;and I speak with some knowledge as a provincial chairman&#x2014;has been his predeliction for double talk. Indeed, we have had a classic example of it this very afternoon when he attempted to justify his refusal to vote with the Opposition&#x2014;the combined Opposition, I may say&#x2014;on the amendment of the hon. the Prime Minister. He sought to justify his stand on the basis that all that amendment did was to praise the Government for its d√©tente in Southern Africa. He has done that very thing on two occasions. His Press statement was double talk of the same kind. If one has the amendment at hand, as I do, one sees that it states in the clearest possible language, language which was understood similarly by the entire combined Opposition, other than Mr. Schwarz, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House is of the opinion that it is incumbent upon every South African to promote sound relations between peoples and races in South Africa &#x2026;</block>

<p>I emphasize &#x201C;in South Africa&#x201D;. It then goes on to deal with matters outside of South Africa and then states, in the second part &#x2014;which the hon. gentleman always omits&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Furthermore notes with appreciation what the Government has done and intends doing in this field.</block>

<p>With the utmost clarity it seeks endorsement by this House of what the Government has done and proposes to do in South Africa. It can only do that in terms of the Government&#x2019;s own policy, a policy which this side of the House, the United Party, and the hon. member for Yeoville, have for years been opposed to.</p>

<p>I do not propose to go into great detail but I do propose to summarize it The hon. gentleman began his speech by saying that the United Party was a body which he had served with his finance and his energy for some 26 or 27 years. In telling us what he had done, he omitted one word which I thought was significant. He made no reference to the fact that during the years he devoted his energy and his money he also devoted his loyalty to the United Party. That is significant because I believe that a political party if it is to serve a useful function, is not merely an amorphous mass with a number of ideals. Ideals are fine, but you have to have a vehicle in order to implement those ideals. The vehicle which we have always had is the United Party. A vehicle to implement ideals which one feels strongly about&#x2014;I concede that the hon. member feels strongly about his ideals&#x2014;an effective vehicle must have a number of attributes. It must be unified and it must be able to demand from its people, particularly from its leaders and its provincial leaders, self-discipline and loyalty. The principle difficulty that this party of mine has been through during the recent months, I emphasize&#x2014;and I shall deal with it in detail&#x2014;has not been differences of policy and principles, but the inability of that group of persons to compose themselves in terms of self-discipline and loyalty.</p>

<p>How did the group operate? First of all it had to establish an identity, which it did, as a group of persons separate from the party to which they gave their loyalty. That had to be emphasized and it was emphasized through the media by their having formed with one or two individuals of the Press, a closer relationship than I would have thought the ethical standards of the journalistic profession would demand because in my view it impinged on one of those standards, i.e. an objective approach to events. Well, having established a group with an identity of its own, they then secured friends in the media to compare constantly in the public mind the value of the group as opposed to the value of the party of which they said they were a part. <span class="col_1119-1120" refersTo="page_0575"/>That is done always on the basis that the group has credibility and merit while the party has no credibility and very little merit. This is constantly done and was constantly done, very cleverly and with great skill, to bring about this identity and to give it dominance in the political scene.</p>

<p>One of the greatest disservices that has been done throughout this campaign&#x2014;and I hope my friends will listen to me&#x2014;has not only been the denigration of groups of individuals within the party as verkramp, but the association with this reformed group of individuals who were not involved. This is something which this House and the South Africans outside should appreciate. What was the next stage? The next stage was to send emissaries to the other provinces to make contact with people, including public representatives, and with certain organs of the Press to discredit the elected leadership in the other provinces. That was the next move.</p>

<p>Then there was the take-over of power. Basically the whole of this operation was a bid for power and it is extraordinary&#x2014;it brought to light a very strange point of view. The point of view is: The party is dead right, it is a wonderful show, its principles are fine, its membership is excellent&#x2014;as long as I am the boss; but if I am not the boss, then it really is a &#x201C;shower&#x201D;, as is sometimes said. That is the attitude of mind behind the thinking of this group. The power struggle was won by this group in the Transvaal, it was attempted but lost in the Cape and it was attempted but lost in the parliamentary caucus of the party.</p>

<p>I would like to deal with some of the points upon which it is alleged that this party is at fault. After the brief summary I have given. I hope you will bear in mind. Sir, that the hon. member condemned this party for having people in its ranks who place personal ambition before the interests of the party and for the question of personality differences. The first point the hon. gentleman made was that he, seeks security through a sharing of power. We have been criticized by these gentlemen in Press statements over the last few weeks that we are not genuinely in favour of a sharing of power.</p>

<p>What is the very essence of any federal structure? The very essence on which it is founded is a sharing of power. The federal structure of the United Party was brought into being by a committee&#x2014;and the hon. gentlemen in this House all know who was on that committee. They formulated the federal structure which was praised at the time in the Press. I have the cutting here. It is headed: &#x201C;Courage, this is what this plan has&#x201D;. That is what was said not two years ago. That committee was joined by the hon. gentleman only after the original principles were established. What are those principles? They are for giving maximum power to the various legislative councils, which will be racially based&#x2014;it is known to this House that that is the basic ground floor of our federal plan&#x2014;and for those councils then sharing power with a multi-racial federal assembly. That is the ultimate destiny to which we are moving. If that is not a simple example of shared power at the constitutional level, I do not know what the term &#x201C;shared power&#x201D; means.</p>

<p>How are we going to bring that about? I assume that the hon. gentleman still believes in that policy. They say it is the greatest thing and they still believe in it. There is only one sovereign authority which can bring that about, namely this Parliament which has sovereignty at the present time. It is an essential element of this federal scheme that there is to be a sharing of sovereignty between the federal assembly and the legislative councils, because a sharing of sovereignty between the upper and lower echelons of the various legislatures is also an essential element of any federal scheme. So there is to be a sharing of power and a sharing of sovereignty, and I have never <span class="col_1121-1122" refersTo="page_0576"/>heard any member of this party say otherwise. How is that to be achieved? There is only one sovereign authority at the present time which can do it, namely this Parliament.</p>

<p>We are criticized on the basis that there is a difference of opinion with regard to the phasing out of this unitary Parliament and the coming into being of a federal system. I have never had the slightest difficulty on this score. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Durban Point yesterday put our philosophy and our general and ultimate direction perfectly clearly. They made it quite clear that we propose to set up a federal scheme which will gradually have various powers transferred to it and that when, as the hon. member said yesterday, the confidence of the people has been won by the efficient working of that federal machine, this Chamber will become redundant. No one has ever run away from that. However, there is a long path to follow between this moment in time and the ultimate creation of that federal scheme. How will it be done? It is our philosophy that this will be done through policy, which is what one puts to the electorate at an election. If we were to go to the electorate and, I imagine, if the hon. member for Yeoville were to go to the electorate at the next election, he would not seek a mandate for the abolition of this Parliament because if he were to do so he would not be able to introduce a federal scheme. He would seek the continued existence of this Parliament in order to bring a federal structure into being. I venture to suggest that thereafter, at the following election, the mandate that he would seek from the electorate would not be the abolition of this sovereign Parliament because if that were to happen he could not clothe the new federation with any powers. Once again he would require a mandate from the people and his policy at that election would be the continued existence of this Parliament in order to be able to transfer powers to the new federal legislatures which had been set up.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member will hear me out. Finally, the stage would be reached when he would seek his special mandate from the electorate which is the guarantee which the leader of this party has given with the authority of that hon. member. This guarantee will be that what my leader has called the keys to the safety of the State will not be transferred to the federal assembly without the specific authority of the electorate. The ultimate philosophy is as clear as day and the steps that have to be taken to achieve that end are also as clear as day. In what field is it permissible within that philosophy for there to be differences of point of view? In my view it is perfectly permissible for individuals to differ in their calculation of or in their speculation as to the length of time that process is likely to take. People who are accustomed to associating with the more sophisticated of the non-White peoples may well take the view that this will be a rapid process after the party gets into power. Those who are accustomed to deal with the less sophisticated or more rural communities, particularly in the non-White world, are entitled to take the view that this may well be a longer process than some imagine. However, differences in emphasis of that kind do not amount to double talk. They are legitimate within a party which adheres to one philosophy. To attempt to describe this as a basis upon which men leave the party is playing with words. I have dealt in that summary with the question of the White Parliament and a sharing of power. There is also the question of White leadership.</p>

<p>The assaults on petty apartheid came largely from the recommendations of a committee of which the chairman was the hon. member for Hillbrow and of which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was a member. Sir, the aims and principles of, the 1973 congress, which was hailed as a triumph for the Young Turks and for the Reformists, was originally drafted by a committee set up by the hon. the Leader of the party, and only minor changes to it were made by the head committee. Then, Sir, there was the 10-point initiative raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition at the first caucus last year and made public in the Press. Where did those 10 points come from. Sir? number of them came from the Leader of the Opposition himself; a large number came from the Division of Information under the hon. member for Hillbrow, and I think a point came from the hon. member for Edenvale. Now, Sir, let us take the statement on Coloured policy. It came from the parliamentary group that is concerned with Coloured affairs. The statement on multi-racial sport came from a committee under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Green Point, and the policy initiative dealing with labour and collective bargaining for the Black people <span class="col_1125-1126" refersTo="page_0578"/>came from a committee under the chairmanship of the hon. member for Hillbrow. So much. Sir, for the myth which has been assiduously cultivated by these gentlemen that every worthwhile initiative in this party has come as a result of their representations.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, one of his lieutenants, the hon. member for Bryanston, attacked me and the party in Natal because, so he said, we only paid lip service to any attempts to move away from discrimination and petty apartheid. Sir, I want to say another word or two in the few minutes which are left to me. I would not normally appear to be critical of my colleagues in the Johannesburg city council. We are moving in this field of trying to remove discrimination. I also administer an executive authority, Sir, as did my hon. friend in the Transvaal with the Johannesburg city council, and I know that one is moving through an extremely difficult field, a field in which one has to move with a measure of care. I think everybody in this House will accept that. The changes which have been made in this field under the administration of the hon. member for Yeoville. I believe, are the following: The parks have been opened to all races. The museums have been opened to all races. Black traffic officers have been appointed recently, but without the power to arrest Whites, and some libraries have been opened. This is the extent of the initiatives taken under the auspices of his regime, Sir.</p>

<p>Now let us look at what has happened in Natal. The parks in Natal have never been closed. The museums in Natal have never been closed. The Provincial Administration has made it abundantly clear to the local authorities that they are free to open any of their libraries which they wish to open. We have had Black traffic officers appointed with equal powers to their White compatriots since 1966, and there is no discrimination against them as to whom they may apprehend for offences and whom they may not, and we have some 30 of them in the employment of the Provincial Administration at the present time. We have for years had multi-racial boards for our large regional water supply corporations. We have three fully-fledged non-White town councils and some 20 elected local affairs committees. We have for years had mixed hospital boards in Natal, multi-racial boards. We have mixed membership of our Tattersalls. The Provincial Administration has persuaded the Book makers&#x2019; Co-operative to change their constitution so as to allow for the appointment of non-White bookmakers. Sir, at all the State dams where we are in charge of the pleasure resorts, we have absolutely equal facilities, chalets, restaurants and the rest, for all those racial groups whom the Government allows us to make provision for. We are proposing to appoint a multiracial consultative committee to advise the province in regard to multi-racial affairs and to advise the Natal Parks Board.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I have in the short time available to me tried to give this House a r√©sum√© to show that Natal, where a United Party provincial council is in office, far from being worthy of the criticism which the hon. member for Bryanston attributed to it&#x2014;I imagine largely out of ignorance&#x2014; is in fact leading the way in South Africa in easing the difficulties of multi-racialism and petty apartheid. There is one other aspect which I could mention. In some of our municipalities, like the municipality of Pinetown, 90% of their traffic officers are Black men, and that has been so for some years, but we do not get on to the roof-tops and shout about it. We have for years had complete road maintenance units operating under the provincial council, entirely staffed by Black men.</p>

The hon. member who has just resumed his seat will remember that a year or two ago <span class="col_1127-1128" refersTo="page_0579"/>I addressed a warning to them and said that they should be careful; a leader is being cultivated in the United Party.

The hon. member would do well to go and look it up in Hansard. Then that same hon. member rose and said that he did not know what I was referring to. It so happened that last year he followed me in this debate, and at that time I told him that he should see who was sitting behind him; who was breathing down his neck.

<p>I want to point out that last year I appealed to you, Mr. Speaker, to allow me to take a photograph of the United Party members of the House. You turned down my request although I said that such a photograph would be an historic one. Just look how they are sitting there today! It is a disintegrated United Party. There we have the representatives of the Oppenheimer Group, called for short the &#x201C;Progs&#x201D;. Next to them are the &#x201C;deserters of Graaff&#x201D;&#x2014; probably one would not be allowed to call them the &#x201C;DOGS&#x201D; for short. An expression of that kind would be unparliamentary, but those &#x201C;deserters of Graaff&#x201D; comprised the Grow Group. Alongside them we have the rest of the United Party. That is what the Opposition in South Africa looks like today: A pathetic Opposition. In any event, I leave them at that.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the debates that have been carried on over the past few days. It was a privilege for us to be able to listen to the farewell message of the former Minister of Finance a few weeks ago. In his characteristic and extremely capable manner he gave us a survey of the financial and economic situation which, as he sees it, prevails in the world. He also informed us of the spirit that prevails in the world, which is being threatened to such an extent by inflation. I am not a pessimist; I regard myself as a reasonable realist, but after the speeches we have heard over the past few days, I think the threat of inflation and its increase in the world causes us all concern. We in South Africa are, perhaps, less affected by it than people in other countries and we are very grateful for that. Perhaps we are not threatened to the same extent, but at the same time it is very clear that we in South Africa will not entirely escape this, either.</p>

<p>Since I am a representative of a constituency that is comprised exclusively of workers and is situated exclusively in an area in which major and heavy industries are established, I want to exchange a few ideas concerning the role that can be played in the fight against inflation by man and the machine. If time permits, √ç shall also say a few words about the role that man will play in the future of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>A few decades ago&#x2014;that was in our youth&#x2014;the Republic of South Africa was exclusively dependent upon the income received from agriculture; that is, if the income from the gold mines is not taken into account. At that time our country was not dependent on its labour to the degree that it is today. However, as time passed, the machine made an appearance and began to replace man to an ever-increasing extent. As we know, the machine plays a vital role. If we consider when our industrial development began, we see that it began after the depression of the thirties. In the years after the Second World War the tempo speeded up, but after the declaration of the Republic there was a rapid increase in tempo. When this young country, South Africa, became a Republic, its enemies in the world thought that since it stood on unsteady legs, they would be able to bring it down. Sanctions and boycotts were then instituted against us and it was necessary at that time for us to speed up the tempo of industrial development in our country tremendously. I can remember that as a child, and I think this goes for many other hon. members, because it is not so many years ago&#x2014;we used the ox-waggon and the scotch-cart on the farm as a means of transport. At that time wheat was still cut with the sickle, bound by hand and carried by hand. I can still remember how, as a young child, while the horses threshed the wheat and there was no wind, I called out &#x201C;moya, moya&#x201D; and whistled up the wind to blow away the chaff. In those days maize was probably threshed with sticks. These are things which many of us sitting here <span class="col_1129-1130" refersTo="page_0580"/>have experienced. In time, however, the machine made its appearance and partially replaced that human labour. Thus the cutting machine, the threshing machine, the self-binder and the combine made their appearance. But even with all these machines, it was still necessary for people to service those machines. In the same way there is the man who worked in an office. He had no aids. If he was lucky he had a &#x201C;Ready Reckoner&#x201D;. Later came the adding machine or the &#x201C;calculator&#x201D;, as we called it. Also the Hollorith machine, and eventually the computer as well. Today it is virtually inconceivable that any firm of any stature should be able to get by without the computer. Let us take the mining industry. In those times the cocopan was drawn by animals. The holes were bored manually while the loading and off-loading of cocopans was done manually by means of spades. This development has taken place in all spheres. In this way the machine has replaced human labour to an ever-increasing extent. Thus, in time the machine came, and with the machine, of course, mechanization. In spite of the machine and mechanization, the demand for people and manpower has continued to increase. It is as plain as a pikestaff that although it has replaced man, the machine is totally incapable of operating without the hand and the knowledge of man. Man has remained the essential link in this entire revolution; without man the computer stands useless, the aeroplane stands useless, yes, even the moon rockets, because although it is unmanned, it is still controlled from the ground. It goes without saying that by means of this process of mechanization, productivity is increased. Both of these factors have acted as a counter to this dragon, inflation, if I may express it in those terms. That machine is unable to produce without a properly trained operator. One can have two similar machines and two tradesmen with the same qualifications to service them, and then one finds that one can deal with the task within two minutes, while the other will take five minutes over it. The factors that make the difference here are dexterity and skill. Mechanization and automation can make no contribution towards the combating of inflation if that machine is not operated effectively and properly occupied and utilized. Machinery is an expensive article in any industry. If it is not fully occupied and utilized, it can have the opposite effect and be a cause of inflation.</p>

<p>Now, however, I want to deal with the person, the individual. We in South Africa are particularly fortunate because we have the mineral wealth, the metals, the raw materials, the water, the necessary infrastructure and even the human material for sound growth. With all these means I believe that we can build and maintain a growing economy. However, we are now being accused every day and on all sides of a failure to utilize our human material properly in this process. Let us now analyse the human material we have at our disposal. In our multi-national country, we have 3,7 million Whites, about 2 million Coloureds and about 600 000 Asians and about 15 million Bantu, a total of 21,4 million people representing the labour force of South Africa, the source upon which we may draw. Once again we must take cognizance of the fact that this source is multi-national in composition; in other words it has a complicated composition. It is the task of the State to ensure, in the first place, that there is a happy and satisfied labour force. In the second place, the elimination of areas of friction on the labour market must be ensured. Proper training and the obtaining of optimum productivity from each worker must be ensured. The last, but probably the most important aspect is that industrial peace must be ensured. If one has all these things, one is well armed to combat inflation. However, the following arises out of the above-mentioned factors. There must be good relations between employee and employer. All these factors I have mentioned will be of no avail if we do not have the correct relationships. We must bear in mind that when we are dealing with people, we are dealing with a living being. It is an enormous task, an almost superhuman task, to comply with the above demands.</p>

<p>I now want to test the National Party and its policy against all these aspects. To what extent have we succeeded in carrying out these things. In the first place I want to look at industrial peace and then at relationships between employer and employee. When we compare ourselves with any country in the world as regards industrial peace, we shall find that we are far ahead of the other countries. We are right on top. I am not referring to strikes that occur sporadically. We know what this sound situation is ascribable to. After all, there is a reason for it. It does not come of itself. The most important reason lies in the creation of the Industrial Conciliation Act, as amended, <span class="col_1131-1132" refersTo="page_0581"/>by the National Party. This is an Act of which the world is jealous and one of which South Africa has a right to be proud. Strikes and work stoppages, when they take place, are minimal. Strikes and stoppages do, of course, occur sporadically. After all, we admit that. However, we have made an analysis of them. In many instances we have found that it has not been a question of the working conditions of these people nor has it been a question of their conditions of service. It has been foreign influences that have been the cause of those strikes. Under this same Industrial Conciliation Act, that jewel of an Act, provision has also been made for due negotiation between employer and employee. Provision has been made for industrial boards, for conciliation boards. The employer and employee may sit around a table and negotiate properly. In other words, to a large extent the employee governs himself in this country. Under the Industrial Conciliation Act we have also provided for job reservation&#x2014;yes, the enemy of the Opposition! We must never see in job reservation those dragon&#x2019;s teeth which so many people see in it. On the contrary, the job reservation measure is a protective measure. It protects all groups of our people. This measure has not been included in the Act to protect the Whites only. It is also there to protect the Bantu and the Coloureds. It is therefore an instrument with which to eliminate friction if necessary. I know that I shall immediately be told: &#x201C;Yes, but the Bantu does not have trade unions.&#x201D; But we have created negotiating machinery for the Bantu. Just think of the works and liaison committees under the Bantu Labour Relations Regulation Act. Some people will now say that this machinery does not work. However we are grateful that recently a thorough investigation was carried out by the University of the Orange Free State, by the personnel research section of the Department of Industrial Psychology. The subject of the investigation was the functioning of liaison committees. They sent questionnaires to 326 of the largest organizations in the country. In those 326 organizations there were 471 liaison committees which, at that stage&#x2014;on 30 June 1974 &#x2014;comprised 41,1% of the recognized liaison committees. What were their findings? They found that in 39% of the cases, productivity had increased. They also found that in 82% of the cases grievances had been reduced, that communication had improved in 97% of the cases and that 82% of the organizations were satisfied with liaison committees. These questionnaires were not sent to &#x201C;tuppenny-halfpenny&#x201D; organizations, but to large organizations such as African Explosives and Chemical Industries and other large organizations.</p>

I also know that in certain cases, trade unions have caused the greatest misery to their members. After all, we know what misery they have caused in some countries.</p>

<p>As far as the training of our people is concerned, surely it cannot be doubted that we in South Africa have done our rightful share. We need only analyse the Budget to find that an enormous amount is being done with regard to the training and education of our people. When I say this, I am not speaking about the Whites only, but also about the Bantu. When we look at the increase in the number of schoolgoing children over the past few years, we are dumbfounded, because there has never been anything like it in the world. In the meantime the Department of Bantu Administration and Development has come up with in-service and pre-service training for the workers. We are grateful that they have come up with this and that rapid progress is being made in this regard. It is not the duty of the State alone to undertake this pre-service training; it is also the duty of each industrialist to do his part in that regard. The labour is used by that industrialist. They cannot, therefore, always remain at a distance and continue to point a finger at the State, because this is their duty, too. Today I want to make an earnest plea that we should also consider extending pre-service training and in-service training to include even the Whites.</p>

<p>In these few minutes I have tried to sketch the role played by the machine, Man, the individual and the State in increasing productivity. It goes without saying that when all these things are done, they must add up too a means to combat inflation. Now, however, a question occurs to me and in my opinion it is the key question. The question is: What, then, is wrong? I can only come to the conclusion that in South Africa, the problem lies with <span class="col_1133-1134" refersTo="page_0582"/>the worker and his attitude to his work. The essence of the problem is the attitude of the worker to his daily task. Is the worker&#x2019;s approach to his work the same as it always was? I am starting to doubt whether in fact it is. Why has the worker&#x2019;s attitude to his daily task changed? He has changed his attitude to his daily task owing to the prosperity we have enjoyed over the past number of years. I find this to be the most important reason for his attitude having changed. He has become lazy. He thinks that he may no longer do certain types of work because they are beneath him. It is not only among the Whites that we find this, but also among the non-Whites and the Coloureds. They no longer want to do certain work. That attitude has not only changed as regards work, however, but also as regards the church. Then there is another important aspect that helps inflation. We all know that the value of money has dropped over the years. Do people still attach sufficient value to the money they have today, even though that money has a reduced value? No, I believe not. We decided to buy a pair of shoes and we walk into the first shop we see and say: &#x201C;Take that No. 9&#x00BD; off the shelf for me. Here is the money.&#x201D; Prices are no longer compared and people spend too easily. This is one of the reasons why we encourage inflation.</p>

<p>I think I could give that hon. member many examples. If he were to come to my house, I should give them to him. I say that we have this phenomenon owing to prosperity. Peoples&#x2019; attitudes towards their work must change again and this is a task that the State will have to perform. However, it is also the duty of the Opposition to help to change that attitude, because it affects everyone. We shall not have this problem if people perform their daily task with dedication again. I want to tell the Opposition that they are the people who will have to help. If we are able to succeed in changing the attitude of the worker we shall ensure that we still have a future in this country and that we shall leave our descendants a worthy inheritance. I want to plead that the Opposition, particularly the representatives of the Oppenheimer group, should stop this nonsense of constantly inciting the Whites against the non-Whites. I want to ask all of them, in all seriousness, to consider desisting from constantly playing off the Black worker against the White worker in South Africa. They can perform a task as a worthy opposition. It is their task to be a worthy opposition. Training a &#x201C;crash training programme&#x201D;&#x2014;call it what you will &#x2014;increased wages, automation and mechanization&#x2014;it will all be pointless if we are unable to instil that correct attitude in the worker. This is an urgent problem for us.</p>

<p>Having referred at the outset to Dr. Diederichs&#x2019; speech, I want to close with Dr. Diederichs&#x2019; words, viz. that we must work, work more, because only then will we still enjoy many golden years in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#ungerer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me, right at the outset, to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Finance on his first appearance in the House in his new capacity. He is following in the footsteps of a man who has won great prestige both here and outside South Africa. We on this side of the House are convinced that the hon. the Minister possesses the qualitative characteristics to win great prestige for himself here and abroad in his own right. Our best wishes accompany him.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to level a few accusations at the United Party. Since I have been taking an interest in politics, it has struck me that the United Party has been affected by failures of understanding to such an extent over the years that not only has it remained simply unacceptable as an alternative Government, but has even been regarded as dangerous for South Africa. I want to say that it is with a degree of reluctance that I discuss this with the Opposition, because when a man has just emerged from a fight to the death and the pieces are still scattered across the floor of the House as a result, one is unwilling to deal out blows as well. Nevertheless I want to make a few accusations this afternoon and the first is that there have been failures of understanding on the part of the Opposition which they have suffered since their formation and which are apparently going to remain with them to the end of their days, and that is no longer very far off. I want to accuse the Opposition, in the first instance, of displaying a lack of realism and understanding of the situation in South and Southern Africa as it exists at present and as it has been over the past decades.</p>

<p><span class="col_1135-1136" refersTo="page_0583"/>In the second place I want to accuse them of displaying an absolute lack of understanding of the national aspirations of other peoples and of displaying in the process, an attitude that has caused their followers, and particularly the youth falling within their sphere of influence, to attach a very unpleasant connotation to the concepts &#x201C;patriotism&#x201D; and &#x201C;Nasionalism&#x201D;, something that will definitely not be to South Africa&#x2019;s benefit in the future. I want to begin by quoting the words of the Leader of the Opposition from the latest Hansard. He was speaking about what has occurred in recent times in Africa and said the following (Hansard 1975, col. 18)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think, too, that that is the essence of the message which we on this side of the House have tried to convey to the House and to the country ever since the breakdown of Portuguese authority in Angola and in Mozambique.</block>

<p>With the collapse of Portuguese authority in Angola and in Mozambique&#x2014;that is the implication of these words of the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;they realized for the first time how important it is to bring about diplomatic contact and d√©tente in Southern Africa as has in fact been achieved by the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a little late.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ungerer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>He goes on to say that they have advocated these things through the years and eventually he states that he warned the Government last year to bring about an improved social and political structure for the Coloureds. This indicates a lack of realism and understanding which, if it had been displayed by the Government in power today, would have been fatal for South Africa in the exceptional circumstances we are living in. There is no shadow of doubt about that. Surely it is obvious to any logical, thinking person that this effort to reach d√©tente must be the culmination of diplomatic contact with Africa north of us that has been built up over a long period at a high level. To say that if one wants to bring about d√©tente one need only board an aircraft to go and visit these people and tell them: &#x201C;Let us discuss peace&#x201D;, could not have been the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Government because then it would have been unable to succeed as it has, in fact, succeeded. Surely that ought to be clear.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with my other accusation, namely that over the years the Opposition have shown themselves to be lacking in the slightest understanding of the national aspirations of the other groups and peoples in this country. The implications of this failure are much wider and more unfathomable that those of the first one I mentioned. Because in a multinational country like South Africa it can only eventually lead to chaos and anarchy if peoples&#x2019; national aspirations are continually disregarded. It is an historically proven fact that the Opposition has always shown itself to be a party with no understanding of the national aspirations and ideals of the nationalistically minded people of this country. I refer specifically to nationalistically minded people because these national aspirations are the aspirations not only of the Afrikaans-speaking people but of a substantial section of our English-speaking people who support the National Party. Through the years it has been proved that the National Party, and the National Party alone, has fought for political development to the glory of South Africa and for its total independence.</p>

<p>In this process the United Party not only dragged its feet; it literally dug its United Party heels in and fought against it fiercely. This is a simply astounding inconsistency. Much of the bitterness between the various political groups in South Africa must be attributed to this inconsistent way in which the United Party has set itself against every effort to bring about political development and emancipation of South Africa. I also want to say, with regard to the Republic, that this same United Party has as yet failed to learn anything and that this same method of theirs has appeared in a still more bitter form and more extensively. And do you realize that during the debate, at the time of the referendum for a Republic, the Opposition referred to the bone of contention cast in our midst. They therefore call the Republic a bone of contention.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>Then they went further and said that the Republic would hamper national unity in South Africa. Once again this only goes to show what a lack of understanding of the situation in South Africa it displayed. It was, in fact, the Republic that put an end to divided <span class="col_1137-1138" refersTo="page_0584"/>loyalties and which, for the first time in our history, offered us hope in the sphere of nation-building. After all, Sir, the signs are very clear. We have almost become a one-party state. There are hardly any seats left that are occupied by the Opposition. I also call to mind the speech by the Leader of the Opposition on the evening before the Republican referendum. Hon. members will remember that he made a tragic speech that evening and said that if we were to become a Republic, we would be out of the Commonwealth and that we would be lonely and poor and alone. Sir, I want to quote the following, in order to give yet another indication of his lack of insight, from Hansard of 23 March 1961 Vol. 107, col. 3524)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the past we always had the feeling that if this matter got to the Security Council and there was difficulty, there was a possibility of Great Britain exercising her veto because we were a member of the Commonwealth. Does the hon. gentleman think that is going to happen now?</block>

<p>Here again we see that lack of understanding, Sir. He insinuated that this would definitely not happen again and we all know that it has in fact happened recently. Once again this simply shows up his lack of understanding. But he went further and, on 23 March 1961, in his speech the night before the referendum, he said on 23 March 1961 (Hansard, Vol. 107, col. 3525)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in other words, what we are doing is that we are entering a period of uncertainty in South Africa: We are entering a period of growing isolation; we are entering a period of growing difficulties as a result of what has happened in London &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, in addition to its lack of understanding, the Opposition has shown itself to be a pessimistic party as well. All this time they have also been talking about &#x201C;too little too late&#x201D;. When we refer to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s d√©tente offensive in Southern Africa, which is described throughout the world as dramatic, it is passed off by him and his party as &#x201C;not far enough and not fast enough&#x201D;. Sir, I say that they have shown themselves to be a pessimistic party. That reminds me of a very good German saying I heard recently to the effect that pessimism gets one no where. This is true of that party too. In fact, over the past three decades the United Party has not grown at all; there has only been a process of dying off and defection. Just look at the seats taken next to them by the late members of the United Party&#x2014; almost a third of the Opposition benches. Sir, I want to go further and say that I am grateful that the United Party is with us today in accepting the Republic of South Africa and being proud of it. But the irony of the matter is that in this process they have learnt absolutely nothing because just as they had no understanding in the past of the national aspirations of the nationalistically minded people of South Africa, in the same way they display a lack of understanding of the national aspirations of the Coloured people of South Africa. Their lack of understanding is proved by the fact that they have had a number of policies in recent years, so many that owing to lack of time I am unable to mention them all here. They have continued to insist&#x2014; and it is unnecessary for me to quote from Hansard although I have it here&#x2014; that South Africa represents one big nation, but in that conglomeration of people there would be White leadership; in other words, a negation of the Black man&#x2019;s highest aspirations and ideals in the political sphere. Sir, I now come to their latest policy, the latest federation policy that displays a new facet with every new session, because in 1971 the Leader of the Opposition was still talking about a sovereign White Parliament. Eighteen months later, in 1973, one of the chief policy architects of the United Party, the hon. member for Durban North, said that he wanted to be honest. He said that he could foresee this White Parliament eventually disappearing, because if that were not the case, the whole concept would be a fraud. How true that is!</p>

<p>I am still coming to the hon. member for Yeoville. It would in fact have been a fraud towards the non-Whites, to whom full independence and self-realization was held out as a prospect but who would never have got it. But then, like people who are fast asleep and who have no idea of what is going on around them, when they came to their senses they went so far as to abdicate, as has now been done once again by the hon. member for Durban North. <span class="col_1139-1140" refersTo="page_0585"/>Then they reached the stage when they capitulated as Whites in this country before the numerical superiority of the non-Whites. Sir, it is unnecessary for me to give you a r√©sum√© of the United Party&#x2019;s new federal policy, because the hon. member for Durban Point did so yesterday in the House in a very enthusiastic and dramatic way. Then a new facet, which I want to discuss in a moment, became evident. But I want to tell you, Sir, these people eventually abdicated as Whites because this overall federal parliament, the umbrella parliament, will become the sovereign body.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>But it is so, and I shall prove it to you. Surely it is true that it has been said that the White Parliament will eventually disappear. They spoke in terms of &#x201C;it is going to phase out&#x201D;, and then, after all, it is only normal for the numerical superiority of the non-Whites to dominate this federal parliament. Surely that is a hard fact, Sir. [Interjections.] But before I come to what the hon. member for Durban Point said yesterday, I still just want to add this. At the stage when this capitulation was taking place, the United Party began to disintegrate again. Surely that is why the hon. Minister for Tourism and Indian Affairs is sitting on our side of the House&#x2014;he refused to throw in the sponge as the White man in South Africa. That, after all, is why he is sitting here. Yesterday the hon. member for Durban Point declared with great verbosity that when this system of theirs is eventually implemented and all the people of South Africa have confidence in this federal parliament, a referendum will be held concerning the continued existence or the abolition of the White Parliament, and he said with emphasis: &#x201C;All the people of South Africa&#x201D;, which implies that it will be White, Black, Brown and Yellow who will decide on this. Now I just want to ask the United Party whether they will allow this to take place on the basis of one man, one vote. [Interjections.] Sir, I am very sorry for the United Party. They say I do not understand it, but there can be no other interpretation of these words. I can quote his Hansard to you. He said very clearly that if all the people were in favour of and had confidence in the federal Parliament, a referendum would be held by all the people in South Africa.</p>

<p>I have the Hansard here, unfortunately for you. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When this Parliament has set up this structure and has gradually transferred powers to it and the stage is reached where that federal assembly has won the confidence of the people of South Africa and is functioning satisfactorily and with security for all, then this Parliament can, on a referendum or special election, transfer all its residual powers, the keys to the security of the State. When those powers are transferred, without equivocation, this Parliament will be <i>functus officio,</i> it will have no further role to play as the sovereign authority in South Africa. If you should ask me whether this would happen or should happen, the answer to all these semantic games would be &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Then he goes further and states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the federal assembly would have to enjoy the confidence of all South Africans.</block>

<p>In the mind of the United Party, as we have learnt to know them over the years, &#x201C;all South Africans&#x201D; means all the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>A few days ago, when the hon. member for Bloemfontein East took part in the no-confidence debate, he elicited two replies from the hon. members for Simonstown and Edenvale. The hon. member for Edenvale said that the White Parliament would disappear, but the hon. member for Simonstown said that it would not disappear. I want to know from the United Party how they explain that. On what grounds does the hon. member for Edenvale understand that the White Parliament will disappear? Does he, too, understand it wrongly, just as I do? After all, he sits in in the inner circles of the United Party! How can the United Party continue to exist like that? I want to ask them, in all honesty, how they can continue to exist while accommodating within their party such diverse ideas and policy directions. That, after all, is what is really happening.</p>

<p><span class="col_1141-1142" refersTo="page_0586"/>The United Party has become a party that commits suicide in the most painful way imaginable, because recently, during the palace revolution, when they had the chance to rid themselves entirely of the elements who do not think like the Old Guard, they let the chance go by, because the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who is really the spiritual father of this palace revolution, is still sitting in the United Party. When the splintering off of the new group took place, the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Edenvale ran to the Press and issued a statement that they were staying in the United Party. Why did they find that necessary if they had not been associated with the people that have now broken away from the party? Why did the hon. members for Newton Park and King William&#x2019;s Town not find it necessary to issue such statements? Surely that is clear proof that the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Edenvale were in contact with those who broke away, but that they did not have the courage of their convictions to follow through what they had started.</p>

<p>The United Party members say that we do not know what we are talking about when we referred to the referendum that can only be a national poll. That is the only explanation I can find for this. By means of a national poll, finality will have to be reached concerning the continued survival of the sovereignty of the White Parliament. I say that this is a policy with such dangerous implications for White South Africa, that it is unthinkable that any White voter should ever cast a vote in favour of that party again.</p>

<p>I want to come to my second accusation, namely that owing to its actions, owing to its blind condemnation of and resistance to the National Party and the idea of Nationalism, the United Party has caused an unpleasant connotation to be attached to the concepts &#x201C;patriotism&#x201D; and &#x201C;nationalism&#x201D; among its own people and particularly among its studying youth. It is possible to distinguish between these two concepts, but never to separate them. Let us seek a brief but meaningful definition for patriotism. All it means is that a person is driven by his love for what is his own, to guard it jealously and protect it, because it makes one so much more mature. Because the true patriot has love, respect and appreciation for what belongs to him, he can also understand that those who are different, of a different colour or a different language, can also have an understanding, love and appreciation for what is theirs. However, we have had the disturbing situation that the youth that has fallen within the sphere of influence of that party opposite, has begun to act unpatriotically, has started doing things that have really been unpatriotic and which would have disturbed law and order in the country and could have caused chaos and ultimately, possibly anarchy. Through their student organizations they even collaborated with the enemy. When the Police acted timeously and vigilantly to restrain the rebellions of these people, the United Party condemned the Government in an irresponsible manner. I can only call it irresponsible If the hon. members want me to quote Hansard in this connection, I can do so. The hon. member for Durban Point was one of those who talked about a fascist government and in spite of the fact that he knows that the entire hostile world attaches a particularly unpleasant connotation to the concept &#x201C;fascism&#x201D; he used that word when speaking before students about the behaviour of Police towards them. The United Party condoned and tried to defend these people&#x2019;s conduct until they found themselves in the Schlebusch Commission, and indisputable facts, which they were unable to reason away, opened their eyes. Only then did they realize&#x2014;again they displayed, initially, that lack of understanding of the real situation in South Africa&#x2014;that they were feeding and pampering a monster. Surely such people who always realize too late exactly what is going on in South Africa and what the prevailing tendencies are, can never govern a country. Surely the voters are only fundamentally right when they reject the United Party to an ever-increasing extent at election after election. And now I am pleased to be able to say that the Opposition, when they eventually realized, with the facts before them, what they were dealing with, at least continued to sound a positive note. This applies to a large section of them and not to the whole Opposition, because again there was that dividedness among them. In spite of the most extreme abuse ever directed at any body in the country by the English Press, they continued to sound a positive note. During the previous session the hon. member <span class="col_1143-1144" refersTo="page_0587"/>for Mooi River almost became my hero on the Opposition side when he addressed a timely and positive warning to the English-speaking youth of South Africa. I think all of us still remember that speech. However, the important question is: &#x201C;Why only now?&#x201D; These people are always accusing us of &#x201C;too little, too late&#x201D;, but why did they only wake up to the problems they themselves had cultivated when the alarm bells in South Africa were already ringing insistently? The Progressive Party has been guilty of precisely the same, and of even worse, by leading our studying youth at the English-language universities along the path of unpatriotic deeds. We know that through the years the hon. member for Houghton has been the spokesman for every liberal and radical faction in this country. However, they are not a factor in South African politics, nor will they ever be one, and therefore I leave them at that.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to say that the United Party are the people who are always talking about change. This is the refrain they took over from Mr. McMillan. In our thoughts we can still hear him making his &#x201C;winds of change&#x201D; speech several years ago in the coffee lounge of the House. The winds of change have already blown Mr. McMillan into oblivion and has blown the United Party towards a stage virtually identical to that of Mr. McMillan, because they, too, have virtually been blown into oblivion. What Mr. McMillan and the United Party did not take into account is that the winds of change in South Africa are represented by the National Party Government. Every important change that has taken place or has been effected in South Africa over the past three decades has been initiated by the National Party Government. In fact, the National Party Government represents the winds of change in South Africa. I want to tell the Opposition this afternoon that under the strong leadership of our present Prime Minister these winds of change will continue to blow, and blow so strongly that if the Opposition does not begin to build up an understanding of what is really going on in South Africa and what the latest tendencies are, they will be blown right off the scene. These winds of change will bring South Africa to a stage at which there will be a meaningful future for all its people, self-realization for each nation and group in this country, and to the stage at which everyone will be grateful to the National Party for the leadership it has given over many years to make their future meaningful.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe the hon. member who has just sat down will accept my not replying to his speech. I want to take this opportunity of dealing with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana before the Natal Supreme Court comes to its final decision. The fundamental dilemma of White politics in South Africa can be reduced to two main questions, i.e. whether the Whites of South Africa believe that it is necessary for the preservation of their civilization, identity and culture to dominate the other groups in this country and whether discrimination on the grounds of race and colour is essential for the preservation of the civilization and identity of the Whites. One can set aside all the other questions and considerations. If the Whites of South Africa can reach finality with regard to these two fundamental questions, we shall be able to determine our future and solve our problems. In fact, we shall be able to ensure our future and our identity in this country. The fact of the matter is that the line which divides those who believe in domination and discrimination on the right from those on the left who do not believe in domination and discrimination is the ultimate line running through White politics in South Africa. It runs through the political parties, in particular through the Nationalist Party and the United Party. I would say that my party stands to the left of that line. We do not believe that one group should, in any way, dominate another group. We do not believe in discrimination based on race or on colour. That line cuts a wide swath through the caucus of the United Party. The difficulties and divisions that have occurred within the United Party are wholly the result of the fact that there is a group of people in that caucus which believe that Whites must dominate. There also sits in that caucus a group of people which does not believe that the Whites can or should dominate. The first group mentioned namely the reactionaries&#x2014;believes that discrimination based on colour cannot be dispensed with. The second group mentioned namely the reformists, the enlightened people on the <span class="col_1145-1146" refersTo="page_0588"/>left, believe that discrimination based on race must go. This is the dilemma of the United Party and of White politics in South Africa. The United Party must solve that problem before it can regain the respect of the South African electorate and become an effective and serious opposition. I have absolutely no ideological, principle or policy differences with the hon. member for Edenvale or the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. [Interjections.] As far as I know, their ideas and beliefs are entirely the same as mine. However, there are people sitting in that caucus whose attitudes on race I find repugnant and abhorrent. It is impossible for a person, in conscience and with a sense of responsibility to his country and people, to sit in a caucus where there are two groups so totally opposed in their fundamental philosophy and thinking. When the differences are pointed out, there is always a denial. I wish I had the opportunity &#x2026;</p>

<p>I shall point out the differences with pleasure. The hon. member who has just spoken pointed out that in this very House when the split was taking place, the hon. member for Simonstown clearly indicated that he stood for a dominant White Parliament having veto rights over all others. The hon. member for Simonstown is at least honest, he is at least a man with courage who says what he believes, but why do the hon. members for Maitland, Newton Park, Albany, and other hon. members who believe in exactly the same things as the hon. member for Simonstown, not stand up in this House and back him and say that they believe in a sovereign White Parliament for South Africa? [Interjections.] That is the difficulty which we have. While they are talking about a sovereign White Parliament, why do they not stand up and say that they are not prepared to carry out to its fullest consequences the policy of doing away with discrimination based on race? Why do they not come clean with South Africa? Why do they not come clean with the electorate?</p>

<p>I have the nerve to use the word &#x201C;clean&#x201D; and if the hon. member for Durban Point is not careful he will come off second best. Let us put it on record that the hon. member for Simonstown stands for a sovereign White Parliament in South Africa while the hon. member for Edenvale is opposed to a sovereign White Parliament. I agree with him. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout does not agree with either side. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Bezuidenhout says that the White Parliament must remain, but that it must not be sovereign and that it must not control other peoples. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says one day that it will go, the next day that it could go and the hon. member for Durban Point does not know whether it should go or whether it should not go. In that caucus, reduced to 37 members, you will find 37 different interpretations of the United Party&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>Let me get down to discrimination in Natal. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana spoke about discrimination. When the United Party in Natal do away with discrimination by employing non-Whites in positions previously held by Whites, I applaud them. I look at their motives, however, and I find that they are often ulterior in nature. I shall tell hon. members why I say this. When non-Whites are employed in positions previously held by Whites they do not pay them the rate for the job; they pay them rates of pay which are consider ably below the rates paid to Whites. What do we have here? We have the removal of discrimination, but the introduction of exploitation of people of colour which is just as despicable as discrimination. Let us be absolutely honest about this. It is all very well for the hon. member for Umhlatuzana <span class="col_1147-1148" refersTo="page_0589"/>to get up and give us a long list of things which they are doing in Natal. I applaud Natal for it, but until that hon. member can get up and tell this House that they have done away with discrimination based on colour and at the same time that they have introduced the rate for the job, the credibility of that hon. member and his party remains in question.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. what the hon. member for Bryanston to whom we have just been listening really did was to run away from Randburg to Bryanston. Then he ran away from the United Party to the Reform Party. In these difficult times in which South Africa and the world find themselves, one is grateful, particularly after having listened to a speech such as the one made by the hon. member for Bryanston, and hon. member who represents those people in South Africa who have a guilt complex about the non-Whites and who want to cause other Whites in this country to develop a guilt complex as well, that the National Party and its leaders have at this particular juncture emerged, not only in South Africa, but also in Africa and the world, as leaders and responsible people to whom the government of this country may be entrusted. One is grateful that this is the case, for it makes one shudder to think what would happen if one of those parties were to come into power in South Africa. The parties on that side have on various occasions told us, in season and out, of the responsibility of an opposition in South Africa. We do not want to deny that an opposition party in South Africa has a responsibility and has the right to castigate this Government and this side of the House when it thinks the Government is erring, but if one considers the highly irresponsible way in which the Opposition parties have been acting recently, and particularly in this debate, I want to say, as one of my good United Party friends in my constituency who is a respectable person, said &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Can a United Party supporter be respectable?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there are some of them. Surely that hon. member has heard that there are disputes in that party. That United Party friend of mine said that although he did not vote for the National Party, he prayed every evening that the National Party, particularly in these difficult time, should remain in power. [Interjections.] Yes, there are good people among them. However, if one considers the irresponsible manner in which the party on the opposite side states its case here, one becomes afraid, for it consists for the most part of a babel of tongues. The hon. member for Bryanston has once again indicated very clearly how many differences there are in the ranks of the Opposition. If what the hon. member for Bryanston said is true one may well expect the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to be the next person to establish a new party. If that happens, one can expect him to take one member with him, namely the hon. member for Edenvale. <span class="col_1149-1150" refersTo="page_0590"/>In that case we will have in this House an opposition party consisting of some 30 members, a Progressive Party with seven members, a Reform Party with three members and a Basson Party with two members.</p>

<p>When we conduct a debate such as this, we must be serious, for to conduct a debate such as this to its conclusion, a debate which can last 12 hours, costs the country thousands of rands. Under those circumstances it is pathetic that, whereas one has on the one hand the highly responsible attitude of this Government and of the speakers on this side of the House, that put South Africa&#x2019;s interests first and that have a policy which can do justice to everyone, one has on the other hand, in contrast, Opposition parties that are scratching one another&#x2019;s eyes out and disembowelling one another. This is the luxury which an Opposition Party in South Africa can experience under the sound administration of a National Party because it can also, like that United Party supporter in my constituency, feel that it is safe under a National Party government and can allow itself the luxury, as a white party, of carrying on as it is doing in its own ranks. Our people have taken cognizance of this as well, and for that reason they returned this National Party to this House as they did at the last election.</p>

<p>I think we should return to the debate a little. This is a financial debate, and I think that since we have a new Minister of Finance we should confine ourselves to matters relating to his portfolio and to matters which are of importance. If one considers the arguments raised on the opposite side concerning the financial position in South Africa, we see that they were nothing but haphazard statements. One would have expected the parties opposite to have accepted this Government&#x2019;s word with regard to what it has recently been saying. Even people abroad are prepared to accept our word. They should have accepted our word and considered the components we have brought into our financial policy, the monetary and fiscal measures which the Government is trying to make applicable. One could have expected hon. members opposite to have attacked our policy on those points to which we have given sharp prominence to the components we have established for growth and progress and the necessary development, and for harmony between races &#x2014;the way in which we want to develop this country further, how we should utilize our capital resources, our resources and our manpower to best serve South Africa. One would have expected them to have levelled positive criticism at this overall image which we have established. That was not the case, and for that reason I want to indicate briefly on this occasion what goals this Government and this side of the House have set themselves.,</p>

<p>This Government has repeatedly put a high premium on the fact that we have a capitalistic economic structure in this country in which free competition and free enterprise has to play its part. Furthermore, I want to say that the State does not want to venture into the domain of private initiative, because that domain should be left open to the private initiative and commerce. Only recently the Minister stated that he was prepared to have an investigation instituted into the question of whether the State is not erring in venturing into this domain which is in fact reserved for private commerce within our capitalistic structure. That is our first standpoint.</p>

<p>Secondly I want to say that we ought to give a little consideration to what factors the authorities in South Africa should take into account in regard to economic growth. The first one I want to mention here is our political policy. In this country the National Party is advocating and implementing a policy which is in the best interests of all people in South Africa, which recognizes the objective of having to afford everyone a right to existence, each within his own area. To be able to do this we must give prominence to this excellent policy of the National Party consistently, every day, and try to realize it to the best of our ability, and since this country is being governed by the National Party it is the duty of the Opposition parties in this country to support this Government when we are taking steps in the interests of all, for in any economic set-up it is, firstly, necessary for one to have a stable government in the country. Sir, nowhere in the world today will you find such a stable Government as we have here in South Africa. The United Party is also aware of this and that is why they can afford to squabble in this manner, for they know that they find themselves under the wing and the protection of a stable National Party Government, which cannot be defeated in an election, which does not indulge in double talk, and which is able to state its standpoint to the entire world.</p>

<p><span class="col_1151-1152" refersTo="page_0591"/>Upon further consideration of the monetary measures, one finds it is important to have advance planning. It is also important to have a division of costs within our department. In the past we adopted a standpoint in regard to these matters. We accepted a budgeting system which contained certain objectives: How we should undertake the necessary financing; how we should ensure our economic stability by taking other steps, by a system of income tax which would not cause uncertainty as is the case in many other parts of the world, but in which initial and investment grants would also play a role and the pressure of taxation would be distributed as evenly as possible. Sir, these are objectives which the National Party Government set itself. In the same way we adopted standpoints in respect of the financing of housing. In respect of agriculture we have a certain financing policy. In respect of export promotion, of industrial financing, of industrial decentralization, we have also stated our standpoint. All these aims are clearly circumscribed and built into the fiscal and monetary policy which is being applied in South Africa. Sir, these things are important, but the picture should also be seen as a whole, and for that reason one would expect an intelligent Opposition, if there is anything of that nature in South Africa, to have come forward with positive criticism and to have pointed out to us where we were erring, but that we did not get from them. They do not, like patriots, speak with praise of what this Government is trying to do. Sir, we have a country with many problems, with its diversification and its various peoples, lust think of the question of the water supply during the next few years; of the infrastructure, the power and railway networks, which had to be established; of the development of the homelands; of the creation of an ever-increasing number of work opportunities. Let us consider our economic development programme which was instituted, in which all these components are contained and evaluated, and in which we adopted a standpoint and at what rate South Africa could grow over a period of five years. Sir, let us consider how we have fared within that economic development programme of ours. Sir, we have achieved great success, for the policy of this Government is to bring about balanced development in South Africa in the long term, with maximum growth and the minimum of inflation. Sir, these two things are not always reconcilable. Very thorough computations have to be made; the correct standpoints implemented and extended, for one is dealing here with complexities, complexities which daily occupy our Minister of Finance and his department, our Cabinet Committee, and most of this Government in steering the South African ship of state along the best course, along the course of growth, at the highest possible growth rate, with the greatest possible degree of stability, with opportunities for all, but also with sound relations. I think the National Party deserves the praise and the gratitude of a great many people for what has recently been accomplished, for the achievements it has attained. To our United Party and Progressive and Reform Party friends I say that they should not talk so much; they should look more and listen more. Then they might still be able to learn something from the National Party.</p>

<p>Sir, you will permit me to turn to another matter. In my constituency, in the catchment area of the Vaal Dam, i.e. on both sides of the Wilge River, and along the banks of the Vaal River on the Free State side, and along the edges of the Liebenberg Vlei, great losses have been suffered by the farmers owing to the heavy rains of the past few days, the flooding of those rivers and the fact that the Vaal Dam is overflowing. While we are grateful for the good downpours in our sowing areas throughout the entire country, particularly now in the planting season, even though they were a little heavy in some places with the result that we were unable to plant, one should like to express sympathy here in public today with those farmers in my constituency and also in other constituencies which have suffered damage. I want to tell you, Sir, that this is perhaps not as sensational as when a gale tears through a town and rips off the roofs of eleven or twelve houses. These floods and flood damage have taken place quietly, over the next hill where many people cannot even see it. On this occasion I should like to bring this very pressing and very serious matter to the attention of this hon. House. According to a survey which was made by the District Agricultural Union of Frankfort, a total of 3 866 morgen of maize fields have been flooded in the seedling and cob stage, and it is calculated that farmers will suffer an overall loss of approximately R483 628. Lucerne lands to the <span class="col_1153-1154" refersTo="page_0592"/>value of R14 991 have also been devastated, as well as wheat to the value of R4 200 which still had to be harvested, grain sorghum to the value of R3 200, and sunflowers to the value of R2 000. This has all been lost. In addition 1 354 morgen of grazing land has been silted up and will be unusable during the next season. Some farmers have lost almost everything. With the exception of 25 morgen the lands of one farmer, Mr. Ben Wilkinson of Villiers, have all been flooded. I have been informed that the harvest of this entire flooded area has been destroyed. Plusminus 600 morgen of maize fields belonging to another farmer, Mr. Gert van Rensburg, of Schweinemunde, near Frankfort, has been flooded. You know, Sir, it is good land there, along the rivers, and conservatively calculated his damage amounts to nothing under R76 000. Large areas belonging to other farmers have been flooded, and the total losses in crops which had reached an advanced stage are calculated at R529 628. This is quite apart from miles and miles of fencing which was also destroyed in the process. Sir. I say that we must think of these people this afternoon, and also of our neighbours in Standerton and lower down the river at Vereeniging. We want to thank the Department of Water Affairs and the Government for the timeous steps which have been taken to control the floods to the best of their ability. We appreciate this, and we are grateful for it. We also want to emphasize that this damage has been considerable, not only for individual farmers, but also great damage for South Africa owing to the loss of food which one cannot afford at this stage. In our towns at least, the damage has not been as extensive. Vacation resorts, etc., have been flooded and rondavels are under water up to their roofs. We are pleased that there has been no loss of life, not as far as I know. We hope it will be possible to control the mass of water lower down in such a way that farmers and towns there will suffer the least possible damage. I should like to ask on this occasion, because we feel ourselves at liberty to do so and know the National Party Government, and because we know what they have done in the past, that after it has been established what the situation is, the necessary auxiliary measures will be taken which will place them in a position to deal with the problems which they are left to deal with alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is already half past five and we have listened to a number of Opposition speakers, but not a single one of them has discussed the Part Appropriation which was introduced here. On the contrary. All we saw them do was to wash their dirty linen in public. These are the people who are supposed to constitute a responsible Opposition. These are the people who have at times called themselves the watchdogs, the people who have to guard the interests of the people outside. In this way they waste the money of the people outside, by discussing their own problems in public in this way.</p>

<p>A few nights ago a few of my colleagues and I went along to a professional wrestling match. It was an entertaining evening and something of a farce. In the last fight, when the huge American, Jonathan, was wrestling in the ring with a certain Apollo, it put me in mind of the United Party. Apollo seized the huge American and led him around like a lamb. He darted across the ring with him and rammed his head against the pole. Then he turned round and ran back to the opposite side of the ring and dashed his head against that pole. I then called to mind how the hon. member for Yeoville had taken the hon. the Leader of the Opposition by the hair last year as he also did quite recently, had darted across the ring with him and rammed his head. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition only managed to shake his head before the hon. member for Yeoville seized him once more and dashed his head against the other side. The promoter of that fight was standing on the outside looking very smug. He was satisfied and not concerned about the outcome, since he was able to fill his purse. They then announced the next fight. That is precisely what we have here. The next fight for the United Party will involve Mr. Winchester the hon. Senator, who will seize the hon. Leader and will dash his head first again this side and then against that. Do you know who the promoter is? No one but the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He is the promoter of this fight and at the moment he is standing smugly outside the ring, watching them bash one another&#x2019;s heads and seeing some of them become punch-drunk. The hon. member for Bryanston told us more about them here. The hon. the Prime Minister said that the hon. member for Edenvale was trailing behind them at his leisure. They cannot get him to move faster. He has the same <span class="col_1155-1156" refersTo="page_0593"/>principles as these Reformists. They must please not speak about &#x201C;reformers&#x201D;, for then they would be raising a delicate matter as far as our people are concerned. In Jameson&#x2019;s day a small group of people tried to employ the same methods to take over the r√©gime, the same methods as those which these Reformists have used. Surely the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is the father of this child. He is the man who conceived this child but who does not want to admit now that he is the father of the child. Nevertheless, in my opinion he has accepted the role of being the child&#x2019;s godfather. After all, it was the English Press that cherished great expectations as far as he was concerned. It was the English Press that held him up as the future leader of the United Party. When he could not have his own way, however, and the Old Guard was not satisfied with him, he looked elsewhere, to someone in the Transvaal. He looked at the Transvaal leader of the party, the hon. member for Yeoville. These Reformists, too, cherished great expectations of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. member for Edenvale. After all was it not the hon. member for Yeoville who persuaded the hon. member for Edenvale to leave the University and to stand for election at the last election? Actually, the hon. member for Edenvale was a Progressive, but he has now left the hon. member for Yeoville in the lurch completely. I think, however, that the hon. member for Edenvale is doing some deep thinking, for his executive committee moved an unanimous motion of no-confidence in him and rejected him and his school of thought because he had left the hon. member for Yeoville in the lurch. As I have said, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout conceived this baby but does not want to admit now that he is its father. But at what time did he and the others think they could take over the United Party from the inside? It was when the hon. member spoke behind his Leader&#x2019;s back &#x2014;I am speaking of Sir De Villiers Graaff, the official leader of the United Party&#x2014; and told everyone how disappointed he was in the leadership of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He was the one who told the head executive of the United Party on the Witwatersrand that he had been sitting in the Opposition benches for 13 years and that they had lost every no-confidence debate up to that time. He was the one who gave this testimonial to his leader and he was the one to whom the hon. member for Yeoville was referring when he said that one of the qualities of a member of a party was that such a person should at least have self-discipline and loyalty towards his leader and should reveal his principles. At that time it was not simply a matter of his having no confidence in his leader. He had confidence in the hon. member for Yeoville. He saw him as the new leader of the United Party. It was on that same occasion that he told the new leader of the United Party in the Transvaal that if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was too weak, &#x201C;Then you, Harry, must do the job&#x201D;. That occasion also afforded him the opportunity to show that he had backbone and would be prepared to accept responsibility for this baby. However, he refused to do so. The reasons for this are, in the first place, that he, as the hon. the Prime Minister put it, first wanted to watch developments from a safe distance in order to see what was going to happen and how many followers they would have. After all, we are <i>an fair</i> with the political past of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. When he thought things were not going well for the National Party, he got out and formed his new party. When things went badly for him there, he returned to the United Party. At the moment he is again watching developments to see how things are going for these Reformists. If there is any hope for them whatsoever, I predict that the hon. member will join them one of these days. If, however, he were to see that the chances were slender, he would simply carry on as of old and be the promoter of further fights in the ranks of the United Party. The hon. member told us that they had set their house in order. They swept out all the dirt, if I may put it that way. But surely one does not set one&#x2019;s house in order that way? A house in which there has been such confusion, in which such fights have taken place, also has to be disinfected, for there are still many germs around, Basson germs, Olivier germs, Winchester germs and Scheepers germs. They are all still there, and until that house has been completely disinfected, the sore in the United Party will never heal. It would be quite interesting to know how the estate is going to be divided now that this splintering has taken place. I am thinking of Dr. Anna Scheepers. Half of her belongs to the United Party and the other half to teh Progressive Party. A portion of the part which belongs to the United Party <span class="col_1157-1158" refersTo="page_0594"/>will have to go to the Reformists now. Actually, it was with the aid of the Reformists that she came to be in the Senate. We should like to see the division which is going to take place now. The hon. member for Yeoville said here that they had made use of his financial resources, and I believe it. However, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that the organization had collapsed in the Transvaal and that the whole lot of them were bankrupt. Subsequently Sister Anna&#x2014;I mean Dr. Anna Scheepers &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, my opponent. She subsequently sent out begging letters in order to collect funds. She sent one to the Garment Workers&#x2019; Union, <i>inter alia,</i> in which she told them about the financial difficulties of the United Party. She also complained about having had to give a month&#x2019;s salary to the United Party and asked whether the trade union would not be so kind as to make a small contribution to the United Party. Fortunately the trade union saw the matter in such a way that they said: &#x201C;Anna, we did not ask you to go to the Senate&#x201D;&#x2014;and I do not believe they would ever have supported her either &#x2014;&#x201C;and therefore we are not prepared to contribute a cent towards getting you out of your difficulties&#x201D;.

<p>He says I am a bad Nationalist because I am getting under their skin. Now I want to put the question to the hon. member for Simonstown for the last time. He can merely nod his head and indicate to us whether Senator Winchester is a good U.P. man. He refuses to do so. [Interjections.] However, I can understand this. Senator Winchester wrote a letter to the chairman of the caucus and said that as long as John Wiley was sitting in that caucus he would not attend another caucus meeting. What he has against him I do not know, for he tells us that Senator Winchester is a good U.P. man. I wonder whether he is going to tell us at some time what personal animosity there is between them.</p>

<p>I want to say a thing or two about labour. In my view it was quite striking that in every major debate we had, labour matters were one of the first subjects they raised.</p>

<p>Labour matters are raised each time. Hon. members will recall that last year during the motion of censure, which was moved in the second session the hon. the Leader of the Opposition rose in the House and said&#x2014;and this was bruited abroad by the English Press &#x2014;that they were in favour of Black trade unions and were also in favour of Whites having to work under non-Whites. That was their new policy.</p>

<p>We told them at the time that we knew what the origin of that change in their policy was. We said we knew that it had become their policy as a result of the pressure which had been exerted by the Young Turks&#x2014; i.e. Messrs. Dalling, Van Rensburg, Schwarz and Enthoven. Its origin was in the pressure which was exerted by that leftist wing. Now I should like to know from the hon. member for Maitland, who is so talkative, whether it is still their policy; are they still in favour of Black trade unions and are they still in favour of Whites working under non-Whites. The hon. member can simply say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;.</p>

Was it as a result of pressure on the part of those hon. members or did it come from the Leader of the Opposition? The hon. member must say whether the pressure came from their side. The hon. member for Sandton goes not want to reply. I know the hon. member for Bryanston will have enough courage to tell us. He is honest. He will tell us whether that change took place as a result of pressure which was exerted by their side.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says he will reply at a later stage, but I can tell you now what his reply is going to be. He is going to say it was as a result of pressure from their side that the United Party moved in that direction. We have discussed trade unions many times in this House, but never before, until we assembled here last year, did the United Party express itself in favour of Black trade unions. On the contrary, last year during the election campaign, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition announced that they were not in favour of Black trade unions and that they were satisfied with these liaison and works committees since they functioned very efficiently. Only afterwards did we get that sudden volte face. As I have said, the volte face came as a result of pressure exerted by the leftists in their own ranks. After this breakup we shall listen with interest to hear whether it is still their policy. What does the Old Guard say? Do they still feel that we should be delivered to Black trade unions and that Whites should work under non-Whites? Last year, these liaison and works committees were spoken of with scorn and derision. The U.P. men delighted in the strikes which took place here for they saw another possibility in them. They hoped that those strikes would cause chaos in the country so that they could make political capital out of it. But the opposite happened. The National Party did not take fright and surrender. The National Party did not yield to the pressure exerted by a certain group of people, pressure which was fanned by irresponsible agitators. The National Party did not yield to that leftist pressure in the ranks of the United Party. On the contrary, in 1973 the National Party introduced legislation to extend those bargaining possibilities between employer and employee. We said, however, that we would not allow Black trade unions, but that we would use the liaison and works committees as cornerstones, to let them serve as a bargaining channel between employer and employee, as is the case in most Western countries.</p>

<p>What is the situation today in this regard? Now those people are disappointed because there are no more strikes. Now they are silent about the functioning of the liaison and works committees. The wind has been taken out of their sails. Now we shall not longer hear them plead for the establishment of Black trade unions.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark told us a few things about the inquiry conducted by the University of the Orange Free State into the functioning of those liaison and works committees. He pointed out what success had been achieved by them and what satisfaction they had already brought. In my opinion, the most important finding in the report is the fact that only <i>5%</i> of the Black workers asked for bargaining machinery. This story which we heard from the United Party and the Progressives day <span class="col_1161-1162" refersTo="page_0596"/>in and day out, i.e. that it was the Black people who wanted Black trade unions, was negated by this finding. It was quite simply a case of agitation which had been sparked off by certain Whites. There are quite a number of them sitting here in the United Party. In that way they tried to incite the Blacks against the Whites so as to cause chaos in the country. All day long we hear reproaches against the Government, as though the White man had a guilty conscience towards the Black man in South Africa. The impression is always created by the Opposition &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, I said they had used their influence in order to get a request for Black trade unions. That is what I said, Mr. Speaker. They used their influence and we know that the hon. member for Yeoville advocated them at the time that he was still in their ranks. Half of their Senatrix, Dr. Scheepers, also advocated them. So they did use their influence so as to influence the Black people to try to get Black trade unions, did they not?</p>

<p>The impression is created by the Opposition that it is the White man who is the suppressor of the non-White in this country and that it is the White man who does not grant the non-White or the Black man in South Africa a right of existence.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. A. REYNEKE</person>:</from>

<p>As I was saying this impression is also being created in the outside world. We have ample proof of that. South Africa has been spoken of repeatedly as a police state and we have often been referred to as Nazis. It is often said, for outside consumption, that the Black man is being suppressed here in South Africa and that it is this very National Party which exploits the Black man for its own gain. However, I shall tell you who the guilty ones are. It is the United Party and the Progressives; they are the people who should have a guilty conscience since they are the people who constantly tell the outside world that the non-Whites in South Africa are being treated unjustly. I want to tell you who has that guilty conscience. That guilty conscience belongs to the United Party and the Progressive Party. They do so because their own consciences are troubling them. It was the United Party, when they were in power, who were the suppressors; they are the people who were the exploiters of the non-White and the Black man in South Africa. It was particularly in the years when they were in power that they had the opportunity to display their goodwill towards the Black man here in South Africa. They did not make use of that opportunity and that is why their consciences are troubling them. By placing the National Party in the dock they want to try and compensate for the sins the committed. They now want to give everything to the non-White in South Africa in that way. We have no objection to pleas being made for rights and privileges for the non-Whites in South Africa. However, the National Party says it will not do so at the expense of the White man in South Africa. To salve the conscience of the United Party the White man has to be <span class="col_1163-1164" refersTo="page_0597"/>sacrificed. That is as they want it and as we have heard from various members of the Opposition, i.e. that they are prepared to sacrifice the White Parliament, that the White Parliament has to disappear in South Africa and that the sovertignty of the White Parliament has to disappear in South Africa and that the sovereignty of the White Parliament has to disappear. I do not know whether their policy is still the same as the one they advocated yesterday. Perhaps the hon. member for Durban Point could tell us whether he still feels as he did yesterday, i.e. that in terms of their policy the White Parliament has to disappear.</p>

<p>What did the United Party ever do for the non-Whites when it had the opportunity? Absolutely nothing, Mr. Speaker. Let us see what they did in the field of education. They left it to the churches. What opportunity in any field was ever given to the non-White here in South africa as to enable him to hold his own and preserve his own identity? Sir, we reject these accusations which have been levelled at the National Party because the National Party has no guilty conscience at all. On the contrary, it has a very fine record because it provided for the survival of every population group here in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, in conclusion I just want to say this: As long as the United Party continues in this vein the statement of the hon. member for Durban Point, after the election last year, will hold true; the hon. member said: &#x201C;The Nats are in for ever&#x201D;. Sir, I also want to quote what the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said last year at a meeting of the head committee; I quote from <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 7 November 1974 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He appealed to Sir De Villiers Graaff to order the recalcitrants from the hall. In the election of 24 April the United Party had virtually been destroyed, he said, and if another election were to be held today, the party would not win a single seat.</block>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I always find it interesting to listen to the hon. member for Boksburg, or at least to the first half of his speech, because I find myself enlightened by a graphic description of all the political cartoons which have appeared in the last week or two. The second half of his speech I do not find so interesting.</p>

<p>Sir, the question of trade unions raised by him will be dealt with in the course of this debate by other hon. members on this side. I do not propose to deal with that question at any length, except to say that our policy of giving Black workers access to trade unions is a policy which was formulated by a committee of which the hon. member for Hillbrow and the hon. member for Maitland were the two conveners.</p>

<p>Obviously, Sir, I cannot deal with all the points raised by the hon. members for Sasolburg and Heilbron. I want to refer to just one or two. Sir, in this debate, at a time when the Government is committed to eliminate, as a matter of urgency, discrimination based on colour, there has been no contribution from any member on that side of the House to show how that is going to be done under their policy. We have had nothing but generalities from them. We have been told that we want to sell the White man down the river. We have had generalities from them about the wonderful fiscal and financial policies of this Government. I wonder if the hon. the Minister of Finance will be good enough to tell us why, if this infrastructure which is required for our economic development has been so carefully planned and constructed, it is necessary to levy an additional surcharge of 20%, making a total of 40%, on imported goods carried by the Conference Lines. Sir, can you imagine what that is going to do to the cost of living of the ordinary person in South Africa? Let us hear why this increase is necessary instead of having this boasting in general terms that everything is well under this Government.</p>

<p>Sir, I was also interested to listen to the speeches of two of my former colleagues who are sitting behind me. I would have thought that on an occasion such as this one would have had something constructive from them. As far as the hon. member for Yeoville is concerned, we had a certain number of platitudinous political ideas from him about civil liberties, the removal of discrimination and the sharing of power, but there was no constructive attempt to spell out how he intends these things to be done. One can only assume, Sir, that that is so because he finds no fault with the policy of the party which he has now left. As far as the hon. member for Bryanston is concerned, I could not believe <span class="col_1165-1166" refersTo="page_0598"/>my ears this afternoon when I heard his description of this terrible party, the United Party, and its terrible caucus, made up of verligtes and verkramptes, of people like the hon. members for Newton Park, Albany, Maitland, Simonstown and myself. When did he suddenly discover that this was there? Until he was expelled from that caucus, he happily enjoyed all the amenities and privileges of being a member of that caucus and he exercised his political activities within the framework of this party and enjoyed all its facilities. But now that he has been expelled, he suddenly finds that this was the terrible life he had to live, with no complaint, I might say. But what does he do now? He now enjoys the one relic of what he had; he retains the seat he won as a United Party candidate.</p>

<p>I believe that we are in this House at this time concerned about the fact that the time has come that we must be precise and not vague as to how we view certain matters and as to what steps must be taken in the future. I say it is necessary because this is a time when the hon. the Prime Minister is making endeavours to achieve detente in Southern Africa, an effort which is being supported, I believe, by every right-thinking person in this country and in this House, an effort which is being watched with anxious anticipation by the whole of our population. Sir, this is a time when it is basically essential that we should seek common ground in an approach between State and State, when we have to seek an approach to find a place for the individual which will lead to peaceful co-existence in this country. This is a time when we must realize that we are of Africa and that our future lies in Africa, and that our future and our security depend on the goodwill and the understanding of the nations in Africa. Sir, as regards discrimination I think there can be no argument that we have in South Africa reached a position of common intent among the Government, the official Opposition and the Progressive Party, a common intent which accepts that discrimination based on the grounds of colour alone and race alone is indefensible. The Nationalist Party have said that discrimination on the ground of colour alone is indefensible and that we, the Whites, cannot deny in terms of a policy which has been basic to their idea of separate development, that we cannot deny the non-Whites the political and economic opportunities which we demand for ourselves. That is according to Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s original statements when he first discussed separate development. The Progressive Party has announced the four lovely aims it has, and according to <i>The Argus</i> I see that it has a commitment to get rid of race discrimination. We of the United Party have also spelt out that we stand for a just and fair society aimed at the removal within its federal framework of all discrimination on the basis of skin colour alone, and I assume for the present that the group which sits behind me similarly intends to remove discrimination. From what I have said, there is unanimity on the objective which we want to achieve, and if we have got that, it is a good start. Then surely, in heaven&#x2019;s name, we must set about finding the means to attain that end. Sir, there is no dispute among us. There is no dispute in this House that discrimination on the grounds of colour must go. Now we must work out the details and provide the mechanism to achieve that end. Sir, we each have an inescapable&#x2014;and I say it with due respect to my colleagues who have been here longer than I have&#x2014;obligation towards the electorate that put us here, to find the means of achieveing that particular objective. To this end there is need for us to discuss the simple question of where we go from here. None of us would have expressed these intentions unless we realized that indefensible discrimination does exist. We would not have said that it is our policy to do away with discrimination, as has been said also by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, if discrimination on the grounds of colour did not in fact exist in our way of life. If that is so, we must accept that the elimination of discrimination requires from us adjustments and adaptations in regard to the personal status and respect as individuals for non-Whites where that respect is now missing. I am not saying it is missing in all cases. We must face adjustments and adaptations in regard to the opportunities and the rights and the economic life of the non-White-people in the Republic. We have to face adjustments and adaptations in respect of the political rights and responsibilities of the non-White people, and most of all, individually in this country, we must have adaptations and adjustments in regard to personal attitudes. To be meaningful, these must of necessity be <span class="col_1167-1168" refersTo="page_0599"/>basic and fundamental adaptations and changes.</p>

<p>I am grateful that the hon. the Minister of Community Development is here because I want to deal with the situation that has arisen in regard to the Nico Malan Theatre complex. This issue is no longer a minor local affair of theatrical entertainment which concerns Cape Town only. What is done in regard to the Nico Malan has and will have national and international repercussions and consequences. Any action which is taken provokes a reaction and the reaction which has been provoked by the decision of the Executive Committee of the Cape Province has undone every good reaction that resulted when the hon. the Prime Minister through the Administrator said that Capab could decide how they were going to handle that theatre. What is the sequence of events? The Government authorized the use of that theatre on an open basis. There was some approval and some disapproval expressed. Capab then considered the matter because it was referred to it as the controlling authority. Capab then requested the fully open use of the theatre. However, yesterday the Executive Committee of the Cape declined this request and came forward with some idea of Saturdays and Mondays for Whites and all races in between.</p>

<p>This position of permits is becoming rather ridiculous. When a sporting body asks for a permit to play sport and it happens to involve Bantu, the decision is not made by the hon. the Minister but by the Department of Bantu Administration or the local committee. They say whether the permit should be issued or not. Where is his discretion? The authority that was given to the Executive Committee of the Cape Provincial Administration by the Government and which was announced by the Administrator was that Capab would be asked how they wanted to use this theatre. Capab has been quite open, definite and explicit. It wants to open it at all times, for all people and for all performances. Now the Executive Committee decides otherwise. I know how the hon. the Minister of Defence feels about it. I am sure that this Government can use its authority and its power to see that the outgoing Administrator revokes that decision and that he does so quickly before he gets out. I believe this is an urgent matter.</p>

<p>Let me go on to some other adjustments and adaptations which cannot be delayed. Naturally there are differences on methods; there will be differences between us on the methods for and the timing of the elimination of discrimination. The changes that we have to make in this country to fulfil the undertakings we gave before the United Nations must be meaningful. They must not violate but reconcile the reasonable needs of the White people and of the Black people; they must calm the fears of minorities. I make no apology for repeating what I said last week. I repeat the view which we in the United Party have accepted and which we believe are the needs which have to be reconciled. I quoted from our federation policy in that regard. What we have to do in handling questions of race relations is to reconcile the needs of the Whites who want security in a country where they are outnumbered, who want to be sure that their civilization and their achievements are protected, that their standards, property and enterprise will be safeguarded, with the needs of the Blacks and the other non-White communities. They want relief from political impotence and economic stagnation. They want the right to greater opportunities in self-government, education, work, medical services and social welfare. They want a fair share in the progress and growth of South Africa which could end without their contributions. That is the dilemma in which we find ourselves, namely to reconcile these two needs. The first thing we have to ask ourselves is how we are going to set about doing this. Let me deal with one basic issue. A question which must be very squarely faced and honestly answered is: Can we reconcile these needs and eliminate political discrimination within a unitary form of government?</p>

As I see it, a <i>sine qua non</i> in a unitary system is one sovereign Parliament Even accepting the establishment in South Africa of all the Black states having independence, the Republic will remain multiracial. I even go so far as to say that that will still be the case even if all the urban Blacks are politically attached to their homelands. South Africa will still be a multi-racial state with White, Indian and Coloured communities. How can one in that situation eliminate political discrimination on the grounds of colour in a unitary state with a single Parliament? The only way is for Parliament to become multi-racial. That is the only way. If one has a unitary set-up, that multi-racial Parliament must function on the basis of one man, one vote or again there will be discrimination in respect of the people who are entitled to representation. The position is aggravated by the fact that when we look to the future we find that with two exceptions only, the Black homeland leaders have said that they do not want independence. The hon. the Prime Minister has said that if the Black homeland leaders do not take independence, the position will stay as it is. That means political discrimination against the Black people of South Africa because of the unitary system which <span class="col_1171-1172" refersTo="page_0601"/>we have. I do not believe that this can be the end of the road. I hope that someone will spell this out for us. Where does one eliminate political discrimination on the grounds of colour in a unitary system even if one assumes that all the homelands are established and all the Blacks are attached, for political purposes, to the homelands? Here we will still have the Coloured, Indian and White populations. The realistic position, however, is that the homeland leaders do not want independence and must therefore be accommodated where there is no political discrimination.</p>

<p>Surely attention must be given to the other side of the picture. It is not a question of whether it is &#x201C;ons beleid&#x201D; or &#x201C;julle beleid&#x201D;. I am stating facts now. Let us look at the alternative, which is the federal system. Let us forget for a moment all the details and look at the principle of a federal policy. The Progressive Party agrees with us that a federal policy is the right one for South Africa. However, they want theirs on a geographic basis while we believe that it can be approached on a community basis. A federal system of government can accommodate the peoples of this country and eliminate political discrimination. I believe that that can be done and that the matter should be discussed. Let me turn to one particular point. I asked the hon. the Prime Minister this session about the appointments to various boards. The hon. the Prime Minister replied that he would deal with the question during the debate. In the debate he said that he was engaged in compiling lists of the boards and of representation on the various boards. He went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to mention only a few which are intimately bound up with the way of life and the existence of these people.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. the Prime Minister said. That is a recognition of the fact that there are fields of government and administration where it is impossible to separate and to create separate authorities on a racially separate basis. That is why he said he was going to make the appointments. There are matters of common and indivisible concern which cut right across race barriers. These appointments to boards, however, are not meaningful political rights.</p>

<p>They involve basic administrative functions in which the non-Whites are to participate. I agree with the hon. the Prime Minister in one respect. He said that all separation is not necessarily discrimination. I now come back to the question which the hon. member for Waterberg asked yesterday: Do we believe in group areas? We as a party are as much opposed to compulsory integration as we are to compulsory separation. What we do believe in is that there should be a freedom of association which is basic. We accept the need for separate residential areas but they must be fairly allocated and justly determined. The discrimination arises in the manner in which those separate areas are provided. Let me remind the House of what has happened when group areas have been determined by this Government. 80 000 Coloured and Indian families have been required to move while only 1 500 White families have been required to move. Could there not have been a dispensation which places less of a burden on one group than on another?</p>

<p>Yes, I am giving the figures of the families who are compelled to move. They have not all moved yet. I am giving the figures relating to this argument of discrimination. The hon. the Minister must also face the fact that there has been discrimination in the allocation and siting of areas for the non-White people. There has been discrimination and it cannot be denied. That is why I say that separation can be effected without discrimination, and I cite this as an example, provided that it is fairly and justly done.</p>

<p>Last year during the debate on the motion of censure I listed a succession of statutes which have imposed separation, apartheid, or whatever we want to call it in this country. I believe that if the Government is determined to remove indefensible discrimination on the grounds of colour, one must note that we have no legislation before us as yet for this session to amend the vast number of statutes which will have to be amended, nor have there been proclamations or Government notices in the <i>Gazette</i> in which there is an indication of change and adaptation. I think these questions must be asked of this Government and must be answered soon. These questions are important and they must be answered in this House. Are we prepared <span class="col_1173-1174" refersTo="page_0602"/>to reopen professional and scientific associations and councils to all qualified persons irrespective of colour? Will lawyers, advocates and scientists have their associations irrespective of colour? I do not expect anybody to give me the answer now, but these questions have to be answered. Are we prepared to permit those persons providing public amenities such as restaurants to decide on the customers that they are prepared to serve? Will the people who have established these amenities be able to decide whether these amenities will be open to all races, to Whites, Blacks or whatever they want?</p>

<p>I say this because this has to be done. There are other matters which I wanted to deal with, but the time which was allotted to me is about to expire. In conclusion I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Justice&#x2014;who unfortunately is not here &#x2014;in connection with the students who are still under restriction in terms of the Communism Act I want to remind this House that the present hon. Minister of Indian Affairs and of Tourism said on 27 February 1973, and I quote from Hansard col. 1509:</p>

<block name="quote">I think it should be made clear that nowhere could the commission find that these activists who were abusing the organization of Nusas, had been motivated by any intention to further the ends of Communism. We cannot substantiate that.</block>

<p>That was a statement made by a present Minister of the Cabinet. At that stage I asked that these papers should go to the Attorney-General or that these students should be released from their restrictions. Last year I asked again that that should be done and although the papers were sent to the Attorney-General no decision was taken. There is no earthly reason why these students should continue to be placed under these restrictions which have been imposed upon them, contrary to the opinion of a man who is now a member of the Cabinet. Obviously the then Minister of Justice thought otherwise, but it is contrary to the opinion of a man who is now sitting in the Cabinet. I want to appeal to him to use his influence in the Cabinet to persuade his colleagues to accept his point of view because, after all, he heard the evidence. The Government wanted a parliamentary Select Committee to go into this matter. He heard the evidence and perhaps he will be good enough to convince the hon. the Minister of Justice that the time has come that these restrictions on the students should be terminated. I hope that it will be done; it should be done soon.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Green Point is someone who is always listened to attentively. I think that it was worthwhile to listen to what the hon. member had to say. I am glad that he made a few statements this afternoon with which we agree. To begin with, there was the appreciation which he expressed for the line of action followed by the hon. the Prime Minister with his policy of d√©tente in Southern Africa and Africa, and his proposed standpoint, as far as relations in South Africa <span class="col_1175-1176" refersTo="page_0603"/>are concerned, to bring about d√©tente as well, so that there may be ethnic and racial harmony on a basis of no discrimination. But I think that if one thing has become clear from the speech of the hon. member for Green Point then it is that we are speaking at cross purposes as far as the concept &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; is concerned. We use the same word, often in the same sense, but the substance of that concept differs noticeably. The hon. member for Green Point also used the word and attributed it to the hon. the Prime Minister, but I think that he must go and read again what the hon. the Prime Minister said in the no-confidence debate in August last year when he pointed out that the concept &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; could be used in two senses. The one, he said, was in a good and more positive sense to which he actually preferred to link the word &#x201C;differentiation&#x201D;, and the other was in a bad sense where it had the meaning of prejudice, and of drawing a distinction to the disadvantage of somebody else. I do not think that the hon. member for Green Point drew an adequate distinction as far as this was concerned. He said, for example, that the Immorality Act amounted to discrimination against the non-Whites. I want to ask the hon. member whether the abolition of the section concerned in the Immorality Act would not mean precisely that there would be discrimination against the non-Whites. I asked the hon. member for Bezuidenhout on a previous occasion with reference to what he had said, which party would suffer if immorality or free sexual liaison between White and non-White were to be allowed in South Africa. If children were born as a result of that immorality, those products would not normally find their way into the White community, but the non-White community would become the dumping-ground of the products of immorality Between White and non-White. I want to ask the hon. member for Green Point whether that would not be tremendous discrimination against the non-White. Should the non-Whites not be protected against this?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point made a fuss about certain facilities which must be thrown open. When he addressed this House on a previous occasion, he also spoke about the Nico Malan Theatre. He said that he really hoped, &#x201C;it will be open to all races at all times for all performances &#x2026;&#x201D; and he continued in this vein. He also said, &#x201C;There must be no niggardly separation or differentiation as regards seating in this complex&#x201D;. I do not want to speak about this subject straightaway, but I shall indicate the implications of the standpoint of the hon. member in the course of my speech.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. P. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to answer that now. I shall tell you shortly. Before coming to that, I want to dwell for a moment on what the hon. member for Newton Park said. The hon. member for Newton Park, in an attempt to escape the miserable situation on the opposite side of this House, tried to sneer a little at the logical standpoints and consistent implementation of the standpoints of certain people on this side of the House. If a person opens his mouth to speak, it is assumed that he will present a logical argument. Therefore it was strange to me that he wanted to employ the logical to discredit logic. If a man has a standpoint, he must carry its implications through after all. Then, surely, he must enumerate the things which proceed logically from it and that is what I have been trying to do, in all humility, as far as my standpoint is concerned, viz. to carry what is inherent in one&#x2019;s standpoint to its implications in practice, in other words, logic and the consequences thereof. That is what Dr. Verwoerd did and that is what our present hon. Prime Minister does, viz. to carry through the practical implications from a standpoint of principle, a policy standpoint. However, we must not use or abuse logic to discredit logic. The logical is a certain aspect of reality, just as number is an aspect of reality, just as the ethical, the aesthetic, the legal, and others, are all aspects of reality. One must not discredit the logical, because then one distorts reality. I just wanted to explain this to the hon. member for Newton Park on the basis of philosophy. He looks intelligent enough to me to be able to follow it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park also made an attempt&#x2014;a very feeble attempt &#x2014;to show how there would supposedly be a difference of opinion on this side of the House. It was a feeble attempt, because look at the diversity of opinion on the opposite side. Look at them. I do not even have to elaborate on this. His attempt was so feeble that it fell flat immediately. He tried to draw a distinction between the <span class="col_1177-1178" refersTo="page_0604"/>pragmatists and the dogmatists. I supposedly belonged to the dogmatic group and others to the pragmatic group. Sitting on this side of the House we have people who have a certain policy and standpoint based on principles, who lay down a policy dogmatically and from that dogmatic standpoint, work out the practical implications pragmatically and apply them in practice. We are dogmatic and practical at the same time. We have certain fixed standpoints from which we depart. In a moment I shall come to the dogmatism of these hon. members and indicate how they have learned a great deal from Dr. Verwoerd, especially the hon. member for Durban Point. He spoke a language in this House which corresponded almost to the word to the standpoint of Dr. Verwoerd in respect of certain matters. As far as dogmatism is concerned, those hon. members can lay no reproach at our door. As far as pragmatism is concerned, there is certainly a difference between pragmatism as a sort of ideology or way of life and a practical approach. The practical approach one does find on this side of the House and in its leader.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the opposite side want to play us off against one another. For example, they want to play the hon. the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defence, me and others off against one another as if the one were a dogmatist and the others pragmatists. I want to refer hon. members to statements by the hon. the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has made certain statements which are as dogmatic as a statement can be. For example, I want to refer to his statement about the authority the sovereignty which the White man wants to retain and will retain over himself. I do not know if it is necessary to read it to the House. But this is what he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For my part I have stated very clearly that I reject federation because I am not prepared to make any part of the sovereignty of the Whites, of whom the hon. member and I are the leaders, subordinate to any other people or nation.</block>

<p>Now, is that purely a pragmatic approach or is it a tremendously positive declaration, a dogmatic premise, viz. that a certain authority, a sovereignty is seated in the White and I refuse to share it with anyone else? [Interjections.] I am glad that you are listening to this. The hon. the Prime Minister went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has nothing to do with White supremacy. It only has to do with self-respect in the sense that I want to rule over my own people alone and that I am not prepared to share my sovereignty with any other people, White or Black, well- or ill-disposed.</block>

<p>When we speak of a sovereignty which a people has over itself, it is not just a power which it exercises in the abstract or a power which is demonstrated here in Parliament or wherever. When it comes to the sovereignty of a people over itself or, in other words, the right of self-determination which a people exercises over itself, then it has to do with its highest function in legislation and the implementation thereof, but it also has to do with the self-determination of that community down to the minutest segment of social life. Then there is no area which is neutral ground to one. Then each area is seen from the point of view that the right of self-determination of a community also applies to that area. From this point of view of the right of self-determination of a community, its authority and its claim in every area is determined. That does not mean that it cannot make a concession to other members of other communities. It does not mean that a distorted image has to be created, as the hon. member for Newton Park tried to do, viz. that if one stands for apartheid or separate development, one can never come into contact with somebody, can build a bridge or have a gate in one&#x2019;s fence. The point is, that if one builds a bridge, one assumes that there is a river and if one has a gate, that there is a fence, and if one provides a door, that there is a wall. Those hon. members want to suggest by their approach that the bridge is there to be lived on. To my mind the bridge is there to be used when one has occasion to do so, but it emphasizes the very fact that there are separate areas, and in the separate areas there is separate authority. That is the standpoint from which we on this side of the House depart.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister emphasized another point very strongly, viz. that one must protect the identity of one&#x2019;s people; one has a right to the protection of one&#x2019;s identity. I read a passage to you from what he said in a speech at Potchefstroom (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1179-1180" refersTo="page_0605"/>You must not advocate a direction which can cause friction or aggravate it and most certainly not a direction, because it will not be tolerated by people, which will lead to the identity of any people being damaged or destroyed.</block>

<p>That is a very strongly stated standpoint, but a standpoint which is directly at odds with the standpoint which the hon. member for Green Point took up here, viz. that the Immorality Act must disappear. The Immorality Act does indeed have to do with the preservation of the identity of the White man and even with the protection of other identities in South Africa. That is a very definite premise. It is not purely a pragmatic premise; it is a premise based on the assumption that here is a community which has a right to its own identity, which has a right to self-determination and to safeguarding itself, also by means of legislation. One can also refer to other standpoints of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014; <i>inter alia,</i> that we maintain order and want to eliminate friction thereby. Everything is linked to the idea that there are different communities. The hon. members on the opposite side also speak of communities, and even want councils for these communities. We also depart&#x2014;they learnt it from us &#x2014;from the idea of communities, each of which has a right and wants to maintain that right, if need be by means of legislation, and if that does not suffice, by means of violence as well. That is our standpoint. The approach of the opposite side of the House is that they merely recognize that there are different communities, and that they live in different residential areas. For the rest they do nothing about it. Therefore one must not obstruct people if they want to move from one residential area to another and have mixed residential areas. For our part we are prepared to go further than merely recognizing that there are communities. We are prepared to pass legislation and apply it to protect the specific community in its identity and in its right to what is its own.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s reaction to the decision on the Nico Malan theatre makes it very difficult for different people, they are making it difficult for people to come there, rather than facilitating it. Their standpoint arouses a resistance and an aversion in many of our people who do not want to be pushed into integration in this liberalistic way. [Interjections.] I am coming to that. Sir, when one speaks about discrimination, one has to do with the typical liberalistic or individualistic approach on the one hand, which amounts to any individual, of whatever colour or race he might be, having equal claim in any community or any place in the country with any other individual in that country. This is the typical liberalistic approach. It is not just a case of &#x201C;one man, one vote,&#x201D; but that each person has the same right in any situation as any other person.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout says that this is the Christian approach. May I quote a Biblical text to him? I quote to him what the Apostle Paul said on the Areopagus when he said that God made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth and determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation. Now the hon. member may go and read any book, whether dogmatic or exegetic, and he will find that everyone appeals to these words from the Scripture for the fact that there are not only different peoples, but that the peoples, in order to exist peacefully, must exist separated from one another. I can quote to him&#x2014;and since I am dealing with this point, I shall do it. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Bezuidenhout allows me to get to the top of my form. I quote to him from a study, not even of my church, but of the Reformed Church, in which they say, that (translation) &#x201C;from the fact that God gives every people its place (Acts 17, verse 26) it follows that if two peoples or races live in the same area and each wants to preserve its identity (and they do want to do <span class="col_1181-1182" refersTo="page_0606"/>that) there will be indescribable tension; territorial separation between peoples is one of the real factors in opposing undesired mixing and the national existence being threatened&#x201D;. It goes on to say, &#x201C;The idea of a multi-racial people in one territorial area must be rejected on Scriptural grounds.&#x201D; That is the Christian standpoint and I hope the hon. member for Bezuidenhout will do some studying and will bring us a few good Christian books from which he can prove the contrary. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, I say that the typical liberalistic approach is that each individual has an equal right in any place in the world. But it is simply not the case. Our approach is an ethnic approach, one of different communities, and that side of the House also accepts different communities. Sir, they speak so often of discrimination. Which party introduced segregation&#x2014;in those times it was still the term&#x2014;into the Post Office? I was a student at Stellenbosch in the forties and it was that party&#x2019;s great predecessor who applied segregation in the Post Office, first at Stellenbosch. But now it is apparently not good enough any more, because change is the fashion in that party. Take group areas. They, too, have been saying now that as long as they are applied justly, it is in order. But, Sir, suppose someone is not satisfied in his group area and he prefers to stay in Constantia, or someone there is not satisfied and wants to stay in Athlone, will those hon. members then pass a law to prevent such a person from going outside his group area, or do they want to give him the freedom to stay where he wants to and to mix with whom he wants to and to create problems, even problems for their own voters&#x2019; roll, because that is compiled on a racial basis? What are those hon. members going to do? They will be obliged to adopt measures to protect people in their residential areas and to safeguard them against instrusion by others. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope that you are not suppressing applause on my side!</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park quoted from an article of mine in <i>Die Transvaler</i> on a previous occasion, but he quoted very badly, because there I stated the very standpoint which I am now trying to state, viz. that if one&#x2019;s premise is that of liberalism or of individualism, it means that one cannot take up the standpoint taken up by the United Party, because they accept group areas and separate voter&#x2019;s rolls. With separate voter&#x2019;s rolls they will experience major problems if the Immorality Act is abolished, because how is a child to be classified who is born from a mixing of people who are on different voter&#x2019;s rolls? I think this is an answer which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout owes us.</p>

<p>The hon. members speak a great deal against discrimination, but I have said that they must take cognizance of what the hon. the Prime Minister said. The hon. the Prime Minister said that cognizance must be taken of the use of the word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D;, because it could be used in a bad or a good meaning. I wonder what the hon. members will say if I quote a person who is very often quoted by them in support of their standpoint. I refer to Prof. Nic Rhoodie who wrote in <i>New Nation&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">If the premium placed on a nation&#x2019;s survival also, amongst others, includes discrimination, that nation will pay the premium for as long as circumstances permit it to retain the initiative in determining the conditions of its own survival.</block>

<p>Therefore, when the survival of a people is at stake, it will make those arrangements which will safeguard its survival. To some this is discrimination; we say that these are arrangements which it makes for its own safeguarding. If it does not want to discriminate, it must see to it in any case that the same arrangements are made for the survival and the rights of other communities co-existing with it. One eliminates discrimination if one gives the same right to others co-existing with one. I can continue to quote from what Prof. Rhoodie wrote. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As long as the Whites are adamant to exist as a separate nation, their collective efforts to protect their interests will unavoidably embody the selective treatment of those out-groups living in close physical proximity to them.</block>

<p>Therefore he uses the word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; in respect of groups with whom the Whites come into contact and against whom the Whites safeguard their existence and <span class="col_1183-1184" refersTo="page_0607"/>identity. I suppose the hon. the Prime Minister will call that action &#x201C;differentiation&#x201D;, where one distinguishes between one&#x2019;s interest and those of others and protects one&#x2019;s interests against the interests of others, as long as the others co-existing with one, are granted equal opportunities and one makes provision for them as well and provide facilities for their convenience which are equal to those of one&#x2019;s own.</p>

<p>The hon. Opposition must realize one thing, viz. that as far as the National Party is concerned and whatever substance they give the concept &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D;, the National Party&#x2019;s policy is a policy of separate development. In practice separate development means separate facilities as well. It is for these reasons that we had heated debates in the &#x2019;sixties on separate universities for the various ethnic groups. What did we do? With the establishment of separate universities for the separate ethnic groups we said that it was normal for a people to have such institutions of their own, but because those universities, at the time of their establishment, could not offer their students a choice of all subjects, the concession was made that such students could be accommodated at White universities on the understanding that full provision for those students at their own universities would be made as soon as possible. That is separate development, but it is also separate development with justice where one is in the position, from one&#x2019;s position of laying claim to one&#x2019;s own, to make a concession to others who do not as yet have the same facilities and opportunities. This is the example, I think, which is used in connection with the Nico Malan theatre, viz. that we grant the non-Whites an equal facility in their own area, and until such time as there is an equal facility in their area, the concession is there so that they may indeed use the Nico Malan.</p>

<p>Is it a concession?</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. P. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>That is purely from our standpoint. The hon. members on the opposite side accept just as we do that there must be group areas. If their group areas idea has any substance, it means that the non-Whites must get full facilities in their own group areas. The hon. the Prime Minister said during a debate last year that this was the shortcoming and that it was a reproach which could be hurled at us, and that private bodies, local authorities and even the Government could be reproached because equal facilities had not been created in time for all people. This is what separate development is. Separate facilities which are provided on an equal basis. If it can be done on an equal basis, there is no discrimination, because then what one demands for oneself is being granted to others.</p>

<p>I want to come to the explanation of the hon. member for Durban Point of their policy. I am sorry he is not here, but perhaps he will read what I am going to say. When the hon. member for Durban Point spoke about discrimination he said something very interesting. In reply to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s question he expressed himself as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If one community, the White community, says that it will have its own schools, because that is its right to do so, that is not discrimination based on colour. It is the right of the Whites to do so if they should wish to do so in the same way as it is the right of a private school to refuse admission to one White child and to accept another White child. It is the right to discriminate between two applicants who wish to go to the school.</block>

<p>Therefore the hon. member speaks of &#x201C;one community, the White community &#x2026;&#x201D;. In other words, he demands for the White community the right to discriminate&#x2014;that is the word which he uses&#x2014;not against others, but between its own community and other communities. If there is an attempt to encroach on the rights, the freedoms and living space of the White community by someone else, it has the right to discriminate between its right and the demand by the other person, on the understanding&#x2014;and I think hon. members will agree with me here&#x2014;that if one puts up such a barrier, it is one&#x2019;s moral duty to help the other person to obtain a similar and equal facility alongside one&#x2019;s own; otherwise it could suggest discrimination. I just want to point out that when we speak of an absence of discrimination, there evidently is a difference of opinion in the ranks of the Opposition. As far as this question is concerned, the hon. member for Durban Point and the hon. member for Green Point differ. Those are two &#x201C;points&#x201D; which are very far from each other, Green Point and Durban Point. The <span class="col_1185-1186" refersTo="page_0608"/>one says, &#x201C;Discriminate&#x201D;, but the other says, &#x201C;No discrimination&#x201D;. I think the Opposition must settle that point for themselves.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point gave a survey of their policy and said what their committee had done. This committee considered the conditions which exist and what he called the &#x201C;facts of life&#x201D;. Now what are these &#x201C;facts of life&#x201D;? They were interesting and I agree with many of them. When one looks at the realities in South Africa and does so objectively and with a little understanding, there cannot be much difference of opinion as to what one sees. At the beginning of his speech he said: &#x201C;We found that there were in South Africa different, identified and identifiable racial communities.&#x201D; Surely that is an obvious truth! Even the United Party has perceived this great truth after all these years. The hon. member also said: &#x201C;We found different ethno-cultural identities amongst our people.&#x201D; Of course we go further than that. We do not merely observe it, but accept that these communities are the subjects of rights as well, that those rights are enforceable and that legislation can be passed in respect of these rights.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point also said the following: &#x201C;We found that to a large extent they lived in separate identifiable residential areas.&#x201D; It is a fact in South Africa that things came about and developed in that way. When the National Party came into power, it did not merely observe this phenomenon as a fact, but it also observed a situation in which there was integration and mixed residential areas. No less a body and none other than the Afrikaans churches appealed to the authorities to consider the evil consequences which arose from the mixing in such residential areas and insisted on legislation in this connection. In other words, the difference between this party and that party is that we do not merely observe, but do something about it. The United Party only wants to observe, but look what has become of all that observation. This Party is prepared to do something about it. [Time expired.]</p>

<heading>LABOUR SITUATION IN SOUTH AFRICA</heading>

<summary>(Motion)</summary>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House calls on the Government to recommend to the State President that he appoint a commission of inquiry into the labour situation in South Africa, with particular reference to the labour requirements of the mining industry.</block>

<p>The primary motive in moving this motion is to draw attention to what I believe is one of the most important single issues in our national life, namely the use of our labour. Usually we debate this issue in the somewhat heated atmosphere of a no-confidence debate or a part appropriation debate. I have deliberately sought to draw attention to it by way of a private member&#x2019;s motion, because perhaps that will create a setting in which we can consider this important problem in a more calm and sober manner. The intention is also to create an opportunity for the Minister or Ministers involved to respond to this problem that we pose and to do so, I hope, in the spirit in which we raise it, because I think that on this important issue of labour, we must forget our political postures. I believe that we are possibly experiencing the calm before the storm, and perhaps it is true to say that this is one field in which we should review the situation and make very dramatic readjustments. That in fact is the essence of this motion, to look at the labour situation and to try to determine how we should approach it. The mechanism which is specified here, the device that is suggested, namely that of a commission appointed by the State President, is obviously not one that we are wedded to. It is normally just a device which one follows. All I want to suggest is that I believe it is essential for us to look at the labour situation and to do it in depth. When you do an analysis of this kind and make a penetrative analysis, then a commission of experts, people who have no political obligations, might well be the best way of handling this particular problem.</p>

<p>I make no apology for drawing attention to the problem of labour in this country. It is undeniable that the patterns which are set now will determine for many years what is going to happen in this particular field. We are at that phase of economic development in this country where we are moving rapidly from a subsistence to a mass consumption society, which again emphasizes the importance of labour. We live in an era of inflation where all of us are conscious of the rapid erosion of our money values, and perhaps the only counter to inflation is productivity, and that you can only achieve through the better utilization of your labour forces.</p>

<p>I think that labour and what we do in the industrial setting is also important from another point of view, because it is in the work situation where our people of different races and different colours very often work shoulder to shoulder. It is very often in the factory situation, on the shop floor and down in the mine where there is close contact between people of different races. Obviously what happens in that work situation can have a spill-over effect and can affect race relations in a much broader sense. I think it is also true to say that that what happens in the labour relations field can have a spill-over effect as far as our relationships with our neighbours in Southern Africa are concerned, because of the vast numbers of migratory workers that we have in South Africa. It is against this background that I want to draw attention to only a few aspects of the labour problem in South Africa. Colleagues on my side will be emphasizing other aspects.</p>

<p>The one issue to which we must refer briefly is the question of labour peace. For years we have been priding ourselves on the fact that we have such a peaceful labour situation in South Africa. That, of course, is true. But I regret to say that there are indications and many signs that we are entering a new age which will lead to very considerable worker unrest. I believe that the statistics do not always give a true reflection of what is happening, but it is certainly true and we have been told <span class="col_1189-1190" refersTo="page_0610"/>officially by the Government that during 1973 some 70 000 workers went on strike in about 120 different factories or work situations. In the 18 months up to June 1974 there were over 300 strikes. These are the broad statistics, the official figures, but the position in practice might be very much worse. Unfortunately, in the mining industry, these disturbances have also taken a distinct line. We know that over the last year more than 60 people have been killed in disturbances on the mines.</p>

<p>I think it follows from this that our communication systems with our workers are inadequate. I think one of the first things we should therefore do is to see whether it is possible to improve the communication procedures which exist at the present time. It is true that nearly all these strikes in recent years have occurred amongst the Black workers. The fact that Black workers have no legally recognized trade unions may be entirely fortuitous, but on the other hand may be an important contributing factor. We are not, at any time, wedded to trade unionism. We are not trying to suggest that if you were to change the Industrial Conciliation Act and were to extend legally recognized trade unionism to all Black workers, it would constitute a panacea and would overcome all our labour problems. We do not say this, but at the same time I think it would be obstinate on the Government&#x2019;s part to continue with the point of view that you can only have works or liaison committees and nothing beyond that. The works or liaison committee can obviously fulfil an important role in this labour situation, but the works or liaison committee is primarily a communication device and not a negotiation device. I think this should be understood.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark made great play last night of the study which was made by the University of the Orange Free State where they found in a survey that where these committees operated there had been a significant improvement in the industrial situation. Workers felt happier, there were fewer stopages and productivity had gone up. That is so and one would expect this to be the case, but this takes one back to the classical Hawthorne experiment in America where for the first attention was paid to worker productivity. There they found that when you have a group of workers and improve the physical environment in which they operate, they all work better and produce more. In the second part of the experiment the physical environment was made much worse, e.g. the lights were dimmed and the ventilation was made much more difficult. They found that even under these adverse conditions the workers still produced more. The answer why this should be so is obvious: For the first time the management took some real personal interest in the workers. That is why they produce more and not because of a change in the physical setting in which they operated.</p>

<p>I think the Government would be wise to remember that the unionization of Black workers is going to come. There is nothing we can do to stop it. Already you have 22 different Black unions operating in South Africa and surely there is nobody on the Government side who is going to pass a law to make them illegal. But it goes beyond this. If these unions are not permitted to form here in South Africa they will be formed elsewhere. Already in Lesotho mineworkers are establishing a union. The president of the Chamber of Mines has said that he will find it difficult to negotiate with them. This might be so, but I would much rather negotiate with unions which function in my own country and over which I might have some control, then to negotiate with unions which operate from foreign territories. The choice before us, as I see it, is not whether we are going to have unionization for Black workers or not. The fact is that we are going to have Black unions. In fact, we have them now. As such, we must direct their efforts in such a way that they will play a peaceful and constructive roll in the industrial set-up in South Africa. If we do not do so, if we deny them this role, we shall be doing so at our own peril because we shall then be creating non-White unions which might be up to a lot of devilry in the society in which we are living.</p>

<p>There is another entirely different issue which I believe one should look at, i.e. what our labour requirements are in South Africa. I do not believe that we have the machinery at the moment for making the exact kind of estimates that are necessary for forward planning. The hon. the Minister of Labour, talking vaguely, says that in 1977 we will have a shortage of 82 000 White workers in this country. His statistics might be perfectly relevant and entirely accurate, but globular figures of that kind <span class="col_1191-1192" refersTo="page_0611"/>are not really helpful to us. Let me pose this simple question: How many instrument mechanics will we require in South Africa in five years&#x2019; time? I suggest that it is very difficult to supply an adequate answer to that question because I do not believe that we have the basic planning machinery in South Africa to provide us with meaningful statistics of that kind. What I want to draw attention to is the fact that I believe it to be absolutely essential for us to create the machinery for proper manpower planning and for the subsequent development of manpower that will follow.</p>

<p>Another entirely different field that the Government will have to investigate is the adequacy of the existing laws. Quite clearly, many of them are antiquated and obsolete. For years we from the Opposition side have pleaded that the master and servant regulations and laws be done away with. We have always been told by that side of the House that this could not be done because an hiatus would be created which would lead to immense problems. Then recently, when the Americans said that they were not going to buy our coal unless we did away with this legislation, the laws were changed overnight by way of a General Laws Amendment Bill, and no one has cried over that. There are obviously many other legal enactments that should be similarly treated. Take a simple issue such as the regulation of wages for Black people. For that there are two entirely different devices. There is the Wage Act and there are agreements which are covered by the Industrial Council. The Industrial Council agreements, it must be said, cover only about half a million Black workers, and yet we know that nearly six million of them are economically active. Obviously, then, only a very small sector of the Black economic work force is covered. Worse than this, however, is the fact that Black workers are not legally entitled to be represented in Industrial Council negotiations. Obviously, this is a situation which we also cannot sustain. I think this is the type of thing that the Government should urgently look at.</p>

<p>Let us take the example of job reservation. How long can we continue with this farce? How long can we introduce and operate in South Africa a form of mediaeval guildism which should have none out at the turn of the century? How long can we impose an artificial ceiling on the occupational development of certain people? How long can we go on prosecuting employers because they employ Black workers in positions in which they are not supposed to employ them? There is, in point of fact, a shortage of White workers. We are not creating a substratum of Black workers. It is known right at the moment that only 0,5% of the economically active Black workers in South Africa have been trained as artisans. This creates an imbalance which is highly dangerous and the Government should take immediate steps to rectify it. There are a vast number of fields of this kind to which we should immediately draw attention. By the very nature of things I can only refer fleetingly to some of them. Take the Physical Planning Act which has now been in operation for some eight years. At the moment we know that nearly all applications are passed. Apparently they refuse only about 10% of these applications. All cases which are reasonably well motivated are passed. This obviously is a piece of legislation which we can no longer sustain.</p>

<p>My time is very limited and I want to turn briefly to the labour position in the mining industry. When we talk about mining we are inclined to think of gold mining, diamond mining, coal mining and even platinum mining, but what we do not always realize is that mining goes well beyond these specified fields. At present we produce 22% of the world&#x2019;s antimony, 25% of its chrome, 15% of its manganese and some 50% of its vanadium. Mining as such is not only the greatest employer of manpower in this country, but is by far the biggest consumer of manufactured goods. It is the biggest earner of foreign revenue and is certainly by far the biggest stimulator of secondary and tertiary economic activity. In fact it would be true to say that if we did not have the mining industry in South Africa, we would be an impoverished State. There are a number of developments in the mining industry which cause us very considerable concern. In recent months we have had a series of tragic misunderstandings which have led to upheavals, to riots and, as I have indicated, to loss of life. It has created a degree of uncertainty which is merely a precursor of industrial instability. The mining people are terribly concerned about this because it has also led to a draining away of our manpower resources. It is known that over the last quarter the gold mining industry in this country has lost some 30 000 workers. <span class="col_1193-1194" refersTo="page_0612"/>Over the last two years they have lost some 70 000 workers. At the moment the gold mining industry is operating on a complement of only 70% of their actual requirements and at certain mines like ERPM, where they are entirely dependent on labour from Malawi, the complement is only 45 %.</p>

<p>Having mentioned Malawi, Sir, I hope you will allow me to digress for a moment. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs rounded upon me the other day because he indicated that some several years ago I had referred to the President of Malawi in disparaging terms. This, of course, was not so; it was an entire misunderstanding. I think it was a construction which was placed upon it by the Press. I certainly have not referred to the President of Malawi at any time and certainly not in that context. It is true that in discussing the vacuum that had been created by the Government in terms of its diplomatic policy, I did indicate that certain officials from Malawi had come here to ask for financial assistance. I did say that this had been hailed by the Government as a major diplomatic triumph. If this particular point which I have made has ruffled feathers elsewhere, I shall be very happy to withdraw the remarks I have made and to apologize for them.</p>

<p>What I am trying to suggest is that in the setting that we have at present, our vulnerability has been completely exposed. Where we are so dependent upon labour from so many other countries in Southern Africa, I think it is essential that the Government, in consultation with neighbouring Governments, should consider establishing a permanent labour secretariat for Southern Africa. This should serve as a permanent consultative body on labour issues so that whatever agreements are made in the field of labour they can be ratified by the various Governments concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. member a question?

<p>Of course, this is a particularly difficult question. I am losely associated with certain of the mining groups and they are concerned about this situation. They want to try and determine what has given rise to this situation. No one really knows what the solution is. The only solution I can suggest, is that there should be a permanent secretariat.</p>

<p>&#x2020;On such a body all the Governments concerned, the workers and the employer organizations would be represented. It seems to me that at the moment Governments can take decisions unilaterally without consulting with the South African Government or any of the employer organizations.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Well, if such a convention can be made bilateral, there is no reason why it should not be made multilateral. All that I am suggesting is that that ought to be done. If there is an agency of that kind, an agency which could act as a permanent consultative body, I think it should also be stipulated that no matter changes should be made in the conditions of employment of any of these workers without the other parties concerned being consulted. At the moment we have uncertainty and confusion. I certainly do not have all the answers to this problem. I am merely suggesting that, if we look long enough at this problem, we might arrive at some solution. As I say, at the moment there is uncertainty and confusion in the labour situation. I believe that this is the type of situation that can be exploited by political and foreign adventurers. I believe <span class="col_1195-1196" refersTo="page_0613"/>that if anybody from the outside were to exploit latent hostilities in our labour force, they could do South Africa far more harm than all the terrorists we might have on our borders.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have unfortunately run out of time. All I really wanted to do was to focus attention on what I believe is a vitally important problem. I might just suggest to the Government that they should not merely take up a defensive stance on this issue or merely laud what has already been done and adopt an air of complacency, because if they do so we are heading for serious trouble. If the Government were to view this problem with great perceptivity of mind as I have suggested, if they were to discard all the outworn shibboleths, I think we could save something from the situation. It is my hope that the Government will approach it in this spirit and that is why I have moved the motion standing in my name.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have just listened to the argument of the hon. member for Hillbrow. Since his motion dealt in general with labour conditions in the mining industry, I had expected that the hon. member would give a more detailed exposition of the problems he sees and the problems which are being experienced in the mining industry.</p>

</speech>

<p>My colleagues will do so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rossouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I hope the next speaker on the Opposition side will go into it in greater detail. What the hon. member for Hillbrow said today simply means that the hon. members of the Opposition want to throw the labour market wide open, that they want to do away with job reservation and that every non-White, whether he comes from our neighbouring states or was born in South Africa, should be able to perform any job for which his capabilities equip him. We on this side of the House do not agree with that. His entire argument amounted to the establishment of trade unions for the Bantu in particular. I want to give him the assurance today that enough machinery has been created by means of which these persons&#x2014;whether they work in the industries or in the mines&#x2014;can put their problems to their employers. We have several works committees, liaison committees and regional committees which yield very good results, not only here in our country but throughout the world. These committees yield good results not only in South Africa, but also in the Netherlands, Germany, Japan and various other countries in Europe.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member, as a man who is directly or very intimately involved with the mining industry&#x2014;and I am now going to deal in particular with labour in the mining industry&#x2014;whether the mining organizations or the various major mines make use of the committees which have been established. With the exceptions of Kimberley, of which we have taken cognizance, and an organization in South West, we understand that the various committees yield very good results. The hon. member for Hillbrow&#x2014;whether he did so innocently or not&#x2014;laid it at the door of the National Party that the Government had invariably been to blame for the various disturbances or strikes, whatever the case may have been, during the past year. I believe that if use had been made of all the machinery which has been established by the Government, all these disturbances which were mentioned by the hon. member would not have taken place, and the 60 people who lost their lives in these disturbances might still have been alive today. I find it regrettable that something of this kind happened, and for that reason I want to make an earnest appeal to the various mining organizations, especially to the Chamber of Mines, for these committees to be established so that the Black man, too, may have a channel through which he can air his problems and through which he can inform his employer about his problems. In this way many of the disturbances would be prevented. I want to say emphatically that it is a mistake to request the Government to establish trade unions immediately, since the Bantu in the mining industry, excepting perhaps a small percentage of them, are not yet in a position to realize the importance and the necessity of a trade union and to accept the responsibility which it entails. As the hon. member indicated, we are of necessity dependent on labour forces which we get from our neighbouring states, such as Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Angola, Rhodesia, the Transkei, the Caprivi, Malawi and Mozambique. Unfortunately I do not have the latest figures, but I think we get 400 000 Bantu per annum from the neighbouring states alone. We have experienced many <span class="col_1197-1198" refersTo="page_0614"/>problems recently in drawing an adequate supply of labour from Malawi. We know what gave rise to this, and we hope that a peaceful solution will be found to this problem. Sir, I know that the hon. the Minister will reply in person to the hon. member for Hillbrow, but I am pleased that the hon. member withdrew the charge today that he levelled some time ago. In the heat of the moment one sometimes says something one should not have said, but we are grateful that the hon. member has withdrawn the charge today&#x2014;better late than never. Even now there are major problems in respect of mine labour. I can speak from experience of the problems which arose in my constituency, in connection with mineworkers from Lesotho. Sir, approximately 80 000 workers are recruited from Lesotho every year to come and work in our mines. I said a moment ago that these people are not yet ready for trade unions. I want to add that if liaison committees had existed at the mines concerned, which could have explained the matter fully to the workers, those disturbances would not have taken place. But unfortunately the mines do not make use of the machinery which has been established by the Government, and that is why the misunderstanding arose. I want to make an earnest appeal today to the mineworkers who come from Lesotho not to destroy and ruin the property of our mining companies because they are dissatisfied with a ruling given by their own Government. Sir, I want to go further, I want to appeal to the South African Police not to allow the property of mining companies to be destroyed, as happened there, and to take firm action against those reckless persons who come to earn their bread and butter in this country and then, as the result of a misunderstanding with their Government, wreck the property of their employers. Sir, since the mining industry must be the largest industry and the biggest employer in the country today, the Chamber of Mines ought to do everything in its power to create the necessary organization so that if working problems or other problems arise, or anything which is not clear to these workers, they will have a channel through which they can raise their objections and make their representations. I believe that this will largely eliminate problems such as the one which was experienced recently. Sir, I think that other Opposition speakers will rise this afternoon and tell us that one reason why not enough Bantu can be drawn to the mines is the fact that the Bantu workers there are housed on a single basis, and that they ought to be housed on a family basis. I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that that would be attempting the impossible&#x2014;and now I am speaking of the mining industry only. I do not believe the mines will ever see their way clear to providing accommodation for every Bantu, wherever he comes from, and for his family. I do not believe this Government will ever approve the creation of those facilities for the Bantu who come from our neighbouring States. But what I am pleading for is that the mines should indeed be able to create facilities for Bantu who can at this stage and with the approval of the State be recruited in released White areas. In saying this I do not mean that they should be able to work where they please, but that they can draw some of those surplus Bantu who are to be found in our major cities and in the rural areas even today and who are living here legally, and that they should be able to create housing for those Bantu on a family basis, in the approved local Bantu townships. If they were to do so, I believe that the mines would be able to solve this major problem to a very large extent. Moreover, they would be getting good Bantu to work there. But I want to repeat the warning that the mines should not perform recruiting work which would disrupt the labour structure of our country. By that I mean that they should not go and recruit where the Bantu are already employed and have good jobs, but that they should do their recruiting where there is a tremendous surplus of Bantu, and that they should be prepared to house the surplus Bantu from those areas in approved Bantu townships. If they were then to provide housing for those Bantu on a family basis, I believe that it would help them and that it could provide a solution to many of the problems we are experiencing today in the mining industry in particular.</p>

<p>Sir, my time has expired. The next speaker on our side will, I believe, discuss in detail, with special reference to trade unions this matter which the hon. member for Hillbrow raised.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Sneaker, the hon. member for Stilfontein entered this debate with a background of personal knowledge of the mining industry and he has raised a number of very important and significant points. I was particularly struck <span class="col_1199-1200" refersTo="page_0615"/>by his reference to the possibility of solving some of the migratory problems surrounding the mining industry, problems like housing, and certainly this is a matter which needs a great deal of attention. There are problems, though. For instance, unfortunately you have to mine the gold where you find it and this means in many instances that these mines are in isolated areas where you do not always have townships for African people in the immediate area. There are some such existing townships but not everywhere, so that this can only be a partial answer to the problem but it is nevertheless a very important step forward because time and time again individual mining companies have requested that this could be a possibility but thus far it has been turned down by the Government. [Interjections.] I am very glad to hear of this development, and I hope that there will be some more developments in future.</p>

<p>The question whether or not the existing machinery is adequate is, I think, a matter which is really under survey in this very debate and I cannot help but feel that if one is to follow the logic of the hon. member for Stilfontein then we must say that there is no need for a mineworkers&#x2019; union at all. It is clear, if one knows the history of the mining industry right back from those early days, that the miners were often exploited simply because the employers were strong and the workers and their organizations were weak. I am now talking about White workers. I am not referring at all to Black workers at the moment. It was quite clear that until such time as the White workers formed a strong and responsible union, so as to counteract or to be held in tension with the strong employers&#x2019; organisation, they would be victimized and exploited. Now they can come as equal partners and discuss and negotiate and there can be collective bargaining. I think that this is very healthy and that the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union would agree with this and would certainly not for one moment agree to disband that union and form a workers committee or a liaison committee Here we find the dilemma that thousands upon thousands of other workers &#x2026; [Interjections.] What is good enough for one worker inevitably must be good enough for another worker.</p>

<p>The other point which was made by the hon. member for Stilfontein was that some of the mining companies are simply not using the existing facilities that are available. Unfortunately the law which governs works committees and liaison committees or industry does not include the mining industry. That does not mean that they cannot introduce works committees and liaison committees. I want to say that certainly some mines, a great number of mines, have actually done this. I want to return to that, because I think this is the crux of the problem and therefore the debate has been advanced.</p>

<p>The labour situation in South Africa is neither simple nor does it have a single answer. It is extraordinarily complex and a most sensitive issue in our national life. The aim of all thinking South Africans, whether they are representative of management or labour, Government or Opposition, is to secure lasting industrial peace. Anyone who is familiar with our history has no desire to see a repetition of the 1922 White miners&#x2019; strike with its dreadful consequences, the loss of more than 200 lives. Whilst the strikes in Natal during 1973 were remarkably free from violence and destruction, nevertheless, no economy and no country can stand the repeated action of taking to the streets by thousands of workers. We must be able to channel this conflict in some way.</p>

<p>The continued economic development of South Africa has introduced what may be termed a new economic imperative which stands directly in contrast with our historically determined racially stratified labour market. Early in 1973, the Department of Labour released its manpower survey No. 9. I would like to refer to that now. This detailed man shortages as of April 1971, a very long time ago. The survey indicated at that time a shortage of some 96 000 White and Coloured workers. At the artisan level in the metal and engineering industry, there was a shortage of some 7 000 artisans and apprentices. There was a shortage of over 2 000 in the electrical trades, of nearly 3 000 in the motor trades, and of almost 10 000 in the building trades. This critical manpower shortage has led to a significant rethinking in Government policy towards the use of Black and Brown manpower. For example, the 1972 Department of Planning &#x201C;Economic Development Programme&#x201D; states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to attain higher growth rates, that is 5¬º% or 6% per annum, it would be necessary to give non-Whites, within the framework of Government policy, improved training and to utilize their services <span class="col_1201-1202" refersTo="page_0616"/>more effectively by giving them work of a more advanced nature.</block>

<p>This view was supported by the Reynders Commission, which stated <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Provision will have to be made for a greater degree of mobility than at present for Bantu to move up the occupational ladder, that is to say the occupational mobility and training of Bantu will have to be adapted to these changing conditions, which in turn, however, presupposes an adaptation of statutory and traditional restrictions as well as the attitude of some trade unions and entrepreneurs in this regard.</block>

<p>I believe that that commission has done its work, that its conclusions are valid and that the Government itself is attempting to adjust its own policy in relation to the desperate need to maintain our economic growth, to increase it and, in order to do so, to include on a much wider basis the use of Black and Brown manpower. Perhaps the most significant statement of the changed attitude came from the hon. the Prime Minister himself when he opened the annual conference of the Motor Industry Federation in October 1973. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be clear that in terms of Government policy there is nothing to prevent employers, with the co-operation of trade unions, taking the necessary steps to bring about improvements in the productive use of non-White labour.</block>

<p>That is exactly what one is trying to say, nothing more and nothing less than that. It is the productive use of Black labour in this country which is at stake and what this debate is all about. The essential point is that we are all agreed that our economy must be viable and that our growth rate must be maintained and increased. It is agreed by all who know what the situation is that in order to do this we simply have to introduce more Black and Brown South Africans into skilled jobs. What are the consequences of this? It means that they will be introduced into more skilled jobs and will receive higher wages and they will have to be trained. As Blacks occupy more and more essential jobs in industry, it is therefore vital that they are incorporated into a formal industrial relations system because without formal leadership the advancement of Blacks, which I suggest is essential, the greater pay differentiation for Black labour and in general the normalization of Black labour conditions, will be fraught with potential conflict. That is why you have industrial relations, in order that you can negotiate, in order that you can take care of the workers as they develop. On the one hand, if you have a vast developing Black labour force, which is a prerequisite for our economy, and on the other hand you are not keeping pace with your industrial legislation, you must have conflict. In my judgment the Industrial Conciliation Act itself, the cornerstone of industrial legislation in South Africa, needs to be overhauled considerably for the benefit of management and of workers, Black and White.</p>

<p>While it is true that the signs of conflict are there to be seen by all who have eyes to see them and that most of it is in the area of Black labour, one begins to see the emergence of a potential problem among White labour or our mines as well. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Mines will know of the strike at the St. Helena goldmine in which he was probably quite heavily involved, where White miners interpreted the 1973 agreement in a way in which it was really never intended. I suppose it is not without significance that Dr. Albert Hertzog was the speaker at the mineworkers&#x2019; meeting prior to that. It is nevertheless true that Black labour in particular presents an enormous problem. Of course, one is aware of the development of works committees and liaison committees and the way in which they have succeeded in dealing with what I term &#x201C;household&#x201D; grievances. One is only too grateful for this, but they cannot and should never be seen as a substitute for collective bargaining and negotiation. That is the whole idea of calling for a commission, not to argue at this time because time is limited, but simply to make that point.</p>

<p>Before I conclude I want to refer very specifically to the mining industry, because this motion directs our attention to it. Our mines are particularly vulnerable at this time in our industrial history due to the fact that we have, for so many years, depended on labour from countries outside our borders. For example, well over 20% of our labour comes from Malawi. We all know that that has now been stopped. If my information is correct, there does not seem to be any prospect of that door being opened in the foreseeable future, and we <span class="col_1203-1204" refersTo="page_0617"/>would consequently be well advised to think in terms of alternative sources of labour so that we will never again be as vulnerable as we are now. A similar percentage of labour, i.e. over 20%, comes at present from Mozambique. I do not have to emphasize in this House the troubled character of that particular country and its problems at this time. Who knows for how long we are also going to be able to depend on that country for labour? Then, of course, we also have the problem of Lesotho. This problem gives rise to very grave concern. A recent compulsory deferment of pay has led, as we know, to rioting, to damage to property and to loss of life. As a result of the shortage of labour and the threatened further shortage, the Chamber of Mines has undertaken a very intensive recruiting campaign. One may well question the wisdom of bringing workers from Rhodesia, again a country in transition. One may also question the wisdom of attempting to bring workers from Angola. To my mind it is the height of folly to attempt to do this. It is too early to know whether the Chamber of Mines in its recruiting policy will be successful in recruiting workers from the urban areas. We know well the enormous difficulties and problems in attempting to recruit workers from agricultural areas outside the homelands. It therefore follows that the homelands themselves must be seen as the pool for continued subsistence labour, as it is called. It is true, however, that we do not know how long this pool itself is going to exist. In short, whilst the Black workers of the Republic of South Africa are coming to our mines, and while one hopes they will do so in larger numbers, it is all too clear that they will not meet the desperate shortage which exists at the moment and which will be intensified. We must bear in mind that we are not talking only in terms of present needs. Enormous developments have already been announced in the Press in respect of new7 mines that are going to be opened. As the result of this enormous concentration and the spending of vast sums of money, we shall need a great deal of regular, stable labour for these new gold mines as well.</p>

<p>My time is also rather limited, so may I just conclude by saying that this state of affairs will surely lead to intensely competitive conditions between industry on the one side and mining on the other because both groups will be competing for labour from the same source. This must have far-reaching consequences and there must be an almost inevitable increase in wages across the board because there will be this competition. Although one does, <i>fit</i> course, welcome wage increases when they are necessary, this is nevertheless going to change the pattern of labour in South Africa. It is also going to change the pattern of wage determination in South Africa. We must also pose the question: How is this going to affect the farmer? Only last night I was speaking to a farmer in the Stellenbosch area.</p>

<p>Not too badly, actually! This farmer pointed out to me that the had 500 workers coming from the Transkei. Whether it is right or wrong to have migrant workers is not part of this debate.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the fact of the matter is that he cannot get Coloured workers because they are all coming to the towns. As a direct result of this there is an acute labour shortage and we must be aware of the attendant problems. I do not have to emphasize the importance of gold for the South African economy, providing as we do 75% of the free world&#x2019;s gold. This brings South Africa inestimable benefits. Nothing should therefore be allowed to interfere with the increased production of ore so that we can continue to reap the rewards of increased <span class="col_1205-1206" refersTo="page_0618"/>gold prices. Therefore I believe that it is right from these benches to support the motion as it stands and to request the State President to appoint a commission of inquiry. Now that we know who the new State President is and knowing his particular interest and commitment to gold, I would imagine, and I say it with respect, that he would be wide open to a request of this kind from this House. Last year I reminded this House that the Botha Commission of 1951 did a very excellent piece of work but, unfortunately, not all its recommendations were accepted by the Government. I think that was a grave mistake on the part of the Government. I know that only last session the hon. the Minister of Labour again refused to appoint a commission to investigate the sources and the problems of labour despite pleas from this side of the House. Despite the emergence of new initiatives by management and despite their skill and their serious commitment to change, the way ahead which shines so very, very bright for our mining industry will only be so provided that we take cognizance of the very serious problems which face our mining industry and our labour market as a whole. I therefore support the motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, so far we have listened to two speakers of the joint, but divided Opposition, and not one of them has succeeded in presenting any substantive proof which justifies in any way the proposal that a commission of inquiry be appointed. The hon. gentlemen referred to certain problems in the field of labour and it is my intention to deal with some of these problems as I proceed as there will not be time to deal with all of them. The hon. member for Pinelands, who has just resumed his seat, referred to the shortage which existed. I think that it is common knowledge that the Government is indeed thoroughly aware of the problems which exist and that it has already taken the necessary steps to overcome those problems. I think that it is general knowledge that private centres have been established or will be established at Bloemfontein, at Benoni, Vanderbijlpark, Pretoria, Krugersdorp, Pinetown and Port Elizabeth, which will be under the direct control of the industry concerned and at which courses will be established at semi-skilled and operator level. The centres will provide training to Black people in respect of work on motor vehicles and machines, mechanical practices, finishing work, spray painting and polishing, basic electrical work, laboratory practices and many other fields into which I cannot go now. I mention it only to show that the Government is not unaware of this and that it has already taken the necessary steps to overcome this.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the mover of the motion. He began by saying that we should elevate this matter above party politics. I can well understand this, because the Opposition is still on its <i>via dolorosa,</i> on its road of suffering. For that reason they can advocate here what we elevate this matter above party politics so that they may first go and work out what their policy should be. That doubt exists in their ranks, not only now, but that it has existed for a long time, as to where the United Party stands in respect of labour, is very clear. If we look at <i>The Star</i> of 25 July last year, we find the following large headline: &#x201C;U.P. plans a policy change.&#x201D; That policy change concerned labour. I can well understand their planning it, because only a week or two prior to that, on 18 June to be precise, the hon. member for Pinelands, who has just resumed his seat, raised the idea that &#x201C;a new commission of inquiry be appointed&#x201D;. That was what the hon. member said about labour matters. After all, it is generally known in this House that it is the Progressive Party, and the people who have now left the United Party as well, who have always taken the United Party in tow and have told them what to do. Therefore they cannot give birth to that policy change which we do not expect from them today either. They touched on a few odd matters without telling us what they actually had in mind.</p>

<p>In the course of the hon. member for Hillbrow&#x2019;s speech he came back to the question of trade unions. I want to say at once that, when we speak about a matter such as labour, it is essential for us in <span class="col_1207-1208" refersTo="page_0619"/>this House to oppose standpoint with standpoint so that not only the White worker, but also the Black worker outside may know what they have in the Government on the one hand and in the joint Opposition on the other hand.</p>

<p>Although I do not want to deal with trade unions now, I want to say that, where the hon. member did indeed deal with them, it was interesting to look at the company in which he finds himself. Then we are also entitled to ask what motivated him to deal with them. If we look at the question of trade unions, we see that the functioning of the trade unions has to do with certain basic circumstances which the worker experiences, problems which can be overcome by means of other machinery which the Government has created and to which I shall return. Trade unions go further than merely providing for those basic needs. The fact is that they have a political motive at the back of their minds. I see the hon. member for Maitland is shaking his head. That I can well understand, because he would like to dissociate himself from it. The hon. members on the opposite side speak of the necessity of trade unions, but if one looks at the <i>International Socialist League</i> of January 1916, one sees that even at that time the issue was &#x201C;the lifting of the Native workers to the political and industrial status of the Whites&#x201D;. More recently a man with the name of M. W. Shope, the general secretary of Sactu, said at the international Trade Union Conference which was held in Geneva on 15 June 1973&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The goal must be nothing less than the transfer of political power to the African people on the basis of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;.</block>

<p>After all, we know them. After all, we know that this is what they want. If the issue was merely the advantage of the worker, they would have come forward with a different motion today. I have here in my hand a lengthy document which indicates the things about which the Black workers complain. However, this is not what the hon. members on the opposite side presented here today. It is not about this that they made their case. Basically, they advocated once again that the doors be thrown open so that the Black man may obtain trade union rights. Surely that does not hold water. Because this is the position, I say that the time has arrived when we in this House should indeed oppose standpoint with standpoint.</p>

<p>My time is very limited. I just want to say that when we speak about labour affairs in this House, it must be very clearly understood that this Government in the 27 years for which it has been in power, has always taken up the standpoint that it must act in such a way so as not to disturb the labour peace in South Africa. The Government prides itself in having succeeded in that. I think that the Government&#x2019;s record is very good in that respect. The hon. member who is going to speak after me, will not be able to hold up a single example to us of Government action against the worker, White or non-White, which had led to those people rebelling. The strikes which took place, the misunderstandings which there were, are due to the political agitation which took place behind the scenes, and the United Party also had a part in that in the past. It is their prompting which gave rise to these.</p>

<p>Another matter which we must have very clearly on record, is the fact that this Government, as far as its labour policy is concerned, will never act in such a way that the White worker needs to doubt that this Government is his friend, because otherwise it will lead to labour unrest and strife in this country. What has already been done to provide for the needs as far as the different workers are concerned? In the first place there is the organized wage regulation machinery. The industrial council system, in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act, has already made such progress that there are 103 industrial councils. There are 104 wage agreements which cover more than one million workers of all races. Councils of this nature are autonomous bodies which regularly consider conditions of service under the system of collective bargaining. It is about these <span class="col_1209-1210" refersTo="page_0620"/>things that there should really have been complaints. In other words, there is no reason whatsoever for a motion of this nature. If that hon. member wanted to be honest, he should in fact have come here today and said that he wanted to move a motion of thanks in the Government for what this Government has done in respect of the accomplishment of labour peace. There are still other agreements as well which, for example, make provision for fringe benefits for workers, such as pensions, illness and holiday benefits, etc. About 800 000 workers of all races are members of pensions and provident funds while 350 000 are members of medical schemes. As far as the unorganized workers are concerned, there is a wage board system which recommends wage determinations. At the moment there are 69 wage determinations in force, regulating the conditions of service of almost 500 000 workers in this country. In addition to this industrial legislation to which I have referred, there is a special measure which has been placed on the Statute Book in order to regulate the channels of communication between the Bantu worker and the employer. Another hon. member on this side will elaborate on that. The fact remains however, that while there were only 43 works committees in 1973, there are over 200 at the moment, while as many as 1 500 liaison committees have been established which represent over 530 000 Bantu workers. As far as the better utilization of manpower is concerned, there are many training schemes in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act&#x2014;in addition to those to which I have already referred&#x2014;which have been negotiated by trade unions and employers and in terms of which jobs are classified. Semi-skilled jobs and other more responsible jobs have been made available to Bantu workers as well. Training to satisfy the labour needs of our country takes place continually in terms of the Apprenticeship Act. In 1974 over 11 000 apprentices served apprenticeships in terms of the Apprenticeship Act. The Training of Artisans Act also offers training facilities for adults and over 2 000 adults have achieved artisan status in terms of this arrangement. I give these facts to show that as far as the human needs of workers are concerned, the machinery is there. As far as shortages which exist in the field of labour are concerned, the machinery is also there. It is also not merely a question of machinery which exists. That machinery is duly employed and with very great success.</p>

<p>Therefore we have the fullest right to say that this motion is entirely misplaced, that it is unnecessary and may be rejected since the Government is a responsible Government which sees to it that what must be done, is done properly. In these circumstances I must express myself against the motion before this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down once again voiced the continuous fear that seems to run through the thinking of hon. members on the Government side with regard to the question of trade unions. I am not terribly sure whether he is as much concerned about peace and order and improved relations in the labour field as he is with the fact that if there is any improvement in this particular field to the advantage of the country, he might lose what has been the main slogan, the main plank in the political platform of the party on that side, and that is that the White workers run the risk of having their positions usurped by non-Whites. They have used that argument in the past to whip up the country politically in order to gain votes for themselves. Sir, that line of thinking is completely out of date in South Africa; it is also completely out of line with the thinking of the Prime Minister over the last six or eight months. It is rather surprising, in view of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s present line of thinking, to find an hon. member on that side making a speech of this nature, in which he decries trade unionism on the grounds that it will bring about no improvement in labour relations and that it will not lead to increased production in this country. Sir, I think hon. members on this side have made some very constructive suggestions here this afternoon, suggestions which should convince the hon. the Minister that there is an urgent need to take a good look at what is happening today in <span class="col_1211-1212" refersTo="page_0621"/>the labour field in order to ensure the future mining development of South Africa. Sir, not only are three new gold mines on the verge of being opened, but the vast mineral resources of the North-Western Cape are to be exploited at a cost of billions of rands. Surely it must be realized that with all this mining development, as well as the industrial development that will accompany the opening of new mines, labour on a tremendous scale will be required and that we will have to ensure that that labour moves in an orderly way and that it is satisfactorily and productively absorbed to give us the fullest benefit and advantage of our mineral wealth.</p>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. member? Is the shortage of labour in the mines and in industry not a stimulant to increase efficiency in those industries?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. Sir, a shortage of labour in any industry would be an incentive to increased efficiency, but that does not detract from the fact that in order to be able to cope with the tremendous mining activity which the Minister has foreshadowed, you will require additional manpower. Sir, we have to take into account the fact that at the moment If million Whites and 5&#x00BD; million Blacks are active economically in all fields. We have a tremendous potential and pool of Black labour which is five times as large as that in the case of White labour and we still hear speeches such as we heard this afternoon about the outdated methods, what I might almost call puerile methods, of dealing with the orderly development, control and incentives to enable this labour to be used fully and productively. People said in the past&#x2014;and I met an industrialist years ago who said so&#x2014;that we were one of the luckiest countries in the world because we had this tremendous untapped pool of labour resources. To use it properly, not only in-service training and the training of operatives, to which reference has been made, is necessary. Proper use must also be made of the 5&#x00BD; million economically active Black workers in the country, to whom must be given the same opportunities in every field of activity in their labour life as is given to any other worker in the country. In other words, we have to grow up and we must begin to look at labour not as White and Black and Coloured and Indian; we have to look at labour as labour <i>per se,</i> and if you deal with labour <i>per se</i> then you have to deal with all the necessary factors which help to bring about a satisfied, balanced and contented labour force in the country. You have to consider the question of wages, the conditions of employment, living conditions, education, housing conditions, security of employment, medical aid, pensions, health facilities. You have to consider innumerable matters. These matters cannot be dealt with by works committees. Even in the countries to which reference has been made where works committees operate, trade unionism is still the strongest of all the cohesive forces in the field of labour in those countries. These other committees are merely adjuncts in the more fragmented echelons, the more intimate echelons, to enable communications, as the hon. member for Hillbrow has so correctly stated, to take place much more easily. And, talking of trade unions, the Confederation of Labour in this country is, I understand, officially against the establishment of trade unions for Black people or, let us say, is against allowing Black people to become members of registered trade unions and to form part and parcel of the Industrial Conciliation Act machinery. But their secretary is on record as having stated that in his view it would be essential to appoint a commission of inquiry to go into this matter.</p>

<p>Let me make another point very clear. I do not think there is any doubt that it is fully accepted in this country by all sides, despite political red herrings, that the Black man one way or another is permanently in this country, whether you call it the White part of South Africa or the Republic of South Africa or the confines of South Africa. He is here permanently, and once you have permanent workers in a country, you cannot differentiate in the trade union field. The first people to admit it will be the top people in the Confederation of <span class="col_1213-1214" refersTo="page_0622"/>Labour, who will tell you that once you accept the principle of permanence then the whole question of trade unionism is wide open and you cannot use this type of political red herring that the hon. member for Springs, who gave an assurance to his voters in regard to the type of protection they will have, tried to do. In fact, the protection which every worker, and particularly those ruling this country and the White workers will have, can be afforded only through the negotiating system which trade unionism brings about.</p>

<p>We have had a number of strikes in the last few years. You will find, however, that in some industries no strikes took place. For example, a firm like Smith &amp; Nephew Ltd., one of the biggest companies in this country, completed a wage agreement with an unregistered African trade union. In the textile industry itself, if it were not for the influence of the unregistered trade unions, things might have been very much worse than they were during those riots in Durban. I think everyone will admit that. In fact, the greatest influence which has helped to avoid bloodshed for us in all the strikes we have had, except for the unfortunate incidents in the Free State, was the influence of these unregistered bodies, who had trained workers and who used their best endeavours to try to bring about some form of peaceful negotiation in regard to the problems that existed. I want to say that I think we have reached the stage where the Government should grow up and not be childish in their approach to these matters. They should approach the matter in a much more sophisticated manner, in a manner which will spell peace for the country, advancement for the country, and a better understanding of the country by the world outside, and furthermore which will enable us to proceed along the lines of the theme of 1975, the theme of detente, and that is to begin to treat people as people and not to use this old, archaic form of differentiation whereby we can climb on the back of one section in order to secure what we think are better rights for another. In fact we are doing the greatest harm in the world by doing so, because we are achieving nothing. The facts will show that in the last few years we have advanced considerably in the field of wages; not sufficiently, but considerably. This is something that was denied years ago. We begged the hon. the Minister of Labour to have a continuous rotating investigation into conditions of labour and wages in the various fields of industry and commerce. He suddenly woke up when the strikes took place last year and began instituting a much fast-moving form of investigation into what was taking place. What did Mr. Tindall, the chairman of the Wage Board, say? He was the very man who said that we had to establish a minimum wage in this country. Let us not forget this principle of a minimum wage. This is one of the most important factors in the whole labour set-up of this country. I pleaded for this question of minimum wages 15 years ago, and I was derided by the Government side who said that I wanted to oust the White people from their jobs. The idea of a minimum wage, which has today become the basis of the assessment of the poverty datum line and minimum effective levels, is something which is now a prominent feature in all countries of the world, and is aimed at allowing every worker to receive a reasonable living wage. If we can get to that stage in this country where we establish a minimum living wage for the entire labour force of South Africa, this whole fear of trade unionism and the political difficulties that it may bring will entirely disappear.</p>

<p>I would like now to make a categorical statement, and I would like the hon. the Minister to tell me if I am wrong. To the best of my knowledge there was a report on one of the risings on the mines in the Free State and the Police report was that there was no political motivation at all. The hon. member for Springs stated positively that all these strikes took place as a result of political motivation. There has been very little political motivation in any of the strikes or any of the labour unrest that we have had in the last few years. It has been traced basically to the question of misunderstandings between employers and employees. It was traced to misunderstandings as to when improvements in wages would commence. It has been traced to the fact that people have been earning <span class="col_1215-1216" refersTo="page_0623"/>too little and have not been able to catch up with the cost of living. Here is another factor that we have entirely forgotten about. We talk of all these labour problems in a vacuum. There is the question of the entire change in our economic structure which brings in its wake need for tremendous changes in this country in its approach to labour and the manner in which it is to approach sections of our community. I think that we have to get away from this question of sectionalizing labour according to colour. That is basically a weakness in the whole structure of labour in this country. It exists in no other country in the world. I know that there are countries in the world where people are very badly paid, but I am talking about Western countries. I am not talking about backward countries and countries where there has been exploitation. I am concerned with the Western countries such as we are, sophisticated countries who have the wealth and the opportunity for supplying their people with all their needs if necessary.</p>

<p>I would like to make one other point. I read an interesting account of what is happening in the United States of America. Over the last few years, despite the inflationary process and the problems people are complaining about, the real income of Americans went up by 43%. There we have an example of the entire standard of a country rising, despite inflation &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">While the general discourse has been about devaluation, inflation and the drop in the Stock Market, the real income of Americans, discounting any effect of inflation, went up by 43%.</block>

<p>This is an example of the fact that when a country can be productive and deal with all its labour as labour and make the best use of all its resources, when it can give normal education to its people, when it endeavours to look after the normal needs of communities in the form of housing, health facilities and a properly regulated wage structure, it has an inbuilt strength that can resist many difficulties which assail it in its economic life. Here is the best example one can give. The time has come to get away from this whole question of whether you feel that trade unions are politically motivated because a person in some other country has stated that Trade Unions are to enable the Black man to become politically dominant. We always boast that we will look after our own affairs and internal problems and that we do not need advice from abroad. We hear this from the Government side almost every day. I concur with that thinking; let us therefore not worry about what people in other countries say. I can give many examples of what people in other countries say, but I know what is right in my country for my country. That is what we want the Government to consider; that is why we want a commission of inquiry to consider all these factors in the light of our modern times.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down began to hide behind the Prime Minister immediately after he had risen to speak, as has now become customary. When the hon. member for Jeppe went on talking, as usual, after his time had expired, one immediately wondered whether the hon. member was in fact conducting negotiations or whether it was his swan song he was singing from that bench.</p>

<p>The wording of the motion we have before us today is fairly wide. It is a motion which one can discuss at length and in regard to which one can wax eloquent. Hon. members on the other side did in fact wax fairly eloquent. One question they did not answer, of course. This was the question put to the Opposition by the hon. the Minister of Labour during the discussion on his Vote last year, namely whether discussions had been held with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union to find out whether they would accept the registration of Black trade unions in the mining industry in South Africa. We are <span class="col_1217-1218" refersTo="page_0624"/>still waiting for a reply to that question. We expected that the hon. member for Hillbrow would give us the reply during the discussion on this motion today. The hon. member for Pinelands has thought fit to refer to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, and perhaps he can give us the answer. He is a man who lives in close contact with the mineworkers and he has urged that nothing should be done which the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union would resent.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words today about trade unions in South Africa and more particularly about their association with the works committees and liaison committees. Two poles have crystallized out in our trade unions in South Africa in recent years. On the one hand there are trade unions with White members only, others with mixed membership, and trade unions with Coloured and Indian members. These are grouped together under the South African Trade Union Council, better known as Tucsa. On the other hand we have the Confederation of Labour. One might say that they have a more conservative approach to labour matters. However, there is a basic difference. Tucsa is outspokenly in favour of the creation of Black trade unions which are to be registered in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act. They are also in favour of open membership of existing trade unions for Black people in South Africa. The Confederation of Labour, on the other hand, is outspokenly opposed to this. Also, a kind of stigma has begun to attach to the term &#x201C;trade union&#x201D; in South Africa in recent years. I suppose one should seek the reason for this in Europe and America. Our people have been shocked by the way in which trade unions in countries in Europe and America are not only able to influence and manipulate economies, but in certain cases even dictate to the Government what to do and what not to do. In certain cases they can even bring Governments into power or threaten to unseat them. We in South Africa do not find ourselves in that situation. Without going into the reasons why we have steered clear of that situation up to now. I want to say that we are fortunate, for the most part, in having mature and generally responsible trade union leaders at the head of our trade unions in South Africa,</p>

<speech by="#lloyd">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LLOYD</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to the hon. member in a moment. One is very grateful for this. Something one cannot always say of the Opposition, however, is that one often perceives some patriotic sense of responsibility on the part of the trade union leaders in South Africa. This is the one thing for which one is grateful, for it is the indisputable right of any trade union in South Africa to approach the employers on behalf of its members, with representations for better salaries, conditions of service, etc. On the other hand it is also the bounden duty of our trade unions and our trade union leaders to urge their members to produce better work and to work harder. They must encourage their members to take pride in their work. One is grateful to know that this is in fact being done by trade unions. However, it is something which could be done more often. I have said that the Confederation of Labour is opposed to the creation of registered non-White trade unions in South Africa. The reason they have always advanced for this attitude is that the people concerned are not yet ripe for this. If one considers that more than 600 000 Black people are employed in the mining industry in South Africa, and that more than 80% of them are foreign Bantu in South Africa, one can imagine the dilemma which would arise if a trade union were to be created for this labour force, the members of which come and go as their term of service commences or expires. This is not just a question of the registration of a trade union, after all. The Opposition likes to hold out the prospect of a Utopia for the Black man in South Africa if the Government were to amend the Industrial Conciliation Act in such a way as to enable Black trade unions to register in terms of that Act. But once they have been registered, it will not do to sit back and to say that the problems are now going to solve themselves because you belong to a registered trade union. It will be no use saying that you will call in the tikoloshe or anybody else to solve problems when these arise. It will not be so easy. We must accept that trade unionism in South Africa is an enterprise which <span class="col_1219-1220" refersTo="page_0625"/>requires a sophisticated management. For that reason trade union officials in South Africa must bear in mind that they have a responsibility to see to it that certain duties with which they have been entrusted by the Industrial Conciliation Act or by the provisions of the particular constitution of that trade union are carried out. If these are not carried out, this may constitute an offence in certain cases. The registration of a trade union may be cancelled, for example, if certain of the provisions are disregarded. Some White trade unions have found, when wanting to act on behalf of their members, that certain requirements have unfortunately not been complied with and that their registration has lapsed as a result. If this happens in the case of Whites, people who are better trained for this and who have been involved in it for years, it is so much more likely to happen to a registered Black trade union. Just think of the labour unrest we could then have in our labour circles. Why then should we create trade unions of this kind while this has been our experience with the Whites? In the light of this one cannot help supporting the Government in having created a forum and machinery for bringing about consultation between employer and employee&#x2014;and this goes for the Black worker in South Africa as well. In 1973 it was decided to develop the system of works committees and to establish liaison committees as well, and now we are glad &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#lloyd">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LLOYD</person>:</from>

<p>We know that it can work there as well. For that reason we are glad that 1 740 of the committees have been established since 1973. For that reason we are also glad that the University of the Orange Free State has analysed the work of these committees, the way they have functioned in 326 organizations in all. They found that 82% of these 326 organizations were quite happy with the functioning of works committees and liaison committees. Perhaps as the hon. member for Hillbrow has shown, one cannot expect those members to pay much attention to the analysis undertaken by the University of the Orange Free State, for the survey was undertaken in the Free State, where there is no Opposition. Therefore, let us rather turn to an analysis made in Natal. I want to refer hon. members to an edition of the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> the official organ of one of the opposition groups in this House, which appeared on 21 January 1975. I quote from an article entitled &#x201C;Most firms for works committees&#x201D;. The article reads:</p>

<block name="quote">Eighty per cent of employers in South Africa are in favour of implementing works committees, the University of Natal&#x2019;s department of economics found after a poll of a wide range of employers throughout the country. However, only 18% of those in favour of works committees were taking steps to implement them, the study found.</block>

<p>Then an important thing follows. I shall come in a moment to facts which will interest the hon. members who come from the Witwatersrand. I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">When all works committees that were being formed at the time of the poll are in operation, a total of 40% of Natal firms and 35% of Western Cape firms will be operating these committees. The national average is 18% and the average for the Witwatersrand 11%.</block>

<p>The very next day, however, another article appeared under the heading &#x201C;Do something!&#x201D; I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">Good intentions are simply not good enough. Employers who approve the idea of communicating with their Black workers but do nothing about it are dangerously negligent. According to a survey by the University of Natal, 80% of South Africa&#x2019;s firms support the idea, but only 18% are taking steps to introduce it. Works committees operating outside the umbrella of trade unionism, as they have to in this country, are hardly satisfactory, but they are better than nothing at all. It has been shown time and time again that lack of communication channels can cause and exacerbate labour unrest. If companies accept this, why the <span class="col_1221-1222" refersTo="page_0626"/>indifference? Witwatersrand businessmen, particularly, like to think of themselves as fast movers (in more ways than one, Sir, especially from the one party to another), yet they are among the worst offenders.</block>

<p>The article concludes:</p>

<block name="quote">What are they waiting for? More strikes?</block>

<p>It is not very difficult, after all, to see who the people are who clamour for Black trade unions every day. After all, the hon. member for Hillbrow comes from the Witwatersrand, and so do the hon. members for Jeppe, Johannesburg North and Orange Grove. The only pity is that Pinelands is not also situated on the Witwatersrand. These are the people who clamour for better relationships and for better machinery every day. Here, however, their own Press is saying that the machinery is there and that it can work. Now their Press wants to know from them why they do not use it. We from this side also wish to pose the question: &#x201C;What are you waiting for? For more strikes?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to be the last speaker on this side of the House in this debate and for that reason I regard it as my duty to discuss in brief a few points which were raised by previous hon. speakers. I must say that I listened with interest to the hon. member for Pretoria East. He said that the establishment of trade unions for Black workers was not a desirable step at this stage, since the Black worker was not ripe for it. I want to tell the hon. member that to my mind his statement is a sign of progress. If we were to put the same proposition to the hon. member for Springs, he would say &#x201C;Trade unions for the Black workers? Most decidedly, never!&#x201D; Am I right? The hon. member for Springs says &#x201C;Never&#x201D;, while the hon. member for Pretoria East political purposes, merely says that the Black workers are not yet ripe for it. In other words, there is a possibility that they will in fact become ripe enough.</p>

<p>I found it a pleasure to listen to the debate which was conducted this afternoon. That side as well as this side of the House endeavoured at all times to discuss calmly a matter which is of great importance to South Africa. Perhaps there was just one false note, and that was struck by the hon. member for Springs. He was like a concertina in a string ensemble. I did not quite understand his behaviour. He was on the war-path, but I still do not know what about. The hon. member made a few statements which I want to touch on briefly. I want to ask the hon. member please to listen attentively. In labour debates in this House we deal with certain matters over and over again. Nevertheless hon. members go on making the same mistake time and again&#x2014;I will not say deliberately; perhaps they do not read the speeches. What did the hon. member for Springs say? He said we wanted trade unions for the Black workers so that they could be placed in a position to abuse these trade unions for political purposes.</p>

<p>Let me put it to the hon. member this way: There are <span class="col_1223-1224" refersTo="page_0627"/>Black trade unions at present, and our only fear is that, since those approximately 20 trade unions are totally without control, the situation may arise that those trade unions may indeed abuse their position for political purposes. The Government has no control over them whatsoever. What we are requesting in this House is that the Government should act wisely, even at this stage, when the people are perhaps not yet ripe enough. Let them, even at this stage, grant the advanced Bantu representation in these bodies, let them organize the labour position in South Africa properly and allow the people to become accustomed to machinery which is very, very old. The hon. member for Stilfontein is very proud of his works committees, and I have no objection to them. They seem to me to be a good instrument as a transitional stage. Now the hon. member is complaining that no use is being made of this particular instrument in the mining industry.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member is asking me &#x201C;Why not?&#x201D; Why does the hon. member not ask the Minister of Mines? Why does he not ask the Minister of Labour? Surely I am not the person to reply to this question. That hon. member is sitting on the Government side. He should raise his voice a little and tell his voters that the Government is not doing its duty. I shall tell you that the hon. the Minister of Labour will be the first one to listen to the hon. member for Stilfontein.</p>

<p>I feel that there is no problem as far as that is concerned. I should like to tell the hon. member for Springs that we already have trade unions in South Africa, trade unions that have been in existence for many years and which were often used for political purposes prior to 1924. Since then we have had responsible action on the part of the trade unions, properly balanced action on the part of trade unionism in South Africa. And now I should like to know from the hon. member what there is left for him to be afraid of. Why does he not hold talks with the White trade unions; what initiative is he taking? Now people are asking whether the White trade unions in the mining sector have been consulted. Has the Government done anything? Has the Minister of Labour or the Minister of Mines said, &#x201C;Has the time not arrived for us to effect a change?&#x201D; But they remain silent and are afraid, and I should like to know why. After all, I have never known the Afrikaner to be a fearful person. If they want to take action, it will be found that the field is wide open for a change in South Africa, even at the Nico Malan.</p>

<p>There is a motion before the House requesting the appointment of a commission. The question which immediately presents itself to me is whether or not it is necessary. The hon. member for Pinelands has stated that the labour question is complex. I want to say that I have no doubt that the problem will be twice as complex in ten or 20 years&#x2019; time. I feel that if there are questions in the air and if there are specific unanswered questions in respect of the labour question in South Africa, we have made out a case for a commission to be appointed to investigate the matter. If I remember correctly, the last commission was appointed in 1951. It was a commission which investigated this matter, but, as the hon. member for Pinelands said, not all the recommendations were accepted. Since that time far-reaching and radical changes have taken place in South Africa, not only as far as the real position is concerned, but also in the outlook of the Government. In 1951 the standpoint was that the Bantu were strangers and that the time would come when they would disappear from the South African labour scene. Today this is no longer the case, and we find that they are being incorporated in increasing numbers. This is a basic change which has taken place during the last 20 years. In my humble opinion, this in itself presents South Africa with a position which requires penetrating investigation.</p>

<p>We speak about change. In our labour field in South Africa I see tremendous changes which will have to take place. We are certain of a few things, although we do not know what the total scope of the changes will be in the next 10 to 15 years. We do know, however, that the people <span class="col_1225-1226" refersTo="page_0628"/>in South Africa will have to double or even triple their production capacity if they want to maintain their standard of living. This will mean that numerous new growth points will have to be created in the industrial sphere in South Africa. This will result in the movement of large numbers of people, White and non-White, all over this field. With the conditions prevailing in South Africa this will create problems which, in my humble opinion, will require penetrating investigation. For that reason I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Mines that we are not merely trying to be critical. We are also trying to indicate that this is a matter which, after 25 years, has to be investigated properly. It does not seem to me that any reason has yet been advanced for not investigating it. No right-thinking hon. member can rise in this hon. House and say that we do not have problems. The question which arises is whether they have solutions to all the problems. As someone who readily participates in debates in this House, I say that if they do not have them, a commission should be appointed in which we can combine the best minds in the country to examine the position, in the hope that we shall thus find a better solution than we ourselves could find. Sir, this is the state of affairs. The worker, as a person and as a production unit, will be very intimately involved in these changes I am discussing, for the White man will not wonk only with fellow Whites, as was originally envisaged; he will also work with 10 to 15 non-Whites. A completely new labour field will be created and as the Bantu is absorbed and becomes more sophisticated, he will make new demands on South African society, even in the sphere of trade-unionism. Sir, we cannot ignore these things; we know that these things are going to come. Sir, Bantu trade unions will come, as the hon. member for Hillbrow said; it is just a question of time, and that is why we are asking the Government to have the matter investigated and to make all the necessary adjustments now, perhaps not as rapidly as in the case of the Nico Malan, i.e. within the space of 24 hours. But make a start right now. The Government should not be afraid of making a start with the necessary adjustments, even at this stage; it has the courage to do so. Sir, as far as labour arrangements are concerned, as far as bargaining machinery is concerned, we are still making use of labour legislation today which had its origin in 1924, 50 years ago. How can anyone suggest that that foundation is still completely sound today? Of course it is bound to show cracks after 50 years. Sir, we repeat the request to the Government: Investigate the matter; do not be afraid of what you might find; surely we have nothing to hide. That is why the hon. member for Hillbrow has introduced this motion in all sincerity and we are debating it in earnest and asking the Government not to be afraid; to investigate this matter and then to tell South Africa, &#x201C;We have a new dispensation for the labour problems of South Africa; here it is; we shall see what can be done in the next 20 years.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Pretoria East is so interested in this labour debate that he has left the debating chamber. I want to tell him that we are acting as a responsible Opposition, an Opposition that does not merely scold and disparage and speak of throwing open the sluice-gates to the Black workers, an Opposition that does not play politics, but an Opposition which is trying to make a constructive contribution in the interests of South Africa. We are asking the hon. the Minister, fully aware of our responsibility: Would you not like to examine the problem with us and see whether we cannot perhaps find answers to the questions which are as yet unanswered?</p>

<p>Sir, together with the hon. member who has just resumed his seat and other hon. members on that side of the House, I should just like to consider this problem. But we must consider this problem very sensibly, quietly and calmly and then take a decision which we believe will in this regard be in the interests of the Republic of South Africa. Although I welcome this debate very sincerely, and also the calm and pleasant spirit in which it was conducted, let me say at once that the Government of course regards this matter of <span class="col_1227-1228" refersTo="page_0629"/>labour as being very vital and very important, and that it is the considered standpoint of the Government to do everything in its power to establish a satisfied and stable labour market in South Africa, a labour market consisting of White, Bantu, Coloured and Indian workers. There must be no doubt at all about this.</p>

<p>Before saying a few words on the motion, I want to refer to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. He referred to the question of trade unions on the mines, to works committees, etc. Sir, let me state at the very outset of this discussion that I have no doubt at all that this system of works committees, which affords the Bantu an opportunity of negotiating with the employers and of learning to negotiate in a responsible manner, is a brilliant and outstanding system, and that one should be careful here not to try to run before one has learnt to crawl. And if one does not begin on such a firm basis, one is going to run into difficulties in South Africa, just as other countries have run into serious difficulties, for then one would be saddled with an exploitable situation, in which the very workers whom one wants to be satisfied can be exploited for political and other objectives on a large scale by bodies whose first concern is not the workers&#x2019; interests, but who have political designs. For that reason I am personally delighted at the sensible manner in which the establishment of works committees proceeded, so that they may be used as a foundation on which to build until an answer is found which, in South Africa&#x2019;s circumstances, will be the best answer. What is going to happen in future no one knows for certain. But if the foundation has been laid well and correctly, the foundation of one of our most important and burning issues, namely the trade union movement, there is no one in this House who will not admit that one has set about doing so in a very sensible way. And that these are working well, is proved by the fact that we have had approximately 300 strikes. But do you know, Sir, that if you analyse the position, you will find that 281 of those strikes took place where there were no liaison or works committees. Strikes occurred in only 19 cases where liaison and works committees did exist. At present there are more than 1 700&#x2014;this is the latest figure&#x2014;liaison and works committees serving approximately half a million Bantu workers. The hon. member asked, with reference to what the hon. member for Stilfontein said, whether I had discussed these matters with the bodies concerned. Let me inform you now, Sir, that I had Mr. Harry Oppenheimer in person here in my office in the House of Assembly where we discussed this matter at length, and I think I convinced the hon. gentleman that this system of works committees forms a very excellent basis, or foundation, from which one can operate. I read in the newspapers the other day that they have now made a start with these committees at Kimberley as well. This very week I received another letter from Mr. John Lamb, the Public Relations Adviser of the Chamber of Mines of South Africa, in which he wrote, <i>inter alia,</i> the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The traditional system of representation of workers&#x2019; views has long existed on the mines. This provides for the election of room representatives and the appointment of tribal representatives who meet and communicate views to management.</block>

<p>We all agree that &#x201C;communications between management and labour&#x201D; are of vital importance.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is important, but if the inference is made that we do not give the necessary attention to communications then I say that is not correct because the Chamber of Mines are doing it, we are doing it on the part of the Government and all responsible bodies realize that that is the vital point and are trying wherever possible to establish a good rapport between labour on the one hand and management on the other hand; and if we are successful in establishing a good rapport then we will be successful in creating a peaceful, stable, satisfied and happy labour force in South Africa. I make bold to say that we are progressing in this respect. Then Mr. Lamb, the Public Relations Adviser, added this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1229-1230" refersTo="page_0630"/>Additionally, individual groups have established recently various forms of liaison committees, and considerable experimentation and investigation is in progress to improve communications and evolve a satisfactory system for expression of Black workers&#x2019; views. There are of course difficulties and complexities, but the mining industry recognizes the importance of progress in this area.</block>

<p>*Sir, I can give the assurance that at the time of the strikes and disturbances which occurred on the mines, not a week went by in which I did not hold personal talks with the bodies concerned, and in which I did not call the people of the other departments together to conduct those talks jointly with me. We did not issue a spate of statements on these matters because it was not necessary. However, serious attention is in fact being given to these matters.</p>

<p>We come then to this motion which calls for a commission of inquiry, i.e. that the State President should appoint such a commission of inquiry into the labour situation in South Africa, with particular reference to the mining industry. Now let us consider this matter calmly and quietly. I want to try at once to eliminate a misunderstanding. I know of no other country in the world in which there is greater labour peace than there is in South Africa. Viewed in the light of the fact that we are dealing here with a powerful Bantu, Coloured, Indian and White labour force, this is certainly a very great and wonderful record of which one may be proud. If hon. members shake their heads they need only go to other countries to establish what the circumstances in those countries are. I talk to many people from overseas who visit this country, and I have been overseas myself to see how matters stand there. Let me tell hon. members that South Africa truly has good reason to be proud of its labour force. Nothing the hon. members say can detract in the least from the fact that we have built up a proud record in this regard. I am not saying that there are no problems, but the hon. members should go and see what problems are being experienced in Germany, Great Britain, America and Italy and then compare these with our problems and circumstances. They will then see that South Africa, as far as this matter is concerned, glitters like a diamond and like gold, as I shall indicate in a moment.</p>

<p>The motion calls for the appointment of a commission of inquiry, and I want to say at once that I am very, very sympathetically disposed to this. We should like to do what is in the best interests of South Africa. However, if we examine the question more closely, we see that the Industrial Conciliation Act has already proved itself in respect of wage negotiation and the system of collective bargaining in terms of that Act, and that our system is the envy of numerous other countries. Experts from other countries have told me personally that they think South Africa&#x2019;s industrial conciliation system is one of the very best in the world, and that is most certainly true. Already there are more than 100 autonomous industrial councils that are constantly giving consideration to conditions of service. These councils control 104 wage agreements, as well as a further 93 agreements which make provision for fringe benefits such as pension, medical and vacation benefits. More than a million workers are sharing in the benefits of these agreements. I have made rather a close study of this subject, and I can honestly say that I know of no system of negotiation in any country which I would accept in exchange for our own industrial conciliation system. I have examined the systems of Germany, Great Britain and America, but ours is the best for our circumstances, and the history of this system has proved this.</p>

<p>As far as unorganized workers are concerned, the wage board system has been established. However, this system is a complicated one, and one has to delve deeply into it from early in the morning until late at night before one will be able to understand it in any way. One must first become conversant with what the system makes provision for before one can speak with authority on it, and express an opinion as to what system is the best. The conditions of service of almost 500 000 workers are governed by 69 Wage Board system determinations.</p>

<p><span class="col_1231-1232" refersTo="page_0631"/>We have a channel of communication for Bantu and to enable us to develop this further, the Bantu Labour Relations Regulation Act was passed. I have already pointed out that in just over a year more than 1 700 such committees were established in terms of the Act, offering representation to more than 500 000 Bantu.</p>

<p>Looking at the question of training which is of cardinal importance for sound labour relations in South Africa, we find the National Apprenticeship Board which is constantly providing the Minister with advice. The 32 apprenticeship and 30 subcommittees are constantly giving consideration to training requirements. Unfortunately I do not have sufficient time at my disposal to indicate how much progress has for example, been made with the training of Bantu workers in the White areas in South Africa during the past two months alone. The hon. members would do well to take a little trouble to establish the facts. And now I am not even mentioning the training of Whites. The hon. member for Pinelands mentioned the shortages which came to light as a result of the manpower survey. He pointed out that there had been a shortage of 97 000 in 1971. He is quite right, but apparently he failed to ascertain that that shortage had, according to the 1973 manpower survey of the Department of Labour, dropped to 71 190. I can furnish him with all the figures. In professional occupations there is a shortage of 11 800; in the clerical section, 6 300; transport and communication, 8 800; services, 6 100; and artisans and apprentices, 16 800. Unfortunately I do not have the time to tell the hon. member for Hillbrow now what the requirements in a certain category of work will be in five years&#x2019; time. But we are able to do so. Hon. members do not acquaint themselves with the powerful machinery which has been created in regard to our manpower and the future planning in regard to it. I must be brief now and therefore I will only be able to sketch the broad outlines, although I have very detailed particulars here. Quite a number of bodies are constantly investigating labour matters in this country, which would make a commission of inquiry in this regard absolutely unnecessary and superfluous. I want to mention the manpower survey of the Department of Labour, as well as the brilliant work being done in this connection by the Human Sciences Research Council. In addition there is the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister, the Scientific Manpower Advisory Board, the Department of Statistics, which is constantly engaged in these matters, as well as the economic research bureaux at our universities. After all, we are all acquainted with the one at Stellenbosch. Their findings are regularly quoted here. To try to create the impression here that we do not know what the future requirements, etc., are, is not correct.</p>

<p>In regard to our mines, I can refer the hon. member to a brilliant piece of work which was recently done in this regard which enables us to know precisely what the available manpower position should be in the year 2000, 2025 and by the year 2050 in respect of Bantu labour, in respect of White labourers and particularly in respect of highly skilled technical people in the mining industry, such as mining engineers, chemical engineers and similar professions. Work in this regard is therefore being done.</p>

<p>Upon considering the set-up further, we see that the Committee for the Better Utilization of Manpower is constantly engaged in this entire matter. If we take the entire spectrum into consideration, we find that all these matters are being properly attended to, and that South Africa therefore has reason to be proud. With the best will in the world I cannot find in regard to the general labour situation that a case can be made out for appointing a commission of inquiry at this stage, while all these bodies are engaged in this matter, because we could create more problems with a commission of inquiry than we would solve in the process.</p>

<p>What do we see when we consider the position on the mines in particular? It is very important that hon. members should take cognizance of the fact that in December 1973 there was an average of 42 000 Whites being employed on the mines. There was a shortage of 650. A total of <span class="col_1233-1234" refersTo="page_0632"/>437 000 Bantu workers were being employed, with a shortage of 15 000. In addition there were 17 Asiatics and 900 Coloureds, with no shortages in these categories. Let us consider what the position was in December 1974, a year later, for this is what this entire discussion is all about. We must not lose our heads in regard to this matter; it is really not necessary. A time will still come when South Africa will be very grateful for this process which it is going through, for in the process our mines have been forced to mechanize and to become less dependent on foreign labour. As surely as we are discussing these things now, we are going to benefit from them. Therefore, instead of being unrealistic, let us be grateful for what we can learn in the process and grateful that the circumstances are forcing us to be independent and autonomous as far as our most powerful exchange earner and our largest industry in the Republic of South Africa is concerned. If we examine the position in December 1974 we see that a total of 73 000 Whites were being employed&#x2014;a thousand more than in the previous year While the shortage was only 450. At the time 389 000 Bantu were being employed, with a shortage of 93 000. However, hon. members must bear in mind that the mining industry is growing every year, and that the position in reality is that even if more Bantu were being employed, the number would still be less than the number we really require. From South Africa and its immediate neighbouring states the mining industry has so far this year been able to recruit between 4 000 and 5 000 more Bantu recruits than during the same period last year. The labour position ought to improve considerably if the intensified recruiting in these particular areas can be maintained. Therefore I do not want to say that the general position in regard to our mines, and as far as Bantu labour is concerned, is the best in the world. There was a shortage, as I have indicated, but there was no year, while this matter has been my concern, in which there was no shortage. The only difference is that the shortage is greater now in comparison with 1973.</p>

<p>That is quite true, but let us consider the facts again. A commission of inquiry is now being requested here. However, I want to quote what the Chamer of Mines said&#x2014;</p>

<p>Allow me to state the facts. I think these are very important facts. I quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite this shortfall in labour, the industry has succeeded in maintaining its normal production rate in 1974. The tons of ore milled on gold mines, the members of the Chamber, only dropped by 0,4% from the tonnage milled in 1973.</block>

<p>Because they moved workers from development to stoping.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I admit that, but surely I have already said that the labour situation on the mines is improving. In spite of the shortage, production dropped by only 0,4%. The labour situation is therefore improving. Hon. members must bear in mind that the Chamber of Mines has budgeted R150 million, which it is spending in respect of increased mechanization, etc. Does the hon. member honestly think that a country like South Africa, with all its exceptional abilities and technical skills, will not succeed and will not produce results <span class="col_1235-1236" refersTo="page_0633"/>if it makes R150 million available for better and greater mechanization? We are producing results, and that is why I am able to furnish these impressive figures to the House this afternoon.</p>

<p>However, we have been requested here to appoint a commission of inquiry. What better authority can I quote in this regard than the Chamber of Mines? The Chamber of Mines, which has made a very thorough study of this matter, has informed me that according to them it would not be the right thing to do if we were now to appoint a commission of inquiry into mining matters. [Interjections.] No, they say it is not in the interests of South Africa to appoint a commission of inquiry at the moment. I shall quote their decision verbatim&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Department of Mines be informed that in the opinion of the Chamber of Mines the appointment of a commission of inquiry would serve no purpose and in the present extremely delicate situation would merely create a situation in the gold-mining industry which would do neither the country nor the industry nor its employees any good.</block>

<p>Why would it not be a good thing? Because the Chamber of Mines, the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and all related bodies are giving very serious attention to the matter. They are, in addition, achieving great success. I do not want to spend too much time on this, but I do want to say that it is the immediate target of the Chamber of Mines and the other bodies to become 50% dependent on foreign Bantu on the mines, instead of the present 75%. Surely we will then be able to be proud of the fact that our most powerful industry in South Africa had produced those results. Now, the following question may be put in respect of the disturbances on the mines: What steps are being taken by the gold-mining industry to investigate and limit disturbances in compounds on the mines? Let me tell the hon. members candidly that I admire the way in which these people are trying to resolve and deal with the matter. No commission of inquiry in the world could have done it better than these people, who are working day and night on this problem.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The Human Resources Laboratory of the Chamber of Mines&#x2019; Research Organization is conducting a top priority research programme in this respect. The channels of communication between mine management and Black workers are being investigated and where necessary they are revised almost on a daily basis. I want to thank them for the excellent work they are doing. Thirdly, attempts are continuing to narrow the inter-group differences in the rates of pay for various job categories which was one of the prime reasons for the disturbances and the difficulties we have experienced. Fourthly, the security organization of one of the groups has been instructed to study the recent disturbances at the different levels.</p>

<p>*After everything I have said, I think that I have advanced and motivated sufficient reasons for such a commission of inquiry not being necessary. Although we are very sympathetic to the request and although we are grateful for the opportunity we have had of discussing this matter, it will not be wise and in the interests of South Africa to appoint a commission of inquiry now. I have the support of those people who are very closely involved in this matter. They also feel that a commission of inquiry is not appropriate under the present circumstances.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a new political party has grown up among us recently, and in the debate we had last week a great deal was said about the turbulence which it brought about in the ranks of the United Party. This afternoon I want to refer to both.</p>

<p>Our attitude to the new party which has been founded, is completely uncomplicated. We believe that there was no good reason or any necessity for the formation of another party on the part of the Opposition. In particular we believe that the new party as such cannot contribute to better government or better opposition, and their actions until now have proved this very clearly. That does not detract from the fact that it is every man&#x2019;s democratic right to form a new party if he wants to. It is true that there are strong feelings within the United Party about the manner in which some people went about it, and those feelings are justified. In general, however, I can say that our attitude is that we do not condemn a person simply because he wants to walk a different political path or belong to a different political organization. I want to add that nobody has been expelled from the United Party as a result of his political views. Anyone who implies anything of the sort, is either doing so deliberately and fabricating reasons after the event, or he is uninformed. In connection with the disciplinary measures which were taken against certain members on this side, there were no differences of principle involved. There are people, and one will find such people, who believe that the disciplinary measures which were taken, were too drastic. That can be debated. However, what is not true, is that anyone was expelled from the party because he was a Reformist or a Young Turk or a verligte. Of course there was never any such thing as a Reformist group in the United Party in any organized sense. As far as I am concerned, I was never a member or a forerunner of an organized group in the party which encouraged people to break away from the party. &#x201C;Reformist&#x201D; was the label which the Press&#x2014;not the relevant members themselves&#x2014;from time to time gave to at least 18 individual members of the United Party caucus. Of the 18 members who bore the label of &#x201C;Reformist&#x201D;, 13 are standing by the party solidly as ever. I mention this purely to indicate that nobody was driven from the party because of his political views. I do not believe it was ever a secret that I and others did in fact stand for certain adjustments in the policy of the United Party. I refer chiefly to the unequivocal rejection of baasskap, both White baasskap as well as the possibility of <span class="col_1239-1240" refersTo="page_0635"/>Black baasskap, and secondly the eradication of petty apartheid or to put it more precisely, the ending of all discrimination on the grounds of the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin. These adjustments have been made and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of this party, played a decisive role in those adjustments. Therefore we are justified in saying that if there had ever perhaps been a reason in the past for a so-called Reformist to leave the party because of its unadaptiveness then that reason no longer exists. Here we have it before us once again in the form of our amendment, a clear statement from the party which reads that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An end be put to discrimination, baasskap and domination.</block>

<p>And if there should be people among us, as some speakers have implied, who vote for this, but cannot accept it, then this cannot be held as a complaint against the party; then they are quite simply being dishonest with themselves. The United Party is not a mouldy conservative party in the stuffy sense in which the word &#x201C;conservative&#x201D; is so often used in South Africa. It is not a party of stagnation. It is a party of definite and radical change. Throughout this session we shall put the emphasis on the removal of the baasskap and discrimination which exists in South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to deal further with an accusation that is often made against this side of the House and which emanates from hon. members on the side of the Government. I am referring to the statement that we of the United Party only have eyes for the interests of the non-Whites and not for those of the Whites. I find it extraordinary that people can come to this House as Members of Parliament and be so clueless as to make a statement of that nature. We on this side of the House will never be afraid to defend the just cause of any man, no matter what his name or his colour may be. We will defend the rights of all South Africans and we regard this as our duty. It would, however, be unnatural for us not to be aware of the fact that we as an Opposition of White people cannot divorce ourselves from the fate and the future of the White community as a whole.</p>

<p>Sir, we do know for certain that the biggest threat to the White man is not the existence alongside him of Black people and Coloured people and Indian people. The biggest threat to the White people in South Africa is White domination, White arrogance, White selfishness, discrimination against others and the humiliation of others by an all-White Government. That is the threat to the White man in South Africa. Because of the fact that this Parliament, this Government, is all White, the coloured people of this country see every law, every action by the Government, as the deed and the responsibility of the White community as a whole. Every injustice by the White Government, every deprivation of rights which coloured people have to suffer, is debited against the White community as a whole. Our battle for the removal of discrimination, for a policy of co-operation between White and coloured&#x2014;I use &#x201C;coloured&#x201D; with a small &#x201C;c&#x201D;&#x2014;it is not because we are liberals or liberalists, although I do not care a scrap what I am called, or because we are &#x201C;obsessed with the affairs of the other population groups&#x201D;, as one member on the other side put it. It is precisely because we are White realists and because we have the deepest concern for the future of the White community. If we have any obsession, then it is the obsession of White people who firmly believe that there will be no peace and stability for South Africa, or for any population group in South Africa, and least of all for the Whites, unless all our different communities seek to co-operate politically and otherwise on a basis of no domination and no discrimination.</p>

<p>Sir, every person whose political eyes are situated in the right holes must be aware of the fact that by reason of the pressure of events, politics is on the move in this country today as never before, and every political party in South Africa will be affected by this. But, Sir, let me say this: Time will show no political party will be more affected by the movement of politics than the ruling Nationalist Party; it will all show up in a matter of time, and that is why I must admit to a measure of surprise that so many political writers and commentators on the English language side have developed an obsession with the personnel affairs of the United Party. Sir, the real political news in South Africa does not lie on this side. The real political news in South Africa lies on the other side, on the side of the Nationalist Party. As far as this side is concerned, let me say that despite all the existing party-political divisions on the Opposition side, far more common ground exists today between Opposition groups in South Africa, particularly on matters of discrimination, <span class="col_1241-1242" refersTo="page_0636"/>than ever before, and not by contrivance and certainly not because of any effort to bring about artificial unity, but because of events. We on this side are utterly opposed to any opportunistic artificial unity. We have full confidence in our party and in our policy, but, Sir, that has developed because of events. I therefore regard it as very nearly irrelevant that a few people have changed their seats in the broader political spectrum of the Opposition. Sir, the side that is going to be most affected by the movement of politics and policies in South Africa is the Nationalist Party and not the Opposition Party.</p>

<p>I listened with absorbing interest on Friday to the hon. member for Waterberg. That hon. member has always been and still is one of the stalwarts of apartheid. He was full of confidence in the past. Now he is noticeably full of apprehension. He does not like what is happening on this side of the political scene. I say this with due respect to him, because I have respect for the hon. member. But, Sir, he now employs the same intellectual strategy as Jaap Marais and others employed in this House before they broke away from the Nationalist Party. They fall back on the letter of their party&#x2019;s old handbook, and they cleverly try to bind the Prime Minister to his past utterances, all in a desperate effort to stem the tide of change. Sir, it will be interesting to watch the outcome of it all. I shall return to the hon. member for Waterberg in a few moments.</p>

<p>*Sir, first I want to turn to the Government and the hon. the Prime Minister. Our role as Opposition to the Government has always been a consistent one. We have always supported legislation and Government action which to our minds was in the interests of South Africa. In fact, the attack has often been made on us in certain circles that we support the Government too often, but, Sir, we shall continue to adopt the standpoint that if the Government takes steps which in our opinion are in the interests of South Africa, we shall not hesitate to support them. I might just say in parenthesis that this is not something the hon. member for Yeoville thought out. For years we have been adopting this course in this House. But hon. members will concede that there would be no benefit in, no reason for, the existence of this Parliament if we did not subject all actions on the part of the Government to close scrutiny and level criticism where it is necessary to do so. Sir, we should like to say the following to the hon. the Prime Minister: He knows as well as anyone that he has no hope of improving and normalizing South Africa&#x2019;s relations with Africa and with the world&#x2014;that part of the world which matters&#x2014;if he does not effect internal changes in the field of human relations. We realize that it is not going to be pleasant for him and that it is not going to be easy for him. I think that he might well find that in respect of some matters he is going to get less support from his own side than he will get from the Opposition. We want to say to him as well that we do not expect him to be able to do all this overnight. We accept that it will take some time. But he has no choice, Sir. Changes will have to be effected, and as long as that party is in power, it is he who will have to effect those changes. In the first place, Sir, it seems necessary to us that the Government must ensure that the form of its adjustments has been finalized before causing announcements to be made which arouse public expectations. We saw what happened last week in the case of the Nico Malan; there we had a good example. If one creates expectations and then disappoints people, one always has a bitter reaction, and the partial opening of the Nico Malan only for a few evenings a week immediately evoked a damaging reaction in the rest of the world, and not only at home but also in certain Africa states where we can least afford it. Therefore we want to say to the Government that we hope that future adjustments will be effected in a more finalized manner than has just happened in the case of the Nico Malan.</p>

<p>The second point we want to make is this: When a step is taken then we believe that it is best that it be carried through logically to its full consequences, otherwise it gives rise to lingering agitations and angry feelings. Let me give an example: Last week, after the initial confusion, the Nico Malan was thrown open to everyone including the Blacks, but at the same time the Nico Malan was thrown open to everyone, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development turned down a request to throw open the open-air theatre at Maynardville, which is already open to Coloureds and Indians, to the Blacks as well. Sir, the result is an indefensible position in which the Government finds itself through its own doing and which arouses bad feelings everywhere. We believe that <span class="col_1243-1244" refersTo="page_0637"/>the Government would be acting wisely in such matters if it were rather to end all Government interference in cultural and entertainment matters at one stroke, as a matter of consistent principle, and if it were rather to leave it to the controlling bodies in each case to decide for themselves who they want to admit and who they want to cater to. Then matters will very soon find their own natural level.</p>

<p>The third remark I want to make, is that the Government&#x2019;s undertaking to move away from discrimination was unqualified. Go and read it again, but what do we find now? The hon. the Minister of the Interior says in Pretoria that the Government will bring back the apartheid signs if it feels like it&#x2014;in other words, it will re-introduce discrimination if it feels like it. The hon. member for Waterberg came here on Friday and declared that the Nico Malan Theatre has only been thrown open temporarily, until each population group &#x2014;imagine it!&#x2014;has its own Nico Malan. Sir, we must know what the standpoint of the Government is; we must know whether it is the policy of the Government which these two hon. members have now announced, and we must know whether the Government intends watering down and qualifying its statement on the elimination of discrimination.</p>

<p>In the fourth place we want to advise the Government not to look for political loopholes with a play on words. I shall mention a few examples. Sir, recently we have been forced to listen to it being said that the Government&#x2019;s policy is no longer one of discrimination now, but in any event still one of differentiation. I do not want to debate the difference in meaning between differentiation and discrimination here. I can tell you that the difference between the two words is far more one of nuance than one of a real difference in meaning. But this we must say here at this point: If any action on the part of the Government which is called differentiation amounts to unequal treatment on the grounds of a man&#x2019;s race or colour, then it will be nothing but discrimination. Then there will be no difference in meaning between the two words and consequently we shall not accept that there is any difference between the two.</p>

<p>Another concept which has been frequently employed in recent times to justify discrimination, is &#x201C;identity&#x201D;. It is a new word about which a great deal is being said. We are told that all sorts of laws and provisions are necessary to protect people&#x2019;s identity, <i>inter alia,</i> the Immorality Act. The hon. member for Waterberg used these words on Friday&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Immorality Act does indeed have to do with the preservation of the identity of the White man.</block>

<p>Sir, I have never heard such a lack of logic before. The Immorality Act is only 26 years old, while the identity of the Whites has already been associated with South Africa for 323 years. I shall be pleased if the hon. member can explain that inconsistency to us. We also know that different peoples are scattered over the face of the earth and that many of them are existing alongside one another and intermingled with one another within the same political boundaries. In spite of this they all succeed in such situations to preserve their identity in a natural way. However, the hon. member says that we alone, only the Whites in South Africa, suddenly discovered 26 years ago that a racial law, such as the Immorality Act, was necessary to prevent us from disappearing. Sir, does the hon. member really want us to believe that? But his argument is still a great deal more incomprehensible than that. Each one of us who is sitting here has a different identity. Alongside our South African identity we also have a White identity and most of us in this House have an Afrikaans identity as well. I do not believe that the hon. member will deny that we have an Afrikaans White people in South Africa, but this Afrikaans White people is living in the closest social proximity to other non-Afrikaans people without an Immorality Act. How is it possible that the Afrikaner has been able to preserve his identity against Whites of other languages in a natural way, while, according to the hon. member, this cannot be done against the non-Whites who are so much further removed from him than the other White people, without the Immorality Act. This is what the hon. member&#x2019;s argument amounts to. It is all a play on words. The Immorality Act is simply a remnant of the old negative apartheid programme, something which has brought nothing but harm and endless misery to South Africa.</p>

<p>Therefore it is our standpoint that false gods such as the Immorality Act will have to go. The hon. member also elaborated at <span class="col_1245-1246" refersTo="page_0638"/>length on another concept which we are hearing more of all the time, viz. that of sovereignty. Every people, he says, has the right to retain its own sovereignty, and he quoted a statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister to the effect that he, the hon. the Prime Minister, would refuse as White leader to share the sovereignty of the White people with any other people, and &#x201C;that it has nothing to do with baasskap&#x201D;. Unfortunately it has everything to do with baasskap. It is a very acceptable idea that every people should have sovereignty over itself. &#x201C;Sovereignty&#x201D; means sole control, full control. No reasonable person can be opposed in principle to a people determining its own future. Of course it is easy to apply this principle when the ethnic boundaries coincide with the national boundaries and where you have an homogenous people within one political boundary. Now it is fortunately, or unfortunately, the case that we are one of the many countries which are multi-national. There is not only a White people living here. South Africa is a fatherland for many people. Consequently it is easy enough to arrange that each of these peoples retain cultural sovereignty over itself. In fact, within the White community the Afrikaner people has its own cultural institutions, such as its schools, churches and universities, and nobody is seeking to destroy these. But if anyone of the peoples living in this multi-national South Africa demand political sovereignty, in other words, sole political control, for itself over the country, in other words, over everyone, then it is simply baasskap and nothing else. And that is what the hon. member for Waterberg advocates. [Interjections.] The concept of sovereignty as they support it is nothing else but the old baasskap policy in a new guise.</p>

<p>Let us concede&#x2014;I am prepared to concede it&#x2014;that one or two Bantustans may perhaps become independent. However, once that process has been disposed of, is there anyone in this House who will say that South Africa will not still be a multinational country with a diversity of peoples? South Africa is destined to be a multi-national country. Now the hon. member for Waterberg says that every people has the right to demand sovereignty over itself. In other words, every people in South Africa&#x2014;I am referring to those who remain after a Bantustan or two has become independent&#x2014;then has the right to demand sovereignty. I say that this is a nice idea, but that it is not capable of implementation in the circumstances of South Africa. I shall be pleased if the hon. member, or any other member, could explain to us how he would apportion authority over foreign affairs, defence, posts and telecommunications, railways and air transport, immigration, water affairs, economic expansion, police, tourism and whatever else one might mention, among the different peoples. One cannot apportion these; surely this is impossible. If one of the peoples in South Africa should demand therefore, that he wants full control over everything, it amounts to nothing but baasskap.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House have finally rejected any one of the peoples in South Africa having the right to exercise sole control over South Africa forever. Therefore we are not seeking an escape in words or concepts which are meant to deceive peoples. All the people who remain in South Africa can enjoy all the cultural sovereignty or exclusiveness which they want, but in the field of political control they will have to seek to co-operate as equals and if this is done in a federal way, there is no reason why anyone need fear that he will be dominated or that he will lose his identity.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall furnish the hon. member for Bezuidenhout with a reply in the course of my speech. At the outset I want to ask the hon. member whether, since he alleged that the Immorality Act is 28 years old, he is <span class="col_1247-1248" refersTo="page_0639"/>not aware that the Immorality Act between Bantu and Whites is much older than that? Never in all the years of his party&#x2019;s government did they withdraw that Act. When the National Party eventually came to apply it, in so far as it concerned the other races as well, it was something terrible. If the hon. member will be so friendly as to listen, I should like to put a question to him and I expect a direct answer from him. If the United Party repeals the Immorality Act, will they also repeal it in respect of the Whites and the Bantu? Why do they only tell half the story, and not the full story? When we debate here, I think we owe it to each other to put the facts in full. Over the weekend I read that the three splinter groups of the United Party are engaged in attempts to form a coalition and to found a new party. I want to warn the hon. members of the Opposition that they must prevent such an eventuality occurring. If that were to happen, their time would be up. To begin with I just want to say that they should not all cross over to the National Party, particularly not the frontbenchers. I am now sitting here on the very last front-bench of the National Party, while many Opposition members are senior to me. If they were to start rapidly crossing over to the National Party, I should have to move back to the back-benches or the middle benches and no one likes promotion of that kind. Hon. members opposite must please ensure that they bring along sufficient backbenchers to enable me to retain my place in the front bench. Our benches are already so full that we should then have to take over the Opposition benches.</p>

<p>I now want to pass from these remarks in lighter vein to the more serious business of politics. Thirty years ago, when I was a young man&#x2014;believe that if you will&#x2014;I was looking at an Opposition even smaller than the present Opposition. A mightier Government side was sitting here whose benches extended right around and further than my present bench. Some people are now maintaining that history is repeating itself. However it cannot repeat itself this time, because there is one basic difference: As far back as 1945, that small Opposition party, under the leadership of the late Dr. D. F. Malan and a small group of stalwarts, was taking a world situation into account. They knew that they were at a juncture at which the non-White peoples of Africa would be emancipated. They knew that the immediate future held a new dispensation for the people. They concerned themselves with that new dispensation and worked out a policy that would make it possible for the Whites and the non-Whites to live together in harmony in South Africa, a policy that would enable the Whites to stay here as Whites and the non-Whites to stay here as non-Whites in such a way that there would not be constant friction between them. At the time that policy was called &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;, a policy that was slandered by the other side of the House until it acquired a certain odour overseas. It was a policy in accordance with which the peoples had first to be separated before the policy could be developed into what it is today. There had first to be a process of emancipation by means of separation and separate development, the creation of good neighbourliness and the promotion of the concept of multi-nationality. That is the stage we have reached today. That is what many members of the Opposition&#x2014; they are a very honest Opposition&#x2014;cannot and do not want to understand. The policy of multi-nationality and separate development contains certain inherent components. Without those components it would have had no right of existence. It would then have been a policy which could have existed neither in South Africa nor in the world of today. Those components I call obligations on the one hand and guarantees on the other. There are obligations in respect of every person living in the country&#x2014;White, Brown or Black&#x2014;to whichever race group he may belong. Inherent in the policy, too, are guarantees to every coloured group. This does not apply to the Whites alone.</p>

<p>To begin with I now want to deal with the obligations inherent in the policy. The various races will eventually be developed into peoples and be emancipated in a dignified manner. The human dignity of other groups is one of the basic requirements of the policy of multi-nationality or the policy of neighbourliness in South Africa. I must be prepared to emancipate a man of another national group or colour group so that he may become a full and dignified citizen in his own right. Our policy must be a policy of friendliness or&#x2014;let me use another good description for it&#x2014;courtesy. We must be courteous towards other people and be willing for them to have everything in the world which we claim for ourselves. This is particularly applicable to us as the guardian nation. The policy of the National Party is to move away from discrimination as quickly as it can and it very much wants to <span class="col_1249-1250" refersTo="page_0640"/>move away from it. That is its stated policy. Of course one cannot move away from it faster than one&#x2019;s policy can develop. These aspects of emancipation, namely human dignity and development, must go together in any policy. In the last instance there must also be absolute honesty. These people must not be misled by promises. Carrots must not be dangled in front of them for them to chase after. They must be informed of the policy in an honest way.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the aspect that so offends the hon. member, namely what the hon. member for Waterberg supposedly said on Thursday. Of course there are, on the other hand, the guarantees to each people that its identity will be retained. After all, one&#x2019;s identity is something that no-one else can claim. A person who does not have enough self-respect for his own identity to be of value to him, is not worthy of being a person. He is not worthy of being a member of a nation. He is not worthy of being a member of a specific group. If that identity means nothing to him, why, then, do family ties mean anything to him? Surely there are many ties that link us in this life, and our identity is one of the most important. The second guarantee that people will demand is the indivisibility of power over their own people. The hon. member said, at great length and with much gesticulation: We are now slowly but surely going through a transition and the people behind the Prime Minister do not understand him. Where could one find a clearer statement of policy than that made by our Prime Minister at the end of last year?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that and I shall reply to the question with pleasure, but then the hon. member must just give me a chance to complete the argument. The hon. the Prime Minister told us that one of the absolutely basic foundations of the National Party&#x2019;s policy is the indivisibility of power of each national group over its own people in its own area. This applies to every people and to every race group in South Africa because apart from the homelands, we also have group areas. Just as we demand it for ourselves, we also promise the indivisibility of power to every national group over its own people in its own area. The hon. the Prime Minister has told us so many times what his policy is in respect of those who do not have homelands, viz. the Coloureds, the Indians and the Whites. What applies to these national groups also applies to me as a White person and in time it will press upon me quite as hard as it will press upon those nations that are in the process of emancipation. The day those people are emancipated, they will have to share with me what I must share with them. This is our argument and until we have reached that point there will be a degree of differentiation and differences. This must be so, because it cannot be otherwise. This policy is a policy that is taking shape or a policy that is unfolding. The National Government stated this policy years ago and as we move forward every day, adjustments take place. However, those adjustments are absolutely in accordance with the policy of the National Party and if the hon. members can show me one adjustment that is not in accordance with it, I shall concede it to them, but they are unable to do so. It is the policy of the National Party that every national group shall have undivided power over its own people in its own area.</p>

That hon. member is sitting almost in the front benches, but one day when it penetrates to him, I know that he will be one of the first hon. members who will come and sit just behind me. There is no homeland for the Coloureds, but we call their areas group areas. The Coloureds live in their own group areas where they will be given the greatest possible sovereignty over their own people. [Interjections.] Of course that is so and what of it?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, through you I should like to ask the hon. member sitting next to me here whether he knows what rights I claim for myself. I claim the greatest possible sovereignty for myself. In time, those people will have sovereignty over themselves, too. At present we have an interim policy and we shall apply this policy during the period of emancipation until we are able to make it a permanent policy in the future. It goes without saying that in terms of that interim policy it is our ideal to make it possible for every national group to have all possible facilities, development and cultural facilities, each in its own area. As long as a national group does not have those facilities in its own area, it will share them with us. I say this particularly for the benefit of the hon. member on the other side. The day a people has its own facilities, it will no longer share ours with us.</p>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>That is not so. We have been saying for a long time that we decide on these matters from time to time. We consider from time to time whether these people require certain facilities and whether they have developed to such an extent that they should be granted the necessary concessions. Sometimes it takes 20 years. After all, people are developing and progressing. When a population group has reached a certain level of development, the White administration, in its wisdom, decides that the time has come to grant them certain facilities that they do not have. Thus, for example, it was decided that we should share the Nico Malan Theatre with them. However, such a population group does not have a permanent right to it. If they were to acquire it, I should in fact be giving them a right in my own area.</p>

<p>But they are paying for it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but they will also have to pay for the facilities created in their own areas. We shall also have to pay a share of the facilities established in the area belonging to another population group. What those poor people are, unable to understand is that there are two sides to everything. What I claim for myself I also give the other man, and where he pays for my help, I, again, help to pay for him. I find it so childish that the hon. members opposite are unwilling or unable to understand those things.</p>

<p>At present the other population groups are enjoying it together with me. However, I want to go a step further today. I have not heard my Leaders make a statement about this, but today I want to tell hon. members opposite that I believe that if and when the other groups have similar facilities, they will have a say in respect of their facilities while we shall retain our say in the White area. As the other groups develop, we shall be able to attend each other&#x2019;s extraordinary functions, either by invitation from the White man and, conversely, the Brown man, or on application. There will probably always be exceptional occasions which, for example, can only be arranged at a university in the Western Cape. In such a case other people may be invited to attend. If we omit to invite them, they can come on application just as we shall be able to go to them. This is precisely what we are doing today. I am a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, and I am proud of it. Until last year I was an elder of the church and I am proud to be able to attest that when the Mission Church opens a new church or receives a new clergyman. White or non-White, we go to that church by invitation. When this occurs we regard it as an honour and they regard it as an honour that we should come. There is no friction in such circumstances. If I go to their church again the following Sunday, it becomes silly, which the hon. member so likes to be. It then becomes an absolute farce because there is no possible excuse for it. That is the difference. Is the hon. member unable to understand that? If we have arranged something exceptional, we invite them and we treat them decently. As those people become emancipated and improve their position socially, economically and otherwise, as they develop, to that <span class="col_1253-1254" refersTo="page_0642"/>extent they will live alongside us on a different basis, but in their own areas. These facts will remain. Now the hon. member or the hon. member over there on the other side of him, who can argue a little more reasonably about the facts, must tell me that if we develop further he would like to see them having a full say in our group area. He must also tell me whether we must constantly be interfering in their area, or does he agree that this policy of the National Party at least possesses morality and honesty? The hon. the Prime Minister can at least go overseas and travel in Africa with this policy. Our hon. Prime Minister always tell us that he tries to create good relations and seek d√©tente in Africa. He seeks it by way of separate development, because this is nothing to be ashamed of. Separate development is not something one needs to hide. It is not immoral. On the contrary, it contains every moral aspect and every grain of morality an ordinary person could want to have towards another person. This is exactly how it is in daily life with regard to the emancipation of people. When one emancipates one&#x2019;s own child or a step-child, one does not share one&#x2019;s personality with him nor one&#x2019;s most intimate family circle. One emancipates him to enable him to have his own house and his own identity and display his own personality. If this is true of daily life between people, then it is far more true of national life in South Africa. After all, the hon. member knows and understands these things. Today I want to make the allegation that as it penetrates to our people, and as they become aware of the realities of multi-nationality and of neighbourliness with the other peoples in South Africa, so those hon. members will come over to this side. The Government&#x2019;s benches will expand towards that side until they extend right to that corner on the other side. I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout will retain his place there if he understands well enough how to join the new parties that will be established. He is a master in that respect and I believe that he will join them. I want to predict that the men who are still young now and who will be sitting there on the gallery in 20 years time as I sat there in that time, will see one great and powerful Government side that will extend right round until the last bench. On the last few benches the whole conglomeration of parties will sit, one behind the other, possibly with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as the leader of that group. But I leave it at that.</p>

<p>I just want to extend my sincere sympathy to those parts of our country &#x2026; Did you want to ask something else? I shall continue to discuss the subject with pleasure.</p>

<p>Sir, I said that it was my intention to proceed to a more serious matter. I want to concern myself with those parts that have been inundated by the terrible floods in the Transvaal. Since the Vaal River has burst its banks and since even parts of the Orange River are threatening to burst their banks and cause a great deal of damage, I just want to tell the people in those regions that we are thinking about them and have the fullest sympathy with them and that we understand their difficulties, because the <span class="col_1255-1256" refersTo="page_0643"/>Lower Orange Region had a similar experience last year. We had to see our crops and our lands being washed away while we were unable to do anything about it. Sir, I want to tell the people in those afflicted areas that man is a wonderfully adaptable being. One is struck by natural disasters but one survives them and soon forgets them. In these days we feel particularly close to those people, because the water in those rivers that are now bursting their banks in the Transvaal and in the Free State are going to flow down the Lower Orange River. Sir, all we can do is hold our breaths and wait and see what is going to happen, but I want to tell those people in advance that we will be with them in our thoughts and that they can be sure that the Government will be sympathetic towards them. Having only just completed major and expensive works, on which they still owe a great deal of money, and having had virtually no income from that land, they can expect very sympathetic treatment from the Government and from the people as a whole. I thank the people and the Government for their sympathetic treatment of those people, and I want to ask my people not to lose their courage and faith.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I get on so well with the hon. member who has just resumed his seat that I would rather not clash with him, but I must say quite honestly that his explanation about the Nico Malan is only spoiling the Government&#x2019;s case. The Government has taken a good decision, but the hon. member is now spoiling the matter with this excuse of temporariness and attendance by invitation. Why does he not say, as the Government should have said, &#x201C;This was crass discrimination: we made a mistake and we have now rectified it&#x201D;? This is what the Government should have said, and if it had said so. everyone would have praised it, but explanations of this kind only spoil the Government&#x2019;s case. Then the hon. member wants to imply that Coloured people&#x2019;s sovereignty will be limited to the group areas. I ask members on that side: Is that the future of the Coloured people; are they to be limited to their group areas here in the Cape Province? The hon. member on my left is a friendly person, but he really spoiled his case today when he spoke about what the Government had done in connection with the Nico Malan. There is less clarity on the Government&#x2019;s policy towards the Coloured people now than there had been before he delivered his speech.</p>

<p>Sir, during the no-confidence debate as well as during the course of this debate, various hon. members pointed out that the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development is inconsistent with the realities of modern developing South Africa. While the Government&#x2019;s plans for political development are moving in an apartheid direction, the rest of the South African society is moving in another direction. In the field of sport, in the social field, in the field of culture, in the field of education and in the important sphere of our national economy, we are in a sense being drawn closer to each other, regardless of our race or colour. Especially in the field of our national economy the policy of separate development is running into difficulties, for the good reason set out by the hon. member for Johannesburg North. The fact is that hon. members opposite will have to accept one day that separate development cannot be reconciled with economic development in South Africa. Therefore, even if we are not able to convince them across the floor of the House that that policy is not going to succeed, it will be driven home to them one day by the hard economic realities of South Africa. And because that policy is going to collapse one day, I want to confine myself at this moment to saying something about the alternative policies available to all of us in South Africa. [Interjections.] Sir, my time is limited, but if there is time later on, I shall be glad to answer questions.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Durban Point gave us an exposition of the United Party&#x2019;s federal policy. I think this House is indebted to him for having put it in a nutshell and clearly. I presume that it was neither reform nor orthodox, but centrist and I would assume that it is authoritative. The hon. member for Durban Point has given us his policy in a nutshell and with a considerable degree of clarity. As I understood him the prime objective of that policy is to create a situation in which there will be no domination of one group over the other. This seems to be the rationale behind the United Party&#x2019;s federal policy. Going through the main point he made, he said that they found that there were in South Africa different, and identifiable racial communities, and that basically people lived according to their ethno-cultural identities. The concept therefore was that there were <span class="col_1257-1258" refersTo="page_0644"/>different racial communities with their separate ethno-cultural identities. There were problems and, on examining the situation, the hon. member&#x2019;s commission found that as long as you had a unitary system of government it meant domination by numbers, of the majority over the minority, as he put it as long as the central Government was based upon a unitary Parliament with direct representation of the people from the bottom to the top. This was the problem as he saw it and in view of this the commission decided to recommend to his party that it should abandon the unitary concept and that it should accept the federal concept. He described this as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So we as a party, on the recommendation of the committee, abandoned the unitary concept, the Westminister concept, a fundamental change in political thinking, and we looked to the only practical alternative, a federal system.</block>

<p>The hon. member said that in 1972 there was a fundamental change in political thinking on the part of the United Party. He seemed to attach considerable significance to this date and to this event. I want to say that I am not with him that this was a fundamental change. I have pamphlets relating back to 1961 and to 1966 in which the United Party declared itself in favour of a race federation. I have pamphlets and statements by Mr. Marais Steyn on behalf of the United Party, saying that race federation must be based on groups and not on areas; the federal Parliament would not necessarily be sovereign. This was in 1962. Then we had the hon. member for Durban North in that celebrated no-confidence debate in which he described changes in their policy and said &#x201C;it is now what it is&#x201D;, and he went on to say to the Prime Minister that no change had taken place&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have not changed anything. I do not have it here &#x2026; I will give him a copy of our principles and he will see that the United Party pledges itself to the setting up of a federation of peoples in South Africa. It is in the constitution and has been there for years.</block>

<p>So, I doubt whether there is any need to suggest that there was special significance in the change which took place as the result of the report of that particular committee. The hon. member went on to describe the key problem and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whichever way you look at it and however you try to juggle boundaries, you will have a majority controlling a minority.</block>

<p>And he then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But a federation of communities would eliminate this, not of geographic areas drawn on a map but a federation of communities where each community would control its own affairs.</block>

<p>So, pivotal in the thought of the hon. member&#x2014;and I do not want to mislead anyone on this&#x2014;is the concept of separate racial communities with ethno-cultural identities controlling their own affairs. This was in essence the protection which would be provided to racial communities in terms of the United Party&#x2019;s federal policy. This is as I see it. I would like to look briefly at both the efficacy and the feasibility of such a scheme.</p>

<p>As expressed in practice I find this philosophy of having groups recognized for constitutional arrangements, both executive and legislative, in direct conflict with the philosophy which has been propounded for some time now by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and, to a lesser extent, by the hon. member for Edenvale. I find this in direct conflict with what these two hon. gentlemen have been saying. Here is the concept of racial division for legislative and executive purposes entrenched in the Constitution and the hon. member &#x2026;</p>

<p>Do you not want a racial Senate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I will deal with my policy shortly. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asks for &#x201C;the removal of all discrimination based on the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin; in other words colour apartheid must be buried and the colour curtain must come down in South Africa.&#x201D; Colour apartheid must be buried and the colour curtain must come down in South Africa, but he says we must divide the people of South Africa on an ethnic or colour or race basis for the purpose of administration and the legislative and the executive control of their lives. I have no objection to him advocating either of these concepts, but what I want to say is that the two are in direct <span class="col_1259-1260" refersTo="page_0645"/>conflict, one with the other. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout goes further. He does not only argue that the colour barriers must come down, but he says that we must have an open society. I believe that it was unfair of one of the newspapers to say: &#x201C;Sap pleit vir gemengde woonbuurte.&#x201D; I do not think that the hon. member said so in so many words. But speaking to the Coloured Labour Party in South Africa, he said that the apartheid society should go. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This simply means that people and institutions should be left to determine their own place in society without dictation from Pretoria as to whom they should associate with and whom not.</block>

<p>He went on in this House the other day to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Fundamentally our outlook is that in respect of social and economic and cultural freedom, every individual in this country must have the right to seek his own social, cultural and economic place in society unburdened by Government restrictions on the grounds of race ideology.</block>

<p>I repeat&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; unburdened by any Government restrictions on the grounds of race ideology-</block>

<p>And yet the hon. member for Durban Point, supported by the hon. member for Green Point, said that we must structure our society on race and colour; we must have separate group areas, separate educational institutions, separate hospitals and separate social and welfare institutions. I have no objection to this being the United Party&#x2019;s policy, but I say that it is in direct conflict with the philosophy which has been propounded time and time again by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He cannot say that the colour curtain in South Africa must come down in South Africa and that apartheid must go, that individuals and societies must be free, without Government restrictions, to find their own place and then still say that we must nevertheless have constitutional provisions for seeing that peoples&#x2019; lives are regulated on the basis of ethnic, race or colour grounds.</p>

<p>The same thing applies as regards the hon. member for Edenvale. He tried to define what discrimination and enforced aparthheid were. He condemned group areas, separate universities, separate trade unions, separate nursing professions and separate academic associations. Yet you cannot have separate educational institutions for the various race groups and still have mixed universities. Surely, if you are going to have separate hospital and health services for Coloureds, Blacks, Indians and others it is natural that you should have separate nursing institutions and nursing associations. I am not objecting to this being the policy of the United Party, but what I do want to point out is that it is in direct conflict with the liberal, laissez-faire approach which is aimed at getting rid of colour discrimination and pulling down the colour curtain, as has been stated time and time again inside and outside this House by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, the hon. member for Edenvale and, perhaps, some others.</p>

<p>What about university autonomy? They have the right to admit whom they want to admit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>If there is university autonomy, why should it be regulated on a colour basis, by a separate section of the population? Why should provision be made in the Constitution for universities to be regulated either by Coloured, Indian or White race councils?</p>

<p>But let us look at the protection, to the extent to which there is protection. Protection, in terms of any constitutional device, whether the United Party&#x2019;s, the Progressive Party&#x2019;s or the National Party&#x2019;s, is limited by the powers of the councils which are being created. You cannot have greater protection than the powers which are accorded to the particular councils. Bearing in mind that the United Party&#x2019;s policy says. &#x201C;We reject the concept of a geographic federation: ours is a communal federation, a race federation in which we will not draw on the map of South Africa but deal with it on the basis of separate communities&#x201D;, one has to ask what powers there are. The hon. member for Durban Point talked about pensions, but what have pensions to do with the ethno-cultural unity of either the White, Coloured or Indian communities? He mentioned social welfare; so we will look after the Red Cross, the Roy Scouts, the Girl Guides and 101 social welfare organizations on a compartmentalized basis in terms of a Constitution which says that groups shall be separated <span class="col_1261-1262" refersTo="page_0646"/>one from the other. The hon. member also talked about local government. Here in the Cape the hon. member for Green Point will recall how we all went to the City Hall three years ago to protest against apartheid being brought into the municipal voters&#x2019; roll. We said that as far as the Cape was concerned, every ratepayer must have a vote. Now one gathers that it is United Party policy to have separate votes and separate rolls for separate institutions. What about education? Do we not want open universities? If we do want open universities, why should they fall under the separate control of separate racial councils? I presume that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout would in due course envisage some multi-racial schools and that this is a natural evolution of &#x201C;the colour curtain must come down.&#x201D; If there are going to be these schools, why do we try to put them into racial compartments today? Why do we want to structure our constitution on the basis of separate facial ethnic compartments when at the same time we are advocating an open society? I have not the time to deal with all the other aspects, but the report which the hon. member for Durban Point signed also listed a number of other matters which would be under the control of these non-geographic councils. These matters include traffic and roads, building services, horse-racing and betting, licensing, shop hours, cemetries, road transportation and liquor laws. What do these have to do with racial identity or with ethno-cultural activities? How do you control them if you do not have a geographic federation? How do you control roads and traffic without having a geographic federation? This is not going to work. It is not going to provide protection. What is more, it is going to entrench petty apartheid in South Africa because we are not dealing with a grand design for the future of South Africa, but with small everyday matters. If you are going to structure your constitution on race and colour as is the intention of the United Party, you are going to perpetuate race division and discrimination in South Africa.</p>

<p>As far as the federal government is concerned it is structured on separate voters&#x2019; rolls in which there will be a qualified franchise based on a group qualification and legislators will be elected on a group basis. Whatever formula you like to use, if there is no discrimination in pay, job opportunities and education, in a very short space of time it is understandable that group which is not White will be the dominant group within that council. I have no objection to this as far as the principle is concerned, but there is no protection such as is claimed by the United Party because this federal assembly is in due course going to take over from the White Parliament as the sovereign parliament of the country. In that parliament, which will be the dispenser of powers, there will be no protection whatsoever. I believe that this is a half-baked scheme which will do no more than preserve prejudice in South Africa, entrench racialism and race discrimination while at the same time it will not provide the protection which the United Party claims for it.</p>

<p>The Progressive Party adopts a different approach. It does not claim to give the absolute protection which the United Party claims it can give; it accepts that South Africa is one country and, in a constitutional sense, one nation, it accepts, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout does, that there is a plural society and that there are groups, but that those groups must find their own level without dictation either by Pretoria or by the race ideology enshrined in the Government. We believe that there is enough common in South Africa, while recognizing the existence of groups, for some common bond which will bring people together in a common loyalty and a common desire to work together within a single political structure.</p>

<p>As far as the homelands are concerned, let me make it quite clear that if when a party like the Progressive Party were to come into power there were independent homelands, we would quite naturally have to recognize their independence. If there are other homelands which have opted for independence but which have not yet attained that status, we will ask them to reconsider their position and come back into a federal arrangement in South Africa. But where they have committed themselves and where it is their intention to continue, we will respect their wishes in this regard. What is more, we will not make the land set aside in terms of the 1936 Land Act the maximum but the minimum amount of land for a reasonable settlement. We believe that within what is left of South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I have only limited time. We believe that there should <span class="col_1263-1264" refersTo="page_0647"/>be a federal form of government in an orthodox geographic federation. That is the policy on which this party was founded. This would limit the danger of authoritarianism. This would take the government back to the people and because of the fragmented authority which is implicit in a federal system, we believe that some of the fear which people have of domination by a central authority will be removed.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Our policy is that sovereignty should not be vested in a White Parliament, but that sovereignty should be vested in the Constitution which should be rigid to the extent that it cannot be altered save by a two-thirds majority of both Houses, or in matters affecting the provinces, by the provinces concerned, themselves supported by a two-thirds majority. In matters affecting racial communities, their approval should be sought in a referendum.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Secondly, there should be maximum decentralization of powers in favour of self-governing provinces, and within those provinces in favour of regional and local authorities. Thirdly, we believe that there should be the maximum separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government at all levels of government. The key factors, which we believe should be entrenched in the Constitution, would be the powers of the federal and State Governments, the powers of the legislature, executive and judiciary and perhaps, what is most important of all, the financial relationships between the federal government and the various provincial governments. One cannot merely have subsidies from the central authority. There must be a specific financial arrangement written into the Constitution and entrenched. We believe that in the self-governing provinces new boundaries should be determined on the basis of community and diversity of interests. We say that in doing this quite clearly the development which has taken place under the National Party, in relation to the homelands, will have to be one of the factors which are taken into account. None of these areas will be racially exclusive and they will all have a geographic base. We would be able to give them the really significant powers which can only be administered on a territorial basis and not on a racial basis. In the self-governing provinces, the form of government and system of representation, we realize, will have to be negotiated and will have to take into account the situation one finds when coming into power. This will have to be taken into account in any situation.</p>

<p>As far as the Central Government is concerned, we believe that there should be a bicameral legislature, a House of Assembly and a Senate with equal and co-ordinate powers. As far as the House of Assembly is concerned, we favour a non-racial franchise rather than a racial one. He favour a proportional system of representation rather than the exclusive winner-take-all constituency system which applies in South Africa at the moment. While one is extending the franchise from its present exclusive White elite to the people of South Africa, it will be necessary to have a phasing-in process to see that there is an orderly transition from an exclusive White situation to a multi-racial situation. The United Party has its qualification on a group basis; we believe that in this period of transition there should be qualification on an individual basis. We realize that in this system certain people will initially not qualify. Therefore we have said that 10% of the seats in this House should be set aside for people who do not qualify. We have said, further, that when the number of unqualified people&#x2014;in other words those who are voting for Parliament on a limited basis&#x2014;reaches 20% of the total, the voter&#x2019;s roll for the unqualified voters can be phased out and in due course the qualification could fall away because the overwhelming majority of the people would in the ordinary course of events be qualified. We make no apology at all for this kind of phasing-in operation. We believe that our federal system, with its decentralization, its separation of powers and its evolutionary nature, will do much to relieve anxieties and fears and promote political cohesion and unity. In spite of this, there will still be people who will have fears and there will still be the risk of discrimination, and so we incorporate three additional features. We say that there should be a Bill of Rights which should apply at all levels and which will prevent adverse discrimination against individuals either by <span class="col_1265-1266" refersTo="page_0648"/>the executive or by the legislature. Where there are racial communities who wish to identify themselves as such for the purpose of protecting themselves, they should be free to participate in the Senate elections on that basis. Any candidate who cannot get one-fifth of the votes of the voters who do not belong to his racial community, should not be elected. We make it quite clear that no one will be forced. If any racial community does not want to identify itself for the purpose of this protection, that protection would fall away automatically. There is no compulsion: it is an offer, a permissive situation within our Constitution.</p>

<p>Similarly we believe that there should be no change in the Constitution adversely affecting any group, and any group should therefore have the right to reject that change at a referendum. Once again, if groups do not wish to identify for this purpose which is purely to protect them from discrimination, there is no compulsion and they are not required to do so.</p>

No matter how good it is, in the present circumstances of Africa it will be unacceptable to the other racial communities unless they are brought in to work out the details of this proposal.

They are doing South Africa a disservice because they are holding up so-called discrimination to the world and making a big fuss about it as though it were a terrible atrocity that was being committed in South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, but I nevertheless take an interest in these matters. At the start, while I was listening to the hon. members for Constantia, Cape Town Gardens and Johannesburg North, it became clear to me that they want to pretend that things are going very badly for South Africa. What is the truth? Exactly the opposite is true, because things are going exceedingly well for South Africa. I cannot emphasize enough how well things are going for South Africa. The hon. member for Constantia has a way of telling a sad story in a very sad way. While I was listening to his exposition of how badly things were going for South Africa, it struck me as a sad story. I just want to say that if he were chosen to play the role of Jeremiah, I think it would be an outstanding choice. He would be excellent at it. Other hon. members opposite are good at that role too.</p>

<p>In the few minutes at my disposal I should just like to explain to the House how well things are in fact going for South Africa. The past year, 1974, which we are referring to in the economic sphere in this debate, was an outstanding year for South Africa. What is more, the prospects for 1975 are very good as well.</p>

<p>Not in spite of this Government, but as a result of this Government. On the other hand, the world economy is in a bad way. Hon. members on the opposite side of the House mentioned this and there is no doubt that in the economic sphere the rest of the world is in fact in a very bad way. Most countries of the world are having to contend with a combination of recession, unemployment, inflation, balance of payments problems and still many more factors. Attempts at international monetary reform have failed. The Committee of Twenty, did not succeed in reaching an agreement in respect of monetary reform. On the other hand, here in South Africa&#x2014;I shall emphasize this repeatedly&#x2014;things are going very well. In recent times we have experienced circumstances which were unprecedented in the world of today. Hon. members on the opposite side might tell me that I should not draw comparisons with other countries. When we speak about inflation, for example, we point out that the rate of inflation in South Africa is not as high as it is in many other countries of the world. But the hon. members say comparisons are odious. However, we are not living a life of isolation in this world. We are part of it. If one wants to determine how great one&#x2019;s achievements are or how sound one&#x2019;s position is, there is only one way in which one can do so and that is by making comparisons with other parts of the world. Now, if we compare South Africa&#x2019;s position with other countries of the world, we find that South Africa is quite sound financially and economically. If it is true that South Africa is quite sound financially and economically, there must be certain underlying foundations on which that sound condition in South Africa has been constructed, even if it is not only financial <span class="col_1269-1270" refersTo="page_0650"/>and economic matters. I should, like to analyse a few factors here to sketch South Africa&#x2019;s sound position in the world.</p>

<p>In the first place there is the growth rate we have had here in South Africa. From November 1972 to the third quarter of 1974, we experienced a strong upward1 phase in our economic cycle. We in South Africa, as a growing, developing country&#x2014; I want to state clearly that we are not a developing country in the same sense of the word as is the position in France or Germany or Japan or other countries of the world&#x2014;are still a developing country and we have, over the long term, had an upward trend in our productivity and in our economic cycle. Within that upward trend in our economic cycle, however, we also find what are referred to as business cycles. These go up and down. So we showed phenomenal growth during the past year, up to the third quarter of 1974, a strong upward trend in our cycle. This upward movement which we experienced is largely attributable to our increased exports and the increase in the gold price. This was followed by an increase in capital investment in South Africa. As a result of these splendid economic conditions, more machinery was purchased. More equipment was purchased and more money was spent on the construction of buildings. As a result of this the stock position in South Africa improved and there was also, as one might have expected, an increase in Government spending. Eventually there was an increase in private spending too. This is what we experienced during 1974, during this period in which, according to the Opposition, things went so badly for South Africa. During this period our real gross domestic product showed the following trends: in 1972 it showed an increase of 3,6%, in 1973, 4,1% and in 1974, viewed in the light of the economic conditions in the world, we had the phenomenal growth rate of 7% in respect of our gross domestic product. Considering world conditions, this is a particularly high figure.</p>

<p>At the end of his speech the hon. member asserted that we should eliminate discrimination in the field of labour. He stated that, by so doing, we would encourage production. As though the elimination of discrimination in respect of labour would encourage production! Surely this is the biggest nonsense on earth. This is the only drum he beats, because he belongs to that party. It is not we who are colour conscious; it is they who are colour conscious. They think of nothing but colour. [Interjections.] Their entire political philosophy is based on colour.</p>

<p>Sir, I was dealing with our agricultural position a moment ago. 1974 was a record year. I do not believe that we have ever in our history had an agricultural year such as the one we had in 1974. In 1974 agriculture contributed two points to the increase in our gross domestic product. We expect a negative figure of one point this year, because the production figures will not be as high as they were in 1974, but, nevertheless&#x2014;and this is the reply to the hon. member for Constantia&#x2014;we expect a growth rate of between 3% and 4% again this year. Furthermore, we expect a greater acceleration in 1976. Sir, please allow me to quote the following extract to you from the report of the Bureau for Economic Research in Stellenbosch&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After the South African economy had been in an upward phase of the economic cycle from the final quarter of 1972, we are convinced that a turning point was reached in the third quarter of 1974 and that lower rates of growth may be expected for the next few quarters. It must immediately be emphasized that the cyclical movement in the South African economy is to a significant extent on the one hand intensified and on the other hand counteracted by virtually <span class="col_1271-1272" refersTo="page_0651"/>exogenous factors in the form of climatic and other physical conditions. It is therefore important to look at the performance of the South African economy exclusive of agriculture and mining which are constrained by such conditions. Here we may mention as an example that during 1973, in the middle of the stronger accelerated phase of the business cycle, there was a relatively small increase, 4,1%, in the overall real growth of the gross domestic product simply because of poor agricultural crops and a decrease in the physical volume of gold production. In contrast, it is estimated that the real gross domestic product will increase by approximately 7% in 1974. If regard is had to the fact that according to expectations agriculture will be responsible for at least two percentage points of this total rate, this implies a levelling off in the growth of non-agricultural sectors as compared with 1973.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not have time to quote any more, but what is interesting is the following: They make a prediction here in respect of what they term &#x201C;quarterly figures on an annual basis&#x201D;, and their prediction for 1975&#x2014;and this is again in pursuance of the question of the hon. member for Constantia&#x2014;is that the increase in the first quarter of 1975 will be 4.5%, in the second quarter, 3%, in the third quarter, 2,5% and in the fourth quarter, 3,5%. In other words, it is expected that this downward trend we now have in our economic cycle will change in the third quarter and will again reflect an upward trend in order to increase the likelihood of 1976 being a better year. Sir, if we compare these conditions in South Africa with the conditions in other parts of the world, this is very revealing. The growth rate was negative in many countries of the world; in other words, their gross domestic product decreased; their position deteriorated. Last year the United States showed a negative growth rate of 1,75%. Whereas our growth rate was 7%, the United States had a negative growth rate of 1,75%. The United Kingdom had a negative growth rate of 1%. Japan had a negative growth rate of 3¬º% and there are many other countries which had a low growth rate. West Germany had a growth rate of 1% and, what is more, their prospects for 1975 are particularly bad in comparison with those of South Africa.</p>

<p>And Rhodesia?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member can provide that figure himself. According to an estimate of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, it is anticipated that the combined growth rates of the United States of America, Western Europe and Japan will be only &#x00BD;% in 1975. This figure represents the combined growth rates of those areas, i.e. &#x00BD;% in 1975. Sir, this is pathetic when one considers that in 1974 the combined growth rates of those same countries was only approximately ¬º%. The figures I have mentioned here in respect of growth rates, speak volumes for South Africa and its sound economy. It is true that the gold price has made a major contribution in this regard. In 1971 the value of our gold production was R922 million; in 1974 it was R2 560 million and the expectations are that it may rise still higher, so that we may have an income of R3 000 million from gold even in 1975. But in spite of these impressive figures in respect of gold, gold comprises only 9% of our gross domestic product, 9% in spite of those large figures. The other sectors which make major contributions are: the manufacturing sector, 23%, trade, 13% and agriculture, 8%. Those three, therefore, make a 44% contribution, while the contribution of gold is only 9%. Therefore, it is obvious that although gold made a major contribution as a result of its rising price, the progress which was made in respect of the other industries, too, must inevitably have been impressive during the past year.</p>

<p>The next point I want to deal with is inflation. I think that it is right and that it befits us to see inflation against the background of the economic growth here in South Africa. One cannot examine inflation in isolation. One also has to take into account the conditions of growth in South Africa. I think that any charges that are levelled by that side in respect of inflation must be weighed up against our growth performance during the past year. Of course, inflation is an evil. It is a tremendous evil, and not one of us wants it. It is also correct to say that we are combating it with all the means at our disposal, and it would be untrue to say that the Government is not doing everything in its power to combat inflation. But&#x2014;and we have to emphasize this&#x2014;price increases in South Africa, or inflation, or call it whatever you will, have not caused the standard <span class="col_1273-1274" refersTo="page_0652"/>of living in South Africa to drop. On the contrary. Notwithstanding rising prices and inflationary conditions the economy of South Africa has been sound enough to leave our people better off than they were before. In other words, wages and salaries have risen more rapidly than the rate of inflation has done up to the present time. It is true that the purchasing power of money has decreased, but the real income of the people has increased. In the non-agricultural sector, i.e. exclusive of agriculture, the real salaries and wages per White worker have increased. In 1973 there was an increase of 1 %, after provision had been made for inflation. In 1973 there was increase of 1%, and from the first to the third quarter of 1974 there was an increase of 2,1% in the real income of our people, excluding the agricultural sector. I have been speaking about Whites, about White workers. The figures for the non-White workers were far more impressive. Over the same period, i.e. in 1973, the real income of the non-Whites increased by 6,4%; in other words, their standard of living rose by 6.4%. In the first three quarters of 1974 it rose by no less than 9%. These figures apply to the non-White workers outside the agricultural sector. The real increase in respect of all races rose by 1,6% in 1973, and by 4% in 1974. Profits also rose. I think one will find throughout that profits also rose and that income derived from profits rose to a larger extent than did the rate of inflation. But inflation is a worldwide phenomenon. We cannot escape it. From December 1973 to December 1974 the U.S.A, experienced a rate of inflation of 12,2%, the United Kingdom, 19,1%, Italy, 25,3% and Belgium, 15,7%. I know the figures have already been mentioned here, Sir, but in order to substantiate what I am trying to prove I unfortunately have to repeat them. Even in Switzerland and West Germany the rates of inflation were material, i.e. 7.6% and 5,9%, respectively. But what is illuminating, is the fact that the wholesale price index figure in the rest of the world, in countries which are our trading partners, was no less than 28% in respect of our imports. The wholesale price index in the United States of America rose by 20,9%, in the United Kingdom by 28% and in Japan by 17%. And our imports cost us 28% more than they had cost us the previous year. That is why we can say that we, being one of the important trading countries of the word, have imported inflation. Internally, too, we have factors which contributed towards the higher rate of inflation, factors which we cannot avoid. For example, we have the higher wages that are being paid to the non-Whites to narrow the wage gap. No one objects to that, but it is inflationistic. Of course it is inflationistic to pay higher wages for social reasons and not for reasons of productivity, greater productivity. From the nature of the case it is inflationistic and we have to take it into consideration. In the light of these circumstances, we did particularly well this past year to be let off with a rate of inflation of approximately 14%.</p>

<p>Another factor which is of major importance, is the balance of payments. What is our position in respect of our balance of payments, particularly in comparison with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>What would our position have been without gold?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, what would our position have been without gold? I have just indicated to the hon. member what a major role gold plays, but there are other factors as well which help to make our balance of payments look less unattractive. One of these is the fact that we are dependent on the use of oil to such a limited extent. The 28% by which our imports rose during the past year is largely attributable to the tremendous rise in the price of oil. In spite of that our balance of payments position is one of the soundest in the world. During 1974 we did indeed have a deficit of R800 million on our current account, but that is not much when we relate it to the tremendous growth rate we had. From the nature of the case, the high growth rate we experienced means that there were increased imports, that capital goods, raw materials, etc., were purchased at a faster rate than before. And it is in fact healthy for South Africa, as a developing country, to have a limited deficit on the current account, particularly when it goes hand in hand with an inflow of capital, as we did in fact experience during the past year. During the past year we had an inflow of capital amounting to R700 million. In actual fact our gold and domestic reserves decreased by only R70 million during the past year. This is insignificant when one relates it to our growth rate and particularly when one compares <span class="col_1275-1276" refersTo="page_0653"/>it with other countries of the world. Just look at the other countries of the world, at their balances of payments. During the past year the following countries showed a large deficit on their current accounts: The United States of America showed a deficit of 3¬º milliard dollar, the United Kingdom, a deficit of 9 milliard dollar, France, a deficit of 7¬º milliard dollar and Japan, a deficit of 4¬æ milliard dollar. Italy showed a deficit of no less than 8¬º milliard dollar. And what is more, expectations are&#x2014;I have the figures of the predictions here&#x2014;that the anticipated deficits will more or less be of the same order as those which were experienced during the past year. At present the rand is regarded as one of the strongest currencies in the world whereas, besides the German mark and the Swiss franc, which are relatively strong, there are various other currencies which are candidates for devaluation today.</p>

<p>Apart from other considerations, which I do not have the time to mention now, there is employment as well. I think employment is the most important consideration for any country in the world today. In South Africa we have certain labour problems. We have always had them. I am thinking of the shortage of skilled labour. Recently the mining industry, too, has been experiencing certain problems. In the field of labour, however, South Africa is a paradise in the world&#x2014;nothing less than that. There is no unemployment in South Africa and there is peace and calm in the sphere of labour. Who will deny this? Does the hon. member, who is so fond of interjecting, want to deny this? What is the position in other countries of the world? In the United States of America 74 million are unemployed today, i.e. 8,2% of the labour force. In Japan no fewer than 1 000 000 are unemployed. Compare this with South Africa. The official unemployment figure for December 1974 was 8 700, or &#x00BD;% of the labour force. According to all international standards this is regarded as no unemployment at all. Our problems are limited, especially when viewed in the light of the tremendous economic growth we have experienced recently. Things are going far better for us than for many other countries in the world in the financial and economic spheres. However, these things have not come about on their own, but have come about as a result of the sound domestic policy laid down by the Government of the day. Hon. members opposite may speak to their hearts&#x2019; content about discrimination which allegedly has to be eliminated. By doing so they are doing South Africa a disservice rather than a service. The hon. members opposite may fight to their hearts&#x2019; content about their policy, but all that fighting will be of no avail for they will not come into power. This Government will govern the country for the next quarter of a century or more. All the stories they are dishing up and the arguments they are having about whose policy is what, will not help them at all. It will be this Government which will govern this country with a policy which, firstly, is based on the maintenance of the identity of the various ethnic groups and, secondly, is intent on eliminating friction in South Africa wherever it might be present. This Government will continue with that policy and not only will it develop fine and sound economic conditions in South Africa but it will also ensure peace and calm for all the population groups of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have been allowed a few brief moments to enter this debate, a debate which I had not intended to enter. However, to allow the speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to go by unanswered, I believe, would in effect be a confirmation of his words.</p>

<p>If I could say from friend to hatchet-man, I would have expected a speech like that from the hon. member for Simonstown, but not from the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He says that there is no such thing as a reformist group. Yes, he was correct. There was no constitution, no membership and no formal meetings, but there were large numbers of people, some of whom are still in the United Party, who thought and believed and who were inspired by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. [Interjections.] He says that he was never a member. That is right; he was never a member of a formal organization.

<p>The hon. member nurtured and helped build up the pressures which led to the explosion of last <span class="col_1277-1278" refersTo="page_0654"/>week. Of course, the hon. member was not always in full agreement with what happened. There were differences of tactics and strategy. Sometimes some people would prefer to talk and other do. Here, however, is someone who, more than anyone, persuaded some people&#x2014;myself included&#x2014; that the United Party is no vehicle for change in South Africa, that it is <i>functus officio.</i></p>

<p>Here is a member who, among others, correctly persuaded us that under its present leadership the United Party is destined for the pigeon-holes of political history. It has been said that there are no differences of principle and yet we have a member who believes, as I do, that while principles may appear good in print, and while some of the causes fought in the United Party may have been won, principles mean nothing if they are not believed in and if they are not unequivocal. While we have disputes and differences, and different interpretations relating to federalism, group areas and even the definition of discrimination, these principles are not even worth a row of beans. It has been said by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that there is no reason for the Reformists. Perhaps that is correct because it is true to say that one cannot reform a corpse. The hon. member says that no one has been put out of the United Party because of their political attitudes, and I ask: who believes this? Who believes that the political attitudes of the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Simonstown are even remotely the same? The truth is that for over a year there have been members of the United Party&#x2014;who will today admit it &#x2014;who have been devoting their time to getting rid of certain other members. They failed as far as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is concerned. Perhaps he is politically somewhat more canny than others of us.

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down is to be forgiven for his jealousy of the fact that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is within the United Party and not leading his group. They must indeed be in a serious position if they are pleading still for the hon. member, who stated his position so clearly and admirably this afternoon, to associate himself with a breakaway group of which they are members. I have been in politics quite a long time. I have been in this House nearly 27 years. In all that time I have never known a party to break away or be formed in respect of which there was such universal agreement in the Press and on the part of political correspondents that it had no future. The entire debate seems to be asking: Who is to swallow them? That is the only argument that is going on. Let me tell the House who is going to swallow them.

<p>The hon. member has said that there were no differences in respect of aims and principles. That is correct. There were no differences in respect of aims and principles. Already, however, they are trying to manufacture differences to justify their existence and give themselves an identity of their own. I have no doubt that they will persuade themselves in due course that there are differences, just as I have no doubt that they will persuade themselves in due course that they have enough common ground with the Progressive Party to sit with them and fight with them in the future.</p>

<p>It was interesting that the hon. member for Sea Point should have chosen today to outline the policy of his party. Obviously he tried to make it as attractive a piece of bait as he could to the people who are sitting on the one side of him and whom he hopes to attract into his spider-web. It was rather amusing to listen to him because he too is wooing the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Has he no confidence in his own powers of leadership? [Interjections.] If he is without confidence himself, there is the hon. member for Yeoville who might well be at his disposal or he might go into the business world and get his former colleague, Dr. de Beer, to come along and give them a lead in the future. What was so interesting was his attempt to show that <span class="col_1279-1280" refersTo="page_0655"/>the removal of discrimination based on colour would not be achieved under the federal policy of the United Party.

He has no answer to that problem otherwise than his qualified franchise which he knows is not an answer itself.</p>

<p>We also had some words from the hon. the Minister of Transport who seems to be thinking back with longing to his days as Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, with a bit of nostalgia. He told us that the policy of his party was so clear that there could be no confusion about it at all. I seem to remember that when one hon. Minister was asked about the sports policy of the Nationalist Party during the last election he said: &#x201C;I am afraid I cannot tell you; I have not seen Piet Koornhof this morning.&#x201D; [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I know you will not allow me to discuss sport in view of the motion that is still on the Order Paper, but it does seem as if there is a little confusion between the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation and the hon. the Minister of the Interior as to exactly what their sports policy is.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he has done his best to paint a picture of a prosperous South Africa, a South Africa that is doing extremely well, but he has not convinced this House that the cost of living burden being borne by the man in the street need be as great as it is. It is excessive in the light of the circumstances at the present time and it is proof that the Government is falling down on its job. He has used selected figures, he has tried to persuade us that inflation was imported, he has tried to minimize the effect of the increase in the gold price, but the one thing of which he has not persuaded the ordinary man in the street is that the latter should have such a hard time as he is experiencing at present under this Government.</p>

<p>The internal battles fought last week in the United Party and in the Opposition ranks have created a good deal of dust. This may have led to a certain loss of political perspective. Therefore I believe I owe it to the House and to the country to state in unambiguous terms where the United Party stands, where we stand in relation to the Government and where we stand in relation to the aims and principles of the United Party itself. Let me say that the short answer to that is that we stand exactly where we stood before. Perhaps I should expand a little on that. In doing so, I think I should say that, as far as the Government is concerned, we are highly appreciative of the steps taken towards detente by the hon. the Prime Minister. Our pleasure is all the warmer and more exuberant not in spite of the delay attendant upon such steps being taken, but perhaps because of it. We have waited for nearly a quarter of a century for something like this to happen. We have waited for nearly a quarter of a century for just such a beginning. Now that the beginning has been <span class="col_1281-1282" refersTo="page_0656"/>made, we are all the more impatient to see the fruits of it. We are impatient because every day that passes means less time for South Africa to ensure its safe passage into a new future. I want to say straightaway that our appreciation will show itself in continued support for every move on the part of the Government to do, <i>inter alia,</i> two things. The first is to remove discrimination based purely on the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin and to remove such discrimination from our Statute Book, and the second is to re-educate the people of this country to accept a more fair and more just society at every level in South Africa. I want to say that until steps of that sort are taken, there is going to be no real substance in the Government claim of having achieved d√©tente either at home or abroad. On the contrary, I want to warn the Government that there will be grave disillusionment and more determined hostility than we have yet known in South Africa unless those steps are taken.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks there has been further evidence of growing contact with Africa. There has been evidence released of booming trade with Africa. There have been visits by African trade delegations. Diplomatic contacts with Zambia have become public knowledge. News of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s visit to Liberia have been released. Nevertheless, I want to assure hon. members opposite that, from what little I know about human beings and about Africa itself, particularly in the climate of Africa today, these moves, whether they are in the field of cementing trade agreements or broadening diplomatic contacts, are going to fall on very stony ground indeed once foreigners of colour begin to move freely and frequently on the South African scene. Such contacts are not easily going to survive brushes with our absurd petty apartheid laws and practices which by world standards have been very little ameliorated as yet by the initiatives taken by this Government. Something much more fundamental is necessary. A fundamental change in the philosophy of this Government in respect of this issue is required. Much more will have to be done than what this Government has already done in respect of our own Blacks. They are much less interested in how Nigerians, for instance, are treated at the Carlton Hotel than they are interested in how they themselves live in Soweto or how they are treated in the cities, offices, factories, buildings and public places of this country.</p>

<p>It seems to me that three things are necessary. Firstly, discrimination on the grounds of colour alone will have to be removed from our Statute Book. Secondly, there must be an end to compulsory segregation and compulsory integration; neither must exist in South Africa. Thirdly, all race groups must have an effective share in the government of the country. Those are the fundamental things that we have got to accept if we are to resist the charges that are made against us of &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D;, domination and discrimination, charges levelled so readily against South Africa under this Government and so harmful to harmonious race relations in this country. Nobody on that side of the House can deny that this Government discriminates statutorily against our Black and Brown people in the labour field, against Black women in the urban areas, against all people of colour in the social field. No one can deny that this Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of the political rights of the Coloured and Indian people is still &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D;, domination, and that in spite of all the charming talk of Cabinet committees and consultation at that level.</p>

<p>Recently there has been much talk of the position in the Other Place. Would it be too much to suggest to this Government that where Senators are to be appointed for their special knowledge of Coloured and Indian Affairs, or their special knowledge of Bantu affairs, people of colour should be appointed to sit in the Senate and give the Senate, the Other Place, the benefit of their advice? That would be a gesture of goodwill that would have far-reaching effects throughout South Africa and throughout the whole continent of Africa.</p>

<p>I said that we would show appreciation for steps that the Government took in the right direction. At the same time I want to warn that we are going to show our impatience at the lack of understanding of the depth of change that is needed and at the slowness of the rate of change and at the backsliding that is always in evidence to placate the verkramptes on the other side of the House in the ranks of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s followers.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman hears me. Let us take the Nico Malan Theatre as an example. What happened? We all know the story. The Government <span class="col_1283-1284" refersTo="page_0657"/>gave an open permit for all races at all times and great expectations were aroused. There had been the speech of the hon. the Minister of Defence at his Cape Congress in which he made most enlightened noises. Even <i>Rapport</i> of 2 February expected the theatre to be completely open. <i>Die Burger</i> here in Cape Town expected that &#x201C;open&#x201D; would mean &#x201C;open&#x201D;. Then came the let-down. It was promptly defended in a halfhearted sort of way by <i>Die Transvaler</i> on that very day. Then came the reversal under pressure from the Government or perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister or the hon. the Minister of Defence, we are not sure which. What about the harm that was done in the meantime by this shilly-shallying? Internally the harm is serious. It was well summed up in the leading article of <i>Rapport</i> on Sunday. This is what they said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar daar is een aspek van die saak wat vir ons ontstellend bly en dit is die totale verontagsaming van die ander groepe se gevoelens wat telkens uit di√© soort episodes blyk. Sou niemand dan daaraan gedink het dat so &#x2019;n besluit (van aparte aande) vir beskaafde Bruinmense e&#x2019;ntlik &#x2019;n erger belediging as die ou bedeling kan wees nie? Veral nadat &#x2019;n volkome oop Nico so beslis in die vooruitsig aestel was. Dat &#x2019;n lid van die Kaaplandse Uitvoerende Komitee dan nog die stap, net voordat dit herroep is, kan beskryf as &#x2019;n bydrae tot die ontspanningspolitiek, vertoon &#x2019;n ongevoeligheid wat ons werklik nie meer in ho√´ Nasionale kringe verwag het nie.</block>

<p>Sir, that was the harm done internally. But what about the harm done outside South Africa? What about the harm done in respect of other countries in Africa? What about the harm done in respect of the countries of the Western world whose diplomats will be reporting back to them as to what the situation was? What about the harm. Sir, that is still going to be done by verkramptes on that side of the House grumbling at the final decision that was taken? Mr. Sneaker, there is another example concerning what appears to be a statement by the hon. the Minister of the Interior&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If necessary, we shall have brand new notices made which say &#x201C;Whites&#x201D; and &#x201C;non-Whites&#x201D; and put them up where such friction occurs.</block>

<p>Sir, the world knows what trouble those notices have caused South Africa. Can a responsible Minister make a statement like that at this time? Here the leader of the Nationalist Party in the Transvaal, the possible crown prince of the Government party, makes a statement of that kind at this time. Why? Because there is a by-election on. Sir, is this not the height of irresponsibility? Let me give another example. For years we pleaded with the Government for the abolition of job reservation. Despite the small number of people who are involved, the Government has steadfastly refused to give way and they have continued to justify job reservation theoretically. But more and more exemptions are granted and in many trades the exemptions are the rule rather than the exception. Sir, a short while back job reservation for Coloureds in the building industry on the platteland was done away with. As far as I know, everybody welcomed it except Mr. Gert Beetge of the Bouwerkersbond. Everybody welcomed it because for years these people had been doing skilled work in the building trade in our rural areas because there were no Whites to do the job. Sir, why did we have to wait so long for this relaxation, and why is it only in the rural areas? Hon. members opposite know what a shortage there is of skilled artisans in the building trade. Sir, the Government is having to make changes today, but they would be far less painful and would cause far less trouble amongst their own people if they were more logical in their actions and if they prepared their people properly for what they know has got to come in due course.</p>

<p>There is another example. Sir. There was a debate on labour here last week on a private member&#x2019;s motion, and it was quite clear from the speeches of certain hon. members opposite that they would not under any circumstances consider trade union rights for Blacks in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister, unless I am misinformed, has agreed that this is one of the matters that will be discussed by homeland leaders and others connected with labour in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister knows that a change is going to have to come sooner or later. Has the time not come. Sir, for him to prepare his people for that sort of thing? Otherwise we are going to have the sort of speeches that we had from the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark and others last week on this issue and we are going to have a wall of prejudice <span class="col_1285-1286" refersTo="page_0658"/>to overcome when the changes have to be made. Surely, Sir, it is common cause amongst all parties in this House that South Africa must deliberately and systematically divest itself of statutory discrimination on the grounds of race and colour. Not only is it accepted as a general principle, but it has become almost an international commitment, openly and irretrievably stated by this Government overseas. On its fulfilment not necessarily and obviously not in a day, but systematically and with deliberate intent, depends the conclusion of real detente in our future relations with Africa and with the world. On it also depends our hopes for a peaceful and prosperous future in our own country. On it depends the achievement of that greater South Africa which is our true destiny. Sir, as political parties we have disagreements, some of them fundamental, about the political method and the constitutional consequences of non-discrimination, but surely we are all convinced of one thing, and that is that progress must be quick and that it must be visible. It must be seen to be done. Now, let us be realistic about this and recognize that quick and visible progress is most urgently needed, and that it will be most readily accepted in those situations where the most economically and educationally advanced people of all races have already become interdependent. We have seen this in our consultations with the leaders of the homelands and the various ethnic communities in this country. We have seen it in growing co-operation within the higher technical institutions, the higher councils, the higher services; we have seen it successfully implemented in our national airways and soon we shall see it, I hope, being successfully implemented in the Nico Malan complex. It already works well in certain private fields, in the professions and in business. I believe it is important that these areas of goodwill should now be extended. I believe that there would be three benefits which would flow from that.</p>

<p>Firstly. I think we will be giving proof that race and colour discrimination is not fundamental to the South African way of life and that it can in fact be discarded as fast as the cultural gap closes. I think that is the first advantage. I think the second advantage is that we should be removing the most acute and dangerous area of frustration by ensuring that all civilized men may enjoy the amenities to which their personal achievements entitle them. I believe, thirdly, that we should be creating standards at the highest levels which will serve as a living example to those who are still unwilling to discard the rigid and outmoded prejudices of the past. Those are three reasons why I believe that progress must be rapid and that it must be visible.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to suggest to the Government in all sincerity that a striking advance in this field could now be made if the Government was prepared to restore the residential area of District Six as a prestige area for the Coloured people of the Cape.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to embarrass the Government in any way. I believe there are few situations in which so significant an advance could be made at so little political and economic cost to the Government itself. What have I in mind? I have in mind the redevelopment of this area&#x2014;it is already clear that the slums and the poverty are the result of neglect in the past&#x2014;into a new residential, professional and skilled craftsmen&#x2019;s district which could become one of the showpieces of South Africa. There are thousands of members of our Coloured community with professional and technical occupations which require them to be in close touch with the centre of the city and its sophisticated markets. They need to be conveniently in touch with our urban institutions, with business, with their suppliers and those engaged in allied crafts and trades. They need to be in touch with each other and to be so in a place where their highest economic aspirations can be realized and higher social standards maintained. The purpose of this prestige Coloured residential area would not be to detach the Coloured leaders from their own people, but to provide a focal point of achievement for their entire community. It is one of the tragedies of our group areas that there is no adequate residential provision for those successful and professional leaders who wish to emancipate themselves from the poverty of their corresponding social environment. The upliftment of the Coloured people cannot succeed if the achievements of the few, the higher achievements of the few, are forever diluted by the lower standards of the many. Sir, I believe a project of this kind could be a symbol. It could be much more than that. It could symbolize the potential attainments of the Coloured people. It could symbolize the willingness of the White people to <span class="col_1287-1288" refersTo="page_0659"/>recognize those potential attainments and to respect them. It could create a new dimension in race relations, because it would provide real evidence to all those communities who must forever remain part of our plural society in South Africa that within the diversity of South Africa there is room for generosity, for dignity and for hope for each community in this country. I want to urge the Government most earnestly to re-evaluate all the special considerations that apply to District Six. I believe that this single act of imagination and generosity could do wonders for the policy of d√©tente, not only in international affairs, but in South Africa itself.</p>

<p>These are internal matters which I have mentioned. I have indicated in previous debates in this House that we are impatient also at the dimness of vision of the Government in regard to its task in Africa. That ground was covered in a previous debate when I mentioned things like a migrant workers&#x2019; charter, the question of power, economic co-operation and transport, and I do not propose to cover that area again. However, while the Government still stands in the field of race relations as we have indicated in this amendment, for &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D;, domination and discrimination, we stand for policies which, put in a nutshell, can be expressed as the elimination of discrimination and the putting of differentiation to work in the interests of the greatest possible contentment and security of every South African, whether he be White, Black or Brown.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>First we must be clear as to what we mean by &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; and what we mean by &#x201C;differentiation&#x201D;. I know it is perhaps difficult for us to talk about discrimination because we are not at the receiving end. I do not think we understand what it is to be discriminated against and I do not think we will ever understand it completely, but there are many examples. What I want to get clear is that you cannot equate discrimination with differentiation. Differentiation is the acknowledgment of the existence of a difference which for instance nature has decreed shall exist between people. There is a difference between men and women, there is a difference between the various groups in South Africa, the Whites, the Blacks, the Coloureds and the Indians and it can be generally accepted that there are physical differences.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am learning. That is differentiation, but that does not imply discrimination. Discrimination only arises when there is an action, a decision, which treats one of the differentiated groups in a different way from another to its disadvantage&#x2014;that is discrimination. There is differentiation between men and women; there is no discrimination unless women are not allowed into the clubs to which men go&#x2014;that is discrimination. However, it is quite different from differentiation I want to make it perfectly clear that as far as the United Party is concerned&#x2014;here I want to help the hon. member for Piketberg&#x2014;our policy does differentiate. Our federal scheme, which is the pivot on which all else hangs, is a federation of different communities and why is it so? So that the minorities, such as the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians, shall always be secure and so that they and the Blacks shall enjoy all that to which their birthright as South Africans entitled them. While differentiation is employed at a constitutional level as a means to secure the political rights of all, there is no discrimination. The stability of our political institutions has to be maintained by differentiation, the ascendancy of civilized values, but discrimination against individuals is not part of our policy. I want to make it clear that that is the essence of our federal scheme. To assist the hon. member for Piketberg again. I have drawn up a brief summary of what I believe to be the most important practical aspects of United Party policy at this time. They are practical issues which I believe are topical and on which the party&#x2019;s stand should be clear and unambiguous.</p>

<p>Firstly, we believe that our federal policy is the only solution to the problem of protecting the rights of minorities&#x2014;by that I mean the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians&#x2014;and sharing political power and <span class="col_1289-1290" refersTo="page_0660"/>responsibility and economic wealth with all races in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Of course they are. They are outnumbered by the Coloureds and the Indians to begin with, or they will be very soon. Take the Coloureds, the Indians and the urban Africans and one will see that they outnumber the Whites. Not even taking the homelands into consideration, there will still be more people of colour in the rest of South Africa than Whites. The second principle is that we will respect the sovereignty of homelands which have become independent when we return to power and we will permit those on the brink of independence at such a time to determine for themselves what they want. We will actively promote the economic development of the homelands by whatever means and at whatever cost sound economic policy employed in their interests dictates. This includes the question of land purchases which may well exceed the limits laid down in the 1936 legislation. Thirdly, we believe in a just and fair society aiming at the removal, within the federal framework, of all discrimination on the basis of skin colour alone, but allowing for personal choice in that people who do not want to mix and those who do will both be provided for. We believe that the Immorality Act should be removed from the Statute Book as quickly as possible. We aim at economic growth as a priority for the future, not as an end in itself, but as a means to raising the standard of living of all our people. We believe in the specific rejection of job reservation which involves the logical consequence that some Whites may have to work under the direction of non-Whites as they are doing today under this Government in certain fields. In the labour field also we believe in the extension of all training and employment opportunities now enjoyed by the more advanced group to all race groups, the right of Black workers to join or to form legally recognized trade unions as well as to make use of the works committee system where desired. We also believe in the realistic application of the principle of equal pay for equal work and responsibility. Our education policy is aimed at free and compulsory schooling for all races. We believe urban Blacks must be accepted as permanently resident in the Republic of South Africa and given all the necessary amenities including the right to own their own homes and businesses in their own urban areas and to a civilized family life.</p>

<p>With regard to the Coloured community we believe that our federal policy will afford them full citizenship and autonomy within their own community. Beyond that there is full freedom for the White and the Coloured communities to develop a closer association in all matters of common interest and, if it is the eventual desire of both communities, to merge their rights and interests, and to the extent that both communities agree, to share their powers and responsibility within a single legislatie assembly. We believe that sportsmen at all levels, through their elected bodies, should run their own affairs and determine questions of membership, the selection of teams and participation in voluntarily constituted leagues and competitions. We believe in the furtherance of the ideal of true equality between the Afrikaans and English languages and cultures. We uphold the power and the right of our courts to protect civil liberty. We reaffirm the principle of the freedom of the Press and freedom of association, and are determined to uphold this. We believe in the maintenance of a strong Defence Force, but that our greatest security lies in binding the loyalty of all races in love of South Africa. We look to strengthening South Africa&#x2019;s ties with the State of Capricorn African through mutually agreed bonds of friendship and mutual aid. That is the credo of this party. Those are the things we stand for and those are the things that those who join us will have to accept unequivocally.</p>

<p>Yes, join us. May I say to the hon. the Prime Minister that the door is open if he accepts these principles unequivocally, with the addition of one further aspect. He must recognize the importance of consultation at all levels in the evolution of policy in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister knows that I have suggested to him before that although a lot of consultation is taking place in South Africa at the present time, it is high time for that consultation to be institutionalized. That is why I suggested the formation of what I called a Council of State, something like the Council of Ministers operating in the European communities <span class="col_1291-1292" refersTo="page_0661"/>at the present time, in which there could be consultation to seek agreement in all matters of common concern. I suggested that such a body should not take the place of any existing Governmental body, nor have the power to conflict with any such Governmental body. I did suggest, however, that it could evolve by mutual consent and that it would be purely advisory in character. Its object should be to seek out common ground and to define the common purpose. Its object should be to advice and not to instruct. It would be an advance, from the present sporadic consultations between the Government and leaders of individual communities, to a new stage of regular consultations between the leaders of all the communities. Let us make a beginning by talking together in an institutionalized body.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will perhaps not expect me to reply to all the political developments which have taken place during the course of this debate. I am, of course, referring to the hon. the Opposition. One surprise followed another in such rapid succession that one would hardly keep up. I also want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in all kindness that there is no need for him to be concerned about our policy aimed at relaxing tension. Nor is it necessary for him to be concerned about our d√©tente policy in Africa and Southern Africa. As I understood him, he had certain reservations. I think what the hon. the Prime Minister has already achieved in this field is of such a spectacular and far-reaching nature that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would do well to leave this matter in the hands of the hon. the Prime Minister. I also do not think he need be greatly concerned about our race relations policy. Our policy is based on separate development and we are in the process of implementing that policy consistently every day of the week. We shall continue in this manner, and I think South Africa is in very safe hands with this Government and this Prime Minister in power. Hon. members referred to various matters in this debate. Perhaps I may confine myself to the economic and financial matters which were raised. I want to convey my sincere gratitude to everyone on both sides of the House for the kind and encouraging sentiments they addressed to me in regard to my appointment to the post I am holding at present. I can assure them that I am greatly appreciative of their kindness and consideration. Unfortunately I cannot mention everyone by name, but hon. members will allow me to say to my old friend, the hon. member for Paarl, that I find it gratifying to see that he has managed to reach the second best school in the country. I wish to thank my hon. friends on this side of the House for the interest they displayed in this debate, and I want to congratulate them on the contributions they made.</p>

<p>I want to turn my attention to the hon. members of the Opposition, and I want to start off immediately by referring to the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I should like to congratulate him on his appointment as chief spokesman for his party on finance. I am looking forward to some good tussles with him in this important field. As far as I am concerned I shall try to deal with the merits of the issues before us in what I hope will be a constructive and amicable manner. The hon. member for Constantia began with what I think was just a preliminary skirmish when he started by asking me why I had not given him far more information. He asked me why I had not said whether there would be a surplus or deficit for the financial year ending 31 March. Over the years a certain tradition has been built up in these matters and I shall certainly try to maintain that tradition. I must therefore remind the hon. member that it is simply not customary to go into details of that kind in the Part Appropriation debate.</p>

<p>Of course the main point of his attack has been inflation. We know that inflation is world-wide and that it is running rampant. No country in the world has been able really to combat it effectively. We know that the inflation in South Africa is <span class="col_1293-1294" refersTo="page_0662"/>certainly higher than we wish it to be. However, we are constantly dealing with it, taking whatever measures we can to counteract it. I must remind the House that our policy is clearly a policy of countering inflation without at the same time stifling a substantial rate of economic growth. That has been our policy for some considerable time and certainly is still our policy today. That is the position against the world background, which is indeed sombre. Today many of the countries of the world are in a state of recession and the term &#x201C;recession&#x201D; is being applied more and more even to the powerful United States. All over the world we find falling growth rates and unemployment&#x2014;which we have heard of in this debate&#x2014;on a scale which we probably have not seen since the years of the Great Depression. I can just remind the House that unemployment has risen by more than one million in the nine countries of the European Common Market over the past year. That is the sort of background against which we in South Africa are conducting our economic affairs. I believe that we have indeed succeeded, where we have propounded our policy very clearly, because although our rate of inflation is very high&#x2014;I do not dispute it&#x2014;it still remains one of the lowest in the world. The facts are there to prove it. What is more, unlike practically every other country in the world, we have succeeded in maintaining what amounts to virtually the highest real growth rate of them all. I believe therefore that within the clearly defined ambit of our policy we have indeed succeeded remarkably well. I want to remind the House that the consequence of the high growth rate which we have maintained in this country, is that our gross national product <i>per capita&#x2014;</i>that is per head of the population, men, women and children&#x2014; has risen by no less than 6% in the past two years. That is the real overall measure of the rise in living standards in this country for the whole population. It has increased by 6% in two years which, as anybody will say, is an exceptionally high rate of increase. I want to say again that, despite that, the Government is constantly looking at this evil of inflation and we are tempering its harmful effects wherever we can. We do employ price control on a limited scale in an endeavour to control the prices of basic necessities but we do not want to hamstring the whole economy by applying price control throughout, and nation-wide. If we wanted to, we could ofcourse stop this inflation. We could simply apply price control and wage control right through the economy; we could freeze profits and dividends, and we could stop all further issuing of credit. In other words, we could even restrict credit beyond the present level. We could take all these negative and extremely far-reaching measures but I believe that, although in this way we would stop inflation, we would thereby halt the economy in its tracks in the process, and that is certainly not our policy, because we want to ensure a rising standard of living for a population that is increasing probably as rapidly as that of any country in the world today. I mention that and want to go further and point out that, apart from applying this limited measure of price control, we are paying out large amounts in subsidies. We pay subsidies on bread, on dairy products such as butter, on maize and on certain of the commodities that go into the production of fertilizers. We do so in order to keep down the costs to the public of those basic necessities. In addition we have been raising social pensions every year for I do not know how many years in an attempt to alleviate the hardships of inflation experienced by pensioners and those who are living on fixed incomes. Beyond that, we have been endeavouring for a long time now to build up a forum of interested parties such as producers, financiers, consumers and workers, a joint committee of such people under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Commerce, in order to discuss these problems constantly to see if we cannot find ever more effective measures. The hon. member for Constantia made a very interesting remark. He said in the course of his speech that there had been a lot of talking on the subject of inflation. Well, I think that that is a very good thing because inflation is a very intractable problem. If ever a case warranted saying <i>quot homines tot sententiae</i> I think this is it. At the beginning of August last year my distinguished predecessor called a meeting in Cape Town of 70 or 80 of the top financiers, industrialists, labour union people, economists, and others. It was a very representative gathering. For one full day we discussed solely the issue of inflation. It is worth looking at the proceedings of that meeting. Talk about a concensus&#x2014;every possible view imaginable was put forward there. I think this simply goes to show what an exceptionally difficult issue this is.</p>

<p><span class="col_1295-1296" refersTo="page_0663"/>The other point is of course that we have also been trying to place a curb on the importation of oil by trying to conserve the use of fuel. Over the last 15 months oil has risen more in price than any other commodity. In that way, too, we have been endeavouring to counter the very substantial element of imported inflation. I draw the attention of the House again to the extreme importance which the Government attaches to that particular issue.</p>

<p>Coming back to the hon. member for Constantia, I want to say he made an interesting statement. He said that probably the majority of people was suffering as a result of inflation. We have also heard today that the salaries and wages of the lower income groups have in fact risen faster than those of the upper income groups. The non-Whites, in particular, have had the biggest wage increases over the last year or two. That being so, if the standard of living, overall, has risen by 6% in two years, it must be a statistical impossibility for the majority of people to have suffered as a result of inflation. I think that one must be careful to look at this matter from a factual point of view. He also said that inflation discouraged savings and productive investment. It is quite possible that in certain countries at certain times that may happen, but I must point out that in South Africa both savings and investments increased substantially in 1974 when our inflation was 11,6%, as an average of month to month increases. Notwithstanding this fact, both our savings and investments increased very substantially. The hon. member also quoted the Stellenbosch Bureau of Economic Research, I think with approval, which stated that during the fourth quarter of last year price increases had actually accelerated. I have the greatest regard for the work of this bureau and I do not wish to criticize it in any way; I think it is doing extremely valuable work. I do not think, however, that that particular statement is correct. If we look at the quarterly increase in the price index, we will find that it was 2,6% in the first quarter last year, 2,9% in the second, 4,3% in the third and 3,3% in the fourth. The rate actually declined in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>The hon. member then raised a point that we have heard quite often. He said that the Government introduced a tight money policy with high interest rates. He said, moreover, that we do not have a situation where inflation is caused by excessive demand. He said that the main effect of Government policy is to dampen down investment. I want to say that I agree that there is not a great deal of demand inflation but surely the Government must be given credit for this. Surely it is the policy of the Government that has prevented that type of inflation which has played such havoc in many other countries and is still doing so at this moment throughout the world, from doing the same thing here. In relation to his point of our having introduced a tight money policy, surely, if that had been our aim we would have increased the liquid asset requirements of the banks? That would have been the most effective way to carry out such a policy, but we did not do it. We have not touched that for a long time. I want to suggest that money became tight at certain times last year precisely because bank credit to the private sector had expanded so fast. In actual fact, the annual rate in the first half of 1974 was no less than 29%. In fact, too, I want to mention that the quantity of money and of what they call near money increased by 22% in 1974, as against 23 in 1973. In other words, the position was virtually the same. There was no worsening of the money supply position in this respect. Indeed, if we look at the fourth quarter of last year, we find that the increase was 43%. That certainly cannot be classified as imposing a tight money policy. As I have said, we agree that interest rates are high but if interest rates had not been at the levels at which they have been recently, we would not have experienced the inflow of capital to this country which we have experienced. As I have said, investment increased considerably last year as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia listed I think five steps which he said the Government had taken and which had specifically aggravated inflation. He talked about labour policy. This is a hardy annual. There is hardly a debate in this House in which the labour policy is not raised. We are told that this policy is wrong and that it is causing inflation. I still have to be convinced that that statement can conceivably be supported on the facts.</p>

<from><span class="col_1297-1298" refersTo="page_0664"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely the relaxation of labour restrictions has been an important factor in restraining inflation over the past year or two. Surely labour shortages have not been an important feature of current inflation. Where does that show? I want to suggest that we should view this matter more critically especially, too, in the light of the very great encouragement the Government had given, financially as well, to the training of labour both in technical institutions and on the job.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke in a condemnatory fashion about our policy of self-sufficiency and in that context he listed the local content programme for motor vehicles. Sir, where is this self-sufficiency as such? We are one of the greatest trading nations in the world in relation to the size of our gross annual production.</p>

<p>Our imports and exports amount to something like 35% or more of the value of our gross national product. We are prepared, Sir, to test our products and prices on the world markets and we are doing extremely well in the process. If the hon. member means that our policy is to put South Africa&#x2019;s interests first, then I agree with him, because we are certainly doing it; that has always been our policy. Sir, in that respect I would like to come now to the local content programme for motor vehicles. The hon. member says that he was appalled that I did not accede to the request last year that the so-called two-year standstill period, which will now be 1977 and 1978, was not brought forward by two years. Sir, what are the facts? The facts are that at the end of last year the local content target was 62%, and in fact many car manufacturers had by then gone over 62%. The aim this year is to reach 64%, 66% next year, and then to have a two-year standstill period to allow the whole industry to catch its breath, as it were, and to consolidate and make further adjustments and investments for the future, which will be clearly set out in agreement with the industry.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member has overlooked the fact that when this application came to me, I referred it immediately to the Board of Trade and Industry, which in this respect and many others is the most experienced and highest qualified body to investigate such an issue. The Board of Trade and Industry, in its usual way, went into this matter most thoroughly and came to the unqualified conclusion that we should not change this programme, that it would be quite wrong, and against the best interests of this country and against the best interests of the motor trade and the motor manufacturing industry. Sir, at the same time I asked the Department of Industries, which has great experience in these matters, to make a thorough investigation. This was done, and the Department of Industries came to exactly the same conclusion.</p>

<p>I myself had interviews with practically every party interested in this matter. While it is true that the majority of the members of NAAMSA, the motor manufacturers&#x2019; association, did ask for an advancement of this standstill period, nevertheless very important members of NAAMSA, and big manufacturers, strongly opposed it. The motor component industry, which is a very important industry and which is independent from the manufacturers&#x2014;there are some manufacturers which also make component parts, but there are many manufacturers of motor components which have nothing to do with car manufacturing as such&#x2014;were unanimously against it, and they gave very sound reasons for their attitude. They have made big investments in this industry. I also spoke to the motor traders, and you will be surprised to know, Sir, how many motor traders told me that they would not support this, although there was not unanimity amongst them. Sir, this was a very thorough inquiry, and the argument that by not acceding to this request when I was Minister of Economic Affairs, I took a decision which will in fact increase inflation, is one which I simply cannot accept on the facts. As I say, we have gone into it factually and we find that that is the position.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member spoke about television and said he wanted an industry which was competitive and efficient, which is surely what we all want. That is why the Government has taken the greatest possible care to see that the industry is in the hands of firms which can carry out their contracts and carry out their manufacturing schedules. Sir, surely if there are six important manufacturers, one cannot say that there is no competition. There are six, all of them competing the one with the other and in the first stage, while we are waiting for the sets to be produced and put on the market on a big enough scale to meet the demand, we are allowing imports to the extent of 240 000 sets. So I think we have <span class="col_1299-1300" refersTo="page_0665"/>taken very careful note of the issues involved and we have gone out of our way to see that there is competition and efficiency. I hope the hon. member, if he disagrees with me now, will be able to substantiate his statement.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member came with a very interesting statement. He said the Government had been reluctant to treat the rand as a strong currency. Now, this really did surprise me. Last year we had very big imports and we allowed these imports in because on account of the very rapid rate of growth we needed capital goods on a vast scale, but our exports also rose very well indeed. The fact is, though, that on the current account there was a deficit of nearly R800 million. Surely, in those circumstances it would have been foolish to force an undue appreciation of the rand. Surely, we would simply then have discouraged exports and encouraged still more imports. I want to say that with the improvement in the balance of payments during the latter part of last year, the rand has been appreciated in fact several times, several times since June 1974. We have a policy of what we call independent managed floating of the rand whereby the rand is allowed to adjust its value by small amounts from time to time. We do not slavishly follow the dollar any more. I can remind the House that in fact the effective exchange rate of the rand is today only 11% below its level in June 1974, so that there has been practically no change. Indeed, it is approximately the same as it was before the devaluation of sterling in 1967. That is the sort of magical date which many people still take as a criterion. If you take that, the exchange rate of the rand today is virtually identical to what it was in 1967.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and in fact in relation to a group of currencies. That is so far as the appreciation of the rand is concerned. The rand is a very strong currency. We recognize it and I think our policy has undoubtedly made it so. I do not want to comment on the hon. member&#x2019;s references to apartheid measures and ideology, which he said had a restrictive effect. I merely want to tell the House that where we have a growth rate of 7% to 8% in real terms, the Government&#x2019;s other policies must surely be very correct and effective to make that possible, because no other country in the world has done it.</p>

<p>*No other country in the world has yet achieved this. If we have a growth rate of 8%, they still say that our policy is a restrictive one; the growth rate should have been much higher. I should very much like to know how much higher it should have been.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then the hon. member returned to the duties which we imposed on textiles on 20 September 1974, and he criticized us there. I just want to remind the House that the textile industry is an extremely important industry in this country, employing hundreds of thousands of people. But due to dumping and to the free importation of very cheap textile goods there was a real problem arising in this industry round about August and September last year. It was a very big problem indeed, the same sort of problem that Australia had. Australia however sat and did nothing with the result that their industry virtually collapsed to the ground, with hundreds of thousands of people becoming unemployed within a few weeks. Sir, in consultation with the hon. the Minister of Labour I went into this matter very fully. We pulled in the Department of Industries and we discussed it with the Board of Trade, and in the result we imposed those duties by a tax proposal in the House, as an urgent measure by the Minister of Finance, on 20 September 1974. Now, it is perfectly true that there were certain goods on the water at that time and that we did not exempt them. We did not exempt them because we asked the Board of Trade to make a very thorough investigation of this whole issue and of all the implications of this emergency measure. I call it an &#x201C;emergency measure&#x201D; because I am quite sure it was. The Board of Trade immediately did that and because it is something very farreaching, the Board of Trade worked for three months on it. In December the Board of Trade came forward with its report and I should like to quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board &#x2026;</block>

<p>*That is the Board of Trade and Industries.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; consequently recommends that the Minister of Finance, in terms of the <span class="col_1301-1302" refersTo="page_0666"/>powers conferred upon him by section 75 of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964, amends Schedule 4 of the Act to provide for the abatement of the full duty less the duty applicable, prior to the increase in the duty on 20 September 1974, on goods of tariff headings as set out in respect of which the duty was increased on 20 September 1974 in terms of section 58 of the Act and which, prior to or on that date, have been loaded on a ship or a vehicle in the country of export, ready for export to the Republic. Furthermore, the Board recommends that the abatement provision be made with retrospective effect to 20 September 1974 during the next session of Parliament.</block>

<p>I want to inform the House that we are now giving attention to the recommendations and a decision will be taken within a matter of days.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I say that it was a much more complicated issue than I think some hon. members may have realized. I am quite certain we took the right step; it was the only way to do it. We saved that industry. I should like the hon. member to see some of the letters which we received from people in that industry after that measure was taken. It was freely said that the Government saved the industry under those conditions. So, we are, in fact, handling the matter and we are going to dispose of it within the next few days.</p>

<p>I should like to come very briefly to the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens. He quoted the Stellenbosch Burea for Economic Research that living standards are threatened as the economy cools; that standards of living will be seriously hit by a continuation of sharp price increases, etc. I have not been able to find that passage in the latest report of the Stellenbosch bureau. I am not quite sure from which report the hon. member took that, but I have the latest two reports and I have gone through them with some care over the week-end. However, I have not been able to find that specific passage. What I did find was this in report No. 84&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although there is thus little doubt that the domestic growth rate will level off further during the present quarter &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is of 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; it should to some extent be considered as a not undesirable feature inasmuch as it will relieve bottlenecks and consequently promote a greater degree of stability.</block>

<p>The hon. member also said that capital obtained from the gold mines ought to be used for the manufacturing industry. Surely, this has been the Government&#x2019;s policy ever since 1924 when it took measures to get this country really industrialized. Surely, we have diversified ever since we have been in power and we have used capital from the mines and other sources precisely to build up the manufacturing industry. I think that is a very clear-cut case.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that we should take specific measures to encourage overseas capital to come here. I want to remind the hon. member that last year we brought in a net capital in-flow of R700 million while the most difficult circumstances prevailed in the world capital market. I think that was not a bad achievement for South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with his proposals about easing taxation and that sort of thing, because obviously I shall try to do that in the Budget. However, he did say that the Government ought to revise its attitude towards the blocked rand and consider removing most of the prohibitions on the movement of capital. We are constantly looking at exchange control and how to apply it. I have had proposals to abolish exchange control, but I wonder what country in the world can, under present conditions, abolish exchange control. The hon. member did not say so, but others outside this House did. Whatever restrictions We have are pretty reasonable and are certainly not discouraging foreign capital from coming here.</p>

<p>I would like to refer briefly to what the hon. member for Johannesburg North said. I want to thank him and other hon. members opposite for their kind remarks towards me when they started their speeches. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s whole approach can be summed up in his assertion that the Government refuses to allow South Africa to turn its resources to best possible account. How on earth do you justify that statement where your growth rate has been increasing by 7 to 8% in real terms, where the <i>per capita</i> growth rate has risen by <span class="col_1303-1304" refersTo="page_0667"/>6% over two years and you have the state of affairs we see around us every day, even with your eyes only half open? Yet that is what the hon. member said. He then said that the expectation was that our growth rate in real terms will be of the order of 3 to 4% in 1975 as compared with 7 to 8% in 1974. He is not the only person to talk of a growth rate of 3 to 4%, but I think the hon. member ought to tell us whose expectation that is. Although I agree that there has been an easing off in the growth rate I cannot possibly at this moment see a growth rate of 3%. If the hon. member has an opportunity he can tell us what the source of that rather far-reaching statement is. He said that we should have done better than we have, i.e. better than a growth rate of 8%. Here, too, perhaps he will tell us in what sectors we could have raised our overall level of production by more than 8% in real terms. He does agree with Government policy that the great aims are to have sustained growth and to reduce the rate of inflation, as he put it, and makes the interesting statement that the remedial action to achieve these things is &#x201C;simple&#x201D;.</p>

<p>*He said it was easy, it was simple to contain inflation and, in doing so, bring down the rate of inflation, I have read the speech of the hon. member in Hansard with great care in order to see what the prescriptions for such simple action are.</p>

<p>&#x2020;He gives us a six point prescription, which he puts very concisely and tersely. He says, firstly, that the Government should continue to recognize that we are part of the world capital market and should refrain from excessive interference with its workings. How on earth can we interfere with the workings of the world capital market? The world&#x2019;s capital market consists of the capital markets of many countries. We have a capital market in South Africa and we do our best to keep this capital market as effective as possible. Indeed, I believe we have succeeded extremely well in doing so. Only last week, about the time the hon. member was speaking, the Reserve Bank was able to announce that it had abolished the fixed interest pattern on maturities of three years and longer. These are primary securities with a term of three years or more on which the fixed interest pattern was abolished. It means, of course, that our capital market has developed out of all recognition. It means that, whereas some years ago we were able to abolish the fixed interest pattern on maturities of less than three years, we have now been able to do it on maturities of more than three years as well. It is an extremely efficient capital market. Obviously the hon. member was meaning that we should have as small an interest rate differential as possible compared with the sources of capital abroad. In fact, he later said so. Well, we did raise our interest rates specifically in order to make it possible to attract capital from a very competitive market abroad. We succeeded to the extent that whereas in 1973 we had a net outflow of capital of R116 million, last year we had a net inflow of R700 million. Surely, the hon. member will appreciate that that is a very substantial achievement. Then the hon. member says the Government should follow a policy of refraining from excessive interference in the world capital market, viz. not to allow too large a gap to develop between domestic and international rates, particularly by not artificially inducing too low rates, because it will inevitably increase the rate of inflation. What we have to do in this country, surely, is to promote and encourage production as much as possible. This relates to our growth rate. Surely, by holding interest rates within bounds, we have gone a very long way towards achieving that. If we simply let our interest rates rise out of all proportion, would we have achieved the growth that we have? Would we then have countered inflation? Surely, the hon. member would agree that, other things being equal, the more one steps up production, the more are one&#x2019;s chances to bring down average costs and prices and to control inflation. The hon. member was very terse in this respect and may perhaps have had other ideas which he did not express.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the Government must, at all times, keep expenditure down very substantially. It must exercise self-discipline in regard to its expenditure. He made the interesting statement that it was no use creating a railway line while denying people the opportunity of opening up mines. It is very easy to say that. Our expenditure is set out in detail in the Estimates of Expenditure, Vote by Vote. Surely, the hon. member should then come to us and tell us exactly where we should make cuts. He should tell us this particularly in respect of infrastructure, railway lines and expenditure for mines. Surely, he should tell us precisely what we should <span class="col_1305-1306" refersTo="page_0668"/>not be doing if, in fact, we are doing it. His statement is a very generalized statement. I do not think it assists us a great deal unless we know precisely what he has in mind. I actually think it is a case of the shoe fitting the other foot. The demand for infrastructure is such that we simply have to go on spending certain essential moneys, virtually whether we like it or not. However, these aspects are placed under the closest scrutiny all the time. I think that anyone saying that the expenditure is wrong or is too high ought to tell us precisely where that expenditure should be reduced.</p>

<p>The hon. member said we should remove all discrimination. I hope the hon. member will draw up a list of what he considers to be discrimination and tell us exactly which of those examples of discrimination should be removed. What does &#x201C;removing all discrimination&#x201D; really mean to a person who has the responsibility of carrying out policy? I really think that we should ask here for a specific explanation of discrimination, item for item. We must then be told how discrimination should be removed.</p>

<p>Yes, the swimming bath in Sea Point. The hon. member says that by those means we would maximize productivity. This question of maximizing productivity is a very difficult one, however. In the United States, where they have made the most exceptional efforts to raise productivity in the last year, their industrial productivity has nevertheless dropped by 3,6%. I do not know whether the hon. member would ascribe that to discrimination in the United States. It certainly does not compare with our record of industrial productivity last year. The hon. member made the point that he disagreed fundamentally with the hon. member for Paarl. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The future prosperity of this country and the policy of separate development stand in direct contrast, the one to the other, and that in fact the myth of separate development cannot stand the cold touch of reality.</block>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I will answer that. We are engaged in a very carefully planned policy of separate development under which these different homelands will be in a position, if they should want it, to ask for their independence, which we will then give to them following the proper negotiations. Believe me, when that happens it will be possible to do it. We will see to it. If the Transkei wants its independence next year, we will make it possible. We are not a bankrupt country. Of course, we shall be able to do it. It is quite easy because we have planned carefully.</p>

<p>The last point I want to touch on is a very interesting one. I was very interested to see the reservations the hon. member for Johannesburg North had about gold. I would have thought that if there was one member in this House who would have stood up and put the case for gold&#x2014;in this uncertain world today where gold is making such headway&#x2014;it would have been the hon. member for Johannesburg North. But if you read his speech you see that he had considerable reservations about the prospects for gold. I for my part want to put the case for gold and I want to remind the House that since I spoke last, a week ago, there has been an extremely significant international development in regard to gold. I refer to the decision of the Common Market countries to recommend to their Council of Ministers that the central banks should be able to buy and sell gold at market prices or, if you like, market-related prices as they sometimes say. Apparently that will also include the IMF. I think that the Ministers of these countries are going to be hard put to it to turn that down. However, we shall see. I think that it is an exceptionally interesting and far-reaching positive factor for gold. I <span class="col_1307-1308" refersTo="page_0669"/>think that it means that here is another one of the supporters, you might say, of the myth of the so-called official price of gold, i.e. 42,22 dollars per fine ounce, crumbling before our eyes. It is perfectly true that gold production has declined. Gold production by volume has declined lately because we are mining lower grade ore made possible by the higher prices. But I would like to remind the House that the value of output has risen very appreciably, as we have heard earlier today. The revenue received last year was very nearly R2 600 million. I believe that, as far as gold is concerned, we have not only an extremely valuable commodity but also a most strategic commodity today. The greater the uncertainty that overwhelms the world, the greater the economic and financial difficulties, the greater the difficulties with the international payment system, the more people turn to gold whether the Americans or anybody else like it or not. That is the situation and I for one have said it before and I would like to say it again: I am not so pessimistic as some people that gold can simply be demonetized, as they say, that you can take gold out of the monetary system. I would like to see that day, if I may express my view.</p>

<p>*Finally and by way of summary, I want to emphasize again that the short term economic situation and prospects in most countries of the world, the major oil producing States being the only exception, are extremely unfavourable. Many countries have been grappling for many months simultaneously with an economic recession, large-scale unemployment, inflation and a serious disequilibrium in the balance of payments. These problems were in the process of developing even before the so-called energy crisis, which began in October, 1973, but were considerably aggravated by it. However, everything is going very well indeed with the South African economy. As a matter of fact, the year 1974 was perhaps one of the best years the Republic has ever experienced economically, and as I see them, the prospects for 1975 are in the main particularly favourable. What makes it so remarkable is the fact that these economic achievements have been realized and are still being realized despite the detrimental effect the unfavourable international economic situation necessarily has upon us. In order to illustrate the striking contrast between the present and the expected economic situation in South Africa and that in most other countries of the world, my colleagues on this side of the House and I have only applied the normal criterions of economic soundness to various countries, i.e. the real growth rate, the ex-ployment situation or, let me rather say, the unemployment abroad, the balance of payments position and, finally, the rate of inflation. Mr. Speaker, you have seen where South Africa stands in this comparison. The combination of a high growth rate, a moderate current deficit, a surplus on capital account and, for all practical purposes, an equilibrium in the balance of payments as a whole, serves as proof of a sound underlying economic situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe I have said enough to prove my great and unqualified confidence in the economy and financial situation of our country.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Bill now before this House for consideration, is a short one, and it is hoped that the few amendments which are of necessity being effected to two sections of the Precious Stones Act, 1964, will meet with the approval of everyone in this House.</p>

<p>The first clause amends subsection (2) of section 108 of the Act relating to Police traps. When considering this clause I should like to see that we do not become involved in a controversy about the humaneness or the moral aspects of the Police trap system, for the fact of the matter is that in a country such as South Africa with its scattered occurrence of diamonds, this system, which has been in existence for many years now, is, absolutely essential.</p>

<p>During 1973 we sold diamonds to the value of more of R162 million, and few people realize what tremendous proportions the smuggling trade in South Africa is assuming, despite every effort on the part of the Police to combat and restrict it. I want to content myself with saying that the illicit diamond trade in all its forms are still increasing; that the State has suffered vast financial losses as a result of this smuggling trade; that Police traps are used as an absolutely last resort in each specific case, and utilized with the greatest circumspection only when there is sound reason to believe that someone is involved in the illicit diamond trade, and that any impairment of the Police trap system may lead to the evil of smuggling getting completely out of hand.</p>

<p>To return to the contemplated statutory amendment, I want to explain briefly that the existing provisions of section 108(2) of the Act are <i>inter alia</i> to the effect that when a member of the S.A. Police has transferred possession of any uncut diamond to any person upon payment or delivery by such person to such member of an amount in money or other consideration, etc., and such person is subsequently convicted of an offence in connection with such transaction, the money, etc., which had been so paid over or delivered is automatically forfeited to the State. This provision was specially inserted as a further deterrent to illicit diamond trading, for experience has shown that the heavy penalties which may be imposed do not in themselves have the desirable effect.</p>

<p>In most cases where the Police offer uncut diamonds to a suspected illicit dealer, it is the practice&#x2014;particularly if it is a valuable packet&#x2014;to take receipt of the money and then, as soon as the money has been counted, to make the arrest without the diamonds having been handed over.</p>

<p>Until recently the Police experienced no problems with this procedure and the application of section 108 of the Act because the forfeiture to the State of the money paid over (even in cases where the Police did not transfer possession of the Police trap diamonds to the accused) was not disputed. However, the position changed in 1972 when, after a trial had run its course in one of our Supreme Courts, after which the accused had been found guilty, the considerable amount of money which he had paid for the valuable packet of Police trap diamonds was returned to the accused by the court. The State appealed by way of civil proceedings against the court&#x2019;s decision to return the money to the accused, <span class="col_1315-1316" refersTo="page_0673"/>but the appeal failed on the grounds of a finding that section 108(2) was not applicable because possession of the diamonds had not been transferred to the person in question before the arrest was made.</p>

<p>&#x2020;People who do not have an intimate knowledge of transactions of this nature may wonder why the possession of diamonds used in these Police traps could not be transferred in each case to the person concerned before the arrest was made, but suffice it for me to say that such a great variety of circumstances and factors are involved in these matters that it is not always possible or advisable to do so.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of Police has, with due regard to all the aspects of the matter, submitted strong representations for a suitable amendment to the provisions of section 108(2) of the Act, and all that we are doing now is to amplify the existing provisions so that money or other consideration which has been paid to the Police in connection with such an illicit diamond transaction will, if the person concerned is convicted of an offence in connection with that transaction, be forfeited to the State, i.e. irrespective of whether the possession of the diamonds which were the subject of the transaction was transferred to the convicted person prior to his arrest or not.</p>

<p>Clause 2: The few changes which are being made by this clause to section 123(1) of the Precious Stones Act, 1964, are intended to improve provisions which are aimed at combating the theft of diamonds and the consequential illicit trading which flows from such thefts.</p>

<p>As will be noted, the section deals with the powers of search by producers of diamonds and not by the S.A. Police whose powers of search are set out in another section, viz. section 99. The position under the section with which we are dealing here, i.e. section 123(1), is that only a person carrying on prospecting, digging or mining operations, or his representative, is permitted to search other persons, vehicles, etc., but what is more to the point is that such persons may only be searched if they are on the land where those operations are being conducted or on the area where or in buildings in which employees are being housed. In other words, a mine owner, etc., is vested with powers of search, but he may not conduct searches of persons and things away from the mining property.</p>

<p>Although most diamonds which are involved in the illicit diamond traffic are diamonds which have been stolen from mines, alluvial claim workings, etc., it has been brought to my department&#x2019;s attention that the matter of security at the diamond sorting houses in Kimberley was cause for considerable concern since the company responsible for the operation of the sorting houses did not possess any statutory powers to search persons employed by it.</p>

<p>I may mention in this connection that all the large producers of diamonds in South Africa, which include the State as owner of the State Alluvial Diggings at Alexander Bay, have formed themselves into the Diamond Producers&#x2019; Association and that all the diamonds produced by them are sorted and valued in Kimberley prior to marketing.</p>

<p>It is therefore considered imperative that the provisions of section 123(1) be amplified in order that the Diamond Producers* Association and the company responsible for the functioning of the sorting houses will have the necessary statutory power to search employees on the spot.</p>

<p>Large quantities of diamonds are also handled by employees of the Diamond Trading Company which is responsible for the marketing of the association&#x2019;s diamonds through an associated London-based company. In the circumstances, the proposed additions to section 123(1) have been worded in such a way that the Diamond Trading Company would likewise have the necessary power to search employees, etc., within its premises. In addition, manufacturers of synthetic diamonds will be vested with similar powers.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, the amendments which we wish to effect here are quite simple, but at the same time very necessary. They comprise only the amplification of an existing principle, and I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the existing section provides explicitly that the searching of any any person has to take place with meticulous consideration for the requirements of decency, and that the searching of a female may only be carried out by another female.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are willing to agree with the <span class="col_1317-1318" refersTo="page_0674"/>hon. the Minister that the two clauses which are being introduced by this Bill are, in fact, necessary in order that the diamond industry should receive the protection it requires in respect of these two offences.</p>

<p>The diamond industry is a very particular kind of industry in that it produces objects or commodities very small in size and very large in value. These particular commodities, therefore, impose a special temptation on employees of the diamond industry or people associated with or attracted by the stones to operate illegally in respect of the product of the industry. In the case of an ordinary industry such illegal operations, such abstractions or thefts of the commodity, would involve the company concerned in a certain loss, probably no greater than the value of the commodity stolen. In the case of the diamond industry there is a particular consideration, i.e. that of controlled scarcity. If there were, in fact, a large-scale leakage of this material through illegal activities, not only would the industry stand to lose the actual value of the stones in question, but through the loss of control there could also be a loss in the value of the commodity as such. It is quite clear that this imprtant industry must be protected, and it must be protected by means which perhaps go beyond what one would contemplate for the agricultural or some other industry.</p>

<p>So far as the Second Reading of this Bill is concerned, we agree that the measures proposed by the hon. the Minister are necessary in principle. Since we agree that they are necessary in principle, we shall not oppose the Second Reading. I wish to say at this stage, in order to give the hon. the Minister time to consider his position, that we would like to see certain improvements effected in the Committee Stage I shall not argue as though we were in the Committee Stage, but merely give a brief indication of what I have in mind in order to assist the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>In the case of clause 1 provision has been made that where a Police agent sets a trap and actually transfers or receives money from the victim or the suspect in that trap, and no diamond has actually changed hands, that money may be surrendered or forfeited to the State. The hon. the Minister has explained the reasons and the circumstances in which this may take pace. We accept his assurances that trapping is necessary in the case of the diamond industry provided that it is subject to certain safeguards. If those safeguards were always applied and respected, one would perhaps have less to say about this particular clause. However, the fact is&#x2014;and it is common knowledge&#x2014;that despite the best intentions, the traps are sometimes set contrary to these caveats which the Minister has expressed; that agents are sometimes over-zealous in the way in which traps are set; and that people who are easily tempted&#x2014; I will not say innocent people&#x2014;have been led, by the manner in which traps are sometimes set, into the kind of situation contemplated in clause 1. I believe an argument can be made out for a discretion in this case. I do not believe that the person who has perhaps been unwary, rash or immature and who has been led into a trap by an over-zealous policemen should suffer exactly the same penalties as would be the case if the person trapped were, let us say, an old lag, somebody who has been operating for a long time. In principle, of course, this should not happen but in practice, as we all know, these things do happen. Therefore I propose to move in the Committee Stage&#x2014;and I wish to give notice that I shall do so now&#x2014;that in line 21 of clause 1, instead of the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; be substituted the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in order that the court, when the case comes before it, may exercise its discretion. If it finds that it has a hardened sinner before it, somebody who deserves to lose the money he has unwarily placed in the hands of the agent, the court would, of course, have the right to cause its forfeiture notwithstanding section 108 of the Precious Stones Act or what has happened in the past in respect of this section. The court will still have the right to impound that money and to hand it over to the State If the court finds before it, however, a person who is inexperienced, who has been tempted and perhaps even misled by an agent who is over-zealous in the execution of his duties, I believe the court should have the discretion to allow that money to be handed back to the accused who may well suffer other penalties. The money should be returned to the accused on the grounds of non-completion of the contract between the two parties. This is something I wish to leave with the Minister for his consideration. I shall not press the matter any further. We shall, however, certainly return to it in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>With regard to clause 2, once again, as I have said, we are in favour of the amendments because we know that there <span class="col_1319-1320" refersTo="page_0675"/>has also been a change in the operational conditions in the mining industry which necessitates a change of some of the words in clause 2. However, the words as they stand here do have rather wide implications. Whereas the Minister has consistently referred to mine owners having rights of search in various places, these words can now also apply to people such as diamond cutters. When rough or uncut diamonds leave the mine property, they are delivered to certain diamond-cutting operators, and with this legislation these extremely wide powers of search are now also being given to people who do not fall into the category of mine owners. I do not have sufficient knowledge of the industry to say whether the ramifications are not wider even than those I have stated.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I believe they are. Even though the provision is limited to rough or uncut diamonds, which are restricted in circulation, a number of people are engaged in this industry and it seems to me that in terms of clause 2 there could be widespread rights of search which I do not believe are truly contemplated by the amendments proposed. I frankly cannot suggest how this clause can be improved, but I wonder whether the hon. the Minister, in consultation with his advisers, will have a look at the wording of clause 2 and see whether it cannot be made more precise and restrictive than is the clause which we have before the House this afternoon. That is all I have to say as far as the Second Reading is concerned. We shall not oppose the Second Reading. We shall raise these matters with the lion, the Minister again in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I avail myself of the opportunity of welcoming the hon. member for Von Brandis back in the House after his operation. I am delighted to see him back and hear him speak on this technical Bill now before the House. May I also express my appreciation to the Opposition for supporting the Second Reading of this Bill. I can assure them that I appreciate it very much indeed. I agree with the hon. member that the matters he raised can be discussed at length in the Committee Stage. In clause 1 the hon. member proposes substituting the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. I shall take this matter up with the Police and with my legal advisers to obtain their opinions. We can then discuss the matter in the Committee Stage. If the substitution will not change the Bill materially, I see no reason why the substitution should not be acceptable to us. I shall, however, have to go into the matter fully and I shall then convey to the hon. member the results of my investigation.</p>

<p>With regard to clause 2, the hon. member desires a more precise wording to make sure that people such as diamond cutters are not adversely affected. I also undertake to go into that matter and we can discuss it further in the Committee Stage. That is all I have to say provisionally. However, let me once again express my thanks for the support for this Bill.</p>
