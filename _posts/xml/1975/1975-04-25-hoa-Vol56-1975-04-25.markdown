<speech by="#engelbrecht">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when one looks at world affairs today there is indeed, much cause for concern. In Cambodia and South Vietnam communist aggression is causing infinite suffering to millions of people at this very moment, while no Western nation as much as lifts a finger to try to prevent it. In Western Europe, the cradle of our Christian Western civilization, the doctrines of Karl Marx are superseding the doctrines of Christianity. Mr. Chairman, unless something unforeseen happens to quell the side of Marxism, Western Europe could within the next decade fall an easy prey to Communism. In our own continent, Africa, there is hardly a single stable Government outside South Africa&#x2019;s borders. It is calculated that more than 300 000 people have been mowed down by famine in Central and East Africa in the past few years. Furthermore, Africa is chastised by underdevelopment and lack of food, by a lack of initiative, lack of know-how and lack of capital, by illiteracy, drought and pests, by official murders and the brutality of public executions, by uncontrollable terrorism and inroads of Chinese and Russian Communism, and by the probability of a fierce and lengthy civil war in Angola.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, while all these and many other things are happening in our present-day world, causing uncertainty and concern for the future, the United Nations Organization, which was founded on the lofty ideals of fostering and promoting peace and goodwill amongst all men and all nations, has found it necessary to devote the major part of its time and energy to discuss, contrary to the stipulations of its own charter, the internal policy of a member State, that member State being South Africa, one of the very few countries in the world where there is stability and peace and progress and where real independence and self-determination are growing into reality for several smaller nations.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, while the United Nations Organization has found it necessary to suspend South Africa from the proceedings of the General Assembly, South Africa who was a founder member of the United Nations, who took a major share in shaping the United Nations charter, who has always had a very exemplary record in U.N. affairs, who has always paid its dues promptly and has consistently held out a hand of friendship and co-operation to all developing nations, was illegally and summarily cut off from General Assembly participation. But, Sir, never a single note of protest was heard in the chambers of the United Nations against communist aggression and cruelty in South-East Asia, or against communist violation of solemn international agreements, or against the oppression of millions of people in the Russian satellite States, or against the bloodshed and oppression of minorities in Africa, or against the brutalities of public persecutions and public hangings in certain African States! Mr. Chairman, this is the world in which we live. This is the world in which we have to try to secure a continued peaceful existence for our children. We, who believe in the sound values of our Christian heritage and in our system of free enterprise, may not lose courage or faith. I think the time has come, Sir, when the peoples who place a high premium on these values should stand together. It is in this regard that I wish to make a plea again today for closer co-operation between South Africa and the United States of America. Sir, I firmly believe that there is no other nation in the world with which we have so much in common as the United States. Not only did our ancestors emigrate from the same European countries, but there is also a very close similarity between the histories of our two countries. The covered wagon of the American pioneer played the same important role there as the &#x201C;Kakebeenwa&#x201D; of the Voortrekker played here. It has been their task and ours to cultivate and civilize a vast uncivilized continent. For many years now it is their national policy and their firm conviction that no other State has the right to interfere in their domestic affairs. We also believe in the policy of non-interference in our domestic affairs. They have a colour problem which they are trying to solve in their own way, namely along the <span class="col_4805-4806" refersTo="page_0816"/>lines of integration, and we have a colour problem which we are trying to solve in our own way, namely along the lines of the development of separate nationalities. Both South Africa and the United States have a long and happy history of close co-operation, not only in the fields of science and research, but we also fought side by side with them through two world wars and again in the Korean war. We also have in common with them the fact that our two countries form part of the New World, a new world with a different task and a different duty towards mankind. There are signs that the Old World is passing by and that the New World has to take the lead. But, Sir, most important of all, we stand together side by side with the U.S.A. in their struggle against Communism, which is endangering and bedevilling their lives as it does ours. The U.S.A. is today generally accepted as the dominant country of the free world and as the undisputed leader in the struggle against Communism. Of course, it must be admitted that the U.S.A. has had serious setbacks recently in its role as protector of the free world. After its failure in the Middle East and after the Vietnam debacle, the question is being raised whether the U.S.A. is still the leader of the free world and its protector against the onward sweep of Communism. One observes signs of a move towards isolationism amongst U.S. congressmen, which is not surprising after the Vietnam tragedy in which 55 000 American lives were lost. However, I personally believe that the U.S.A. is a great country with a great people who will not falter or hesitate when a task has to be performed. We have appreciation for the more positive and realistic approach by the State Department towards South Africa. We have appreciation for ambassador Scali&#x2019;s realistic speeches in and outside the forum of U.N. We are sorry that through no fault of our own we are no longer allowed to play a role in that organization. It must, however, be borne in mind by our friends that we also have a feeling of national pride, and until such time as there is a change of heart in U.N., it could surely hardly be expected of us to go back, cap in hand, asking for more humiliation and degradation. That, of course, is my own personal view. The time, however, is ripe that a solid base for co-operation between the U.S. and South Africa should be encouraged. This would be to the infinite advantage of both countries, because ultimately friendly relations between States are determined by facts and by national interests and not by sentiment.</p>

<p>The fact is that after South-East Asia has been conquered, the communists will undoubtedly turn towards Africa. Already there is the enormously expanding communist arms build-up; in African countries. There is, for instance, the naval and military concentration in Somalia at the horn of Africa. There is also intense Soviet interest in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. These are hard facts which cannot be denied or disputed. Communist domination of the Indian Ocean and of the Cape route poses a serious threat not only to South Africa but also to European countries and also to the United States, since one by one the possible theatres of war are being occupied by pre-emptive Russian action. There will come a day when it will be too late to act.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to conclude by saying that the time is ripe for the U.S.A. to shake off the domineering and the bullying of the communist-inspired majority of the U.N., and for its own sake to declare itself prepared to sell to South Africa the arms we need to safeguard the Cape sea route.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I deal with questions that have been put to me, I should like at this stage to express my sincere thanks for the appreciation expressed on both sides of this House for the work which has been done by the hon. the Prime Minister, myself, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs and my department. I can assure hon. members that everything which has been achieved was the result of excellent team-work. A great deal of hard work was done by the team as a whole. I can also assure hon. members that the support of hon. members on both sides of this House means a very great deal to us. In the second place I want to express my sincere thanks for the fact that all the members on both sides of the House responded so splendidly to my request and plea to be careful in their statements in regard to Africa. When I made that appeal to hon. members, I realized that there was a danger that, this could lead to a colourless debate, a debate without any fireworks, but I think hon. members will agree with me that this was not the case at all, and that the majority of the speeches which have been made up <span class="col_4807-4808" refersTo="page_0817"/>to now, were constructive and also useful. For that I want to convey my thanks to members on both sides of this House.</p>

<p>One of the few discordant notes that was sounded, came from the hon. member for Sea Point. That is regrettable, for otherwise that hon. member made a useful and constructive contribution. I am not much older than that hon. member. Nevertheless I think that I should speak to him like a father this morning. By continuing to try to play off my good friend, the hon. the Minister of Defence and I against each other the hon. member is harming his own image. It makes a very poor impression. The hon. member should rather ask himself where South Africa stood with d&#x00E9;tente and what the future of us all&#x2014;both his children and mine&#x2014;would have been if the S.A. Defence Force had not, under the present Minister of Defence, been developed to that degree of preparedenss and striking power which it has today. All this has been done under the guidance of the present hon. the Minister of Defence, in spite of the fact that the U.N. is attempting to enforce an arms boycott against South Africa. Therefore I really hope that there will be an end to the pettiness of this hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member also enquired about the alleged recruiting of mercenaries in Johannesburg who, according to report, will be used in Mozambique. I must say that the reply to this question is in fact obvious. The Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to the recruiting of mercenaries has been very clearly stated, <i>inter alia</i> during last September in this House by my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Defence, and by myself. We stated unequivocally that we are opposed to such a practice and that we shall not allow it. This is still our policy today. This newspaper story has been thoroughly investigated and my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Police, has informed me that it became apparent during the investigation that the story had no substance whatsoever. If attempts should be made in future to recruit mercenaries, strict action will be taken against them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout raised objections to the use of the word &#x201C;non-White&#x201D; in the 1974 edition of the <i>South West Africa Survey.</i> Surely it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between the various population groups of South Africa and of South West Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sometimes it is absolutely necessary. This is also being done at the U.N. If the hon. member were to take the trouble to read the notes which I made available to him and to other members in regard to the recent session of the U.N., he would find that many of the speakers&#x2014;Americans and others&#x2014;also use that expression in speeches quoted in the survey.</p>

<p>If the hon. member were to take the trouble to read through his own Hansard of the past, he would see that he himself has repeatedly used that word here.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but internally.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, but apparently the hon. member is not aware of the fact that a very close study is made of our Hansard in the outside world as well. I think the hon. member is being over-sensitive, completely unreasonable and unpractical as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made the allegation that not all political parties have full participation in the process which is now taking place in South West Africa. He quoted, I think, from the <i>South West Africa Survey,</i> Vol., II, 1974, page 27. But what is stated there relates to the situation which existed at the time when South, Africa made contact with the Secretary-General and his representatives. It deals specifically with the freedom of political activities. The freedom of political activities still exists in practice, on the basis set out in the quotation which the hon. member used yesterday. What is happening there at present, is something else. The leaders of the various population groups&#x2014;not the parties, although some of the leaders are brought there by political parties&#x2014;are at present holding talks.</p>

<p>The hon. member also complained that there was insufficient information on the future of South West Africa. Does the hon. member not realize what is happening in South West Africa now, or does it not suit his purpose to admit what is happening there&#x003F; Surely the inhabitants of South West Africa now have to work out their political future themselves, and all options are open to them. How on earth could the department <span class="col_4809-4810" refersTo="page_0818"/>which compiled this survey have stated in 1974 what was going to happen there in future, seeing that all the options are open&#x003F; Surely that would have meant that we would have been prescribing to those people, who are seated around a conference table, what they should do. That is not our interpretation of self-determination. Then we would have been doing precisely what we say we ourselves and others should not do.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the next session of the Security Council. Our actions in this regard are a matter to which, the Government is constantly giving its urgent attention. I think hon. members will agree with me that it will not be advisable for me at this stage to anticipate the Government&#x2019;s actions. This House will of course be fully informed in due course on the Government&#x2019;s actions. However, I want to remind that hon. members that the hon. the Prime Minister said in this House last week that good progress was being made in South West Africa with the consultation among the various population groups themselves. This is in fact relevant here.</p>

<p>The hon. member thinks that we can refer our problems in regard to the United Nations to the World Court. I have already caused this matter to be thoroughly investigated by the law advisers of my department. In the first place this is impracticable on a juridicial basis. The World Court may only be used if a dispute arises between two members of the United Nations, and both members subject themselves to the authority and jurisdiction of that court. In the second place the World Court may be approached for an advisory opinion, when this is requested by the U.N. organ concerned. A member state itself cannot do this. Even if this had in fact been possible on legal grounds, which is not the case, of what avail would it have been to us&#x003F; In view of our experience of the court in the past, it would be futile to go to this court again with our difficulty.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to our relations with Lesotho. I and all of us on this side of the House also regret the recent actions of Lesotho. It is very regrettable, for this is not conducive to sound relations between South Africa and this neighbouring state of ours. We have sought to maintain sound relations throughout, and shall continue to do so. As regards the charge made by Lesotho pertaining to interference on our part, I can only say that in that respect South Africa has a very clean record. Lesotho would do well to consider examining its own conscience in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vasco suggested that I should seek out opportunities to hold frequent talks on foreign relations with the Bantu nations. I have already done this on occasion, <i>inter alia</i> with representatives of the Coloureds, as well, but in the past such discussions did not take place regularly and systematically. I think that the hon. member has made a good suggestion, a suggestion which could be followed up in consultation with the hon. the Prime Minister and the other Ministers concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville advocated <i>inter alia</i> that we should strengthen our ties with South America. We on this side of the House agree with him one hundred per cent. I could just remind him of the fact here that we have recently established diplomatic relations with a considerable number of Latin American States, so that we already have diplomatic relations with approximately a dozen States in Southern and Central America today.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The speech of the hon. member for Pinelands continued, like the speech of his leader, several constructive elements. He made the suggestion that like last year we should again include as members of the delegation to the United Nations non-White South Africans. I can assure him that this will again be considered at the appropriate time, and that the experiment which we made last year was certainly worthwhile. The hon. member also put questions about the training of non-Whites as diplomats. I can inform the House that this matter has been finalized to the point where we can shortly proceed with the recruitment of non-White members for the diplomatic service. The hon. member also pleaded for more unofficial contacts with Africa. This is actually already taking place in several fields.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis and several other hon. members stressed the importance of South Africa&#x2019;s continued membership of the United Nations.</p>

<p>*The hon. member and other hon. members should realize, however, that there is a world of difference between withdrawal on one&#x2019;s own initiative, for whatever reason &#x2014;for example, because one is dissatisfied with the organization, because it is not serving <span class="col_4811-4812" refersTo="page_0819"/>its purpose, or because one is not being accorded proper treatment there&#x2014;and the situation South Africa has had to deal with since the last session of the General Assembly. This is a situation in which the U.N. is making it impossible for us to practise our membership. This also affects the question of our contributions to the budget of the organization. I do not know whether the hon. member for Pinelands wants us to make our contributions in spite of the fact that we are not at present able to participate in the proceedings of the organization. South Africa&#x2019;s standpoint in regard to its membership of the U.N. has been stated very, very clearly and unequivocally here and elsewhere. We want to remain in this organization as long as this is possible, in practice, and our future relations with the U.N. will therefore depend on further developments in practice.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should also like to refer to a few remarks made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in this debate. He referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the gravity of the situation in Rhodesia and pointed out the difficult position in which South Africa would find itself should terrorist activities flare up in Rhodesia once more. This is where he stopped, and now I should like to know from him what, according to his party&#x2019;s standpoint, South Africa should do in the event of such terrorist activities flaming up in Rhodesia. It is very easy for him to deal with problems such as these without his stating his party&#x2019;s standpoint.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Tell me what your standpoint is, then I shall tell you what ours is.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>I am asking the hon. member what their standpoint is. He did not ask for ours, and I am now asking him what their standpoint is.</p>

<p>The hon. member gave a very true description of the success of guerrilla warfare in the world during the past number of years. I nearly want to go as far as saying that he sang the praises of this success. He is correct, because it is really pathetic to see how the powerful West reeled against the onslaughts of guerrilla warfare. I think, however, he omitted to say one thing, which in my opinion, must be said in the times in which we are living in the world at the moment. To be specific, the hon. member omitted to say that all the guerrilla onslaughs were aimed at colonial authorities. He omitted pointing out that the principal key to their success was the fact that the men who were used to fight them, had no attachment to the country they had to defend. I think we must make it perfectly clear to the guerrillas, terrorists and subversives that if they were to touch South Africa, they would find themselves in a different situation to what they possibly experienced elsewhere in the world, and that the people of South Africa are a nation who bought this country with blood and tears and that we are definitely prepared to retain in this country for ourselves. I do not want to argue with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I just think that he should have added this and that it would have been a very good thing if this had come from his side of the House.</p>

<p>There is a third point to which I want to refer in connection with the remarks which came from that side of this House. The hon. member pleaded that we should not terminate our membership of the U.N. Actually the hon. the Minister has already referred to it, but I want to ask those hon. members what their standpoint would be if the United Nations were to make it impossible for South Africa to exercise what they called South Africa&#x2019;s right of membership. Do they want us to keep officials at that body who may not enter into the council chambers, who cannot fulfil any function there and whose presence there will cost a tremendous amount in addition to the membership fees we have to pay&#x003F; Furthermore, if the treatment experienced by South Africa at the United Nations were to be of a kind, as the hon. the Minister and the hon. the Prime Minister has already said on previous occasions, that it would be so humiliating to South Africa as a State that it could take it any longer, would they still want us to remain in the United Nations under those circumstances&#x003F; Do they want us to allow South Africa being trampled upon&#x003F; Do they want us to crawl in front of the United Nations&#x003F; I put these questions to them and they can now answer me by way of interjection. What would their standpoint be in that event, if we were to be faced by such a situation&#x003F; Sir, I want to tell them that my standpoint is this: If the hon. the Minister or the hon. the Prime Minister were to decide in that case that South Africa should <span class="col_4813-4814" refersTo="page_0820"/>terminate its membership of the United Nations, I should not hesitate for a single moment to say, &#x201C;Well-done&#x201D;. I should also add, &#x201C;It is high time&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I also want to say something with regard to Dar-es-Salaam and I should like hon. members on that side of this House to agree with it. They reacted very positively on the successes of our Prime Minister and our Minister of Foreign Affairs in Africa, but in Dar-es-Salaam one thing was said which I want to reject with contempt, and that is that this whole exercise with Africa supposedly was a clever move on the part of South Africa to bring about division in the ranks of the Organization for African Unity. I think this should be rejected categorically with the contempt it deserves. I believe that the debates in recent times in this House of Assembly and the speeches by representatives of the people very clearly revealed the attitude of the South African representatives of the people towards the hand of peace and friendship extended to Africa by the South African Government. I think it would be a good thing if this aspect, this insinuation of a clever move, were to be categorically rejected by hon. members on that side of the House as well, because they see the South African Government, they know the hon. the Prime Minister and they know the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, they are in a very good position to say to Africa, &#x201C;It is nonsense&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In the very short time I still have at my disposal, I want to refer to a matter which I raised in the debate on this Vote as far back as 1968. It is always with joy that I take cognizance of the growing interest showed in South Africa by foreign countries. During the past few months in particular, there has been an intensive increase in this interest. During the past few months there have been several trade missions from Europe, from South America, and also from other parts of the world. It seems to me as though this is going to increase. I think the reason for this growing interest in South Africa is the confidence in South Africa which has been created by the hon. the Prime Minister, which improved the image of South Africa, confidence in our stability, both economically and physically, and in our security. We say to these interested parties that we welcome this. In our communications with Europe, it is going to become necessary for us to be able to communicate with those people in their own language, and that will be a good thing. If we have knowledge of an additional European language, it is not only in that particular country that doors will open to us. Indeed, many doors over the whole world are opened to us through a knowledge of French, Spanish, German or whatever language. I think it will be a good thing if we were to stress in our schools and educational institutions or wherever, that we South Africans, young and old, will concentrate on learning European languages in addition to the languages of Africa, which we either know or are learning. It opens the hearts and doors of those people and it promotes the interests of one&#x2019;s country when one is able to communicate with those people in their own languages.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s desire to give me fatherly advice and I accept it in the spirit in which it was given. However, I do think the hon. the Minister is far too sensitive. I merely said that I believe that it was a good thing for South Africa that the present hon. Minister was Minister of Foreign Affairs and not the hon. the Minister of Defence. I said this because I have a very high regard for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s ability in this specialist field. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I want to make this point quite clear. I have no desire to cause embarrassment nor do I derive any satisfaction from any embarrassment that might be caused to the hon. the Minister by referring in this House and elsewhere to the outbursts of the hon. the Minister of Defence. However, I have a duty when issues relative to the detente situation and to foreign affairs are raised to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister and this House to such matters. I do not believe that the outburst of the hon. the Minister of Defence in relation to an objective analysis of a certain Government document in this House the other day was conducive to good relations in Africa. I want to put this to the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs because I believe that he is objective and that he is backed by an objective department. I ask him, please, to take the Chapter in the &#x201C;Handleiding&#x201D; dealing with &#x201C;Bantoe-beleidsrigtings&#x201D;. He will see that it draws very heavily on policies being adopted in Angola and in Mozambique.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am trying to put something to the hon. the Minister. I hope he will accept it in an objective way. Here we have a &#x201C;Handleiding&#x201D; which draws considerable inferences from policies being applied in Mozambique and Angola and in Rhodesia. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to analyse this and to consult with the hon. the Minister of Defence in order to have it withdrawn. I maintain that it is out of date. To the extent that it constantly asserts that there is violence where there are Black majorities. I also believe it to be out of tune with the statements made by the hon. the Prime Minister who went to Liberia and said that in Rhodesia the Government should be a civilized government irrespective of race. I put it very seriously to the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs that he should examine this document and that he should ask the Department of Defence to withdraw the document and recast it in the spirit of the d&#x00E9;tente that has been initiated by the hon. the Prime Minister and by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the debate on this Vote generally has covered a wide field but there are still a number of issues on which I hope the hon. the Minister will give us some information when he speaks again. In the general outward movement of diplomacy there have been a significant number of new contacts which bring hopeful situations but which also bring some dangers. One of the countries that has adopted a disturbing attitude towards South Africa recently, if newspaper reports are to be believed, has been Japan. While there has been an improvement in relation to a significant number of countries, I am distressed to find that there has been a formal statement to the effect that in regard to visas for cultural, educational and scientific exchanges, Japan will no longer issue visas to South Africans. In relation to the international conference on nutrition visas for South Africans were withheld. At the same time the Foreign Minister of Japan has been in Africa and has said that it is the deliberate policy of his country gradually to withdraw from trading and business links with South Africa. We would like to know whether the Minister is aware of the situation and whether he has been in touch with the Japanese authorities both in relation to the question of visas for South Africans wishing to go to Japan and in connection with the stated intention of Japan&#x2019;s Foreign Minister to reduce her trade links with South Africa. I raise this because of the important motor-car industry and because of the importance of the export of iron ore and other base metals.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is increasing evidence of contacts between the South African Government and the Governments of a number of Arab States. This is quite clearly important for South Africa, both because of our location and the question of oil and because of the strategic position which the Arab States occupy in the whole international field. To the extent that it is our policy to have increased contacts with other States, we are in accord with it, but I would like to point out that we are now moving into an area of diplomacy which involves tremendous international tension. I would like the hon. the Minister to give this Committee the assurance that the contacts that we are having with the Arab States will in no way impair the traditional friendly relations which have existed between the South African Government and the State of Israel. I believe that this is perhaps an appropriate moment to suggest to the hon. the Minister an up-grading of the Consulate-General representation that we have in Tel Aviv. At the moment the State of Israel has ambassadorial representation in South Africa, whereas South Africa is merely represented by a consul-general. Is this not an appropriate time to upgrade our representation in Israel to either ministerial or ambassadorial level&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, on the question of Angola and Mozambique, we have had consulates during the Portuguese r&#x00E9;gime. This will continue in Mozambique until 25 June, and we have had a consulate in Angola until November. We would like to know whether the hon. the Minister has been in contact with the new interim r&#x00E9;gime in Mozambique with a view to seeing that we will continue to have this consular representation when Mozambique gets its full independence in only two months&#x2019; time. We believe that it is very important that this representation should continue. Mr. Chairman, there have also been a number of agreements between the Portuguese Government and the South <span class="col_4817-4818" refersTo="page_0822"/>African Government involving our relationship with Mozambique for as long as it was a province, but once it ceases to be a province there will be a number of matters which may have to renegotiated. We would like to know whether we can anticipate that successful negotiations with the new interim r&#x00E9;gime are likely to be concluded in such matters as the recruiting of mine labour. We would like to be reassured that the whole question of integrating the power from Cabora Bassa into the South African power grid will not suffer any setbacks. Then there is also the question of the continued use of Lourenco Marques as a harbour and a rail link to the Reef. There is the question of the trade agreement that we have had with Portugal, which has now been transferred to the new r&#x00E9;gime.</p>

<p>I think it is a matter of regret&#x2014;and I think the Minister will accept this&#x2014;that at this stage, at any rate, we have no formal representation in the three neighbouring Black territories&#x2014;Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland. I think it is a matter of regret that while Malawi, some 2 000 km to the north, is represented in South Africa, these three neighbouring territories are not. We would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether he is pursuing this matter, whether he is taking this seriously, and whether as a result of the new d&#x00E9;tente situation he believes that there is a possibility in the future of greater formal representation between South Africa and these three countries than has existed in the past.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, on the Rhodesian situation. Initiatives have been taken by the Prime Minister and by President Kaunda in order to bring people to the discussion table in Rhodesia itself. But I wonder whether the South African Government, either on its own or in association with other Governments, has considered what role it may play or could offer to play in a post-settlement period. This is important because there will be people in Rhodesia who will be concerned at the post-settlement situation, with the whole question of economic aid should there be a settlement and once the international boycott has been lifted, and whether South Africa had made offers to play a special role in providing economic aid and making capital available to Rhodesia to replenish some of the capital goods which have not been able to be replenished over the last 10 years. The second one is a defence agreement. Here the question is whether there is an offer or a suggestion of an offer that should the Rhodesian issue be resolved, South Africa together with other African territories bordering on Rhodesia would enter into a non-aggression pact, or whether we will agree to protect that country during a period of transition from any incursions from outside. I believe that it is important to d&#x00E9;tente exercise that not only should we bring people to the conference table too, but also that South Africa should indicate that if discussions reach the position where relationships are normalized, South Africa would do everything in its power to see that in the years that follow, Rhodesia would be enabled to recoup its economic situation and that minorities within that community will feel safe should there be any further terrorist attacks from outside.</p>

<p>Sir, there is of course a specific reason for the sensitivity displayed by the hon. member for Sea Point as regards the hon. the Minister of Defence; it is the fact that the hon. the Minister of Defence, without beating around the bush, spoke very seriously to that party which is represented in this House by the hon. member, concerning its standpoint in regard to subversion in South Africa. The hon. the Minister had good reason to andress that hon. party&#x2014;and I do not want to emphasize the word &#x201C;honourable&#x201D; too strongly&#x2014;because&#x2014;and I address these remarks to the hon. Leader so that he may take note of them&#x2014;the hon. member for Pinelands made a speech from his back-bench last year which was calculated to be theological and Christian justification for naked pacifism, and this after the conference at Hammanskraal, which, by that time had already become notorious. There was a reason why the hon. Minister of Defence had to speak to that party in regard to its standpoint in connection with the security of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. P. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Sea Point also referred here to certain organizations concerning themselves with the interests of Rhodesia. It is not my aim to concern myself with the domestic and political affairs of Rhodesia, but the hon. member referred to certain organizations and he mentioned certain names. He mentioned Sascon. I myself <span class="col_4819-4820" refersTo="page_0823"/>have studied a publication issued by Sascon and after taking note of its contents, came to the conclusion that I did not want to be associated with it in any way. I do not want to be associated with that organization. But the hon. member for Sea Point, lacking adequate discretion, went ahead and included a number of names, and here he dragged in by the hair no less a person than Dr. Koot Vorster, in the same breath as the Herstigtes and others of the extreme right. Sir, in this instance he dragged in a man who is very highly respected in clerical circles and in cultural circles, a man whom I have the privilege of calling my personal friend. He is not in a position to defend himself in this House. Not that I think that he needs to be defended; he is quite capable of doing so himself&#x2014;in fact, he can do so better than I.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I think that for the sake of the record something should be said about this here. I say that it reveals a certain lack of discretion when someone is simply dragged in here forcibly and associated with extreme rightists. From what point of view are extreme rightists attacked in this House&#x003F; I have to take it that at least those who are to the left of that right, and possibly also left of centre, do so. Sir, as far as Dr. Koot Vorster is concerned, I just want to tell the hon. member for Sea Point that he is definitely not leftist. In the second place, he is definitely not a friend of communists and he is definitely not a person about whom there is doubt concerning his standpoint on subversive activities in South Africa. I also want to say of him that he is a person who is definitely senstive to any onslaught being made from the left on the spirit of people and particularly on the spirit of a people and the will of a people. He is definitely sensitive to that. It was against that background that he paid a visit to Rhodesia.</p>

<p>I want the hon. member for Sea Point to call to mind again something that he knows. This is in regard to a certain degree of involvement with Rhodesia on the part of people in South Africa. We have a very strong cultural and religious involvement with a great many people in Rhodesia. If we do not interfere in the political sphere, and this is our definite policy as stated and faultlessly carried out by our hon. Prime Minister, there is no doubt that cultural links exist over the Limpopo across the political borders. What is wrong with that&#x003F; There are religious links, too, and what is wrong with that&#x003F; The point I want to make is that owing to the links that exist, discussions take place repeatedly. If we get people coming here from the Netherlands owing to the cultural links with people in that country&#x2014;cultural links that are sometimes extremely embarrassing to us&#x2014;then no one complains about that. These people often come and say things in South. Africa which we do not like. Prof. Vercuiel was here and he said: &#x201C;Breekt de muren af.&#x201D; (Break down the walls). We had him climb over the wall to come to South Africa. I do not know whether he will be so eager to return here, because it is possible that he might be tarred and feathered. Nevertheless the point I want to make is that a man like Koot Vorster went to Rhodesia against that background to meet our people. He met many people besides merely the ordinary John Citizen; he also met people in high places.</p>

<p>In any event, he was not engaged in underground matters. Against this background I think we should be careful not to do what is popular in certain circles, viz. simply to deal out blows to rightists while we can identify a few rightists as being opposed to the Government as well as to the Progressive Party. We must be careful not to group certain people with rightist opinions together with others and then want to put them all against a wall and shoot them.</p>

<p>Surely, too, the background of the matter is, firstly, that there have been voices in South Africa urging that South Africa should dissociate itself from Rhodesia. In saying that, they do not mean that South Africa should only dissociate itself as regards religion and culture, but politically too, and that Rhodesia should stew in its own juice. There were such voices, that described Rhodesia as a stumbling block for South Africa and as a stumbling block for the d&#x00E9;tente policy of our hon. Prime Minister. The standpoint adopted by our hon. Prime Minister and his actions in regard to Rhodesia, and similarly as regards other states in Africa, attest to the fact that we do not have a negative attitude towards Rhodesia nor do we want to use it against other countries in Africa, but we do not want to be written off as people who want to leave Rhodesia in the lurch or want to condemn it as a stumbling block in these discussions concerning d&#x00E9;tente politics.</p>

<p>There is a further factor which we must take into account as background to our <span class="col_4821-4822" refersTo="page_0824"/>discussions concerning a country like Rhodesia, viz. the existence of inherent situations that make matters extremely difficult for those people who have religious and cultural links with us. I want to say at once that this does not apply to White people only, but to a large number of Black people, too, who, through the ministrations of the Afrikaans churches from South Africa, have been converted to the Christian faith. The interests of those people, too, are a matter of major importance to us.</p>

<p>The reason for mentioning this is the fact that there are factors in Rhodesia that make matters extremely difficult for these people and that cause us to view the developments in that country with, a great deal of interest. If&#x2014; as is the case at the moment&#x2014;it is the position that an organization like Zanu has in fact no intention of associating itself with peaceful negotiations with the Government or anyone else, then these are the matters we have to consider, because then there are people who have cultural and religious links with us in South Africa, and who are involved in a situation of this kind. If it is true that 38 people have been killed since the ceasefire in December, and that the murder of those people can be laid at the door of an organization in Rhodesia, then these are matters which engage not merely our vague interest, but which cause us to be extremely concerned and worried.</p>

<p>There is another matter we could take note of. Before I come to that, it may be interesting to refer to the statement issued by the presiding officer of the special court in Rhodesia&#x2014;a statement which hon. members have probably also had the opportunity of looking at&#x2014;in which reference is made to the aims of Zanu. The final clause of the statement of unity issued by Zanu together with other movements reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The leaders recognize the inevitability of continued armed struggle and all other forms of struggle until total liberation of Zimbabwe.</block>

<p>This, therefore, is an organization that has committed itself to armed struggle, and it is as a result of this that since December, the date when this document was published, there have been 38 murders&#x2014;a few Whites, but the majority non-Whites. What is important is that our involvement in Rhodesia is proved by the fact that our Police are there and are there for the sake of Rhodesia and the mutual interests of South Africa and Rhodesia.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into detail, because we have put it clearly that we are not interfering in Rhodesia&#x2019;s domestic affairs, but we have also said, so that the world may know, that South Africa and Rhodesia have often conferred together. South Africa and Rhodesia have given each other advice in the past. From time to time we have considered everyday realities. We have made contact with Black African states, and Rhodesia has been involved in that. However, we all accept that Rhodesia is not a country subordinate to any other country. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that you want to tell me that my time is up. I think I have said enough and I thank you.</p>

<speech by="#enthoven">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to react to the speech of the hon. member for Waterberg save to say that I do not think that he really understands the tremendous change which is taking place in the attitudes in Africa over, let us say, the last nine years. UDI and the revolution in Portugal are two tremendous watersheds in our political history and I think one day that when historians write about this period of history they will accord these two instances a tremendous significance. UDI was a White reaction against the increasing decolonialization at that time. That is why that was important. The revolution in Portugal was the final death-knell of colonialization in Southern Africa. In this period of nine short years, attitudes not only throughout the whole of Africa, but here in South Africa as well, have changed radically. The hon. the Minister has been Minister of Foreign Affairs throughout that whole period and I think he will agree that there has been a tremendous change in attitudes during this period. In order to analyse that change of attitude one has to look at Hansard at the time of UDI to see the way we were then thinking in South Africa. If one does this one finds it quite a fascinating experience, because one can see the extent to which we have revolutionized our thinking on African affairs. If one goes back to the debates of 1966, just after UDI was declared, one sees how frightened&#x2014;I think <span class="col_4823-4824" refersTo="page_0825"/>this is the correct word to use&#x2014;we in South Africa were of this whole process of decolonialization. I want to quote two passages to indicate how White South Africans were thinking at the time. The then Prime Minister, the late Dr. Verwoerd, reacted to a suggestion that the Government was not interested in the Whites of Rhodesia and said the following during the no-confidence debate in 1966:</p>

<block name="quote">Would we not be aware of the advantages to South Africa if a solution to this problem could be found in which the White man retained his supremacy, we who were always the foremost fighters for the supremacy of the White man&#x003F;</block>

<p>Then he went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">How dare anyone try to impress upon the public of South Africa that we believe such people to be expendable&#x003F;</block>

<p>Then let us take a quote from what the hon. Leader of the Opposition said during the same period, while discussing the same crisis of that time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, do you realize &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was talking about the consequences if the Rhodesian Government were to collapse&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that we would have militant Nationalism across the river from Messina&#x003F; Do you realize that both Angola and Mozambique would be out-flanked and we would be weakened&#x003F; Do you realize that we would be in the position against which Gen. Smuts warned so often that the frontiers of the West would have been rolled back to the Limpopo River&#x003F; When I say these things, I am vividly reminded &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he goes on to discuss the speech of Harold Macmillan, the famous &#x201C;winds&#x201D; of &#x201C;change&#x201D; speech. I think these two speeches illustrate the thinking that was generally held throughout the whole of the White electorate, there was a tremendous fear. Our whole policy and our whole attitude to Africa was an introverted one. It was controlled by fear. We were frightened of what was going to happen and we had very little trust in any form of decolonialization and any Black Government then present or which we expected to come in the future. Our attitude today is absolutely, completely and totally different. We have heard it in this debate. The attitude of South Africa today is very forward-looking and outward-looking as against the fear and the tremendous trepidations that we had then. Today I think we can look forward with a certain amount of confidence to our future in Africa. I think that we have realized&#x2014;in fact, it has been stated in this House many times during the course of this debate&#x2014;that our future is in Africa and that we are of Africa. I think that the whole d&#x00E9;tente programme is the exact opposite of the feelings that existed at that time. We were then frightened of what was going to happen in the future. Now I think there is a great degree of positiveness in what we see in the future. We see a tremendous advantage for us at the end of the rainbow and it is not a matter of sacrificing A or of sacrificing B or of having to do a deal with A or B. It is simply a complete change of circumstances and a change of attitude. And it is not only we in South Africa who have changed our attitude, but also other people in other States of Africa. Everybody is realizing that the necessities of this situation demand d&#x00E9;tente and the success of d&#x00E9;tente. We do have problems, and I think that these problems we must expect, because it is unrealistic to expect us to go through this total revolution without experiencing problems. I want to say that I am absolutely confident that we will see this through. The stakes are too high no to. At the present moment we, like other States in Africa, are groping with the changed circumstances, because we are getting contact and the feel of it. As we have been through this tremendous revolution over the last nine years, I am quite sure that we are going to go through another revolution over the next four or five years. It is not something that we can determine now how we shall deal with it. But I think there are certain things which we have all accepted by the Government and by everybody in this House and by everybody in Africa<i>&#x2014;inter alia,</i> that in the new dispensation there can be no room for race discrimination. We have made that public, and we also have to work for the concept of equal opportunity for everybody. That is generally well known. Thirdly we believe&#x2014;and I think that we have seen the success of it&#x2014;that problems have to be solved in South Africa, in Southern Africa, by the people who are concerned with <span class="col_4825-4826" refersTo="page_0826"/>those problems without any undue influence from any outside party. I would agree absolutely with the hon. the Prime Minister where he says that it is absolute nonsense to suggest that there has been any interference by South Africa in how Rhodesia must sort out its problems. It is totally against the way the whole situation is unfolding in Africa today.</p>

<p>In the few minutes which are still available to me, I would like to mention a few words about the problems which we have recently experienced with Lesotho. I think that whilst we probably have reason to be disappointed at the recent attitude of Lesotho, there are, nevertheless, very logical reasons for this, and if we look at the reasons and are prepared to do something about them, we can not only improve our relations with Lesotho, but also perhaps pre-warn ourselves about other problems which we might experience with our other Black neighbours in Southern Africa. The first thing that we have to understand about Lesotho is that it is a very poor country and that the unemployment is enormously high&#x2014;probably 400 000 out of a million people are unemployed in Lesotho.</p>

<p>About half of the working population of Lesotho has to get work opportunities in South Africa. This is a situation for the foreseeable future, because there is very little chance of it changing. There are two things that upset Lesotho. In the first place they feel, rightly or wrongly&#x2014;it does not really matter which&#x2014;that they are being discriminated against in South Africa and that they are not treated with the respect which they should get. In the second place, they either have to starve in Lesotho or work in South Africa. If that is the problem which we have with Lesotho, it is possible that we shall experience the same problem, and to a greater extent even, with our other Black neighbouring States. Is it not in our interest to get to the key of this problem by entering into negotiations with the Lesotho Government to find out how they feel we should behave towards their nationals in South Africa, to find out what they think the problems are and how these can be bettered&#x003F; I think the position should be put across to them that we are against discrimination based on race, that we are for equal opportunities, that we do believe in consultation to solve our problems and that we are sympathetic to the very real problems which they have especially in regard to the treatment of their nationals in South Africa as against our treatment of German, Swiss or Dutch nationals. If we show that we are prepared to deal with this problem and if, in fact, we do get to grips with it, I feel that not only will we be doing ourselves a service in our relations with Lesotho, but we will also be doing ourselves a service by planning ahead for problems which we could possibly have to deal with in the case of the other neighbouring Black States.

<p>Everything we tried to do, they disparaged in the eyes of the outside world. They created an image of us which we now have to attempt to rectify through d&#x00E9;tente. How I had to sit here and listen to it! I am speaking emphatically today, because it bothers me that they now want to give the impression that it is really they who are responsible for the fact that we are now at last on the road to d&#x00E9;tente. Listening to them, one has to believe that they were really the initiators of d&#x00E9;tente. They accused us of being racists and we hear those words in Addis Ababa, Dar-es-Salaam and at the U.N. We are supposedly racists now. But that is their creation. In fact, they went so far as to say that we were a reckless gang. I think that that is in Hansard. They said that it was an irresponsible gang that was governing here. In this way they gradually created an image of South Africa that gave rise to an impossible situation for us. It is not only the Opposition that I want to call to account today, but the members of the Press sitting up there in the gallery, too. They should not wish, today, to conceal the role they have played in this regard, because we shall not forget it. They must be called to account. Already I can say that as I know some of them, as soon as d&#x00E9;tente gets into difficulties, they will throw overboard the soft attitude they are displaying towards us today and once again pull out all the stops against us. I predict this.</p>

<p>What is going on in Africa&#x003F; I want to mention the conference at Addis Ababa for one reason only and from it I want to seek a reason. What is going in Africa&#x003F; In February of this year, 42 Ministers convened in Addis Ababa. While they were convened there the sound of artillery between Eritrea and Ethiopia could be heard and human beings were being slaughtered. Human beings are being slaughtered in Uganda. In Equatorial Guinea, Nkwema has already slaughtered, killed about 10% of his people. They do not utter a word about that. While they are sitting there, a drought of extreme proportions is being experienced in West and East Africa as a result of which millions&#x2014;man and beast &#x2014;are dying. They are sitting there while Africa battles with a monetary emergency because while they are sitting there, the increased oil prices and the oil crisis are strangling their economies. The Arab-Israeli conflict is in progress. But they do not say a word about those things. In February 1975, at Addis Ababa, not a word was spoken about the problems in Africa. But South Africa is tackled. All I want to ask is: Why is that&#x003F; What is going on&#x003F; Why is South Africa&#x2019;s system&#x2014;its social order, its economic system and its capitalistic system of thought in which its economic and social order function&#x2014;picked out&#x003F; Why are we unable to make a breakthrough with the truth&#x003F; What is going on&#x003F; Is our diplomacy of unalignedness wrong&#x003F; Is our type of diplomacy, maintaining of a low profile, wrong&#x003F; Does the fault lie in our diplomatic method&#x003F; No, it cannot lie in our method, because, as revealed in Africa, in the states of Africa, in Addis Ababa and Dar-es-Salaam and as it started elsewhere in 1955, their method is demonstrative, agitative and militant. As against a demonstrative, agitative militant and growing nationalism one has, after all, to maintain a low profile diplomacy and unalignedness. We have no choice. My reply, therefore, is: No, it does not lie in our method of conducting diplomacy. We must remain unaligned. We must maintain a low profile in conducting our diplomatic affairs. We may not be demonstrative, we may not be militant, nor may we be agitative. We must anchor our diplomacy to what we cannot escape. Our diplomacy, as it is conducted today, has deep roots. Africa is seeking diplomacy. Africa is seeking a method in their diplomacy that they have not yet found. A new personality is developing in Africa. It is not the personality that existed under colonial management. It is free of that. What did that colonial period mean to Africa&#x003F; I have said this repeatedly because I think that it is of the essence of the matter. The colonial period in Africa implied poverty, ignorance, pestilence, exploitation and despoliation. And then they left Africa and <span class="col_4829-4830" refersTo="page_0828"/>that was the heritage of the Black men in Africa. That is how he sees the White man. And then we remain, the last remains of a Western civilization that has passed through Jerusalem, Athens and through Rome. It passed through the dark ages &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, while fully realizing the delicacy of the matter, I nevertheless want to put forward a few facts on this occasion in order to underline the correctness in international law of the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to South West Africa.</p>

<p>In his original proposal to the Peace Conference after the conclusion of the First World War, Gen. Smuts called the mandate system as embodied in section 22 of the Charter of the League of Nations &#x201C;a temporary expedient&#x201D;, which he regarded as a &#x201C;stepping-stone towards self-government and self-determination&#x201D;. Nevertheless, neither in section 22 of the Charter of the League of Nations nor in the Mandate for South West Africa itself were any arrangements made for termination of the mandate. No indication was given of the method in which the envisaged &#x201C;self-government and self-determination&#x201D; were to be brought about. In addition, no instructions in this regard were given to mandataries during the existence of the League of Nations. As long as the requirements of the mandate in regard to the furtherance of the material and moral welfare and the social progress of the population of the mandate were complied with, the realization of the aims of section 22 were left to the administrative originality of the mandataries.</p>

<p>When the League of Nations was terminated and the United Nations Organization brought into being, most of the mandataries, as is known, subjected the various mandate territories to the trustee system for which the United Nations Charter makes provision. However, as far back as during the San Francisco Conference in 1945 and in the subsequent meetings of the Preparatory Commission, and during the first part of the first meeting of the General Assembly in London in 1946, the South African representative reserved his Government&#x2019;s legal position in regard to South West Africa and referred to his Government&#x2019;s intention of consulting the population of South West Africa as regards the future form of government of the territory.</p>

<p>As a result of this consultation, which did in fact take place subsequently, notice was given during the last meeting of the League of Nations assembly in April 1946 of the intention of the Union Government to put its case, during the subsequent meeting of the General Assembly of the U.N., for the incorporation of South West Africa in the Union, in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of the populations of the territory. In the meantime the Union Government was to continue to administer the territory in terms of the Mandate.</p>

<p>The proposal of the Union Government to incorporate the territory in the Union was in fact submitted during the second part of the first meeting of the General Assembly, but the General Assembly rejected the proposal and recommended that the territory be placed under the trust system of U.N., and in addition called on the Union Government to submit a trust agreement in regard to the territory. The point of view of the majority of the members of the U.N. on that occasion was that the indigenous population was not mature enough, politically speaking, to hold such views. Whether what they asked for would have been in their interests was clearly of no importance to certain members of the U.N. Consequently the Union Government adopted the standpoint that it was not legally obliged to submit a trust agreement and that it would continue to administer the territory in the spirit of the Mandate. Even after the International Court in 1950 found in an Advisory Opinion that South Africa was not, in fact, under an obligation to conclude a trust agreement with the U.N. as regards South West Africa, since 1946 continuous pressure has been exerted on the South African Government by the U.N. to place South West Africa under the trust system. However, the standpoint of the Government&#x2014;and I say this in all humility&#x2014;has quite rightly remained essentially unchanged on this score. But, Sir, let us take a closer look at the trust system of the U.N. for a moment. If we refer to the Charter of the U.N. and consider the provisions of section 76 thereof, we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The basic objectives of the trusteeship system, in accordance with the purposes of the United Nations laid down in article 1 of the present Charter, shall be, <i>inter alia,</i> to promote the political, economic, social and educational advancement <span class="col_4831-4832" refersTo="page_0829"/>of the inhabitants of the trust territories and their progressive development towards self-government or independence &#x2026;</block>

<p>and then, and this is very important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned.</block>

<p>On closer analysis, therefore, Mr. Chairman, it is evident that the aim of the trust system of the U.N. is also to lead the populations of the trust territories in question towards self-government or independence; that recognition be granted to the fact that the specific circumstances of the various trust territories do in fact differ, and that these differences must be taken into account in their progress towards self-government or independence. In conclusion, reference is made to &#x201C;each territory and its peoples&#x201D; and &#x201C;the wishes of the peoples concerned&#x201D;&#x2014;a recognition, therefore, of the fact that various peoples or national groups may reside within a specific trust territory.</p>

<p>What do we find when we test the Government&#x2019;s declared policy, as repeatedly stated by the hon. the Prime Minister and as expounded, too, in a statement made to the U.N. by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 12 December 1973&#x003F; I quote it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that it is for the inhabitants of South West Africa to decide their own future. Neither the South African Government nor the United Nations should enforce solutions on them from the outside. In the meantime the South African Government will continue with its efforts to assist them on the road to self-determination.</block>

<p>Sir, I say that when one sets this policy against the aims of section 22 of the Charter of the League of Nations, against the Mandate for South West Africa and even against the aims of the trust system of the U.N., then it is clear that it is fully in accordance with them. We know too, that a great deal of progress has already been made, and is still being made, as regards the implementation of this policy.</p>

<p>The decision of the Security Council dated 17 December last year, in terms of which it was demanded, <i>inter alia,</i> that South Africa should immediately cease its so-called illegal administration of South West Africa and, what is more with the aid of the U.N., hand over power to the people of Namibia, is therefore an unfounded, unacceptable and premature decision and, above all, anything but in the interests of the various peoples and national groups of this territory. No, Sir, there is only one correct policy that can be followed in regard to South West Africa, and that is the policy that has consistently been followed, and is still being followed, by this Government.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member for Mossel Bay will forgive me if I do not react to what he said, as I want to complete the argument I raised in the House last night. I was referring to the situation in the Indian Ocean, and I described how an initiative by Sir Alec Douglas Home to create a security system in the area by appealing to India, Mauritius and Sri Lanka, fell on deaf ears at that time. Sir, concern was growing nevertheless in the Indian Ocean area, I think very largely in consequence of the fact that it was then known that it was definite policy to re-open the Suez Canal, and the re-opening of the Suez Canal was obviously going to make it far easier for the Russian fleet already in the Indian Ocean in that it would bring them closer to their home bases, give them greater accessibility and allow them particularly easy access to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. It was at that time also that Sir Alec Douglas Home approached the Prime Minister of Mauritius and expressed concern about a technical agreement which Mauritius had entered into with Russia under which considerable facilities were to be given to the Russian fishing fleets. The Prime Minister of Mauritius said that he saw no harm in this agreement, that it was of a purely technical nature, and he said he would be prepared to offer a base in Mauritius, at Diego Garcia, to the British for use in order to re-establish an equilibrium in the area.</p>

<p>Sir, it was also in 1970, in September of that year, that the Lusaka conference of non-aligned States took place where they formalized a concept which was known as the &#x201C;zone of peace&#x201D; in the Indian Ocean. The resolution called upon all States to consider and respect the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace from which all great power <span class="col_4833-4834" refersTo="page_0830"/>rivalries and competition as well as bases conceived in the context of such rivalries and competition&#x2014;either army, naval or air force bases&#x2014;are excluded. The area should also be free from nuclear weapons. This proposal was one which was generally supported by all the States which attended that conference but it became clear that there was a major difference in approach particularly between India on the one hand and Sri Lanka on the other. They were both strongly opposed to the entry of American forces into the Indian Ocean. However, India had entered into a treaty with Russia in 1971, which appeared to establish a kind of axis between Delhi and Moscow. There was a good deal of concern that the creation of this axis would in fact introduce a degree of preference for Russian ships in the Indian Ocean and it was Sri Lanka which felt that this particular threat brought with it the further danger that there would be an increased British and American presence in order to balance the situation. India on the other hand took the view that the treaty which they had entered into with the Soviet Union was entirely a peaceful one. It dealt with mutual consultations regarding attacks or threats in the Indian Ocean and appropriate and effective measures to ensure peace. The situation has developed along these lines and there is no doubt that there is a very large naval presence in the Indian Ocean. One cannot disregard the build-up that is going on. At this stage it seems perhaps, historically speaking, too late to return to the idea of a peace zone in the Indian Ocean. It seems impractical to think of the possibility that all these ships may be withdrawn and the area declared a zone of peace. What would perhaps be the best solution is that there be some kind of balance between composite forces in order that, at the very least, peace may be maintained by a kind of deadlock, a kind of equilibrium. From the South African point of view, I think this is perhaps the best solution. What I have given is a very brief summary of the situation which has arisen in the Indian Ocean in recent years. I believe that this is an area which is of the utmost importance and an area which is deserving of the most active efforts by our diplomacy because, as I mentioned earlier, there are 26 coastal States around the Indian Ocean. Some of these are important States. There are countries which have enormous interests. Japan, for example, though it is not one of these coastal States, has enormous interests in the sea-lanes through the Indian Ocean. Then there are also Australia and Iran, and various countries along the African littoral. Then, of course, there is India itself, Burma and other States, all of which have a concern in maintaining peace in this area. When I suggested that this was a vertile field for South African diplomacy, I was not suggesting that this was something that had been left undone or neglected. I believe it is a new task of enormous proportions and enormous difficulties. As I said at the beginning, I believe that we have a ministry of Foreign Affairs which has quite considerable talents. A task of this gravity and a task of this difficulty is one which deserves the attention of that department as a new task of diplomacy. There are certain areas of co-operation in respect of which we in South Africa are excluded from the international scene because our interest is no more than a general or universal one. There are other areas where we have special claims because we have a particular geographic or other interest. One has in mind, for example, an area like Antarctica where South Africa does participate because of, amongst other reasons, its proximity to the Antarctic continent. There are questions such as international nuclear safeguards where South Africa&#x2019;s interests cannot be disregarded because South Africa is the possessor of uranium and of advanced technology. I believe that the Indian Ocean is another area where South Africa&#x2019;s presence is essential, where it has a right to participate, and in respect of which nobody can reject advances on a topic which is of such obvious importance to the coastal States of the Indian Ocean. Therefore I believe that the Indian Ocean is indeed a fertile area for our diplomacy. It is an area in which we have a natural right to participate and an area in which we can make a major contribution, not only in our own interests and in the defence of South Africa, but also in creating a zone of peace, of freedom, not necessarily through the withdrawal of all maritime forces, but through the maintenance of a degree of equilibrium in this area to the benefit of all countries which surround this critical strategic area of the world.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Von Brandis made three contributions during this debate, two of which, which, were very important, concerned the U.N. The hon. member for Brentwood <span class="col_4835-4836" refersTo="page_0831"/>discussed the same subject and also made a sound contribution. The hon. the Minister has already replied in that regard. While I was listening to that, the idea occurred to me that our foreign policy and all the aims we are striving towards are, in my opinion, outstanding ones and fully in accordance with all the finest and most lofty ideals of the international community. I admit, of course, as the hon. member for Brentwood has also done, that there are certain indications and there is a certain amount of proof that the U.N., particularly at certain sessions of this organization, has deviated from its Charter to a certain extent and that members have not always kept to the praiseworthy resolutions of the original architects of that fine organization. Nevertheless, when I read this charter, I believe that it embodies certain principles and aims that really compel my admiration and which, in my opinion, are indispensable to world peace, to the establishment of orderly and peaceful relations between countries and so as to assist developing countries to a certain degree. What I find particularly striking is the remarkable correspondence between the principles and the aims of this charter of the U.N. and the principles and aims of our own foreign and even domestic policy. To support my statement, I want to quote from section 1 of the charter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To maintain international peace and security, and to that end to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace; and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of peace, and to bring about, by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice in international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.</block>

<p>That is precisely what we are trying to achieve through our foreign policy. This is particularly the case when we consider that the hon. the Prime Minister has extended his hand to African states and offered to conclude a non-aggression treaty with each of them. This shows that we as a White nation have no urge for conquest and that we have no desire to act as aggressors. Section 1(2) of the charter reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.</block>

<p>Here the word &#x201C;self-determination&#x201D; is emphasized. This is a lofty aim of this international organization and I want to say here without contradiction that it is also the lofty and comprehensive aim of our domestic policy, of our relations policy, to place these people&#x2014;in the charter the word &#x201C;peoples&#x201D; is also emphasized&#x2014;on the path of development on which they can realize all their potentialities. We guide them towards self-realization and towards eventual self-determination. I also want to quote from section 73A, the definition of the principle of trusteeship. This is of particular significance in regard to the implementation of our policy here in our country and in South West Africa. I quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To ensure the true respect for the culture and peoples concerned and their political, economic, social and educational advancement, their just treatment and their protection against abuses, to develop self-government, to take due account of the political aspirations of the people and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions according to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and their various stages of advancement.</block>

<p>It is very clear to me that if I am not mistaken, this charter elsewhere describes the principle of trusteeship as &#x201C;a sacred trust&#x201D;, as a very valuable pledge entrusted to us. It is virtually a calling to us as a White nation in respect of the non-White nations and if one considers the terminology, then it is the same terminology that reflects our relations policy, too, to a large extent, because the principle of trusteeeship comprizes nothing but our policy of autonomous development. We are dealing with the historical situation in South Africa, where a certain philosophy has developed, viz. the policy of trusteeship as a relationship between us as a White nation and the wards, the non-White nations, which are entrusted to us as a &#x201C;sacred trust&#x201D;. We are doing exactly as the U.N. says. To be specific, we take into account the profound, underlying, ethnic, cultural civilizations and differences in development, do we not&#x003F; To a large extent, trusteeship depends on the position as regards economic and political <span class="col_4837-4838" refersTo="page_0832"/>power while, we, on the other hand, take into account the profound differences. This is the sociological basis. At the same time we are also the bearers of the Christian religion. The hon. member for Pinetown who is looking at me like that, now reminds me that when he stood there &#x2026;</p>

<p>Pinelands &#x2026; he said that we were shackling certain people and put this forward as if our policy of trusteeship were something permanent. No, it is not permanent. However it is temporary, and that is what is so outstanding about our policy. The hon. member can see, therefore, that he has an entirely mistaken image, because it is our policy that is in harmony with the sections concerned in the Charter.</p>

<p>What about the hon. member for Waterberg&#x003F; The hon. member should rather concern himself with the water at Sea Point, because there is a bit of hot water there that you have landed in. [Interjections.] I want to put it very clearly today that we believe in an international organization. I am one of those people who believes that we should do everything in our power to remain a member of this international organization. I am in agreement with, the hon. member for Brentwood in that he pointed out the deficiencies. However, what is lacking in this organization is the necessary attitude, because whereas we are dealing with a world that is today going through the greatest and most difficult period as regards human, race and national relationships, there must be an international organization that can neutralize the shocks between nations. If one wants a new mechanism of this nature to function smoothly, then the correct attitude is the oil, but such an attitude is unfortunately lacking today. We sincerely hope, therefore, that this fine organization will be reviewed once again. We established it after the Second World War, because we were afraid of a third world holocaust. We were afraid that civilization would exterminate itself. It was then that a new world order came into being and the U.N. was established. South Africa itself was one of the architects of this international organization, and consequently I hope that they will not make it impossible for South Africa to remain a member. After all, it is not only in regard to our own people that we have a calling, and surely it is not only in the African context that we must see South Africa. We are part of the world, too, and it is not only here on the altar of our own people that we must make a contribution. We must also make a contribution on the altar of humanity. We must also think in international terms, and consequently we must have an international organization which I could perhaps call the meeting place of the world where there can be an exchange of ideas, where there can be consultation, where countries can learn to know each other, in order that an attitude may develop from this which will enable us to achieve the fine, lofty ideals harboured by such an organization and which were at the time expected of the League of Nations, too, of the Kellogg Treaty and now the United Nations as well, viz. to maintain peace and at the same time to bring about orderly and peaceful relations between all the States and to assist under-developed peoples. To show how right the hon. member for Brentwood was, let us consider the reaction of Mr. Scali, the representative of the United States. Mr. Chairman, Has my time expired&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have reached the conclusion of the debate and consequently there is only time for me to reply to the few speeches in which reference was made to us. I can <span class="col_4839-4840" refersTo="page_0833"/>agree with the hon. member for Carletonville to a certain extent that we are at present living in a world in which there is very little interest in what kind of government a specific country has, whether it is a dictatorship, or whatever other form of government it may be, because all the attention is concentrated on human rights. This is the problem we have to cope with today. Before the Second World War the White man dominated the entire world&#x2014; including Asia and the whole of Africa&#x2014; but after the war a radical change occurred. The entire Black and Yellow world became liberated and developed a sensitiveness, and today the attention is focused on two things in particular. The one is opposition to colonialism and the other is opposition to racism. All the Western countries are faced with that opposition, and therefore there is no conspiracy against South Africa alone. All the countries which, in the eyes of the majority in the world, are guilty of colonialism and racism, are in the dog-box. That is precisely the situation in which we find ourselves, and unless we, like the other countries, are able to get away from what is seen&#x2014;I stress the word &#x201C;seen&#x201D;&#x2014; as colonialism in our control over South West Africa, and are able to get away from racism&#x2014;which the rest of the world regards apartheid to be&#x2014;we will continue to be in trouble. In a nutshell then: This is the situation we must face up to.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterkloof put certain questions in regard to Rhodesia. I must say that I was surprised that he put these questions, for we on this side adopt the attitude that this is a particularly delicate matter and that consequently we should not go into it too deeply. What I drew attention to when I was speaking was that if the negotiations in Rhodesia should happen to fail and this is, as is being envisaged, followed by a resumption of terrorist activities, and these develop into a large-scale guerrilla attack with the support of the OAU, then we, with our Police there, are involved. My standpoint is that we will then be faced with a very critical decision, for we know what large-scale terrorist activities mean, of what long duration they are and how difficult it is to put an end to them without their spreading over the entire continent of Africa.</p>

<p>I drew attention to that, and now the hon. member for Waterkloof has asked what our standpoint is. The policy of the Government at present, as I understand it, is that it will withdraw the South African Police as soon as there is a cease-fire. However, this is the extent to which the Government was candid with Parliament. The Government has not yet told us what its policy will be in case there is no cease-fire. We on this side do not know whether we are under an obligation to Rhodesia to remain there. If that is the case, what is the nature of that obligation&#x003F; Therefore the hon. member should not put those questions to us.</p>

<p>These are questions which he should put to his own side, for his party is in office. If we become involved in a large-scale guerrilla war over the affairs of Rhodesia, I ask further: What will our motivation be if we are involved in it&#x003F; Will our motivation be to try to maintain the <i>status quo</i> there&#x003F; Is that going to be the motivation&#x003F; The declared policy of Mr. Smith is majority government. Majority government is the official standpoint of Mr. Smith. He explains it by saying that he does not stand for White majority government or Black majority government; he stands for the principle of majority government on the basis of equal merit. What will the Government&#x2019;s notivation then be if we were to become involved in large scale antiguerrilla activities in Rhodesia&#x003F; [Interjections.] I repeat that we regard this matter as being a very delicate situation, particularly now, when there is a possibility of negotiations. Now the hon. member for Waterkloof is asking questions of this kind. If there is one side which has the right to put these questions to the Government, then it is our side, and not the hon. member for Waterkloof.</p>

<p>If we had had the information on what obligations the Government has, and what its motivation would be if it were to remain, there is no doubt at all that we would express our opinions in this regard. It is for the Government to decide whether it will reply to the questions raised by the hon. member for Waterkloof.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said I am sensitive about the use of the word &#x201C;non-White&#x201D;. I think the hon. the Minister missed the point entirely. We are in fact using the word &#x201C;non-White&#x201D; internally, but I do not think we want to continue to do so. I think we have reached a stage where we want to try to get away from that <span class="col_4841-4842" refersTo="page_0834"/>term as well. There were times when we used the word &#x201C;Kaffir&#x201D; in this Parliament, but we stopped using it. The words &#x201C;Native&#x201D; and &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; have been used here, and today we are using the word &#x201C;Black man&#x201D;. Even the Coloureds object to the word &#x201C;Coloureds&#x201D;. They do not object as strongly to the word &#x201C;Brown man&#x201D;. But we must realize that the word &#x201C;non-White&#x201D; is negative. It has the connotation of a &#x201C;non-person&#x201D; and of White superiority, and it is attracting unfavourable attention overseas. That is why I told the hon. the Minister that although we are still struggling to find another word as far as our own usage at home is concerned&#x2014;and I think we shall have to find one; there is no doubt about that&#x2014;I do not think it is sensible to use the word &#x201C;non-White&#x201D; conspicuously in publications which are intended for overseas consumption, and which are in fact intended for the attention of the United Nations. That was my point. I repeat that it is being seen as an example of White superiority. It is regarded as another word for &#x201C;non-person&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also referred to South West Africa and said that he could not prescribe to the people there. Sir, no one is asking that we should prescribe to them. The entire concept of self-determination is counter to prescription. Self-determination means that a decision is taken by the people themselves. Our side was in fact the first to advocate the idea of self-determination for South West Africa. We did so long before the Government. Therefore we are not advocating that we should prescribe to South West Africa in regard to what is to happen to it. However, we must bear in mind that we are the administering power. We have the responsibility in the outside world in regard to the future of South West Africa. We have the final responsibility, and we shall have to help solve that problem. We cannot simply leave it to the people, for the machinery has not yet been created. We have to create the machinery which will make it possible for the people of South West Africa to implement self-determination. That was the point I submitted to the Minister.</p>

<p>There is no machinery for that purpose. Sir, I could put questions to that hon. member to which I am certain he would not be able to reply. There is considerable ambiguity. Take for example the speech made by the French ambassador to the Security Council, which appeared in the White Book which the hon. the Minister submitted to Parliament. He was referring to a statement made here by our ambassador, and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, that statement seems inadequate to us not only because it is vague &#x2026;</block>

<p>This refers to the Government&#x2019;s policy of self-determination&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but also because it does not dispel certain ambiguities concerning the right of the Namibian people as such &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, as a whole&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as Rhodesia is concerned, the Government&#x2019;s position has been made very clear, and I do not think it would serve any good purpose if I were to go into it any further. The hon. member said that he meant that we should elucidate how the machinery in South West Africa is going to be created to enable the various population groups to decide on their future. That is precisely what the hon. the Prime Minister did in this hon. House. We are creating that machinery so that it will be possible for all the population groups to have machinery at their disposal which will enable them to say: These are our spokesmen; these are our representatives; they may, with the necessary authority, have their say in these matters, together with the representatives of the other population groups.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterkloof emphasized the value of proficiency in languages for the promotion of international relations. My department is also thoroughly aware of this. Proficiency in languages is an essential requirement for entry into the diplomatic service, and the department also goes out of its way to help members of the <span class="col_4843-4844" refersTo="page_0835"/>department to improve their proficiency in languages when they are already in our employ. The Government is also aware of the importance of the knowledge of foreign languages with a view to our international relations. As a result of a decision recently taken in this connection fey the Cabinet, my colleague, the Minister of National Education, and I personally, were instructed to go into the matter of promoting a knowledge of French at our high schools. We have certain plans and proposals which we shall discuss with the educational authorities in the various provinces, and I am very certain that the result will be a considerable improvement in the availability of facilities at our high schools.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point referred to the instructional guide which has already been discussed under the Vote of my colleague. The hon. member has now urged me to read the instructional guide myself. I think I could benefit by reading it myself. I have every confidence in the judgment of my colleague and his department.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member also wanted to know about the refusal of certain so-called cultural and scientific visas in the case of Japan. I can assure the hon. member that we are in contact with the Japanese authorities in this connection. As far as other visas are concerned, tourists for all other purposes are still being freely admitted to visit Japan.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to certain statements about our trade with Japan. In this connection I can assure him that there are no problems in our two-way trade with Japan.</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted certain information in connection with the future policy of the authorities in Mozambique. He referred to the continued use of the harbour, etc. I can refer him to public statements by spokesmen for the authorities in Mozambique. These spokesmen have indicated in public that they will be prepared to continue providing the facilities which we are using at the moment. I am afraid, however, that the details regarding those facilities will have to be worked out when Mozambique attains self-government and independence in the course of this year.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the absence of diplomatic representation in the case of our three neighbouring territories. I can assure him, as I have done before in this House, that I am in favour of it. I hope the time will come when it will be possible for us to implement our policy in practice in this connection. The hon. member must, however, remember that this is a two-sided matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted to know whether we had given any assurances of a special role that we would play in the case of an independent Rhodesia. I think our first objective in the case of Rhodesia is that a satisfactory solution should be arrived at. It should be crystal clear by now that if Rhodesia should become fully independent, South Africa would be prepared and willing and glad to play her part in co-operation and in supporting them in whatever way should be necessary, just as we are prepared to do in the case of our other neighbours.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the debate was adjourned I was discussing Rhodesia. I said that it would serve no good purpose if we were to speculate here on South Africa&#x2019;s attitude or reaction in case certain situations in regard to Rhodesia were to arise. Nevertheless, I said that if Rhodesia&#x2019;s independence were to be recognized, Rhodesia would be able to rely on co-operation and assistance from South Africa. Anything of that nature is obvious; it is, after all, our declared policy. But what I meant of course and should really have said, was that if the Rhodesians themselves find a solution to their problems and if Rhodesia&#x2019;s international position is normalized, they will be able to rely on our support and assistance. By this time everyone ought to know this.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Von Brandis stressed the importance of developments in the Indian Ocean. I can assure the hon. member that we share his views on the importance of this area. This, incidentally, is one of the explanations for our large expenditure on defence. However, apart from the defence aspect, I can assure hon. members that the Government and my department have not neglected this issue in the past and will not neglect it in future. What is more, I am confident that our efforts in this connection will become increasingly more successful as <span class="col_4845-4846" refersTo="page_0836"/>d&#x00E9;tente gains momentum. We are making efforts in this direction. A reassuring aspect of the matter is that other members of the free world are also becoming more concerned about the increasing Russian presence in the area.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, I hope you will allow me a few minutes more to convey my sincere gratitude and appreciation, together with the gratitude and appreciation which have already been conveyed from both sides of this House, to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs and his staff. It is probable that the task resting on their shoulders has never before been so exacting in our history. To give you an idea of what is happening I can tell you that during the past 12 to 14 months the Secretary for Foreign Affairs has been out of the country approximately 30 times. Seven of those 30 visits were to overseas countries. I myself, in one week, undertook two journeys to two different, distant countries in the heart of Africa. The head of the Africa Division of the department, and other senior officials of my department and other departments, made literally dozens of journeys to the rest of Africa. You will agree with me that this work by the Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as other departments, is of the utmost importance in these times of contact and communication, dialogue and d&#x00E9;tente. They have to create the channels along which communication between Governments can take place. Apart from that they have other important functions as well. The Department of Foreign Affairs has to advise the Government on our foreign policy, and consequently it is part of its duties to study the position throughout the world, including the situation in countries where we have no representation. They have to keep the Government informed on that as well. Another important function of my department is to ensure that all foreign relations on the part of South Africa are co-ordinated. It has to ensure that all government bodies that have anything to do with, overseas countries adopt a uniform approach. Unco-ordinated action could lead to confusion among those with whom we make contact and with whom we hold talks. Unco-ordinated actions could undermine confidence in our Government and frustrate proposed actions. Therefore it is a fact that in practice anyone associated with a South African mission abroad acts under the umbrella of the ambassador or other person in charge of the mission. He is responsible for everyone associated with his mission abroad.</p>

<p>The diplomatic service of course calls for special qualifications and special training. One of the principal qualifications a diplomat is required to have is that he should be absolutely honest. He should always walk a straight path. For a good diplomat there are no short cuts. For diplomats there are no instant solutions. Diplomats cannot simply rush into a situation, although the temptation to do so is present at times. No one expects a diplomat to rush into a situation. Even the Government with whom he is accredited, does not expect this of him. The diplomat must realize that normally he does not come into the limelight in the execution of his duties. It is an old profession, and there are many traditions attached to it, traditions which have become clearly defined over the centuries. There are many unwritten rules. It is a fine profession, but it is also a very difficult profession, particularly for South Africa&#x2019;s diplomats and their wives who work alongside them. I can inform the hon. members that our present diplomats are, in a very excellent manner, upholding the fine traditions created by their predecessors.</p>

<p>Therefore I am pleased and grateful that hon. members on both, sides of the House have expressed their gratitude and appreciation to my department.</p>

<heading>INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#enthoven">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was adjourned I was saying that there was a similarity between clauses 1 and 2(c) of the Bill before us and section 16 of the Bantu Laws Amendment Act, No. 70 of 1974. Section 16 of that Act reads, <i>inter alia,</i> as follows: The investment corporation, a development corporation or a corporation may, <span class="col_4847-4848" refersTo="page_0837"/>with the prior approval of the Minister, indemnify any person with whom such corporation enters into an agreement in terms of which such person undertakes to establish an industrial, commercial, financial, mining or other business undertaking in a Bantu homeland, against any loss which such person may incur in connection with such undertaking while such contract is of force and effect, and which, in the opinion of the Minister, is not insurable and in respect of which, in the opinion of the Minister, he has no effective right to damages.</p>

<p>The provision here is similar inasmuch as it provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or to indemnify any company or other person in respect of the costs attaching to suits, or in respect of any loss or damage, arising from&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(i) the financing by such company or other person of any other company or other person; or</li>

<li>(ii) the entering into any contract by such company or other person.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then in clause 2(c) we give the Minister authority to guarantee such indemnity. When we tried last year to find out what was behind section 7A, we did not get much response from the Minister. We understood that it was necessary to give the Minister powers of this kind to facilitate or encourage certain investments in the homelands, so that was supported. I would like to know from the Minister whether there is also a political motive for the proposed section 4(e) and the proposed, section 5 <i>bis</i> (c.) What is the actual reason for giving the Minister these powers&#x003F; Are the reasons similar to those given to us last year by the Minister when we raised that issue&#x003F; Sir, I am very pleased to see on the Order Paper that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs intends moving an amendment in the Committee Stage to clause 2(c) to limit the amount to be indemnified by the Minister, because quite clearly these indemnities are just as onerous as actual loans and there must be some kind of limitation to them. Sir, one thing to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister is the wideness of the wording, &#x201C;any loss or damage&#x201D;. That could mean anything; it could mean a capital loss; it could mean a loss of profit, or any kind of loss. We shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister can give us some indication as to why he wants this clause to be so wide.</p>

<p>Sir, the other aspect of creeping socialism or Government encroachment into the private sector has been dealt with, especially by hon. members of the Opposition, and I do not want to go again into the arguments put forward by them, but I would like to back up their arguments with two quotations. One is a quotation by Dr. Martin van den Berg, who is well known in business circles, who said the following on this question of Government interference in private industry&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question is whether capitalism can survive in a democracy in which there are all types of pressure on the State to provide all types of additional services to people hit by market economies. Because it is the job of those elected to Parliament to stay in power, they are susceptible to these pressures. What is needed is the education of the voter to raise his voice against these various pressure groups, otherwise we will be working ourselves into a form of socialism. The silent majority must speak up.</block>

<p>Here is another quotation by Dr. Jan S. Marais, warning about the same problem&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government and all Government agencies should try harder to stay out of activities the private sector can and will undertake, and especially Government and semi-Government agencies should try to avoid competing directly or indirectly with the private sector.</block>

<p>This is a very real problem, Sir, and I think the fact that so many speakers on this side of the House have raised this matter shows how tremendously concerned they are about this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Randburg put to the hon. the Minister certain questions with which the hon. the Minister will certainly deal in more detail in due course. Some of those points can best be discussed in the Committee Stage. Therefore, I do not want to attempt going into the arguments raised by the hon. member. What I want to do, however, is to return in general to the discussion we have had up to now on <span class="col_4849-4850" refersTo="page_0838"/>this particular Bill. I want to refer to the &#x201C;yes, but&#x201D; attitude of all the speakers on the opposite side who have participated in this debate up to this stage. Now I have to say at once that one really hoped that there would have been a more positive approach from that side of the House to a Bill which has one aim, and that is to enable the IDC in a positive way to perform its task very effectively. But in this debate we have witnessed once more the inability of that side of the House to distinguish between what should be criticized and questioned and the things that should have their blessing. I really think that as far as the IDC is concerned, the praises which the IDC deserves, are not sung loudly enough here or outside. I want to say that the monuments which have been erected in the sphere of industrial development by the IDC since 1940, cannot be broken down by the actions of either the United Party opposition or anybody else. Therefore, I want to say that the IDC does not deserve to be on the receiving end of the continued questioning, to use a euphemism, by the Opposition of what it is doing, and I feel that we are serving no purpose by doing so. Not only the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens, who participated in this debate earlier on, but more particularly the hon. member for Johannesburg North, came back in their speeches to the role which State corporations play and with reference to this legislation they tried once more to make out a case for casting suspicion on the role of the State corporations and for assuming that all was not well as far as the operation of these corporations was concerned, because they allegedly interfered with free enterprise in South Africa. For that reason I think it is a good thing to focus the attention in a discussion such as this on what is being done by the IDC, for the necessity and the desirability of the amendments proposed in this Bill should be seen against that background. Now I am best able to do so in terms of certain conditions laid down by the hon. member for Johannesburg North in terms of which the IDC should supposedly conduct its affairs. He asked the hon. the Minister for certain assurances. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first assurance is that the IDC will only invest in spheres where the private sector is both unwilling and unable to invest, and the second assurance we want is that where it does invest, the IDC will within a reasonable period after the profitability of the enterprise and the security for the repayment of any outstanding loans have been established, take steps to dispose of any equity interest held by them.</block>

<p>I feel, of course, that that assurance which was asked by the hon. member for Johannesburg North, is totally outrageous and presumptious.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It is just nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, to put it plainly, it is just nonsense. What does, in fact, happen, is that the IDC steps in where need exists, and I can illustrate this best with reference to the most recent annual report of the IDC. I shall not have time now to go into this in detail but if one simply looks at page 8 of the most recent annual report one gets an idea of the work the IDC is doing Here we see the following under the heading &#x201C;Scheme for financing of export capacity&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This scheme was introduced in May 1973, with the object of providing financing, at reduced interest rates, for projects that will earn foreign exchange.</block>

<p>In the light of the condition laid down by the hon. member for Johannesburg North, viz. that the IDC should invest only in enterprises in which the private sector is not prepared to invest, or in which they cannot invest, I want to say at once that his argument, request or demand does not make sense. If one looks into this matter, what is there which prevents the private sector from undertaking such a scheme&#x003F; So why does the private sector undertake it&#x003F; There are various reasons for that. Sometimes the reasons are of a practical nature. The most important point is, however, that if the IDC had not entered this field&#x2014; which is open to the private entrepreneur &#x2014;South Africa would have been prejudiced. I want to quote more from the report:</p>

<block name="quote">Thus far the response has been favourable. Applications amounting to R28,9 million were approved in the first year of the scheme and the additional exports involved could be of the order of R58 million per annum &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_4851-4852" refersTo="page_0839"/>Surely it is in the interests of South Africa that this be done. So how can a condition be laid down that the IDC should be restricted to fields in which the private sector cannot or do not want to operate&#x003F; The IDC is making an important contribution to financing for the export of capital goods. In addition it is also making a contribution to import financing and industrial decentralization. I can continue in this way to mention what the IDC is doing. It is also rendering assistance through its small industries division, which, after all, is pre-eminently a field for the private sector. Sound arguments could probably be advanced why the IDC should not act in this field as this, too, is a field for the small man, the individual entrepreneur. I say again that if the condition were to be met that the IDC should be confined to the field into which the private sector cannot enter, it would mean that one would literally shut out the full sphere of our economic spectrum. Is that what the hon. member wants&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately my time is limited and I have received an instruction from the Whips that I have to deal with these matters very briefly. [Interjections.] He need not worry; the hon. the Minister will bring him to book very thoroughly. He can prepare himself in the meantime. I can continue in this vein. There are still other fields in which the IDC rendered assistance, but unfortunately I cannot go into more detail. There is, for instance, the South Atlantic Cable Company which is an undertaking which lends itself pre-eminently to yielding a profit, so why has it not been undertaken by the private sector&#x003F; Then there is the heavy minerals project, Foscor and Sapekoe, all of them companies in which the IDC has invested. In this way there is a whole series of spheres in which the IDC has interested itself in the past for very good reasons. A sound argument can be made out that these spheres are meant for the private sector, but it is simply impossible and outrageous to say that the activities of the IDC should be curtailed and limited to certain reject spheres of our economic activities in which nobody else is interested. It is outrageous and I really hope that the hon. the Minister will not take any notice of requests and demands which have been made.</p>

<p>There is a second guarantee which the hon. member for Johannesburg North wants. He wants the IDC to be prepared to sell its share in these enterprises in which it has invested as soon as they are being run at a profit. If this has to happen, it means in practice that it is expected of the IDC to undertake those things in which nobody else has shown an interest, and that it has to develop an enterprise by means of its know-how and financial support, as it did in the case of Sasol and Foscor, and that it should approach the private sector as soon as an enterprise has been developed to a profitable level and say, &#x201C;We have done all the work; we have run the risk and we have shouldered the responsibility for major capital expenditure. The project is profitable now. Ladle off the cream for yourselves&#x201D;. I think the roots of the hon. member for Johannesburg North are too deeply planted in our economic life in South Africa not to agree that it would be bad business, from a business point of view, to do something like that. I think it is more correct to say in these enterprises in which the IDC has taken an interest, the benefits, financial benefits as well, resulting from that shareholding of the IDC, can best be re-utilized to the advantage of South Africa. I want to deliver a sincere plea here not to effect a change in this regard.</p>

<p>As far as the proposed amendments themselves are concerned, these simply make provision, in the light of changed circumstances, for making the activities of the IDC more streamlined as we are living in different times. After all, there is a world of a difference between 1975 and 1940 when the principal Act was placed on the Statute Book. The hon. the Opposition will not differ from me when I say that one has to and may expect a dynamic Minister and a dynamic Government to effect changes, where and when necessary. The only thing the hon. the Minister is doing, is to effect essential changes so as to enable the IDC to do its work more effectively in 1975 in the light of the circumstances. That is all, nothing more and nothing less. Because this is so, surely we can say to the Minister on behalf of the whole nation of South Africa that we support this legislation without any hesitation whatsoever because we have faith in his judgment when he has to take decisions, and because we have faith in the management and staff of the IDC and especially in the board of directors of the IDC whom we have come <span class="col_4853-4854" refersTo="page_0840"/>to know over the years, as people who act very conservatively when it comes to the acceptance of obligations and responsibilities. After all, it is a good thing in my opinion to pay some tribute on this occasion to the board of directors of the IDC, which is made up of the very best financial and economic experts in South Africa. They are people who stand squarely in the everyday economic activities of South Africa. We may rest assured that they will not want to contribute to the suppression of private initiative in South Africa. Under these circumstances it is my privilege to support this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am afraid I am going to disappoint the hon. member for Springs, because I am going to identify myself with other speakers on this side of the House who have expressed their doubts about the manner in which the IDC is entering into undertakings which could possibly be done, and possibly be done better, by private enterprise. I will come back to this subject a little later.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to deal with two aspects of this Bill which is before us. The first one is in relation to clause 1 which gives the IDC the additional power to what it already has to issue indemnities against loss in certain circumstances. The IDC at present may &#x201C;guarantee any undertaking given in relation to the financing of any company or the performance of any contract by any company&#x201D;. This Bill will, in terms of clause 1, enable the IDC, as an alternative to guaranteeing the due performance of contracts, to indemnify against loss or damage in respect of similar circumstances. As I read the Bill, this is an alternative power and not a power that will be exercised in addition to guaranteeing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Not in the same case; this is an alternative power.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, the IDC is now being put in a position where it can decide which is the better method, because it can either guarantee the due fulfilment of a contract or indemnify the company against loss. I think that with the increasing part being played by the IDC in the financing of imports and exports, but particularly in the financing of captial exports, this is a very necessary and desirable addition to the powers of the corporation. I think in practice it is often the case that when imports or, more important, exports are being financed, an indemnity against loss to the party that is providing the finance is a more appropriate means of facilitating the finance than a guarantee of due fulfilment of contract.</p>

<p>I have already said that I have my reservations, along with the other speakers on this side of the House, in respect of the role which the IDC is playing in the industrial development of South Africa, because there are undoubtedly instances where the IDC is doing what private enterprise can do and can do better. Nevertheless I do believe that the role which the IDC is playing in the financing of exports, and particularly in the financing of capital exports, is a very valuable and a very necessary one. I think in order to do this job most effectively it does require this power to indemnify against loss. One has only to look at the growth of capital goods exports which have been financed under the IDC&#x2019;s export finance scheme to realize this. Since 1970 authorizations of export finance under the scheme have risen from R76 million in that year to R181 million in 1974. In fact, last year, of the funds which became available to the IDC, no less than 42% was applied to the purpose of financing capital exports. It seems to me that the corporation is fulfilling a very desirable function in this regard.</p>

<p>I think we have to realize that the availability of long-term credit is an important competitive weapon when it comes to securing export business in capital goods. South Africa has to compete with exports from other countries which are supported by export finance schemes and export guarantee schemes some of which, I might say, are subsidized and we simply cannot stand back in this direction and not do likewise. For that reason I support what the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens has said in this regard. We regard this as a desirable feature of the Bill and I must say that in this respect I think the hon. member for Johannesburg North was a bit off the mark in not realizing what the purpose was of this provision to allow the IDC to indemnify against loss.</p>

<p>The second aspect of the Bill which I would like to deal with is the provision which allows the Minister to increase the amount of loans raised outside the Republic of South Africa which may be guaranteed by the Government without Parliamentary approval from R30 million to <span class="col_4855-4856" refersTo="page_0841"/>R200 million. In this respect I think the hon. member for Johannesburg North was again off the mark. This provision does not increase the IDC&#x2019;s borrowing power by R170 million as the hon. member for Johannesburg North seemed to indicate. It merely raises the limit in respect of which the Government may guarantee loans raised outside the country by that amount. The actual borrowing powers of the IDC are governed by section 4(f) which, is not amended by this Bill. They, of course, are limited to three-quarters of the issued capital of the corporation. As I calculate the position, the unused borrowing powers at the date of the last balance sheet of the corporation amounted to R47 million, which is the amount by which the corporation can increase its borrowing without going to its shareholders for additional approval.</p>

<p>I would say that, bearing in mind that the amount of R30 million which is provided for in the existing Act was set as long ago as 1940, the amount of R200 million is a fairly reasonable figure taking into account the depreciation of the value of money in the meantime, the expansion of the industrial activities in this country, and some of the new and justifiable spheres of activity into which the IDC has moved. I hope that this amendment allowing the Government to guarantee foreign loans to a greater extent is going to mean that the IDC will be able to borrow abroad to a greater extent, that it will be able to attract more capital to South Africa and that it will be able, in the process, to improve our balance of payments. Here again I would like to associate myself with other speakers on this side of the House. If this increase in borrowing power is going to be used for increased investment by the corporation, I hope the Minister and the board of the corporation are going to bear in mind the objects of the corporation. These objects have been quoted in this debate and I will not quote them again, but I believe that, with the background we have in South Africa of a private enterprise economy, these objects of the IDC should be interpreted as confining the activity of the IDC to areas where private enterprise fails to do the job. Unfortunately, I cannot say that this is or has been the case, and here I would cross swords with the hon. member for Springs. To my mind there has been an undesirable participation in private enterprise, for example, the participation of the corporation in banking. I see no reason why the State, through the IDC, should participate in banking; the private sector is perfectly capable of providing a complete banking service.</p>

<p>I see no reason why the IDC should concern itself with running widely diversified investment companies, such as National Selections and Industrial Selections. These are surely areas which should be left entirely to private enterprises. Having in mind the fact that the Government does appear to be aware of the need to hold a tighter rein on the participation of State corporations in the economy, as it is evidenced by the fact that a committee has been appointed to watch over the activities of State corporations, <b>I</b> do hope that now that we have a new Minister of Economic Affairs, he is going to follow a strict policy in regard to the activities of the IDC in relation to the objects laid down.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to repeat at the outset that I have pointed out that in the modern business community, national and international, in which we have to compete and in which the IDC has to play its part, two specific needs have arisen. These were, in the first place, that the amount it was able to guarantee in respect of loans raised abroad was too limited and that it had to be increased. I just want to say at this stage that bearing in mind the fact that the limit of R30 million on the amount was imposed as far back as 1940, there is sufficient reason for this amount to be increased. The second factor to which I should like to refer is the need which exists for the right to indemnify, over and above the right to guarantee. I want to say at once that I appreciate the support given to these two facets of the Bill by the hon. members for Cape Town Gardens and Constantia. I think that in this regard the hon. gentlemen hit the mark, something they have seldom done in the past and are unlikely to do very often in the future, and I may tell them to continue along these lines; they have done well in this particular regard.</p>

<p><span class="col_4857-4858" refersTo="page_0842"/>Before I come to the arguments themselves, I think there are certain general statements that I should make. The hon. member for Johannesburg North, with the limited support of the hon. member for Randburg, took this opportunity of using the Bill as a vehicle for propagating certain philosophies to which he subscribes. Amongst other things, he used this opportunity, not to discuss the part and participation of the State directly or of public corporations in the economy, but to discuss at once the interference of the State in the economy through the corporations. In his speech he made two statements, <i>inter alia,</i> which were totally unfounded and in my opinion totally unmotivated as well. The hon. member said that the moment one referred to the legislation, or to what the legislation before us is intended to authorize, the whole question of State expenditure, direct as well as indirect, through public corporations, should be investigated. He made two assertions in this regard, but in my opinion he said absolutely nothing to prove those assertions. Those assertions were merely platitudes and generalities. Firstly, he said that the expenditure, including expenditure through State or public corporations, was of an inflationary and a less productive nature. I tried to find something in his speech to prove those statements which he made, but I found absolutely nothing to substantiate them. The second statement which the hon. member made was that this legislation implied further interference, to use his words, in the private sector and in spheres proper to the private sector. The hon. member conceded in general that the State has a part to play in a mixed economy such as the one we have. But he did not show himself to be willing to quantify the part which the State has to play, as he conceded in principle, and to say what its nature should be and in what spheres it should be played. He was not prepared to take this statement of his any further. But having made this profound economic pronouncement, that the State does have the right to participate in the economy and to recognize its mixed nature, he proceeded to condemn the direct or indirect participation of the State&#x2014;quantitatively and qualitatively. The question now presents itself to me, and I believe it to be a reasonable question, what the hon. members&#x2019; motivation is in adopting standpoints such as these. The hon. member for Yeoville said that we had a capitalist system. No one is denying this and this is not what I am arguing about. In fact, the hon. member for Johannesburg North conceded that we had a mixed economy and that there was a need for participation by the State.</p>

<p>I shall deal with it. I do not want to be drawn into a dialogue with the hon. member for Yeoville, however, for I am not dealing with him at the moment. But if what I said is applicable to him, he may as well take a seat next to the hon. member for Johannesburg North right now; he need not postpone it. Arising from the two assertions made by the hon. member, which, as I have said, he did not prove, he said that he wanted two assurances from me as Minister of Economic Affairs. In the first place he wants to have the assurance from me that the Industrial Development Corporation will invest and operate only in those sectors or segments of the economy in which the private sector is unwilling or unable to do so. This is important. In other words, before entering a particular field which has not been entered in the past, the Industrial Development Corporation is to ask the private sector whether or not it is willing to enter that field itself, and not whether that field needs to be entered in the national interest. Implicit in the assurance which the hon. member asks me to give &#x2026;</p>

<p>I first want to finish my argument; then the hon. member may ask his question. Implicit in the assurance which the hon. member asks me to give is a premise, and that is that if the private sector has entered a particular field, no matter how limited its participation, the mere fact that the field has been entered by the private sector will absolutely prohibit the IDC from entering that specific field. In addition, a second premise is implicit in the assurance which the hon. member asks me to give. This is that even if the competition in the private sector is as limited as could be in a specific field, the State will still be under no obligation to enter that field and to make the competition more competitive. If this is what the hon. member is asking me, I am not prepared to give him that assurance.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me to give him the assurance that when the IDC has entered a specific field, it will withdraw from that field within a reasonable period of time as soon as the enterprise in which it was involved has become profitable. The hon. member will know that it was not always possible to withdraw at a given point of time. This is so for many reasons. I do not think there is any need for me to tell him what these reasons are. I think the hon. member should have a look at the composition of the IDC&#x2019;s board of directors. With the exception of the chairman, who used to be the Secretary of a State Department, all the members of the IDC&#x2019;s board of directors are people who are active in the private sector, and they are not active on their own, but they occupy the most responsible positions in their respective fields. I say that an accusation against the IDC of unjustified participation in the private sector would really amount to a motion of no confidence in the leading figures in the private sector of our country. Let us see who serves on that board of directors. The hon. member shakes his head, but I want to have it placed on record. There is Dr. W. J. A. Hurter. He is the chairman of the board of directors of Volkskas Beperk, as well as of other companies of an industrial nature. Is this a disqualification from the viewpoint of the hon. member for Johannesburg North&#x003F; Another member is Mr. D. U. Benade. This should console the hon. member. At the moment he is president of the Federated Chamber of Industries, while he is also a director of several companies. Then there is Dr. J. A. du Toit, chairman of the Coloured Development Corporation, who is also involved in several companies. Then there is Dr. I. G. Halliday. I could go on in this way.</p>

Sir, this is important, because the hon. member for Johannesburg North has not convinced me of his objectivity in this connection.

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove should keep quiet now; I shall come to him. Sir, when I have to answer these questions in respect of the hon. member for Johannesburg North, the question naturally presents itself&#x2014;and I think the hon. member for Johannesburg North will concede this&#x2014;whether, in the light of the financial and economic institutions in which he is involved and which are responsible for the fact that many of his colleagues are here and which are also responsible for their continued presence in this House, the party to which he belongs collectively and he himself in particular are qualified to judge objectively in this particular case. When I analyse the hon. member&#x2019;s speech, I am not convinced that he is able to give an objective, balanced opinion in the national interest. Sir, I do not blame him. I think he finds it very difficult to distantiate himself from his involvement in these financial and economic institutions and to make an objective contribution. There is not the slightest doubt about the fact that the hon. member for Johannesburg North really has identifiable and known interests in powerful financial and economic institutions&#x2014;for which I do not blame him&#x2014;for which he holds a brief&#x2014;I do not think he can deny this&#x2014;but which in <span class="col_4861-4862" refersTo="page_0844"/>my opinion disqualify him from speaking authoritatively on national interests on the one hand and particular group interests on the other. I believe that he and his party have introduced a new element into our politics through the interests which they represent, which brought some of them to this House. Apart from the statement made by the hon. member to the effect that in a mixed economy such as ours, the State has a part to play, which seems to be merely theoretical according to him, he is not prepared to qualify this and to tell us what the restrictions or the extent of the State&#x2019;s participation should be.</p>

<p>Let me make a second statement. No one will deny that the dividing line is a delicately balanced borderline. But he has made no contribution whatsoever towards determining what this delicately balanced borderline should be and where it should be drawn. No, Sir&#x2014;and this I want to deal with&#x2014;the hon. member has joined the chorus&#x2014;and allow me to say at once that it is a monotonous chorus&#x2014;and accused the State of creeping socialism.</p>

But I am glad that the hon. member for Orange Grove interrupted me.

All I want to tell him in this regard is that he has every right to do as the hon. member for Constantia and Cape Town Gardens did, and to point out that we should always be vigilant in respect of the State&#x2019;s participation in the economy.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us now come to the legislation at once. Having referred to it in general terms I want to say that we should consider the legislation which is now before us in the light of, firstly, the objectives which were set when the Industrial Development Corporation was established in 1940. In evaluating the amending legislation which is before us in terms of the objectives of the principal Act&#x2014;the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens quoted them and I have also referred to them&#x2014; we must ask ourselves whether there is anything in this legislation which is in any way contrary to the objectives of that Act. Surely this is the norm by which we should evaluate this legislation. Secondly we should look at the extent of the IDC&#x2019;s powers as defined in section 4 of the principal Act. I want to ask the hon. member whether there is anything in the amending legislation we are now considering which is at all contrary to that Act. Naturally <span class="col_4863-4864" refersTo="page_0845"/>the test is how, since 1940 up to now, the board of directors of the IDC has interpreted the powers conferred upon it by section 4 and the objectives presented to it by section 5 of the principal Act. The best evidence of how this has been interpreted by the boards of directors is to be found in the annual report to which the hon. member referred. However, the hon. member seems to have read only page 24 of the annual report. He pointed out that the IDC had handled 1 636 applications since its inception and that an amount of almost R1 400 million had been involved. It is obvious, after all, that many of the amounts have been paid back since 1940 and that the amount which is mentioned in the report is the total amount involved in the applications. It does not represent the outstanding amount. If the hon. member had wanted to, he could have looked at page 22 of the report as well. If he had done that, he would have seen there how the various amounts have been invested in terms of the various sections of the Act and he would have seen that the amount invested by the IDC in private company shares is relatively small compared with the amount invested in the form of loans. If he had done that, he would have found that the investment in shares&#x2014;except in wholly-owned subsidiaries &#x2014;is smaller than the investment in loans and guarantees. Does the hon. member not agree with me&#x003F; I should like to take this a little further because I believe this to be an important matter. Has the hon. member ever lodged a complaint with the department about unfair competition or participation by State corporations in the private sector&#x003F; I ask him this question because the Government&#x2019;s standpoint and policy in respect of participation by State corporations in the economy is no secret, and if anyone wants to know more about it, the procedure that should be followed and the place where complaints should be lodged are no secret either. After all, this has formed the subject of various statements by some of my predecessors and by the hon. the Prime Minister as well. Let us see what the policy of the Government is, because I think it is important for me at least to tell hon. members what it is. The Government&#x2019;s basic philosophy is that the national economy can best be served by the profit motive, as embodied in the private sector. This is a general statement, but I want to qualify it. The hon. member for Johannesburg North did not qualify it. From the nature of the case, the State&#x2019;s machinery is not equipped to utilize the development opportunities which arise every day, to keep the national economy buoyant and to develop a broad industrial structure which will fully utilize the country&#x2019;s resources and provide jobs for all levels of the population. I readily concede that. That has always been the philosophy of this side of the House. The policy of allowing the private sector to apply the means of production is no new concept. However, there is a qualification to that: As long as it can be reconciled with the general interest and as long as it does not conflict with the general interest. The hon. member for Orange Grove agrees. We have had legislation on the Order Paper and there is more legislation on the Order Paper coming up for discussion which proposes to protect the general interest against possible exploitation by the private sector. I am referring here to small minorities in the private sector. Let me make myself clear on that, because it is important. Although I subscribe to this basic philosophy and the economic policy for the development of our industries is my specific responsibility and I intend to perform this task to the best of my ability, it will not be done at the expense of the public or national interest. Let there be no doubt whatsoever about that. The reason for the establishment of the State corporations is well-known. I am not for a moment suggesting that State corporations cannot make mistakes and I shall come back to this later. But where would this country&#x2019;s industrial development have been without the State corporations&#x003F; It is very easy to pay lip service to this principle and in practice to argue against everything the people do. The IDC&#x2019;s record in this particular regard shows us&#x2014;the hon. member for Johannesburg North quoted this from the annual report&#x2014;that it has handled 1 636 applications since 1940. From whom&#x003F; From State corporations&#x003F; Or from the private sector&#x003F; No, really, Sir, we must not be na&#x00EF;ve in discussing these things. No one can deny that the IDC&#x2014;I am not referring now to the other State corporations, because they are not under discussion at the moment&#x2014;was established to stimulate industrial development <span class="col_4865-4866" refersTo="page_0846"/>and to guide that development into fields and in directions in which such opportunities had not existed before. In this way the IDC has created opportunities which are obvious. I make no apology for the fact that we are using the IDC to bring about a balanced geographical development in our country, and I wish we had more funds available to us in this regard.</p>

<p>I advocate further participation by the IDC in this particular regard. It could not be reconciled with our objectives if the IDC were to reserve to itself the right to use the means which are made available to it&#x2014;a major part of the means consists of public funds, and I concede that&#x2014;to intervene in order to deprive the private sector of its opportunities in existing enterprises. Their function is to help develop new directions. That is not in dispute between us. They have the additional responsibility&#x2014;hon. members must know that this is my standpoint as well as that of the Government&#x2014;of intervening, where there is insufficient competition, to create rivalry so that the situation may become fully competitive. There must be no doubt about this either.</p>

<p>I heard the criticism expressed by the hon. member for Johannesburg North, as well as that of the hon. member for Randburg, who is now sitting up straight again. To me it sounded very much like a prelude to agreements in other spheres. The hon. member for Randburg associated himself with the hon. member for Johannesburg North in his general condemnation of the State&#x2019;s participation, and I heard him quote Dr. Jan Marais authoritatively. I could not hear the name of the other person.</p>

<p>By the way and for the hon. member&#x2019;s information, Dr. M. van den Berg is a member of the Standing Advisory Committee on State Competition.</p>

<p>However, I want to come back to the speeches made by the hon. members for Cape Town Gardens and Constantia, and I want to say at once that I take the warning to heart that the IDC and the other State corporations should no indulge in unwarranted activity in spheres pertaining to the private sector. I want to add at once that the Government and I have no argument with hon. members on this point. I have already referred to the qualifying aspects in dealing with the speech made by the hon. member for Johannesburg North. There have been complaints from the private sector from time to time about the actions of some State corporation in some direction, because of the competition of the State corporation sector, if I may call it that, with the private sector. To the extent to which these complaints may be justified, and the situation may exist in respect of which hon. members and the private sector allege that such actions are not in the public interest, I believe that the necessary adjustments should be made. In fact, my predecessor and I have been assured by the chairmen of the various State corporations, which as hon. members know, are quite autonomous in their decision-taking, that within the framework of their statutory powers they are aware of the Government&#x2019;s policy and standpoint, as stated by me to the House this afternoon, and that they will do their best to act in accordance with the letter and the spirit of this policy and philosophy. I want to conclude by referring to this matter in this particular connection.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, the hon. the Prime Minister announced on 10 December last year that it had been decided in principle to constitute a committee to which complaints in this particular connection could be referred. Hon. members know, too, that I have already announced the names of the members of this committee. What is important, however, is that apart from the chairman, the entire committee consists of representatives of the private sector. I believe that hon. members will agree with me that we can at least expect impartial standpoints from this committee as a tribunal. So we have already dealt with that facet.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Springs for his contribution&#x2014;in fact, I want to thank all the hon. members for their contributions. They have afforded me the opportunity of formulating my standpoint and informing the House in this regard. In a general sense, too, they have assisted me. I want to point out that the hon. member for Johannesburg North indicated that although there is a limit to the amount which can be guaranteed, there is no limit in respect of the amount which may be indemnified. I am prepared to concede the validity of that argument. It is a reasonable argument. Consequently I shall move the amendment as printed in my name on the Order Paper in the Committee Stage. Now the hon. member may ask his question.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am convinced that this legislation will be quite incontroversial and that I will receive general consent from hon. members on the other side.</p>

<p>It is an important feature of the economic system in the Republic that every person is free, subject only to those restrictions laid down in public interest, to earn his daily bread in the manner best suited to him. However, according to our economic system, no one is allowed to gather wealth in any branch, of commerce and industry without competition. I therefore want to accept that the hon. members of this House will appreciate the important role competition plays in our national economy. Competition in commerce can, however, also be limited by prescribing to a trader at which, price he must sell a particular article.</p>

<p>With a view to assuring competition in commerce, one of my predecessors, the present hon. Minister of Transport, issued a notice in this regard in accordance with the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955, on 25 June 1969. With certain exceptions the notice concerned prohibits any person from persuading or compelling a reseller to adhere to an indicated price.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I must mention, however, that in terms of section 2(2)(a) of the said Act, the provisions thereof shall not be applied in such a manner as to limit, among other things, any right derived under the Patents Act, No. 37 of 1952. Although I do not propose to enter into the details of the matter, I may add that a certain accused party was acquitted on 10 March 1975 upon charges involving the contravention of the resale price maintenance prohibition of 25 June 1969 because the court was of the opinion that a patented article is exempted from the prohibition. The Attorney-General in this particular case intimated that he agreed with the view of the magistrate who delivered judgment in the case and that he would, therefore, not be prepared to take this particular point on appeal.</p>

<p>*However, it is being felt that it was never the intention that the holders of patent rights should have such far-reaching powers which may be to the detriment of the national economy in general. Therefore it is being proposed in the Bill which is now before the hon. House, that a saving clause be added to section 2(2)(a) of the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955.</p>

<p>The proposed saving clause lays down that the provisions of the said section shall not be construed if any person thereunder retained or were granted any right of enhancing or maintaining prices in any manner contemplated in section 2(1) of the Act.</p>

<p>This provision will have the effect of curtailing the rights of persons in terms of any of the Acts mentioned in section 2(2)(a) of the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, in the sense that such persons are not excluded from the operation of the latter Act if they create a monopolistic condition as a result of the enhancement or maintenance of prices. Therefore it follows that the holder of patent rights can be guilty of contravening the prohibition on price maintenance. Furthermore, the opportunity is also taken to rectify the reference to the Act mentioned in section 2(2)(a) of the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act. The proposed rectification concerned will have no effect on the existing law.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this amending Bill seeks to amend an Act that has been on the Statute Book of our country for some 20 years. In view of the tremendous public interest which, revolves around the concept of the word &#x201C;monopolistic&#x201D; as to whether it is either evil or beneficial, I feel that it is only right that I should make some reference to the original Act in order that both the public as well as hon. members present here may better be able to judge the justification or otherwise for the amendment.</p>

<p>No, Sir. As I say, when that investigation was initiated by the then Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr. van Rhyn, the principle was established that the Government recognized <span class="col_4871-4872" refersTo="page_0849"/>that a monopoly was not an evil as such and that there were many monopolies in South Africa that were permissible. The hon. the Minister is now seeking to amend the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act in order, as he sees it, to protect the public interest. I think that this is the important argument which we in our own minds have applied in considering the actual amendment&#x2014;whether or not it is in the public interest. Generally, in times of high inflation such as we are experiencing at the moment, the public is intensely conscious of prices that are maintained in any monopolistic sense of price maintenance as such.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has given us details of the thinking which induced him to introduce this legislation. We believe that his logic is correct. If he is seeking to amend the principal Act in relation to the specific incident which came before the courts, he is following a procedure which he is entirely within his rights to follow. We are not going to oppose this amending Bill. We will support it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have considerable reservations about this particular amending Bill which the hon. the Minister has just introduced. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider the points that I shall raise. I think he will agree that they also impinge upon this amendment. I hope he will discuss these points with his department to see whether they do not perhaps have a greater impact than what has so far been outlined.</p>

<p>In most countries of the world the particular Acts which are mentioned here confer certain rights which are denied to others. I refer here to the Patents Act, the Trademarks Act, the Copyrights Act and the Designs Act. As we understand this amendment of the principal Act, it seeks to remove what was previously an exception to a complete ban on resale price maintenance. These particular Acts were previously given as exceptions.</p>

<p>We on these benches are all against resale price maintenance and we are more than happy that it should be abolished. But I think at the same time one has got to bear in mind that there may be other consequences which will spill over on to a number of people involved in industry and particularly small retailers in South Africa. In the magistrate&#x2019;s judgment to which the hon. the Minister referred, and which gave rise to this amendment, it was accepted that if a person has a patent, then he has the right to set the price for the patented article, but that he has not got the right to set the price for other things that go alongside the particular thing which, forms the patent. But, Sir, these other people under these Acts also have certain others rights. They have the right to a licence; they have the right to determine to whom their products should be sold. They have the right in law to say that only one dealer in a particular suburb may sell their product. As I understand the position, the Minister is not interfering with that discretionary right of people within these categories. He is only concerned with the question of price. But, Sir, when you consider the question of price, you must also bear in mind that there may be circumstances where, if it is simply left like this, this amendment could cause very severe losses.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, standing by itself. I have no objection to the amendment, but what I am trying to say to the Minister is that I think it ought to be considered in a wider context, because if, for instance, one of the well-known supermarket chains in this country used a patented product as a loss leader and sold it at a very low price, this would cause extremely severe damage not only to the manufacturer of the product, but it would deny the public the right really to get the product, because no small retailer would be able to afford to stock it. Let me mention an example.</p>

<p>There are certain discount stores or markets of one nature or another who are able to offer, say, 10 golf balls for a price of R6-50. Incidentally, I checked this morning. The small retailer, however, cannot buy 10 golf balls at lower than R6. All I am saying to the hon. the Minister is that we are all in favour of the public getting the product as cheaply as possible and that we are in favour of the abolition of resale price maintenance, but that it must also be seen in this particular context because in one sense what you are doing here by putting forward this amendment, without considering these other facts, is that inevitably you are going to force the small retailer out of business. In the principal cities certainly you are going to limit the supply to a small number of people.</p>

<p><span class="col_4873-4874" refersTo="page_0850"/>Take the case of a tennis racket, for instance. It is well known that at certain places either here or in Johannesburg you can buy a tennis racket at a price below what the ordinary retailer has to pay to get it. What we are saying, therefore, is that while we have no objection to this amendment in the sense that it abolishes retail price maintenance, it must be looked at in a much broader context and that some consideration must be given to the protection of the manufacturer of a product or the protection of the small retailer against a much larger combine that will be able to take advantage of this amendment.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Z. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened to the speech by the hon. member for Johannesburg North and I found it rather strange. In the first place, as I understand it, he wants the wholesaler or a large retailer to be prevented by means of this legislation from conducting his business in the manner in which he wishes to conduct his business. If he wants to sell one product at a lower price, he is certainly free to do so. I do not think that one should interfere in business practices unnecessarily, and if I understood the hon. member for Johannesburg North correctly, this is exactly what he said. The other aspect is the following. I am glad to hear that all the parties who have spoken so far, are satisfied with the idea that this Bill should be approved as printed. It is true that when one is dealing with goods other than material goods such as these, where one refers to patents and trade marks and copy rights and designs, the person who applies his brains to create something, is entitled to ownership of that particular creation of his and that he should also gain by it financially. Under the Patents Act and the particular Acts which have been referred to here, the necessary protection has already been afforded to these persons to have the full use of their creations for certain terms or periods of time, but the basic point still remains: What is in the public interest&#x003F; Is it in the public interest that price maintenance should be applied without limit or bounds&#x003F; Then we are all agreed that this is not is fact the position. Therefore I support this Bill as do the other hon. members here, and I feel that the problems mentioned by the hon. member for Johannesburg North, perhaps do occur in normal business practice, but this happens in business practice and people are competing there as well. After all, we are a capitalist country based on a capitalist financial system.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this legislation has one merit which I think has not been mentioned, and that is that it illustrates the expedition with which an amendment to a piece of legislation is introduced in this House after a lawsuit has taken place. I see that the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations is sitting in the House. He told us some little while ago how long it takes to get a Bill of only one or two clauses dealt with by the law advisers. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations will not get some advice from the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs as to how quickly you can get a Bill drafted if actually you want to do so.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member must come back to the Bill quickly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I was congratulating the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs on his expedition. He is really quick on the job. But may I indicate a number of problems which I think arise, not necessarily by reason of the amendment itself, but by reason of references to monopolies and their relationships to patents. In the first place, I think we must appreciate that you can in fact have a monopoly which is not hit by price maintenance agreements if in fact you have virtually only one supplier. One of the problems which exists, particularly when you have patented articles, is that you may have only one supplier who is able to market a commodity, and I think that those circumstances require action just as much as price maintenance agreements, because they too have an effect on the price structure, it is very often the case in many parts of the world that price increases are caused by this kind of monopolistic conditions, which I think should be looked at. The other thing one must look at is that when you have a patent, you are not only able to determine what the price is of the product that you wish to sell, but you are able to determine who should be allowed to sell it, and this again can create a monopolistic condition which indirectly can have an effect on the price structure in South Africa. This is something also which I believe needs to be looked at.</p>

<p><span class="col_4875-4876" refersTo="page_0851"/>The other factor which I think we need to look at is that we are dealing here with price maintenance agreements which do not affect the manufacturer. One of the ways in which prices can be increased is not merely by price maintenance agreements in so far as the public is concerned, but at the preliminary stage of manufacture or at the stage of the wholesaler, in respect of imported goods, in regard to which there is really no control whatsoever. This is another factor which can affect prices in so far as the public are concerned. Here we have a situation where, for example, if there is a patent and the goods which are sold under that patent have to be imported, a monopoly can be created unless there are other goods which can compete with the goods in respect of which there is a patent and which do not fall under the same patent. Let us take a camera for example. You can have a patent in respect of a particular camera but you may find the situation that there is no similar product which competes with it Take the instant-developing camera for example. In South Africa there is inadequate competition in respect of that kind of camera. The seller can virtually charge what he likes because the other cameras cannot compete with it. I am not saying that a monopolistic condition exists in respect of that camera on the market at the moment or that excessive prices are being charged, but I am just using it as an illustration to show that the question of patents is something which has to be gone into far more deeply than is the case with the present legislation. This is what I should like to commend to the hon. the Minister, because I think that it does require attention.</p>

<p>The final question I should like to raise is that we also get the other side of the picture. Where maximum prices are stipulated you often find, in the absence of competition, a tendency to regard the maximum price as the minimum price. There the question of competition becomes extremely important. One can perhaps comment on the role that the discounter plays in this field, where the maximum price tends to become the minimum price. The role of the discounter is an important one, but what we need to look at is what has been looked at to some extent in respect of television, but not in respect of other matters. When a product is marketed the public should have adequate facilities available for maintenance and repair. That has been covered in the case of television, but we very often find that prices are cut and that the public is then landed with goods which nobody can adequately repair or maintain. That is as much of a loss to the consuming public as are the higher prices which they sometimes have to pay.</p>

<p>While this piece of legislation in itself does not cover the whole field, I think it can correctly be said that the mere fact that an article is patented does not mean that the seller should be entitled to charge what he likes for it because it could in the final result end in exploitation in the extreme. For that reason we support the Second Reading of this Bill, but we do appeal to the hon. the Minister to ask his officials to go much deeper into the implications which arise from patented articles marketed in South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just wish to repeat that the effect of this amendment we are considering now, is of limited scope. Let me say immediately that I am not able to follow the argument of the hon. member for Johannesburg North in this particular regard. Perhaps I should put it differently. The legislation before us was only introduced to deal with an <i>ad hoc</i> situation which had arisen as a result of a court judgment. As far as we are concerned, it is basically only concerned with the question of price maintenance if and when it is against the public interest. This remains the norm. I immediately concede that there is some substance in the arguments by the hon. member for Yeoville; in fact, I just want to prove that I not only agree with him on these particular facets he referred to but also on others. It is a fact that the question of monopolistic conditions has repeatedly been discussed outside and also during this session, and that questions were raised. I remember the hon. member for Constantia asking a question in regard to paper. I indicated that I would reply to his question later. The fact is that the whole discussion on monopolistic conditions continues from time to time, here as well as else where. Many sins are of course committed when arguing over this matter, but the fact is that these discussions do take place. A second fact which is quite true, is that divergent view points are put forward in these discussions in regard to the monopolistic activities of concentrations of economic Dower which exist in the country. I am not commenting on it. All I am saying at this stage is that these discussions do <span class="col_4877-4878" refersTo="page_0852"/>take place. I want to say immediately that it still remains a problem to find an acceptable suggestion, one which is fair and reasonable and which will not impede sound growth and development, without doing extensive research on the particular subject. I now come to the hon. member for Yeoville. I personally believe that extensive investigations into these aspects to which the hon. member referred are essential, but also in general terms into monopolistic conditions in general, irrespective of what causes them. I think it must also be borne in mind that there has never, to my knowledge, been an empirical investigation into the tendency towards, for example, economic power concentrations in the Republic. At this stage&#x2014;I think this will also answer the questions raised by the hon. member, for Johannesburg North, for although I cannot share his reservations, we could perhaps accommodate them &#x2014;I want to say that the Government has already decided to appoint a commission of inquiry, in which the following will have representation: an outsider as chairman, four members in consultation with the Handelsinstituut, the Association of Chambers of Commerce, the Chamber of Industries and the federation of steel, and engineering industries, Seifra. This commission will investigate the whole question of monopolistic conditions. Its terms of reference will more or less be as follows: To investigate, and report on&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the tendency towards the concentration of economic power in the Republic of South Africa;</li>

<li>(b) the advantages and disadvantages of such concentrations viewed from the angle of public interest;</li>

<li>(c) the efficacy of the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955, as instrument which ensures competition in the economy; and</li>

<li>(d) the legislation considered necessary to eliminate concentration of economic power or any restriction on competition not justifiable in the public interest.</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, I think that this widely formulated terms of reference of the commission of inquiry will accommodate the hon. member&#x2019;s problems. As a result of this, we may be able to produce legislation which will satisfy all of us. Finally I should like to thank hon. members once again for their contributions.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The various professional bodies which promote the interest of attorneys, notaries and conveyancers have all, with the exception of the Cape Province and the Territory of South West Africa, been established by legislation which dates from the period prior to Union. The result is that the legislation concerned is only available in one of the official languages. As you know, it is policy to review and consolidate all legislation passed prior to 1925, particularly with a view to making this legislation available in both official languages.</p>

<p><span class="col_4879-4880" refersTo="page_0853"/>However, the Bill at present before the House is more than a mere consolidation and translation. After long negotiations with the various law societies it was agreed to submit this measure. Every provincial law society and the law society of South West Africa had to be prepared to make concessions or adjustments in order to make this single measure, which will to a large extent bring about uniformity in the provinces and the Territory, acceptable. Furthermore, this opportunity was taken to eliminate deficiencies in the old legislation and to formulate a measure which complies with present-day requirements.</p>

<p>The Bill is self-explanatory. It makes provision for the continued existence of the existing law societies and defines anew their composition, objectives, powers, duties and method of administration.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, to enable the various law societies to regulate more effectively the profession of attorney, notary and conveyancer, more extensive disciplinary powers are conferred on their councils by clause 18. These powers are in conformity with those of most other professional bodies.</p>

<p>Provision is also made in clause 21 for the prescribing of rules by the various councils with regard to the affairs of their societies and the conduct of their members. The existing provisions in this regard differ from society to society. At present rules may be made in the Cape Province, with the approval of the majority of judges; in Natal, with the approval of the provincial division of the Supreme Court; in the Transvaal, of the State President after consultation with the Judge President; in the Orange Free State, of the Minister of Justice after consultation with the Judge President; and in South West Africa, of the Judge President. For the sake of uniformity, and as a compromise, clause 21 provides for approval by the Chief Justice of South Africa, after consultation with the Judges President and, where necessary, Chief Justices of the Bantu homelands. Should the Chief Justice be of the opinion that the interests of the public would be adversely affected by any provision of a rule, the approval of the State President will have to be obtained.</p>

<p>*The acceptance of this legislation, Mr. Speaker, will result in the repeal of 13 existing measures. This Bill may be regarded as a milestone in the history of the legal profession in South Africa. Through excellent co-operation, legislation has now been successfully introduced which will indicate to all interested parties, clearly and on a uniform basis, what the objectives and functions of the various law societies are. I trust that the prestige, status and dignity of the legal profession will be enhanced and promoted by this measure.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is not very often that one feels one should express sympathy with the hon. the Minister, but I must say that on this occasion I express sympathy with him for having had to deliver the same speech on two occasions in exactly the same words. It has had the advantage, however, of enabling us to study this speech. We can find nothing that we can fault in the speech, nor anything that we can fault in the Bill. We would not, in any event, seek to find any fault in the Bill, because this is peculiarly a Bill which has been agreed to by all the law societies throughout the Republic and South West Africa. The wording of it has been agreed upon and we would not, at this stage, like to disturb one word of the Bill. It is indeed, as the hon. the Minister said, a milestone in South African legal history that the individual law societies have agreed to make certain concessions regarding the rights which have long been held proudly by them all, in the interest of finding a common platform without losing their identity and autonomy. It is in the interests of the public that there should be understanding, and a move towards practices which are uniform. I suppose that the legal profession is unique in that the attorneys and the advocates in this country may not be admitted to their profession, nor removed from the practice of their profession, except by order of court, because they are officers of the court. It is all the more pleasing that various societies have found agreement, especially on the compromise of their rules. It is well-known that for years now there has been an attempt to bring about uniformity and a consensus in respect of the manner in which the rules should be improved and in respect of who should eventually control the decisions which are made by each of the law societies. One of the problems, of course, was that some societies did not want their rules to be subject to the approval of the Government, since they were subject to the approval of&#x2014;as the hon. Minister pointed out&#x2014;in some cases a majority of <span class="col_4881-4882" refersTo="page_0854"/>judges, but at any rate in many cases to the control of a court. I think that the compromise that has been reached is an admirable one, namely that the approval, after consultation with the local Judge President, should be sought from the Chief Justice. If the Chief Justice feels that the matter or rule is one which may affect the interests of the public adversely, he can refuse, and only if he refuses, does the Government&#x2019;s approval becomes relevant. I think that it goes without saying that if the Chief Justice feels that any rule made by any of his law societies was not in the public interest, the State President would hesitate to confirm such rule without there being a considerable amount of investigation and discussion. So, we find ourselves in a position&#x2014;as I have said&#x2014;that we not only approve of this measure but feel that at this stage it should not be altered in any way, being as it is a matter of agreement and compromise between the various people concerned.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps there is only one matter on which there might be any difference of opinion and that is the title of the Bill. It appears as if there is a difference of opinion as to whether it should be in Afrikaans &#x201C;Die Wetsontwerp op Prokureursordes&#x201D; as it is now stated, or &#x201C;Wetsontwerp op Wetsgenootskappe&#x201D;, that being the only difference that there appears to be in the ranks of the legal profession.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I may be allowed to say a few words about this Bill, I think it is probably well known that since pre-Union days, since very early times in South Africa, the practise of law has been what can be termed an organized profession. By organizing the profession in the manner in which the law societies and the legal profession in South Africa have been organizing it, I think we have achieved a situation that certain standards have been reached in respect of qualifications of attorneys and of legal people generally, of the discipline exercised by members of the profession and, as a result, of the quality of service offered by members of the legal profession to South Africa as a whole. In 1911, I think it was, just after South Africa became a Union, the four law societies of that time appointed a committee to go into the possibility of and to draw up draft legislation in connection with the bringing into being of an overall South African law society. For many reasons the work done in those days did not bear fruit. I think there was a tremendous amount of vested interests in business and in other professions. Also there was a certain amount of provincialism which achieved pre eminence at the time. Consequently the work of that committee was never completed. It was only in 1934 when an important step forward was taken in the creation of a more unified profession when the original Attorneys, Notaries and Conveyancers Admission Act was passed which governed major aspects of qualifications and of the practice of law. Some four years later, after much discussion, the overall association was founded. This was a major step forward in the founding of co-operation and liaison between attorneys all over the country. Since then progress is continually being made. <i>De Rebus Procuratoriis</i> which used to be the journal of the Law Society of the Transvaal, some years ago was accepted and brought into being as the law society journal for the whole of the profession. This booklet in itself has played an important role in keeping attorneys up to date in the practice of the law and in keeping them informed of new matters which come before Parliament and in discussing the substance of court judgments.</p>

<p>This legislation, as has been said by my hon. colleague for Durban North, is the product of the labours of the hon. the Minister, the Department of Justice, the Association of Law Societies and, I think, of the protracted negotiations which have been conducted by the five law societies in the various provinces. It is the product, therefore, of their co-operation and goodwill. I think I tend to agree with the hon. member for Durban North and with the hon. the Minister, who no doubt will feel this way, that the Bill is as it stands, should not be amended at this stage. Though allowing for provincial nuances and provincial autonomy, this Bill certainly does create a sound foundation which I think <span class="col_4883-4884" refersTo="page_0855"/>will further the unity of purpose in the regulation of the profession and in the conduct of its members. We of the Reform Party therefore welcome the Bill as being to the advantage of the efficient practising of the law and consequently to the advantage of clients and the public.</p>

<p>There are a few problems I would like to mention and I hope that the hon. the Minister will reply to a few of the matters that I want to raise. In mentioning these problems I want to say that I do not wish to move any amendments now. As has been pointed out, the Bill in its present form has been the subject of lengthy negotiations among various societies and it would probably create tremendous problems to go back and try to renegotiate these matters. I do want to mention these problems, however, and ask the hon. the Minister to deal with them and also perhaps to go back to the various parties and find out, if some of the matters I raise warrant it, whether they could not lead to the Bill being amended at a later stage.</p>

<p>The first matter I want to deal with is contained in clause 15(1) of this Bill. Clause 15 is the clause which relates to the powers of the various councils of the law societies concerned. One of the powers granted to such a council is to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">prescribe the allowance on the fees charged by a practitioner for professional services which such practitioner shall be entitled to make to another practitioner or any other person who carries on practice of a lawyer outside the Republic with whom he is not in partnership, in respect of any matter on which they were both engaged.</block>

<p>The problem I want to mention is that in other countries one very often finds people doing jobs and performing functions which in South Africa may well be the functions of an attorney, acting as a member of a law society and as an officer of the court, but such person performing those functions overseas may not in fact be an attorney. In the strict sense of the word he may not in fact even be a lawyer. I am thinking of the case of a tax adviser who may send a tax problem over to a South African attorney because in the field in which he operates in his own particular country he is dealing with a company tax problem which might relate to something in South Africa. He may then send such problem to a South African attorney. I think too of a person who in another country may deal with estates but who need not, in fact, be an attorney. He may deal exclusively with estates. I think, for instance, of a notary in another country who may send work to a South African attorney while he himself does not operate as an attorney in his own country, but exclusively as a notary. It may be correct to state that such people fall under the generic term of &#x201C;lawyer&#x201D; and that the use of that term will cover any problem that might arise. My difficulty is that the term &#x201C;lawyer&#x201D;, as it is mentioned in this Bill, is not defined at all and so I foresee problems in this regard. I would prefer that an allowance should be paid to any lawyer, to call him that, practising outside the Republic, or to any other person as may be prescribed by the council. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will take this problem back to the law societies to see whether we cannot come up with something which gives a little more clarity to the matter.</p>

<p>Another matter I would like to raise is in regard to clause 20. I raise these matters now because I do not intend moving any amendments for reasons I have stated. As far as clause 20 is concerned, we have a situation in terms of which when a practitioner has been convicted of some misdemeanour or other by a council, he can then in terms of the provisions of this clause take the matter on appeal. If the appeal court allows his appeal, although it is not stated here, I assume&#x2014;I think that this is the correct position and I hope the hon. the Minister will confirm it&#x2014;that apart from allowing the practitioner to recover the costs he may have paid to the council in respect of the original inquiry, the appeal court will also allow him to recover the costs of appeal and perhaps, in certain circumstances where it had been found that the case brought against such practitioner was a very weak one, the appeal court would be allowed to recover the costs which may have been incurred by the practitioner when he was found guilty at the original hearing.</p>

<p>I do not think it is.</p>

<p>In relation to clause 21, I should like to know from the hon. the Minister why <span class="col_4885-4886" refersTo="page_0856"/>the Transvaal has been excluded from the provisions of subsection (3). In all the other areas with the exclusion of the Transvaal, the law societies involved have to submit rules to their members in general meeting for approval. It may well be in the interest of the council of the Transvaal, but I do not think it is in the interest of the practitioners, and I think they should be consulted.</p>

<p>One point, which is almost a point of principle, and which I think can be properly raised in the Second Reading debate, is clause 22. It is only a 4-line clause and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No action for damages shall lie against any society, council, member of a council, official or employee of any society or any person with whom a council has concluded any agreement referred to in section 5(g)(ii), in respect of anything done in good faith in terms of this Act.</block>

<p>These are very wide powers, because in terms of this Bill a council has very wide powers. A council may acquire or hire immovable property, draw or endorse cheques and enter into insurance schemes. There are all sorts of things that a council can do, and there are all sorts of things which a council can authorize its employees to do. It is quite clear that this section does not exclude a claim being brought against a council or against an employee or an official of a council who is acting maliciously; clearly the council is still liable, but a claim being brought against the council for its negligent acts, which may in fact have been in good faith, is excluded. I believe that this prejudices aggrieved parties, because it denies to aggrieved parties the remedy of claiming damages for normal delicts. While we should certainly try to protect the council, I believe that in doing this we should not exclude the possibility of claims being brought against the council for normal delicts. In terms of the wording of this clause the council is immune from claims against it for misdemeanours committed in good faith but delictually, misdemeanours which may well cause severe damage to individual persons with whom the council enters into contracts or who are connected with the council itself. I wonder if the hon. the Minister will look at this with a view to further amendment. I do know that the other professional bodies have similar provisions in their constitutions, but I do not approve of such clauses. I do feel that people who have legitimate claims for acts of the council which may have caused them damage should be afforded the right to bring claims against the council. Even attorneys are held liable for the consequences of their acts, and what happens is that attorneys take out insurance to protect themselves. Every attorney makes mistakes from time to time, just as every politician makes mistakes from time to time.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>I am looking at hon. members to my right. What I am saying is that in every profession people make mistakes, but if those errors prejudice other people, whether they be clients or members of the public, and even if those errors, whether they be errors of omission or negligence, are committed in good faith, the attorney concerned is liable to his clients. Normally these people take out insurance, and I feel that while holding attorneys liable to their clients, we should not give the council immunity against claims which may be brought against them because of the negligence of their employees or officials. Sir, this is just a thought which I submit for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s consideration.</p>

<p>Apart from the few points that I have mentioned, this bill is to be welcomed. I think South. Africa has been served well by our legal profession with its high standards. [Interjection.] I often ask myself, Sir, why so many lawyers are in Parliament. I am not sure whether they are in Parliament because of the high, standard of the training they had, which enables them to understand the working and the intricacies of Parliament, or whether they are perhaps in Parliament because they cannot earn a living outside! [Interjections.] However, I think I am correct in saying that the legal profession has over the years done a good job for South Africa. It has provided people for the Civil Service, for the administration of companies and businesses. It has provided even some of the brains of this hon. House, and this Bill plays its role in furthering and maintaining the contributions being made to South Africa by its legal luminaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an uncomfortable situation in which the hon. the Minister and I find ourselves here, in that we have to agree with the hon. member for Durban North as well as with the previous speaker in regard to this Bill. But if it is unfortunate in that respect, it is fortunate in another respect, which is that we have before us here today the example of a piece of legislation&#x2014;and here I want to agree with hon. members&#x2014;on a profession which sets very high moral standards for itself. The result of those high standards which the profession has set for itself over the years, has in fact been that even provincial differences are in a certain sense being eliminated in this legislation. But having said this I really must rectify what an hon. member of the Other Place said, namely when he alleged that this legislation was a typical example of what we are going to find under a federal system of government. I should like to state here that we are not dealing here with a federation of law societies, but with a confederation of law societies. Perhaps it would help the hon. members on the opposite side of this House if they were rather to make a proper study of this Bill and then decide whether they are still able to refer to a federation or whether they should not rather refer to a confederation.</p>

<p>Sir, I have said this Bill is an example of a high professional standard which is being set. I also want to say that this Bill is an example of the very strict discipline to which the various law societies subject themselves. We on this side of the House not only welcome this piece of legislation, but think that it will serve to make the dignity of the profession and the integrity of the profession, as well as the services rendered by the profession to the community even more effective.</p>

<p>On this occasion I should like to convey a word of thanks to the profession for the services which the profession have been rendering so selflessly in respect of the rural areas. I think the attorneys&#x2019; profession in the rural areas is playing a special role, which I think is generally regarded as being of great value.</p>

<p>The hon. members, who preceded me, had a problem with clause 15 as far as allowances are concerned. This concerns allowances in regard to persons who may possibly do similar work abroad. Sir, it is a known fact in South Africa that it is only the legal profession, as a profession <i>per se,</i> which has a form of allowance, in terms of which another profession is compensated for services rendered to that profession. All that is now going to be regulated in clause 15 is that where functions are performed abroad by people similar to those performed internally by attorneys here in South Africa, attention can be given to giving those people allowances as well. But this does not apply to other similar professions. An overseas firm of auditors will be able to receive certain allowances from a firm of attorneys in South Africa if that firm of auditors renders certain services, while a firm of auditors within South Africa will not, if it renders the same services as that foreign firm, receive a similar allowance from a firm of attorneys in South Africa. I think we should be very careful not to deviate from the old practice, which I think is a sound practice, that allowances should only be paid between firms of attorneys on a professional legal basis. In this respect, however, I think that an exception may be made, particularly since we are dealing with certain activities which may be performed abroad. I am thinking in particular of our neighbouring states, where firms of attorneys are not always available to do certain types of work. I do not think that we should extend this tendency internally. We should be very careful in how we deal with this matter.</p>

What I and the hon. member fear in respect of the cost of appeal I think will be eliminated by section 87(6) of the Magistrates&#x2019; Court Act.

<p>Mr. Speaker, my only reason for rising is to thank hon. members for supporting this measure. This is an important measure because it is a milestone in the legal profession in that attorneys have succeeded for the first time to come together and devise for themselves a common constitution for their activities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sandton raised certain matters and if he will give me his attention, I should like to discuss these matters with him. I am referring to clause 15(1). The hon. member wanted to know whether it would be possible to effect an amendment in this respect. He proposed: &#x201C;by any person who may be prescribed by the council&#x201D;. In other words, what he wanted was that the councils should decide which foreign attorneys should be accepted as attorneys in South Africa. Am I correct&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should not argue now. He can get up again to make another speech later on if he wants to do so. Clause 15(1) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prescribe the allowance on the fees charged by a practitioner for professional services which such practitioner shall be entitled to make to another practitioner or to any other person who carries on the practice of a lawyer outside the Republic with whom he is not in partnership &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, when the law societies refer to a &#x201C;legal practitioner&#x201D; they mean a legal practitioner in terms of the law of the Republic. This complies entirely with what the hon. member envisages in this amendment. He says the law societies should be able to lay down what kind of people shall be legal practitioners abroad, but the legislation itself refers to legal practitioners and should mean legal practitioners in the South African sense of the word. In other words, when the law societies find that it is a legal practice abroad in the sense of legal practices within the Republic, they may prescribe the fees. The Bill therefore complies entirely with what the hon. member wants.</p>

<p>As far as clause 20 is concerned, I think that the hon. member for Schweizer Reneke has replied fully to the argument raised by the hon. member. I think the hon. member lost sight of section 87 of the Magistrates&#x2019; Court Act. Clause 20(4) lays down that an appeal &#x201C;shall be prosecuted as if it were an appeal from a judgment of a magistrate&#x2019;s court in a civil matter, and all rules applicable to such last-mentioned appeal in respect of the hearing thereof shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply to an appeal under this section&#x201D;.</p>

<p><span class="col_4891-4892" refersTo="page_0859"/>&#x2020;Section 87 of the Magistrates&#x2019; Court Act provides for the procedure of a court of appeal. In terms of paragraph (e), the court of appeal may make such order as to costs as justice may require.</p>

<p>*Since the manner in which the costs should be determined is already laid down in the Magistrates&#x2019; Court Act, it is therefore not necessary to include it in this Bill.</p>

<p>As far as clause 21 is concerned, the hon. member wanted to know who it was that asked for their exclusion from this particular provision. The Law Society of the Transvaal is not prepared to deviate from the existing arrangement in this connection. The Law Society has had this arrangement for many years and was not prepared to sacrifice it. However, they made a very important concession. Clause 21(2) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any rule referred to in subsection (1) &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member had no objection to this, but he brought it to our attention&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; shall be made with the approval of the Chief Justice of South Africa and, if the Chief Justice is of the opinion that the interests of the public would be adversely affected by the provisions of any such rule, with the approval of the State President.</block>

<p>This is a particularly important concession made by the Law Society of the Transvaal. In my respectful submission, this is a concession which complies entirely with the spirit of that which the other law societies have. I want to deal with this matter very briefly, because my time is running out. The hon. member also referred to clause 22, which contains provisions in connection with negligence. For the sake of completeness I quote this clause again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No action for damages shall lie against any society, council, member of a council, official or employee of any society or any person with whom a council has concluded any agreement referred to in section 5(g)(ii), in respect of anything done in good faith in terms of this Act.</block>

<p>If I understood the hon. member&#x2019;s argument correctly, it meant that when we say that anything has been done &#x201C;in good faith&#x201D;, it means that the persons concerned are indemnified. Is that correct&#x003F;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hon. member says that if a person has been negligent, negligent in good faith, he is now being indemnified. My respectful submission is that when it comes to negligence or guilt and the exclusion thereof, the legislature would never do so unless it specifically does so in an Act. In other words, when referring to &#x201C;in good faith&#x201D;, it does not include negligence. Negligence implies guilt and it has to be excluded specifically. Therefore it could only be &#x201C;in good faith&#x201D; in respect of which there is no question of negligence. If my argument is correct, there is no need for the law societies to consider any amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The aim of the Bill is to amend various statutory provisions which apply to the Railways. The implications of the various clauses are explained in the explanatory memorandum which has already been tabled, and therefore I shall only elaborate on it briefly.</p>

<p>Although section 13 of the Railway Expropriation Act, 1955, provides for powers of expropriation with relation to the construction of pipelines, the possibility exists that the Railway Administration&#x2019;s powers to construct a pipeline before all the expropriation formalities have been dealt with, may be disputed. For technical reasons it is impractical to determine the precise route of the pipeline before expropriation has been completed, and therefore it is necessary <span class="col_4893-4894" refersTo="page_0860"/>that the Railway Administration should have the power to construct a pipeline first and expropriate the servitude afterwards. Without such powers, the construction of pipelines which are urgently necessary could he delayed for a long time, something which, in certain circumstances, may seriously prejudice national interest. The amendments which are being proposed in clause 1 to 5 are aimed at placing the Administration&#x2019;s powers to construct pipelines without previous expropriation of servitudes beyond all doubt.</p>

<p>Hon. members will probably remember that in the Expropriation Bill, introduced in the House of Assembly by my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, during the 1974 session of Parliament, provision was made so as to place beyond doubt the Railways&#x2019; powers to construct pipelines without previous expropriation of servitudes. However, as a result of the decision to construct a third pipeline for petroleum products from Durban to the Rand and since the abovementioned Bill is presently being investigated by a Select Committee and will presumably not become operative soon, it has been decided, in view of the urgency of the matter, to amend the applicable Railway Act correspondingly as quickly as possible. The Railway Expropriation Act confers no substantive right of expropriation to the Administration, according to legal opinion, but only provides for the procedure which has to be followed after expropriation. Therefore it has been considered advisable to consolidate the necessary expropriation powers in the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act, Act No. 70 of 1957. It is intended to repeal certain existing and related provisions in the Railway Expropriation Act at the same time or to adjust these and adopt them in the Control and Management Act in order to group all the powers with respect to expropriation and related matters together with the Administration&#x2019;s other powers in the latter Act.</p>

<p>Clauses 6 and 9 are intended to make provision for amended scales of compensation for cattle, sheep, goats and pigs which are killed or injured while being transported by rail or while on a railway line. The scale of compensation is adjusted to place it on a more realistic level. The new amounts were recommended by the S.A. Agricultural Union and are supported by the Department of Agricultural Economy and Marketing.</p>

<p>Representations for the appointment of railway servants on a voluntary basis as reservists in the Railway Police Force were addressed to my predecessor in 1973 by the Railway Police staff association and clause 7 is aimed at making that provision. The intention is that the conditions of service of these reservists will be the same as those applicable to service in the S.A. Police Force. To promote efficiency, the reservists will not form a separate force and the Railway Police Force will therefore consist of permanent and reserve members.</p>

<p>With clause 8 it is envisaged that the compensation for the making and maintenance of a fire-break on land which borders on the Railway line be increased.</p>

<p>The aim of clause 10 is to make provision for the termination of a servant&#x2019;s service before the date of his superannuation, after this has been mutually agreed by the servant and the Department. Existing railway legislation makes no provision for the termination, before superannuation of a servant&#x2019;s services for reasons other than those mentioned in sections 10, 11 and 12 of Act 22 of 1960, i.e. inefficiency, reduction in or reorganization of staff, severe bodily injury, ill-health or physical disability. It is considered necessary that there should be a measure of flexibility in this connection.</p>

<p>The aim of clause 11 is to amend the provisions of section 14 of the Railway and Harbour Services Act, 1960, in order to bring the conditions with respect to the provisions of the value of accumulated leave at retirement into line with those which apply in the Public Service.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The purpose of clause 12 is to raise the maximum retiring age of pilots, navigators and flight engineer officers in the Airways department from 55 to 58 years. The request for a higher retiring age emanated from the staff and is supported by the department as it is desirable, bearing in mind the expansion of the S.A. Airways, that the services of experienced flying personnel be retained for as long as possible.</p>

<p>Clause 13 provides for a consequential amendment to the Railways and Harbours Service Act, 1960, arising from the change in designation of the grade of ticket examiner to that of conductor. <span class="col_4895-4896" refersTo="page_0861"/>Concerning clause 14, I wish to explain that, in terms of section 32 of the Railways and Harbours Service Act, changes approved by the Administration in conditions of employment prescribed by regulation may be brought into operation from a date specified by the Administration pending approval by the State President of the amended regulations, provided that such approval is obtained within three months from the date of notification to the staff. For administrative reasons it is not always possible to observe these conditions and it has, therefore, on occasion in the past been necessary to obtain parliamentary validation of the action taken. Hon. members may recall that, last year, during the debate on the Railways and Harbours Acts Amendment Bill, 1974, the hon. member for Durban Point in dealing with the validation clause suggested that suitable steps be taken which would render it unnecessary for the Department having to approach Parliament annually to validate certain of the actions during the year. In order to overcome the problem, it is proposed to amend the relevant section to dispense with the prescribed time factor and to provide for regulations made in terms thereof and amendments thereto, being made with retrospective effect.</p>

<p>I now come to clause 15. Arising from the decision to grant salaried status to the staff in the employee grades, it is necessary to amend section 1 of the Railways and Harbours Pensions Act, Act 35 of 1971, to permit, where desirable for pay purposes, of the time worked by such staff to continue to be calculated from the 16th day of a month to the 15th day of the following month, as provided for in this clause.</p>

<p>The amendment proposed in clause 16 allows for the utilization, for housing loans, of moneys vested in the Administration in terms of section 19 of the Railways and Harbours Pensions Act, 1971. To assist the staff to a greater extent in acquiring their own homes, it is the intention to introduce a new scheme, which will be known as the House Ownership Scheme with Pension Fund Assistance, with retrospective effect from 1 April 1975.</p>

<p>The purpose of clause 17 is to obtain parliamentary ratification of the amended guarantee agreement between the Administration and the Transvaal Coal Owners Association in respect of the construction of the guaranteed single line of railway between Ermelo and Broodsnyersplaas. The original agreement, which forms a schedule to the Second Railway Construction Act, Act No. 83 of 1971, was concluded at the time on the basis that the line would be constructed and equipped by a consortium of local and/or foreign contractors and would be financed with the aid of export credits and other foreign and/or internal loan facilities in accordance with certain stipulations and conditions. The tenders received from the consortiums were, however, considerably higher than the departmental estimates, and it was consequently decided not to accept the tenders but to invite tenders afresh on an amended basis whereby the scheme would be financed in the normal manner. Other amendments which were effected at the same time primarily concern the guarantee of operating losses over the line, the rail rate, export tonnages and the guarantee period. The amended Guarantee Agreement forms a schedule to the Bill.</p>

<p>In terms of section 1 of the Railways and Harbours Loans Act, 1973, the General Manager may, subject to ministerial approval, raise money by way of loans to finance expected expenditure in respect of capital and betterment works and enter into any agreement for this purpose. As the General Manager may not always be available at the time when an agreement is to be negotiated, it is deemed necessary that he be authorized to delegate the powers in question to such person as he may decide as and when necessary. Clause 18 provides accordingly.</p>

<p>Clause 19 empowers the Administration to enter into a working agreement with the Rhodesia Railways to provide for interworking over the new railway line from Rutenga to Beit Bridge. Normally agreements of this nature are entered into in terms of section 2(3) of the Railways and Harbours Control and Management (Consolidation) Act, 1957, but as the construction of Beit Bridge was financed from funds donated by the Alfred Beit Trustees, a special agreement was entered into in 1927 at Government level to provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the maintenance <span class="col_4897-4898" refersTo="page_0862"/>of Beit Bridge and the working of the railway line traversing it. The agreement was validated by Parliament by the Railways Construction Act, 1927, and amended by the Messina-Limpopo Railway (Supplementary Agreement) Act, 1942. The purpose of this clause is to bring the new agreement into line with the normal practice but for historical reasons and as the 1927 enactment also provides for matters not related to Beit Bridge, it is not considered expedient to repeal the relevant Acts.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the Bill which has just been explained by the hon. the Minister is interesting in the sense that it is not monotonous, because it deals with a great variety of matters. It deals with the question of expropriation, with the question of compensation for animals which might be killed or injured, with staff matters and with the question of foreign loans; even with international arrangements between Rhodesia and the Railways as well, and a new agreement between the Transvaal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association and the Railways&#x2014;matters therefore of a diverse nature. I should just like to comment on a few of these matters.</p>

<p>The first one is the question of expropriation. The hon. the Minister said that although there is a Select Committee that is investigating the question of expropriation, he is nevertheless satisfied that the provisions of this Bill are not in conflict with the work of the committee. Under the circumstances he apparently thought fit to continue with the Bill. Actually, Sir, there is only one new principle which is being introduced here and that is, as the hon. the Minister said, that expropriation may take place after a pipeline has been constructed. In view of the technical problems with which the department is faced, this side of the House has no problem as far as that matter is concerned, and therefore we support that principle.</p>

<p>Sir, then there is the question of compensation for animals, I was glad to hear that the S.A. Agricultural Union have approved the compensation which will be paid, because it is of course impossible for me as a consumer to judge whether the values which are stipulated here are too high or too low. The prices which I pay are considerably higher. But I want to refer to another point which to me seems strange. We often speak of differentiation and discrimination in this House. Here I find gross discrimination against that animal species which is called the pig. The values of all the animals are being increased, except for those of pigs, which are being decreased. I do not know what the hon. the Minister has against pigs, but it is strange to me that pigs should be discriminated against. I think the hon. the Minister should reconsider the matter. In my opinion, not even Noah would have agreed with this. The pig is also an animal, and from what I know of meat prices, one pays considerably more for pork today. If hon. members who are in the agricultural industry would perhaps like to comment on this, they may do so in the Committee Stage. As far as this side of the House is concerned, we are satisfied that in this connection the Bill is acceptable as it stands at the moment.</p>

<p>The other point which I want to raise deals with the question of housing. I think it is a very good idea that pensions fund moneys may now be used for investment in housing for the staff. Normally one has to wait for one&#x2019;s pension moneys until one retires. Now we have the very sound situation, in my humble opinion, that one can derive benefit from the funds which are established for pensions while one is still living. However, a new point is being introduced here. For the first time I notice that there might be losses on the investments which are made by the fund and that the fund will bear the losses. That is something new to me, and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could just explain to us whether this particular principle or idea has been introduced with a view to the investment which will now be made in housing.</p>

<p>Then lastly, Sir, various amendments are being affected as far as the staff are concerned. Perhaps some of them are onerous, but throughout they are generally to the advantage of the officials. If there is a clause which will have an onerous effect on the personnel, then I would be glad if the hon. the Minister will give this House <span class="col_4899-4900" refersTo="page_0863"/>the assurance that that particular clause has been introduced with the approval and co-operation of the various staff associations. I am especially worried about the raising of the retiring age of certain people who are connected with the Airways and of whom the highest degree of competence is required to be able to do that work. Since the retiring age has now been increased from 55 to 58 years, I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether that has also been done with the approval of the staff associations. I am aware that the provision that one may retire at 50 years of age still remains, but I should like to have the assurance that this amendment has been made with the approval of the staff associations.</p>

<p>Sir, those are the only remarks I want to make about the Bill. For the rest this side of the House supports the Bill.</p>

<p>Let me just say a few words about the discrimination against the pig. The discrimination is not there just because a pig is a pig; this has been done in co-operation with the responsible bodies, <i>inter alia,</i> the SA. Agricultural Union. These prices on which we decided are the prevailing prices as recommended by the S.A. Agricultural Union in 1973.</p>

<p>I should like to read to you what the Agricultural Union wrote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Therefore the Union requests that the prices which have to be paid should at least be in agreement with the slaughter-values of 1973. According to the attached information which has been obtained from the Meat Board, these are R154 for cattle, R28 for calves, R17 for sheep and goats, R26 for pigs.</block>

<p>There were subsequent negotiations with the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing as well and that department recommended prices in respect of pigs were even a little lower. The recommendation of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing in respect of pigs was R24,27. It was felt that the prices as recommended by the Agricultural Union, which were actually a little higher in respect of pigs, viz. R26, were more realistic and therefore we accepted them that way. I just want to say that in respect of all these provisions in this legislation which affect officials, the officials were properly consulted. It is obvious that this new Home Ownership Scheme for which we are going to use pension funds, is generally welcomed by the staff and that the staff was consulted in all these various negotiations. The hon. member also referred to the increased age of the pilots. There too I can just say that we would obviously not effect such an amendment if negotiations had not taken place with the officials concerned, and this had not met with their approval. Therefore, I can give the hon. member the assurance that the negotiations were properly conducted, as they affected those aspects of the legislation which affect the personnel.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half hour&#x003F; It has been said before that the Cabinet is very much like a board of directors of a company. In the sense that there is a close resemblance between running a business and running the business of the State, this analogy is useful to us in assessing the various portfolios. The hon. the Minister of Labour is very much in the position of a director of personnel. He is the manpower man. We here in Parliament have the opportunity once a year&#x2014;and this in actual fact is the essence of Parliament&#x2014; to assess the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s performance against certain minimum requirements. We do not have in mind the kind of poll that was conducted by the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> recently. The hon. the Minister did not shape too well in this poll but I do not wish to push that particular issue at the moment. We also realize the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s sensitivity in this regard. I should like to say that those of us on these benches have also developed a certain sensitivity to this kind of poll and it will probably be left to the hon. member for Sea Point to learn that whilst it is bad to have an albatross around you, it is infinitely worse to have a Pegasus around your neck. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What we want to advance as our main theme in this particular debate is that the Government&#x2019;s labour policy has come to the end of the road and that in view of the very dramatic advances around us it is necessary, and urgently so, that there be sweeping change. If it were necessary for us to obtain support from outside, for this view we could obtain no better support than the report which has just been published of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. In the portions of that report dealing with labour, every single thing we have said over the past five years has been fully vindicated. The question arises now, if the Government has got a high-powered body of this kind, if the Government has got an Economic Advisory Council, is the Government going to take notice of the recommendations that council makes&#x003F; We have ample evidence to show that in the past the Government has not done so. It is quite clear that where one has important people devoting their time to this kind of activity, one has either to take notice of what they say or else one has to disband such a council altogether.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>In looking at the portfolio handled by the hon. the Minister, it is clear to us that in his capacity as director of manpower, the hon. the Minister controls a vast amount of money and he has had vast powers vested in him. The Budget which we have before us provides for an amount of about R18 million for the Department of Labour. The hon. the Minister has a staff of more than 2 000 people who are permanently assigned to this department. Whilst this may be small by government standards, the body of people concerned with this particular department is very substantial by any other yardstick.</p>

<p>We want to discuss with the hon. the Minister in particular the function and activities of his department but before doing so, there are two smaller matters that I want to raise. The hon. the Minister also has certain administrative obligations. For example, he is in charge of certain funds which fall under the general heading of social security. Latest reports indicate that the Unemployment Insurance Fund which is administered by his department has invested an amount of R160 million with the Public Debt Commissioners. This is a vast sum of money. It is perfectly proper to have insurance in life but when one overinsures, it is either bad business or else it shows that one has qualms about one&#x2019;s own chances of survival. Where the hon. the Minister has the vast sum of R160 million in his Unemployment Insurance Fund, we would like to <span class="col_4903-4904" refersTo="page_0865"/>know where he is going to draw the line. How much additional money does he want&#x003F; Does he not think that if one has this kind of money in the Unemployment Insurance Fund, people might construe it as a lack of confidence in the economic future of South Africa&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is a second fund which the hon. the Minister controls, viz. the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund. According to reports, this fund has an annual income of about R32 million and the statutory reserve at the moment stands at R42 million. The same question arises in this regard. We want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he regards these reserves as adequate or whether he wants to continue to accumulate reserves and, if so, what does he have in mind to do with this money&#x003F;</p>

<p>What we are primarily concerned with here today is to discuss with the hon. the Minister the duties and functions of his particular department. We have the distinct impression that there is uncertainty as to what these powers and duties ought to be. We would, in fact, like to get from the hon. the Minister himself his understanding of his primary tasks. As far as this activity of manpower control is concerned, it seems to us, particularly at the present time, that it is vitally important that lines of communication and areas of authority be clearly demarcated. We want to suggest that, in looking at the labour issue, there are two ways in which one can approach it generally. One can decentralize this activity altogether, in which case each Minister will handle his own labour issues individually&#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Mines will look after mining labour, the hon. the Minister of Agriculture after agricultural labour and so forth&#x2014;but experience elsewhere in the world has shown that in view of the importance of labour, in view of the fact that it is so closely integrated with one&#x2019;s entire economic activity, it is desirable to centralize the labour activity to the greatest possible extent. In South Africa at the moment we believe that it is not at all clear where the Government stands on this issue. When we raise the question of disturbances on the mines, it is the hon. the Minister of Mines who replies not the hon. the Minister of Labour. We get the impression that the Minister of Labour feels that his area of jurisdiction does not go beyond the Industrial Conciliation Act, and in fact he does not operate unless the matter is covered by an industrial council agreement. On the other hand, the jurisdiction of the Minister of Mines is limited by the Mines and Works Act. The moment you begin to involve Black people, then it provides a temptation for the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to interfere, a temptation which he can never resist. We find at the moment, for example, that training schools for Black people are somehow under the control of the Minister of Bantu Administration. When there is talk, as there is at the moment, of designing a charter for migratory workers, then the initiative is taken by the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. We regard this as a very laudatory effort and we support him fully, because we have asked for this over a long period of time. But, Sir, where does the Ministry of Labour fit into this&#x003F; If it is a charter for migratory workers, one would expect the Department of Labour to take the initiative, but somehow this is not done. I want to say that there is every evidence at the moment that the Minister of Labour is being by-passed, because the great employers of labour find that some of the colleagues of the hon. the Minister are more flexible and less pedantic in their interpretation of Government policy. They find that this hon. Minister, instead of being a source of encouragement to them, is a source of harassment, and hence they tend to by-pass him. Although this may work well in practice, it means that in the Department of Labour itself, where we have a vast degree of expertise, where we have a tremendous amount of competence, this expertise, this know-how, this competence, is not available to South Africa on the widest possible front.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another way, too, in which one can look at this general problem. In the past we have tended to think in terms of White labour and Coloured labour and Black labour. This obviously has a relevance; it always has had and will continue to have a relevance, but every piece of research that is done nowadays suggests that the basic needs of workers are the same, and I believe that what seemed to us at one stage to be clear demarcations and boundaries will in time to come tend to become blurred. I think the sooner we can begin to think in this country in terms of workers as such, the better. But, every time we talk about labour&#x2014;and I have just taken the trouble to look through the debates of the last two or three years&#x2014;what we get from the hon. the Minister and those who <span class="col_4905-4906" refersTo="page_0866"/>support him on that side is that they see themselves as the campaigners for the White workers, and they say so every time; they say, &#x201C;They vote for us; they have put us here, and they will always vote for us.&#x201D; This is an odd assessment of the Minister&#x2019;s task as Minister of Labour. Surely the hon. the Minister of Labour must cope with all labour in both the functional and in the ethnic sense. It is only when you begin to see yourself as being in control of all forms of labour and as being helpful to all forms of labour that you are discharging your function, and surely that must be the Government&#x2019;s philosophy. We are told that there is going to be no discrimination in future. On this issue, too, we would like the hon. the Minister to tell us precisely how he sees his task and where he stands. If we relate this to what Dr. Norval wrote in <i>Rapport</i> over the weekend&#x2014;and he dealt with other Government departments &#x2014;then this much is clear: We have here an organizational structure in the Cabinet that has not changed fundamentally over the last 50 years. Our suggestion would be that the hon. the Prime Minister should immediately look into the whole Government organizational system, because there are quite obviously gaps and hiati and also overlaps. The whole organization must be streamlined and restructured.</p>

<p>Sir, as I have indicated, what we really want to discuss with the hon. the Minister today is his primary function, his primary duty, as he sees it. Whenever we have a debate, what we get from the hon. the Minister tends to be negative. He always says, &#x201C;ons sal nie die sluise ooptrek nie&#x201D;, or he says, &#x201C;Job reservation will go over my dead body.&#x201D; It is always negative. There is never anything positive from him. We have never heard the hon. the Minister say, &#x201C;I am going to make it my task to increase productivity by 5% during the coming year.&#x201D; We have never heard him say: &#x201C;I am going to give South Africa 20 000 new artisans within the next year.&#x201D; There is, in fact, never anything positive; there is always this negative approach. He never tells us what he is going to do for the country, but he always tells us what he is not going to permit.</p>

<p>We shall put to the hon. the Minister our approach for the labour problem and we would like him very much in this debate to spell out what his policy objectives are. We have indicated in the past that we take our stance on the following issues: We will study the labour needs and requirements of the economy and we will co-ordinate them on a nation-wide scale; we accept that Black workers in the urban areas are a permanent element of our industrial force and we will deal with them accordingly; and we recognize that it is necessary to provide statutorily for collective bargaining rights for all workers. In this connection we have said that while we accept the works committees and the liaison committees system, we see these committees as complementary to and not as a substitute for trade unions, and we have said that we recognize the right of trade unions to negotiate agreements enforceable in law. We have indicated that we are opposed to the reservation of work on the basis of a person&#x2019;s skin colour, and we have indicated that we would apply realistically the principle of equal pay for equal work entailing equal responsibility. We have indicated that we would make a point of providing vocational education for workers and extend apprenticeship training to all race groups. We have said that all workers irrespective of race should enjoy the full social security benefits commensurate with their employment categories. And we said, finally, that we would implement labour policies dictated by the human and economic needs of South Africa and its people and not by ideological considerations. Sir, that is what we take our stance on. We would like to hear in this debate where the hon. the Minister disagrees with those policy issues that we have put forward. We would like to hear from him precisely what his policies are. Because, you see, Sir, there is now a new situation in South Africa. We are told that there is going to be no discrimination in future and consequently the hon. the Minister will obviously have to make major adaptations to his labour policy. I can think of no better opportunity to put these forward than precisely during this debate.</p>

<p>But, I will indicate where the differences lie and I want to mention just one or two aspects to show where the differences lie. An important field is that of productivity because this is one which is emphasized in the report of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. This body has indicated the steps that ought to be taken. But what is not generally realized, is that the wealth of the country in <i>per capita</i> terms is directly related to the productivity of its labour. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister &#x2014;because he will never give us these statistics&#x2014;that productivity in South Africa <span class="col_4907-4908" refersTo="page_0867"/>is at the moment at a disastrously low level. In comparison with most of the economically advanced countries of the world, the growth in our productivity is very much lower. We are, in fact, at the bottom of the league. Recently, at a symposium in Sweden, they dealt with precisely this issue, and I want to give the committee just two different indices. The first one which they used at this symposium in Sweden, was the output per unit of input, which is an ordinarily understood index in the productivity field. Here they dealt with the issue and expressed it as a percentage. They quote 12 different countries. In France it was 82%, in Belgium it was 74%, in the United Kingdom it was 54% while South Africa was way down at the bottom of the league at 23%. But this is not the kind of statistics that we will hear in this House from that side, because anything not in favour of that Government is conveniently forgotten and swept under the carpet. But let us look at the manufacturing industry, which is one of the most important sectors in productivity. I might just remind the hon. members that whilst in 1920 manufacturing was responsible for only 7% of our GNP, at the moment it is responsible for about 25%. What they used here too is an index called PLU, i.e. the production per labour unit. They made a comparison between the 17 developing countries in the world. They took 1963 as their basis with an index of 100%. They then expressed what the productivity of these countries was in 1972; which was 10 years later. For Japan it was found that the index then was 228%. This means that their productivity had more than doubled over the 10 year period. For a country like Canada the index was 142. Again, however, we find that South Africa by a significant margin is way at the bottom of the whole list. Our index is 102. What this means is that, over a period of 10 years, the increase in productivity in South Africa as expressed in the PLU index had gone up by only two points. This means that we have run very far and have worked very hard in order to stand still and to remain exactly where we were.</p>

<p>I think we are entitled to an explanation from the hon. the Minister of Labour. He is in charge of labour, while the whole productivity issue centres around the employment and utilization of the available human resources. I think this Committee should demand an explanation from the hon. the Minister of why these figures are so low. But the answer is, in fact, simple, We can tell the hon. the Minister why. The explanation for this low productivity figure is locked up in two little words, i.e. &#x201C;Government ideology&#x201D;. One of the things that gives great impetus to growth in productivity is mobility of labour. This means that labour must be able to move laterally from your less productive sectors in the economy to the more productive ones. This Government, however, is stopping what ought to be a natural movement through the application of the Physical Planning Act. Secondly, labour must be mobile in the sense that it must move vertically, from lower paid and lesser skilled jobs to higher paid and higher skilled jobs. Here, again, the Government is blocking it through the application of its job reservation procedures. What ought to give normal impetus to increased productivity is by way of deliberate Government policy, in this case being blocked.</p>

<p>What also leads to a low growth in productivity is poor training. Here again, it has been shown in America that the national income was increased by 22% as a result of improved and increased education and training. In this regard we know of all the difficulties we have had in the past to get the hon. the Minister to accept the need for dynamic new initiatives in training. How well we remember it, when we talked about a crash training programme, how the hon. the Minister sneered at us. Recently, however, we found that Prof. Hennie Reynders&#x2014;certainly his <i>bona fides</i> should be acceptable to the Government&#x2014;expressed himself as follows when talking about the Government&#x2019;s responsibilities in this field. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Much more need be done. Indeed, as far as training is concerned, a crash programme is indicated.</block>

<p>Does the Government still sneer at us&#x003F; Prof. Sadie indicated only a few months ago that by 1980, which is only five years away, 2/3rds of the industrial work force in South Africa will be Black and they will have to provide their own substructure of managers and technicians. What is the Government doing to meet these requirements&#x003F; That is what we would like to know and that is what this debate is about. I do not believe that the hon. the Minister has any idea of the magnitude of the task that faces him. If he cannot meet these <span class="col_4909-4910" refersTo="page_0868"/>requirements, it in fact amounts to sabotage of South Africa&#x2019;s interests.</p>

<p>The Economic Development Programme, to turn to another issue, says that in order to attain this growth rate, which they have specified as being 6,4%&#x2014; let us be honest about it they would have liked to set a higher one, but they cannot do it because we do not have the skilled manpower&#x2014;is dependent on getting a net immigration figure of 30 000 people a year. We are not going to get anything like it, because the hon. the Minister of Immigration is so busy adjusting the Government&#x2019;s sports policy that he cannot cope with immigration. Even if we did meet this net immigration of 30 000 people per year, the EDP makes it quite clear that there would still be a need for 60 000 skilled workers. Again we ask the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;Where are these going to come from&#x003F; Where are the schemes he has in mind at the moment to give us those skilled workers&#x003F;&#x201D; Unless we can get these skilled workers we do not have a chance of meeting the economic development target figure.</p>

<p>I turn to just one other issue. The Government has told us that they will close the wage gap in South Africa. The Prime Minister is committed to it, because he said that he would close the wage gap. What is the situation at the moment&#x003F; I do not think hon. members realize what is happening. It is quite clear that the disparity is still immense. Jan Marais has given the <i>per capita</i>-income of the White man in South Africa today as 3 150 dollars. For the Coloureds he gives a figure of about one tenth of that, viz. 350 dollars. For the Black man he has given a figure half of that of the Coloured man, viz. 185 dollars. In manufacturing industry, which is at least that sector of the economy where there ought to be a much smaller gap, we find according to figures given recently by the FCI, that the average income for Whites is R400 per month and for Blacks R70 per month. What this means is that the gap is the equivalent of 80% of the White rate. Put differently, it means that the wages of the Blacks will have to be increased by six times in order to catch up with those of the Whites. Now, every time we hear from the Government that they are closing the gap, because when the Whites get a 10% increase the Blacks have often been given a 20% increase. This, in their arithmetic means closing the gap. Of course it does not do anything of the kind. In absolute terms it means that the gap is increasing. In fact, this is borne out by statistics which were recently released by the Department of Statistics, whereby they show that in 1969 the gap between average White and Black wages was R229 and that in 1973 it had jumped to R312. We want to know what the Government has in mind and how this Minister is going to close this gap. He is faced with a very difficult situation. Whereas in a country like America, the ratio between the earnings of skilled workers and unskilled workers is of the order of 1&#x00BD;:1, in South Africa the ratio between the earnings of skilled workers and unskilled workers is of the order of 8:1. What is this due to&#x003F; First of all, it is due to differences in educational level between, generally speaking, White and non-White workers. Secondly, it is due to differences in job structure. Thirdly, it is due to differences in industrial bargaining procedures and, fourthly, it is due to the fact that there is unemployment among the Black people. Some people estimate that, at the moment, this unemployment figure is growing at the rate of almost 100 000 people per year. Here we have a commitment by the hon. the Prime Minister, who said that he was going to close the wage gap while the figure that I have given, point to the fact that the wage gap is, in absolute terms, in fact increasing. Again we want to know from the hon. the Minister what he is doing about it, what his policy is and what constructive steps are being taken by him to make sure that this gap will be narrowed. He cannot do this unless he completely restructures the whole of the work force. Here again, he will immediately have difficulty as far as his own ideology is concerned.</p>

<p>I refer just to a simple issue like job reservation. [Interjections.] I do not know why hon. members are so unhappy to hear about job reservation. The hon. the Minister has said only over his dead body will job reservation go.</p>

<p>The hon. member must tell us what his reactions and solutions are. Dr. Willem de Villiers&#x2014;his credentials should be acceptable to the Government, because he is the managing director of General Mining&#x2014;said recently that job reservation was a dead letter and <span class="col_4911-4912" refersTo="page_0869"/>that if we want to meet South Africa&#x2019;s economic commitments it should go.</p>

<p>I refer now to the recent negotiations in the building industry, and specifically to the recommendations that have come from the tribunal, recommendations which were accepted by the Minister with alacrity. One must remember what is happening in the building industry. We do not have enough artisans and we cannot fill the skilled positions. That is why building costs are skyrocketing as they are. The Government in the meantime, to circumvent this, has introduced a new category of labour called &#x201C;first-class workers&#x201D;, whom they say could be Black, and who, in fact, generally would be Black, who could do all sorts of jobs previously done by Whites. The department must, of course, operate within the framework set by the Minister, and against this background the department now issues a statement about job reservation. If one can find a statement which is more confused or more indicative of the failure of Government policy, I still want to see it. This is what is said in this statement; these are the recommendations which have been accepted by the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) That work reservation must be retained, but that it ought to be applied on a more uniform basis than at present.</li>

<li>(2) That rural areas ought to be excluded from work reservation.</li>

<li>(3) That work reservation ought to be applicable to urban areas falling under the jurisdiction of Building Industrial Councils only, but then also to some other important growth points where Industrial Councils have no jurisdiction, i.e. Richards Bay, Rustenburg and Pietersburg.</li>

<li>(4) That the Industrial Council areas of Kimberley and others, where circumstances are the same as those pertaining in rural areas, must be excluded from work reservation.</li>

<li>(5) That certain work which is less skilled, and which is normally no longer being performed by skilled artisans, ought to be excluded from work reservation.</li>

<li>(6) That Coloured artisans ought to be permitted more readily to perform skilled work in the industry, even also in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, subject, however, to certain conditions and not to the detriments of Whites.</li>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is an old English proverb which says &#x201C;small things amuse small minds&#x201D;. The hon. member obviously took great delight in the evaluation survey which the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> conducted. However, I want to ask him to evaluate his party by conducting a test among the voters of South Africa. There will be no result to register. They had the opportunity last week of putting up a candidate in the Overvaal constituency and of stating their labour policy there, but they ran away. Overvaal is out and out a workers&#x2019; constituency. They should have tested their party there. During this session, the United Party have very clearly shied away from labour questions. On no occasion did they want to talk about labour matters, and therefore we are glad that we can address each other directly on this matter today. If it had not been for the motion which was introduced by the hon. member for Hercules during the session, we would not have been able to have spoken about labour until now. I shall indicate why the hon. member avoids labour matters and just refered to them obliquely during the course of this session. It is because there is labour peace in South Africa. They can only raise a hue and cry when things are going badly for South, Africa. The hon. member quoted a number of figures here, but what, however, is the real position&#x003F; South Africa is one of the few countries in the world which have economic growth, and prosperity. Those are the facts talking. However, it is tragic when one listens to those hon. members, to hear that they always refer to job reservation. I am also going to deal with it in case they think that we are running away from it. Their argument is as old as the hills and is repeated here year after year. They are the people who say all day, &#x201C;Remove job restrictions such as influx control and job reservation&#x201D;. Section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, in other words, should be removed from the Statute Book. We have been hearing that story for the past ten years already. Even during this session, the hon. member for Maitland made a plea during the discussion of the motion of the hon. member for Hercules that the Government throw off the shackles of job reservation. I then <span class="col_4913-4914" refersTo="page_0870"/>asked him whether he meant that we should abolish job reservation in South Africa. He answered in the affirmative.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the White man has nothing to fear in South Africa because he will always be the leader in any sphere, particularly in the labour sphere. He is the one who will be the supervisor, the instructor and the employer. The White man has no need to fear.</block>

<p>Oh, on merit! These hon. members say that we should abolish this, but the words which I have quoted here are the words of the hon. member for South Coast, which are recorded in Hansard. Now that is the ambiguity of the United Party. The one moment they say that job reservation should be abolished and that workers should be able to move freely, but the hon. member for South Coast when he was training the apprentices, said that there is no need for them to be concerned, because their job will never be threatened. He said they would always be in charge, they would always be the supervisors and the instructors. That is the credibility of that party! That is the ambiguity we are dealing with. That is also why the United Party looks like its Leader. The United Party is a sick party which is disintegrating. [Interjections.] The double talk we find on that side of the House is why they have a mere 37 seats in this House today and are weaker than they have ever been.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall withdraw the word &#x201C;cowardly&#x201D;, but those hon. members did not have the courage of their convictions to go and fight in a constituency such as Overvaal. It is necessary for every worker in South Africa, not only for the White workers, but for all workers, regardless of race or colour, that job reservation should be kept on the Statute Book as a protective measure. [Interjections.] For the sake of the record, I want to state once again that if it was not for job reservation in South Africa and if it was not for determinations in accordance with job reservation in the Western Province, 96% of the Coloured in the Cape would not have had a share in the furniture, shoe and clothing industries, because the Black man would have ousted the Coloured here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry, the hon. member had half an hour, but I do not have as much time at my disposal. There is the proof that they speak lightly about job reservation. No, they cannot come along with those arguments. Had it not been for job reservation, the Coloureds would have been ousted from these spheres of labour today. The hon. member for Orange Grove stated very bravely here that they are going to abolish the colour bar in the mining industry. He must tell us today on whose behalf he is speaking. Is he speaking on behalf of the 85 000 Whites in the mining industry, on behalf of the 641 000 non-Whites in the mining industry or on behalf of Anglo American Corporation who he represents here&#x003F; That <span class="col_4915-4916" refersTo="page_0871"/>is what the hon. member must tell us. He must tell us on whose behalf he is speaking when he makes those statements. We know that the hon. member for Hillbrow and the Progressive Party have said repeatedly &#x2014;the hon. member for Hillbrow said so today again&#x2014;that we should abolish influx control, that we should house the Bantu on a family basis and that we should abolish migrant labour. I want to put a very simple question to the hon. members. If the hon. members were to abolish it, are they prepared to house those 641 000 Bantu who work in the mining industry in the urban complexes on a family basis&#x003F; Those hon. members know that it is the Bantu&#x2019;s tradition to have one, two and sometimes three Bantu wives. Do they want to decide for the Bantu which wife he should bring to the urban areas&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>You do not even want to allow one wife.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>If one man has three wives, do those hon. members want us to build three houses for that man&#x003F; The hon. member for Maitland is obviously prepared to decide which wife must be brought for which Bantu. If we were to concede to that, we should have to create large urban complexes for the Bantu in our metropolitan areas. That is the hind of unfounded statements we have from hon. members on the other side. They blaze these statements abroad but then they are the people who tell the world with great acclaim that South Africa discriminates against the Black man.</p>

<p>We know that certain exemptions are made and that there is sometimes a relaxation as far as job reservation is concerned. If representations are made for relaxation, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will consider applying these in our border industrial areas in the first place. It might stimulate the industries to decentralize in accordance with the policy of the National Party. In the second place I want to point out that, if we do those things, it will also mean that we shall better be able to utilize the Bantu labour. If we were to grant exemptions there, it would mean, in the third place, that we could employ the Bantu in that area on a family basis. This will mean that we shall not have to use expensive land in our urban areas or create expensive housing and infrastructure in the urban areas. What is the most important to me, is that if we were to bring about a relaxation, we would help to make the homelands viable.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to express my thanks for the opportunity which the Opposition offers me to proceed immediately. I accused the Opposition of avoiding labour matters recently because there is so much labour peace prevailing in South Africa. We know that over the past year or two we have had to deal with strikes sporadically. This we admit. We are not running away from that. But we also know that when strikes took place, there was sometimes a militant influence behind those strikes. Last year and the year before last when we had strikes, the hon. member for Hillbrow carried on like a real &#x201C;Popeye&#x201D; in this House. Even before he had eaten his spinach, he jumped up here, made muscles, showed his fist and said timeously and untimeously, &#x201C;We must speak about labour in South Africa&#x201D;. He introduced labour motions as matters of urgent public interest. He really acted like a General Idi Jacobs.</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Then the hon. member and other hon. members spoke about labour peace. When there was unrest, they had reason to speak about labour matters. I shall tell you why they do not discuss labour matters today. There is a very good reason for this. The reason is that they are avoiding their own policy. Since the quarrel between those hon. members and the Reformists, we have heard very <span class="col_4917-4918" refersTo="page_0872"/>little about Black trade unions. We hear no longer of Black trade unions since they quarrelled with their allies. I think it is necessary that they should spell out very clearly to us whether they are back to their policy of 1972 and whether they are standing by their policy of 1973, the &#x201C;three-tier system&#x201D;. The other reason why they do not speak about it, is the success which has been achieved with the implementation and introduction of the legislation appertaining to Bantu labour relations regulation. That is the reason why the hon. members raise such a hue and cry. It was the hon. Leader of the Opposition who said last year, in respect of the implementation of this Act, that it was a third rate Act. He said it did not offer the Bantu the necessary bargaining machinery. But in this short period of two years, it has been proved that the Minister was correct in introducing that Bill here and that is why we have labour peace in South Africa today. The legislation created the opportunity to establish works committees and liaison committees by means of which the Bantu could confer about his labour problems, could bargain and speak about his wages. That is why they avoided that. I shall now give you one more proof.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinelands asked how many strikes have taken place in South Africa over the past 18 months. The answer which he received was 435 strikes. Then the hon. member wanted to know in how many of those strikes works and liaison committees were involved. In only 35 cases in which there were strikes, were works and liaison committees involved and in 404 cases there were no works and liaison committees.</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>There were no strikes &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>In other words, practice showed this to be the proper legislation and the hon. the Minister to be on the right track. It is not only the answer to the hon. member&#x2019;s question which proves this. We know that the University of the Orange Free State instituted a proper investigation through the personnel research division of its Department of Industrial Psychology.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>But that was in your previous speech.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>They instituted an investigation into the functioning of liaison committees and their finding was&#x2014; there are hon. members here who will deal with this in detail&#x2014;that the legislation and the hon. the Minister are on the right track and that we should recommend to employers that they should make use of these media, because then we shall have further labour peace in our country. We know that when the legislation was implemented, there were only 43 works committees and a mere 120 liaison committees. Today we have the massive number of 1 711 liaison committees and 235 works committees, and that gives a total of 1 945. That creates the channels for 554 000 Bantu to negotiate and decide about their labour matters. That is the norm we can apply to evaluate the success of these things. We know that they always said that trade unions were the salvation and blessing, because without trade unions one cannot continue in South Africa and if the Black man does not have trade union rights, one will not have labour peace, because if one does not have Black trade unions, they will not be able to negotiate collectively in a proper way. We also have evidence as far as that is concerned. I have here an article which appeared on 29 November 1974, &#x201C;Trade Unions are major stranglers of countries&#x201D;, and, <i>inter alia,</i> reference is made in the article to the peace and prosperity we have had in South Africa over the past 50 years. They say that the world envies us our industrial conciliation legislation and that we have had strikes here from time to time. Let us consider the position in Great Britain, the once powerful and wealthy State. This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Britain is a supreme example of how failure to curb the power of trade unions has reduced a country which, in the lifetime of many people, was the richest and the most powerful nation on earth and has reduced it to one of the poorest amongst the immediate competitors second, I believe, to Portugal.</block>

<p>In other words, England has degenerated to second lowest in its company. That is as a result of trade unions. Let us see what they say of Italy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Labour unions sought and won excessive wage demands&#x201D; and so helped to put an end to the industrial boom of the fifties and sixties that has made it the world&#x2019;s seventh biggest industrial nation, but which now has a budget deficit of $16 billion a year.</block>

<p><span class="col_4919-4920" refersTo="page_0873"/>That is what trade unions have done to certain countries. Then one is grateful that a leader such as Chief Minister Kaizer Matanzima said last week on an occasion that he will not he so stupid as to allow Black trade unions immediately in his homeland. The Chief Minister said in a policy speech to industrialists in Johannesburg that it is merely common sense that trade unions are a luxury the Transkei can do without. He also said that the matter could be considered again on a subsequent occasion, but if trade unions are allowed, their powers will be properly defined. He realizes the dangers inherent in this. I wonder whether it would not be in South Africa&#x2019;s interest if even the White workers were to make greater use of these works committees and liaison committees, because I think it may have greater advantages for them than some of the trade unions have for them. I am not against trade unions, Sir, but I say that trade unions could cause South Africa great misery. We are fortunate in that for the most part we deal with responsible trade unions in South Africa. Sir, what are the unemployment figures like throughout the world&#x003F; The unemployment figure in South Africa is ,3%.

<block name="quote">In all, 75% of all American industries have had a decline in their work forces. The dry statistics of unemployment have their human equation, too. The unemployment rate for Whites (7,5%) is better than that for Blacks (13,4%).</block>

<block name="quote">To be a White teenager (20,8%) is still better than being a Black teenager, where the jobless rate topped 40,1%.</block>

<p>That is the position among the young people in America, where 40,1% of them are unemployed. There it is not regarded as discrimination, but when there is unemployment among the Blacks in South Africa, where the ratio between Black and White is far bigger than it is in America, then it is due to racial discrimination.

He then set up a new skittle, i.e. that we on this side want to abolish influx control. Sir, nobody on this side said anything of the kind. He put up this new skittle as well, but missed it altogether because nobody had said anything of the kind. But then he added a second aspect to the matter; he asked what we were going to do with the two or three wives of the Bantu worker. Sir, that has nothing whatsoever to do with the matter. Then he came along with the other old skittle, i.e. work reservation, as a magic remedy to protect the Whites, apparently, Sir, I find it very difficult to understand.

He did not even try to answer the first question. Why does he, as a student of the labour position in South Africa, not get up and say: &#x201C;The hon. member for Hillbrow wants to know from us what the task of the hon. the Minister of Labour is. I shall define it.&#x201D; Where does the hon. Minister fit in when it comes to migratory labour&#x003F; What finger does he have in that pie&#x003F; Which is the position of the hon. Minister of Labour when it comes to the training of Bantu workers&#x003F; And I can continue in that vein. Does the Minister of Labour have any say in the matter when it comes to mining labour&#x003F; But he did not even try to reply to these questions. He was also asked another serious question, but at that time he was occupied with his own thinking: How is it possible, in the modern times we are living in, that South Africa&#x2019;s production figure is so poor compared with that of other countries&#x003F; And if he is unable to furnish me with an answer to this question&#x2014;I take it the hon. the Minister will try to reply to it&#x2014;I ask him why he does not tell us what the Government has done over 27 years to ensure that productivity has been increased by means of training&#x003F; But we had no reply. But I go further and say there was still another question. You see, Sir, the hon. member has so much to say about labour peace. I have no objection; I am very grateful that this is so, but the task of the hon. Minister of Labour is not only to establish peace and order in South Africa. His task is also to provide in the labour needs of South Africa. The hon. member only has to read the Economic Development Programme and let him tell me this afternoon: If we have a growth rate of 6,4%&#x2014; and I wonder whether there is any hon. members on that side of the House who is prepared to say that we are not prepared to maintain that growth rate&#x003F; No reply! In other words, they accept the projection of the Economic Development Programme and this being the case, one is forced to come to the conclusion that we shall have a shortage of 60 000 White labourers.</p>

<p>Yes, in four years&#x2019; time and not in 25 years&#x2019; time. This will be even before the next election if that will perhaps cause hon, gentlemen to sit up and take notice. The hon. member for Vanderbijl Park is not listening to me now, <span class="col_4923-4924" refersTo="page_0875"/>but my question is the following: What is he going to do in order to bridge this gap&#x003F; He has no answer whatsoever, Sir. That is the argument which is raised under this Vote year after year. We are trying to find an answer. That is why the hon. member for Hillbrow says quite correctly that the hon. the Minister, who knows what the requirements are in the labour sphere should say to us: &#x201C;I accept the Economic Development Programme. As Minister of Labour, I shall see to it that the rightful labour needs of the South African economy will be provided for.&#x201D; Then he should tell us at the same time how he is going to do it. But, Sir, we do not have a word from that side. They remain silent every time. Every time we are being overwhelmed with arguments which are based on colour only.</p>

<p>Sir, it goes much further than that. What is at issue here is the economic development of South Africa with which everyone, Black and White, is concerned. The simple fact is that unless we refuse to grow, as the economic programme tells us, those labour requirements will have to be found. But we do not get an answer anywhere. They are as silent as the grave. The argument is quite simple. I tell the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark again: If he is so fond of work reservation he better accept it if it will satisfy him. As far as influx control is concerned, there is no need for him to throw open the sluice gates. Neither do I say he should do so. But then I ask him, as a member of this hon. House: When is he going to reply to these questions concerning productivity&#x003F; When is he going to reply to these questions with regard to training&#x003F; When is he going to reply to these questions dealing with the labour requirements of South Africa&#x003F; How does he see the picture for the next four or five years&#x003F; Where should the labour come from&#x003F; If the hon. member and the hon. Minister do not furnish us with those replies, they would be failing in their duty. It is as simple as that. That is what the whole debate is concerned about. It does not only concern work reservation. This is something which has become a clich&#x00E9;. Those hon. members are only concerned with the propaganda which can be made against us. That may be allowed to continue. But, Sir, we are concerned about the labour requirements of South Africa. Trained people have to be found, and the hon. Minister should make it his primary task to find them. The hon. Minister is not here to win elections. It is no use the hon. member telling me that they win elections. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Once again, Mr. Chairman, both the hon. member for Maitland and the hon. member for Hillbrow raised the same old hackneyed stories today which they raised last year in this debate. What have they in fact said&#x003F; The hon. member for Maitland made a big fuss about the fact that this Government was not doing enough to train manpower in South Africa and utilize it better. The hon. member for Hillbrow questioned the entire issue of liaison committees. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that to a certain extent they were in favour of liaison and works committees, but that these should not replace Black trade unions in South Africa. The hon. member went further and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s labour policy has come to the end of the road.</block>

<p>Where does the hon. member get that information&#x003F; We in South Africa have peace and quiet on the labour front to the same extent as any other country in the world today. I want to ask the hon. members for Hillbrow and Maitland whether I am correct in saying that. Furthermore: It goes without saying that there must be reasons for the fact that we have peace and quiet in South Africa. I believe that the peace and quiet we have in South Africa is ascribable to the National Party&#x2019;s labour policy. This is the first important fact. The second important fact is that it is ascribable to the fact that we have a Minister of Labour who controls labour matters in South Africa in an orderly fashion. Hon. members opposite can laugh at me if they wish, because when one says these things, they always make a joke of it. We in South Africa are exceptionally fortunate in having such a Minister in charge of our labour affairs. When I say this, it must be understood that I am not seeking a job from him. We have peace ana quiet in South Africa and in my opinion this is a proud achievement in view of the fact that we in South Africa have a mighty White, Bantu, Coloured and Indian labour force. That is why I say that we convey our sincere thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p><span class="col_4925-4926" refersTo="page_0876"/>I now come to another matter which is, I believe, of real importance to us in South Africa and which has been questioned by the hon. member for Hillbrow and Maitland and, I am sorry to say, by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, too. I refer to the whole issue of our liaison and works committees. Since I intend dwelling on this matter, let me say very clearly that representations urging the recognition of Black trade unions in South Africa are no rarity. We know that there are appeals from time to time for the recognition of Black trade unions in South Africa. No restriction is imposed on their establishment, but let me state very clearly today that this Government is not going to recognize Black trade unions in South Africa because it believes that they are not in the best interests of South Africa and its people. Hon. members opposite can talk until they are blue in the face and plead this whole matter daily. As long as it is governing South Africa, the National Party Government will not recognize Black trade unions in South Africa. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Hillbrow must give me a chance, because he himself spoke for half an hour. This Government is not like hon. members on the other side of the House who have a different labour policy every year, or every second year. We spell out our labour policy clearly so that the people of South Africa may know where they stand with this National Party Government. The Government believes that negotiation between employer and employee is essential, and consequently it was decided that liaison committees and works committees, a system that exists in many other countries as well, should be tested.</p>

<p>I have before me a report by the University of the Orange Free State concerning this whole matter. It is an illuminating report, a report that was not compiled by politicians but by people who investigated this entire matter impartially and scientifically and compiled a report of about 130 pages on the subject. If hon. member opposite have not read it then I must really recommend it to the hon. members for Hillbrow and Maitland.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>This report was compiled by the research division of industrial psychology at the University of the Orange Free State. The hon. member states that he is aware of this report, but if he had been aware of it, his standpoint in regard to works and liaison committees would not have been the one he has held today and in the past as well. I should now like to quote what this team of scientists at the Free State University have said about liaison and works committees. Hon. members opposite would do well to listen to this. Among the most important findings was that owing to the composition of this whole system, productivity in South Africa has risen by 39,7%. It is also interesting and illuminating to find that in 82,6% of the cases, grievances were reduced, whereas in 97,4% of the cases communication improved. 82,2% of the organizations with liaison committees were satisfied with the results achieved. Furthermore: 84,7 of the organizations are of the opinion that this has led to sound communications between employers and management. Now it is interesting to note that a questionnaire concerning this matter was sent to 326 of our largest organizations. We often hear the cry that there are people, including people from these organizations, who ask that there should be Black trade unions in South Africa. Of all these organizations, only 5% are in favour of Black trade unions. The hon. member would do well to listen to the names of a few of the organizations. Some of these companies are among the biggest and the most well-known in the country. I shall mention only a few of them: AE &#x0026; CI, Amcor, Anglo-Alpha Cement, Barlow Rand, Bruply, Busbodies, Cadac, Colgate Palmolive, Crystal Hope, Wispeco, <i>Daily News</i> and, strangely enough, <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> too. Dorman Long, Dunlop and Fedmis. It is very clear from the report that these scientists are in favour of this system, and to such an extent&#x2014;and this is what I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the question is asked whether we should not ensure&#x2014;these are also recommendations contained in this report as a result of the comments they received&#x2014;that as regards certain of these organizations we should make it obligatory for a minimum number of the workers to belong to these liaison committees. For the sake of interest I just want to mention to you what the recommendations of this report are [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The committee system is sound and all efforts should be directed towards the improvement of the system rather than attempting to point out its weak points.</block>

<p><span class="col_4927-4928" refersTo="page_0877"/>We are dealing with an important matter here and therefore I want to ask hon. members of the Opposition to come to the hon. the Minister and state how this could be improved rather than to be continually raising negative and undue criticism. I quote again [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Through sustained contact with the industry, training measures and possible tax concessions, the Government can make a contribution towards improving the system.</block>

<p>This finding, too, I want to bring to the friendly attention of the hon. the Minister. I quote again [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The employers cart and should make the major contribution towards improving the system and ensuring its success, <i>inter alia</i> through effective training of Black members, the creation of a sound organizational climate and sound staff management. The Black worker can also contribute towards making the system function successfully and a great deal of benefit to himself could result from his support of the system.</block>

<p>I believe that when we read this report we find the spirit and attitude with which we must solve the labour problems in South Africa. I want to tell the hon. member for Hillbrow, as an ex-employee of Anglo American, something interesting. Last Saturday, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, the hon. member for Virginia and I were in the fortunate position of conducting discussions with the top people of Anglo American. It would be unfair for me to mention the names here today, but I can tell this ex-employee of Anglo American that those top people in that management told me, in the presence of the hon. member for Virginia and the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration&#x2014;please note that we are dealing with Anglo American here&#x2014;that they were by no means in favour of the recognition of Black trade unions in South Africa. I also want to tell the hon. member for Johannesburg North that the top people of Anglo American&#x2014;people he knows&#x2014;are not in favour of it. I want to go further and say that they told me that they were in favour of &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for the opportunity of coming in immediately after the hon. member for Welkom, who while he seems to be very knowledgeable about Anglo-American, does not seem to know a great deal about the labour movement in South Africa. Both the member for Welkom and the member for Vanderbijlpark have expressed great concern about Black trade unions. The hon. member for Welkom has gone so far as to say that as long as this Government is in power, it will not recognize Black trade unions. This is very interesting. I, too, would like to quote to him from a newspaper he would perhaps like to read some time. This is a report from the newspaper of March 1975 where we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In an unprecedented interview with Black labour leaders a senior Government official has expressed himself in favour of responsible Black trade unionism.</block>

<p>This newspaper is <i>The Daily News</i> of 22 March 1975. I would also like to quote from the <i>Evening Post</i> of 22 March 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Deputy Secretary of Labour, Mr. J. G. H. Botha, has expressed himself in favour of responsible Black trade unionism.</block>

<p>That is one of the few good things that has come out of this Government. I would like the hon. member for Welkom as well as the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark to go and have a conversation with Mr. Botha because they have a great deal to learn from the officials who work in the Department of Labour. May I say that these officials have an unenviable task in trying to maintain the orderly relationship between management and labour against the background of a Government ideology and against the background of the kind of members who have spoken thus far from the Government benches. There is another aspect they seem to have overlooked, viz. the report of the Department of Labour for the year which ended 31 December 1973. I wonder if either of those two hon. gentlemen have ever read this report, because here, in black and white, not written by the Opposition, but written by the department itself, are some of the facts and figures relating to the labour scene in 1973. It is quite clear that there is a changing attitude within the mind of the Black worker in South Africa. This has been dramatically illustrated especially by the <span class="col_4929-4930" refersTo="page_0878"/>urban worker as well as by the migrant mineworker&#x2014;a position with which I do not have the time to deal with today. However, it has been specifically expressed by the urban Black worker. The most dramatic evidence of this kind of earthquake almost which has transformed the scene in South Africa was obviously the Durban strikes in 1973. The fundamental significance of these strikes can certainly never be overstressed, not only because it was the first time for a long time that Black workers in significant numbers said &#x201C;no&#x201D;, but also because it unleashed a new period of labour unrest in South Africa. We are told that we are living in an era of unprecedented labour peace, but what do the figures which appear in this report indicate&#x003F; Listen to these figures&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bantu were involved in 246 stoppages of work which should be regarded as &#x201C;strikes&#x201D; in terms of the Act. In all 67 338 Bantu took part in these strikes.</block>

<p>Here we hear again that the Progressive Party was responsible for that as well because they are supposed to be responsible for so much that takes place in South Africa. In case anybody should say that this report only goes up to 1973 and that that was a very unusual year&#x2014;and we admit that it was a very unusual year&#x2014;let us take a look at the figures for 1974. Here I have the figures which I have received directly from the hon. the Minister of Labour himself. There were 374 strikes&#x2014;I am only referring to Black labour&#x2014;during 1974 involving no less than 57 656 workers. Is that labour peace&#x003F; This is a scene of unrest. What is more, we have heard comparative figures of Europe, especially from Germany, England and the United States of America. But let us take a look at the figures for Africa. We all talk of being part of Africa. I have analysed those figures and I find that South Africa has had the second worse record in the whole continent of Africa in terms of labour unrest and work stoppages over the last two years. [Interjections.] Here I have the figures. Anybody can come and check the figures, if they like. They are documented by our own Government sources themselves, by the ILO and by the countries of origin. We find that the only country that has a worse record than South Africa is Morocco. South Africa is well ahead of countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Tunisia, Algeria, Zambia, Malawi, Ghana, Tanzania and Upper Volta. We have the worse record! If we have a look at these figures we shall find that once again we are in trouble and the situation in South Africa needs to be put right. I am suggesting that there is a new move &#x2026;</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid I have very limited time in which I want to try to argue this case. The fact of the matter is that there is a new situation which is developing in South Africa. There is no question about it. The only reaction we are getting from that side is the question: Why do you keep on talking about Black trade unions&#x003F; I notice that everybody on that side is against Black trade unions&#x003F; Are they against White trade unions&#x003F; Do the hon. members want us to put them out&#x003F; Shall we say to the White workers&#x2019; unions &#x201C;Throw them out!&#x201D;&#x003F; [Interjections.]</p>

The fact of the matter is that the present legislation as it exists is not able to contain the strike situation nor indeed is it able to get people back to work. That is what we are talking about. We are committed to labour peace, but let us not pretend that labour unrest does not exist. Let us face up to the fact, let us analyse it and then let us introduce the necessary changes in order that we can have abiding labour peace in South Africa.

We must begin to work out a pattern so that we can solve the problem together and not pretend that it does not exist.</p>

<p>I want to return to work committees or liaison committees because if there is one thing the hon. member for Welkom has said that really made a great deal of sense, it is that the works committees or liaison committees ought to be compulsory and should not be left to the whim and the fancy of the employer or the work force. I agree 100% with the hon. member on that point. Indeed, I would go further and say that we should think in terms of these same committees not only for the Black workers but also for the Coloured, Asian and White workers, in fact committees should be created for the total labour force. However, such committees should never come in the place of trade unionism or collective bargaining, but should serve as a direct complement to that. If that were to come about I believe we would go a long way to meeting the kind of needs that exist at this time in South Africa.</p>

<p>As I have said. I listened very attentively to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. As did the hon. members for Hillbrow and Maitland, he harped on one subject only, namely the tremendous injustice that is supposedly being done to the Black worker in this country. I could not but get the impression that particularly that hon. member who has just resumed his seat would not mind if more unrest were to occur in the field of labour because it is in that way that <span class="col_4933-4934" refersTo="page_0880"/>they are trying to twist the arm of the Government to make concessions to the Black worker, and that simply may not happen, ever, in this country.</p>

<p>Before coming back, in passing, to certain aspects raised by the hon. members thus far, allow me, Mr. Chairman, to bring a single matter, in my opinion an important one, to the attention of the Minister, viz. the fact that the Afrikaans Language Festival is going to be celebrated this year and that certain groups of workers will have the opportunity of having 14 August as a holiday in order to attend the festivities, while others will be excluded. I realize that the hon. the Minister is not empowered to declare that day a public holiday, but I wonder whether he would not be prepared to make an earnest appeal to employers to give all their workers off on that day so that they may attend these festivities which are very important to us here in South Africa.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to the debate. I cannot but dwell, in passing, on the extremely irresponsible speech made by the hon. member for Hillbrow. By implication he made an attack here on the hon. the Minister and the Department of Labour. He accused them by implication of having displayed an inability to deal with this matter. He referred to the 2 000 employees employed by that department. It is an important department and he conceded that. I want to avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister and his department, the senior officials, in particular, for the contribution they have made, including their contribution in this year 1975 that is now under review, in helping to bring about peace and quiet in the field of labour. The hon. member for Pinelands told us how many work stoppages occurred during 1974. I shall come to that later. The fact remains that the action taken by the officials of the department constitute a very positive contribution towards ensuring peace and quiet in the field of labour in this country. I should like to avail myself of this opportunity this afternoon to pay tribute to them in this regard.</p>

<p>What has been the drift of the debate thus far as the Opposition is concerned&#x003F; I think one could summarize it in two basic ideas&#x2014;in the first instance that there should be increasing Black employment and that the Black worker should thereby be put on an equal footing with the Whites at all levels and, in the second instance, the plea that trade union rights be granted to the Black workers in this country. I do not have the time this afternoon to go into this in detail. What underlies the arguments of the Opposition&#x003F; It must surely be that they adopt this standpoint because they believe that economic development and the tempo of economic development are dependent on the presence of large numbers of workers. That is the purport of their reasoning.</p>

<p>We can debate on the question as to whether they are trained workers or not. However, the Opposition adopts the standpoint that we in this country have a host of workers and that they must be utilized. This raw material must be developed in order that that economic development may take place. If they were to adopt that as their premise, I should agree that that was a very positive standpoint because that is what is really involved, viz. not primarily the worker, but the economic development that must take place. However, to put it very mildly, such a premise is totally wrong. The presence of a large number of workers has, in point of fact, been a curse in South Africa up to the present instead of a blessing, because it is for that very reason that South Africa has never learned to conserve labour. Economic development depends primarily on the effective quality of one&#x2019;s manpower. In turn, this quality depends on one&#x2019;s manpower, on the distribution of talents, viz. the training and the way of life of the community, the people, from which that manpower is drawn. The way of life of the people or the community from which one draws one&#x2019;s manpower determines whether one&#x2019;s social cultural element is far more important than talents and training because economic development is in fact, a way of life and not merely a function of economic factors only. It is common knowledge in South Africa that the way of life of 75% of our manpower is not such as to give them the initiative, the perseverance, the willingness and the sense of responsibility of the entrepreneur or the executive on whom the tempo of economic development and progress depends. In savin&#x003F; that, I am not casting any reflections. Those people cannot help the fact that material welfare <span class="col_4935-4936" refersTo="page_0881"/>forms part of their cultural values today or that the desire for it, when present, has not yet been adapted to the appreciation that one&#x2019;s own initiative can bring about or further its realization.</p>

<p>Sir, productivity has been discussed here. Of course this aspect must affect productivity, but the Government takes this fully into account, and through the action it takes, makes provision for his slow evolutionary process to run its full course. That is why increasing sums of money are being spent in the homelands; that is why White skills are being sent to the homelands to train and guide those people on the basis of their cultural circumstances so as to reach the point at which they will be able to accept this responsibility to which I have referred, in the interests of their own people. Sir, improving one&#x2019;s manpower requires the following: The number of entrepreneurs and executives must be increased. In this regard one need only consider the large number of projects under way in South Africa at the moment. In the second place there must be active promotion of the quality of work produced by this section of the manpower, or so much of it as already exists. In the minute that remains, I want to make a few remarks concerning one aspect of this in particular. Sir, we in South Africa have reached the point where the White man cannot afford to allow 76 000 Whites, as stated in the previous manpower survey, to be employed as operators, and I want to make an earnest appeal here this afternoon for us to adopt an imaginative method of putting a stop to the wastage of unnecessary White manpower, by enabling these 76 000 Whites to undergo training as artisans. We must not simply cram them into Westlake for two and a half years, although I have great appreciation for the work done at Westlake. We must consider how to allow these 76 000 people, or as many of them as possible, to acquire the status of artisans. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. McLACHLAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Hillbrow opened this debate this afternoon. In recent times, the hon. member has been promoted a great deal. He has become the United Party&#x2019;s chief spokesman on labour affairs; he has become the aspirant leader of the party and in that way has also become the aspirant leader of the Opposition in this House. In the nature of the matter, the prospects offered by the latter post are rather dismal.</p>

<p>Last year the hon. member came to this House and gave us six of his party&#x2019;s fundamental points of policy, and subsequently gave us ten objectives of his party concerning labour matters. Sir, against that background and against the background of all the promotion the hon. member has had, we had expected to be able to conduct an interesting debate here concerning the points of policy which the hon. member put to us here last year. But what did we get from the hon. member&#x003F; An innocent motion concerning labour affairs. The hon. member then stated that there was one minor point to which he had to refer briefly, viz. the issue of industrial peace, and he then added that for years we have been proud of the fact that we have such a peaceful labour situation in South Africa. In fact, therefore, he has come along with a motion in which he congratulates the Government on the industrial peace in South Africa. But then the hon. member continues and mentions a few things that have to be changed. He wants the existing legislation to be amended. In other words, he wants this very legislation to which the industrial peace we have been enjoying for years may be ascribed, to be amended. This afternoon he comes along and repeats that plea, in chorus with the hon. member for Maitland, and they again referred to amendment of that legislation, those measures that have ensured industrial peace for us in years gone by.</p>

<p>I should like to furnish a reply to the question as to why we have industrial peace. Sir, the one reason for this is the fact that notwithstanding these problems we are faced with, the worker has felt secure throughout. It would not have been possible for us, after 27 years, starting with the gravest unrest South Africa has ever known in the field of labour, to arrive at the position where, in the words of the hon. member for Hillbrow, we have industrial peace, without there having been any reason for this. There is only one factor that could have caused this and that is the satisfaction and feeling of security of the worker in South Africa. We could ascribe that security to various things. In the first place it is owing to the vigorous and resolute actions of the hon. the Minister, supported by his department, his senior men in particular, who have adopted firm standpoints in regard to so-called labour unrest, to which the hon. member for Pinelands, too, has repeatedly referred. There are other reasons for this, <span class="col_4937-4938" refersTo="page_0882"/>too, but I do not want to go into them now. I want to deal with the reasons that derive from the workers. If the hon. member for Hillbrow himself admits that there is industrial peace, then there must be a particular reason for it, and the reason is the certainty on the part of the worker as regards his social security. After all, the worker in this country, whether White, Brown or Black, knows that this country has a strong economy and that if he gives a day&#x2019;s work, he will receive a living wage for it. He knows, after all, that in these 27 years of National Party rule there has been an increase in labourers&#x2019; wages that has been far greater than the increase in the cost of living. Those are things which the people live with. Admittedly, we have heard hon. members, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Hillbrow, talk about equal wages for equal work and about the elimination of the wage gap. Reference has also been made here to the high cost of living. All those things have been mentioned with a view to making the worker dissatisfied and drawing his attention to his basic dissatisfaction. However, I do not know when last we had a fervent speech in this House from that side calling for higher wages for the White worker. I do not know about that. Whatever the case may be, these people receive a living wage and they are satisfied with it. Now what we have had here this afternoon is the hon. member for Pinelands singing in the same chorus as the members of the United Party. They referred to the events of 1973. We know how in 1973 the Opposition parties attempted to create the impression that those strikes which occurred at the time were the start of an enormous workers&#x2019; revolution that could even lead to an industrial revolution and which could plunge the country into economic misery and give them an outside chance of coming into power. It is for those reasons that hon. members seized on those minor disturbances of 1973. They have not come up with new data this afternoon. Last year the hon. member for Hillbrow mentioned his six-point programme in the House and the other day he moved his labour motion. On each of those two occasions he called for certain matters to be rectified.</p>

<p>I should like to mention two aspects of our labour legislation which concern security in particular. In the first instance there is the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, which provides for a Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund so that people who are injured in the course of their employment may be assured of an income. The purpose of this fund is to provide security for every employee who works under dangerous working conditions. This is an old Act that dates from a long way back, and this Government has supplemented and amended that Act in order to give our people more security. For example, provision is being made for the payment of medical and funeral expenses, and for aid to the dependants of a workman should he be injured. Only employers contribute towards this fund. The employees themselves do not contribute towards it. No distinction is drawn between the colour of the workers, and the employer contributes for White. Black or Brown on the same basis. It is a fact that if there is an accident and payments are made, there is no differentiation on the basis of colour. What one does find disturbing is that on analysis, it is evident that probably about 80% of the unclaimed moneys in the fund are due to the Bantu. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Westdene has referred to the work stoppages and strikes to which I have referred as &#x201C;so-called strikes&#x201D;. However, if he reads this excellent report of the Department of Labour again, he will find that they take it far more seriously than he seems to do.</p>

<p>In the short time I had at my disposal a few minutes ago, I tried to indicate what our problem was. I stated that we had reached a new era in South Africa in the field of labour relations and that we were ignoring the change from a passive, docile Black labour force to a group of people who wanted to be directly concerned and involved in everything which affected their lives and their work. We ignore that kind of change at our peril. Black workers want to be consulted about pay, promotion, working opportunities, jobs and job evaluation. In short, they want the same consideration that other workers in South Africa have enjoyed for a very long time indeed. In many ways the Industrial Conciliation Act has served this country extremely well. The only difficulty is that it has served only a very small minority of people extremely well. What we are suggesting and what we are pleading for and urging is that the same consideration that has rightly been given to the minority, ought also to be given to the wider range of workers.</p>

<p><span class="col_4939-4940" refersTo="page_0883"/>The legislative machinery which exists at the moment and tries to deal with our total labour force, is vast and there are too many aspects for me to deal with in a short ten minutes&#x2019; speech. However, one can say that there are at least four major areas what may be called &#x201C;negotiation&#x201D;. The first is the industrial council agreements; the second, the conciliation board agreements; the third the Wage Board determinations; and the fourth, the Bantu Labour Regulation Act orders. If one has the time to go through this legislation, one can only draw one vivid conclusion, namely that the statutory wage regulation, which determines the wages of more than a million Blacks, takes either the form of an agreement between management and White, Coloured or Asian workers organized through registered trade unions or the form of determinations recommended by a Government appointed and, incidentally, all-White board. In other words, no provision is made for Black worker representation to participate in statutory wage regulations.</p>

<p>The other major area is of course in plant level worker/management consultation. Here we have heard a great deal about the introduction of works and liaison committees, and there is no question that, as a direct result of the unrest in 1973, the Government itself amended its legislation in order to cope with a new situation. If one had time, one could look again at the objectives of the works committees and the liaison committees, but that is not necessary. Suffice it to say that at the end of August last year there were 182 works committees, well over 1 000 liaison committees and three co-ordinating works committees established in plants employing almost half a million Black workers. The intention of these committees is highly commendable. Furthermore, in support of the committee system, it has been argued firstly that it is in line with the trend throughout the industrialized world, especially in Europe and Scandinavia, to move towards a system of worker representation on an enterprise level; secondly, that it provides an opportunity at the plant or enterprise level for consultation and negotiation that does not even exist for White, Coloured and Asian workers; and thirdly, in respect of the liaison committees, that this is the form of a mini-industrial council. In general it is claimed that this system is capable of coping with the aspirations of Black workers.</p>

<p>I want to submit that this is not true and I want to argue it along the following lines. In no country in the world are works committees offered as an alternative to trade unionism. In each case they complement the trade unions which are already in existence. Secondly, no answer can be provided to the question which is put by more and more Black workers, namely that if collective bargaining is good enough for White, Asian and Coloured workers, why is it not good enough for them&#x003F; The psychological answer to this demand is a very important one because it deals with the feelings of a growing number of workers in South Africa. We do not have an answer to that question. Thirdly, the establishment of works and liaison committees is not compulsory and I have made the point earlier that as a direct result of that, a bad employer&#x2014;and there are bad employers&#x2014;or a leaderless labour force&#x2014;and there are such labour forces&#x2014;are without any regulation or provision, and that is a very bad state of affairs. Fourthly, the powers of the committees are purely advisory. Most of the Western European committee systems are statutorily enforced and have specifically stated powers of information, consultation and co-determination in a series of crucial areas which affect the worker directly and intimately. Fifthly, although the word &#x201C;negotiation&#x201D; is used to describe one of the functions of the work committees, no provision is in fact made for real negotiation. There is no ability to legalize agreements which may be reached between the employer and the employees. A system in terms of which works and liasion committees negotiate wages, could in fact be in direct conflict with the industrial legislation which exists in our system.</p>

<p>To sum up, the works and liaison committee system, which aims at providing plant or enterprise management/labour interaction, I submit has neither specified nor enforceable powers of consultation and co-determination, nor is it capable of conducting wage negotiations. I would like to submit to the hon. the Minister of Labour the following conclusions in point form, and then a couple of recommendations which I would like him to respond to. Firstly, Black workers both in urban areas and in the mining industry&#x2014;and I have no time to look at it now&#x2014;are displaying a new desire to participate in the decision-making areas which affect their lives. This is a new dimension.</p>

<p>Secondly, wild-cat strikes at a significant level appear to be continuing into 1974 as well. The present legislation makes no provision for collective bargaining rights for Blacks, and the provisions for worker representation at an enterprise level for Blacks are hopelessly inadequate. I would like to suggest that we think again about something which I know has been looked at and which has been turned down before. As the result of this new mood, this new set of needs, it is important once again to urge that a full-scale inquiry into the industrial relations legislation be repeated. We need such a commission of inquiry to examine all the aspects of industrial relations, whether they be for Whites or Blacks. Here we could look again at the formulae for providing a measure of plant or regional wage bargaining, as well as providing this at a national or industry level. A compulsory, well-structured system of plant level worker representation with specified responsibilities and powers, recognition of Black trade unions and union membership for Blacks, the current trend in labour relations in Western Europe with specific reference to the position of immigrant workers there&#x2014;they have very similar problems to these we have here&#x2014;and the concept of an industrial relations court which has already been established in Kenya and is working very well and is going to be set up in Zambia also, are aspects to bear in mind. Membership of the commission must obviously be as wide as possible and must take into account not only the feelings of management, labour or Government, but also the feelings of a wide cross-section of our labour force.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, once again the hon. member for Pinelands was, as usual, the great champion of Black trade unions. He created the impression that the members of his party were the only members in this House who looked after the interests of the Black workers. However, one finds it remarkable how these people can blow hot and cold. Here we have the same hon. member, the great champion of Black trade unions and of the interests of the Black people, who is not so tolerant when it comes to the streets of Pinelands. Then he makes representations to the City Council and asks them whether they cannot do something to remove those Black people from the streets of Pinelands because they give offence to the Whites there. [Interjections.] I shall say in a moment where this double talk comes from. It is because they know that Black trade unions will pose no threat to them, the members of their party, the wealthy and those people living in Houghton and Parktown, because they can buy their apartheid. The hon. member for Welkom referred to the report published by the Department of Industrial Psychology at the University of the Orange Free State. From that report it can be seen that an investigation into the operation of the works and liaison committees at 326 of the largest organizations here in South Africa, was instituted. If the hon. member had wanted to take the trouble, he would have seen that only 5 % of all Black workers there requested bargaining machinery. That is why I want to say that this cry and this plea of theirs does not refer to anything requested by the Black worker. It is a White cry on their part. It is the cry of the hon. member for Pinelands and the other liberal elements in his party and the left wing of the United Party. I find it strange that certain members of the United Party have now suddenly joined the Progressives and the Reformists as champions of Black trade unions. I want to tell hon. members that they want them for one reason only. They do not want them in the interests of the Black workers, but they want to use them as a political weapon against the National Party.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the United Party&#x2019;s siding with the Progressives in regard to the issue of Black trade unions. Hon. members will recall that last year, at the time of the general election, each party had the opportunity of stating its labour policy. The National Party stated that as far as they were concerned, there would not be Black trade unions. The United Party, through the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, stated that it was not in favour of Black trade unions. What is more the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated that he was satisfied with the works and liaison committees because as far as he was concerned, they were working entirely effectively. Notwithstanding the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition adopted that standpoint during the election campaign, two of the official candidates, viz. Mr. Harry Schwarz and Dr. Anna Scheepers, stated that they were in favour of Black trade unions.</p>

<p>What happened after the election&#x003F; When we discussed the motion of censure in the House of Assembly, the hon. the Leader <span class="col_4943-4944" refersTo="page_0885"/>of the Opposition performed a total about-face by saying that the United Party was in favour of Black trade unions. I wonder what caused that sudden change of front. We maintained that it was the result of leftist pressure exerted on them from within their own ranks. Last year I asked the hon. member for Bryanston whether it was true that it was that leftist group in their party which exercised that pressure. His words at the time were, &#x201C;I could, but I shall keep it for another day.&#x201D; The hon. member for Randburg is present at the moment and I wonder whether he would furnish us with a very honest reply. Was it as a result of the pressure exerted by the leftists in the United Party&#x2014;that is to say, when the hon. member was still a member of it&#x2014; that the United Party had a change of front in order to accept Black trade unions&#x003F; The hon. member need only say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;. [Interjections.] The hon. member does not even have the courage to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;, because I think that there are still certain hon. members in the United Party who want to draw them, viz. the Reformists, towards their side. Now he does not want to tell us. Hon. members know that one always gets truth from the mouths of babes and sucklings. On Friday, 21 March 1975&#x2014;in other words, not long ago&#x2014;a motion concerning the training and utilization of manpower was being discussed in this House. I want to quote from Hansard, column 3127. The hon. member for Orange Grove had the floor and he stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless trade union rights are given to the Black people in South Africa, I can foresee nothing but trouble in our industrial future.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark then asked the following question by way of interjection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do you want to instigate it&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply furnished by the hon. member for Orange Grove was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For a long time we have stood for trade union rights, and the suggestion that we are trying to instigate and foment that trouble purely and simply because we are asking for the machinery of trade unions, is a disgraceful situation. It is just what I would expect from that hon. member.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member for Pinetown made the following interjection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Anna Scheepers is doing it for us.</block>

<p>What is Anna Scheepers doing for them&#x003F; The hon. member for Pinetown said it in so many words and it is of no avail now to attach any other meaning to those words. [Interjections.] It seems to me that the hon. member for Durban Central is suddenly terribly concerned about the hon. member for Pinetown now. I do not know whether the hon. member is the midwife or the godmother of the hon. member for Pinetown, who sometimes acts so irresponsibly in the House, but one can attach no other meaning whatsoever to the words of the hon. member for Pinetown than that Anna Scheepers is used by the United Party to do that inciting.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this admission on the part of the suckling of the United Party is a very serious admission that definitely deserves our attention. I now want to ask the rest of the United Party whether they agree with the interjection by the hon. member for Pinetown.</p>

<p>Just like any other developing country, South Africa, too, suffers a shortage of skilled labourers. Now, the Government is often blamed for this and I want to say that this Government is not at all to blame.

I am not referring, now, to the training of artisans and apprentices.</p>

<p>I want to say something about the Career Services Section of the Department of Labour. This section was established with a view to bringing about the most effective utilization of our manpower by providing services in the sphere of career guidance, provision of employment, aptitude testing, rehabilitation of handicapped persons, personnel selection and manpower surveys. These services are furnished at no cost by the department. Well-qualified persons are employed at all district offices to provide those services and are available there at all times. The department also does everything in its power to bring these services to the attention of the public through the quarterly journal <i>My Career</i> which they publish, and by means of visits paid and brochures distributed by the department.

<p>Mr. Chairman, today we have again heard quite a number of arguments in regard to the work reservation policy of the Government. The hon. member for Hillbrow as well as the hon. member for Maitland referred to it. He said that it is not playing any part in the socio-economic life of the country. However, the hon. Opposition always loses sight of one very important aspect of work reservation.</p>

<p>Its propaganda value.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>That is the kind of argument which is always used, namely that it has propaganda value, but this indicates once again, and stresses the fact, that the United Party is out of touch with the heartbeat of its people. It is out of touch with the psychological needs of its people. Since I represent a constituency in which the White worker is preeminently playing his part, I want to reaffirm that the Government has the greatest appreciation for the loyalty and devotion to duty of our White workers. We have great appreciation for their disciplined conduct at all times. We are thoroughly aware that the labour peace which exists in South Africa is attributable mainly to the fact that this Government and the White worker are still on the same wavelength. In this regard the labour peace in South Africa is attributable to the very fact that the worker has the assurance that there will be no meddling with his social security. The worker and his family know that there will be no meddling with their social security because primary consideration is being given to this matter by this Government and the hon. the Minister of Labour. That is why work reservation will remain and that is also why close consultation with the trade unions and staff associations is high on our agenda.</p>

<p>Since I am thinking of social security, I want to make a few remarks about an important social security measure, namely the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. The hon. member for Westdene referred to this Act. I just want to emphasize that although we are not a welfare State we nevertheless have measures of this nature to which constant attention is given, and which ensure that the worker and his family have peace of mind and that an incentive exists for the employer himself. Every three years merit rebates are granted to those employers whose claims payments in respect of injuries are lower than average. These e-bates are based on the ratio of an employer&#x2019;s claim payments to his assessments. Great appreciation exists for the difficult and essential work which is being done in terms of the provisions of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. Nevertheless, there are a few anomalies in regard to this Act which I wish to bring to the kind attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>We are thoroughly aware that the Bill actually deals with indemnification, and not so much with damages. Factors such as pain and suffering or the loss of the pleasures of life are not covered by the concept &#x201C;indemnification&#x201D;. Yet the differences in compensation payable under the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act and under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act are considerable, and are in fact to the disadvantage of the workmen concerned. I notice that the reserves in the statutory reserve fund amount to R45 million. The amount which is being budgeted for in respect <span class="col_4947-4948" refersTo="page_0887"/>of claims for the coming year amounts to R17&#x00BD; million. It would appear therefore that the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund is able to afford improved payments. I wonder whether the time has not arrived for attention to be given to the total elimination of income restrictions in the payment of claims under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act.</p>

<p>I also wish to dwell on a few aspects of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act which could he reconsidered. I am taking as an example the case of asbestosis. If a miner contracts asbestosis in a mine or in the loading of asbestos, his case is dealt with in terms of the provisions of the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act. If he contracts asbestosis in the off-loading of asbestos at a harbour, he falls under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. The same applies to factories or places where asbestos pipes and containers are manufactured. For that reason I welcome in this regard the appointment of the Erasmus Commission of Inquiry into Industrial Health, and the fact that this commission has already commenced its activities. The report of this commission, which will probably eliminate anomalies of the nature I have just mentioned and will further promote the safeguarding measures which exist, is being awaited with great interest.</p>

<p>I want to mention other examples of aspects of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act which I feel ought to receive attention. I am thinking for example of the example reported in the case <i>Kau</i> v. <i>Fourie</i> 1971 (3) S.A. 623 (T), in which it was found that an assault by an employer on an employee at his place of work and even during working hours does not constitute a claim under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. It could for example be considered whether damages for injuries incurred on the way to work in various circumstances do not sometimes prejudice the employee. I am thinking of the circumstances in the case <i>Xakaxa</i> v. <i>Santam,</i> 1967 (4) S.A. 521 (E). If the transportation is controlled by the employer and the accident occurs, the accident comes under the cadre of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. However, if he is being conveyed by his own means of transport, which is not controlled by his employer, then the case is <i>prima facie</i> not covered under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. I am thinking of cases where the accident is ascribed to the negligence of the employer or certain of his co-workers. Then the workman may apply for increased damages. Usually the negligence of the employee is not relevant to the consideration of his claim for damages. This is only the case if he is guilty of serious or deliberate misconduct or other wilful act. However, when he applies for increased damages, the negligence of the employee becomes a factor. Sir, I want to offer for the consideration of the hon. the Minister that in this case the provisions of the Apportionment of Damages Act, Act No. 34 of 1956, should also be made applicable, i.e. that one does not fail completely if the immediate cause of the accident was one&#x2019;s own negligence, but that the amount of the increased damages is reduced in accordance with the degree of the employee&#x2019;s negligence. I am thinking of the case where an apprentice is injured in an accident and then in due course qualifies as an artisan. If he should then in due course suffer a setback as a result of that accident, he is still compensated in accordance with his scale of earnings while he was still an apprentice.</p>

<p>Sir, in conclusion I want to mention a matter which has already been raised in this Committee. I am referring to delays in the settlement of claims under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. In the first place I want to testify that we have at all times received the most pleasant reaction from the Commissioner under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. But in these urgent times, in these times of computers and modernization, surely attention can be given to the more expeditious consideration and payment of these claims.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Brakpan concentrated for the most part on the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. I have no fault to find with that, and perhaps I could also make a contribution in this regard. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not, at the same time consider the matter of he doctors&#x2019; accounts, as well as the hospital accounts, which have to be submitted under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, for I do not think the worker is receiving his fair share. I think that an investigation would in this case serve a very good purpose.</p>

<p>Sir, in addition to that the hon. member for Brakpan discussed work reservation. He said that we are out of touch with the people; that there should be no meddling with the social security of the White <span class="col_4949-4950" refersTo="page_0888"/>workers. Sir, is there any White worker in South Africa today who feels that he cannot compete with a non-White&#x003F; The White man does not want the insult levelled at him that he cannot compete with a non-White worker.</p>

<p>If there are labour disturbances in a country, Sir, do you know who is responsible for that&#x003F; If there are labour disturbances, it is always the Opposition who is responsible for that. But in this country there is labour peace, and that labour peace is due to the fact that we have a responsible Opposition in this country. Britain was mentioned here. If any of those members had known what the position in Britain is, they would have known that many people voted for the Labour Party for a specific reason. They said there was the greatest chance of labour peace if the Labour Party was in power, for then they would have a responsible Opposition which would not incite the workers. Sir, the labour peace which we are enjoying in South Africa may be attributed to this side of the House, for we have never exploited the grievances of the workers of South Africa, not for political gain nor for any other reason. That is why we have industrial peace in South Africa.</p>

<p>But I want to come to the heart of the matter. Labour peace has been discussed here, and everyone says we should thank the Minister for it. But surely this is not the only task of the Minister. The principal task of the hon. the Minister is to see to the labour requirements of this country. For weeks now we have been conducting a debate on d&#x00E9;tente, on defence and our national security here, but if we eliminate all these words, what emerges is one idea, and this is as plain as a pikestaff and flashes its message as clearly as a beacon, namely that our greatest bulwark in this country against a hostile world is our economic strength. [Interjections.] And our economic strength depends on whether we have the workers in South Africa. The growth potential of South Africa depends on whether or not we have the labour. But what is the position today&#x003F; I am an ordinary farmer, but whether one speaks to a farmer or to the top men of the industrial sector, each one will tell you that there is a shortage of labour; his greatest bottleneck in his production process is labour. Sir, one can speak to any department&#x2014;to the Post Office, the Police Service, to Interior, or the Railways&#x2014;and every department will tell you that there is a shortage of labour.</p>

<p>That hon. member was given a long time to speak, and said nothing. Now he must give someone else a chance. What is the basic cause of the shortage of skilled labour&#x003F; I shall readily concede that as far as unskilled labour is concerned, it is not the fault of the Government alone. I cannot place all the blame on the Government; there are various other factors, but I shall come to them in a moment. But as far as skilled and trained labour is concerned, that side of the House has to bear the full responsibility, for in South Africa there is no shortage of people who can be trained. There is only a shortage of political and economic vision on that side of the House. What is the reason&#x003F; When the history of South Africa is written and posterity comes to read it one day, they will realize that it was this Government which destroyed the immigration policy of General Smuts. Dr. D&#x00F6;nges said at that time: &#x201C;All <i>ad hoc</i> machinery of the previous Government for its large-scale immigration policy is being dismantled. The policy is the maintenance of the existing structure of our White population and the protection of the State, based on a world view of matters.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In those years, when Europe was in ruins and people wanted to emigrate to South Africa, when we could have attracted the cream of Europe as immigrants, this Government destroyed that policy, and for that reason we are not able to produce as we should be producing today. To me that side of the House, that party, will always be a living monument to the tragic loss of manpower in South Africa. If our young people&#x2014; the few who still vote for the Nationalist Party&#x2014;had only known that it was this Government which pegged the expenditure on Bantu education at R13 million and that we are now saddled with an illiterate mass of workers, under whom there are those who probably have the lowest productivity in the world as a result of the actions of that Government, because it kept them illiterate. It could perhaps be said now that this was a previous generation of Nationalists. However, that is not the case. The hon. the Minister of Labour was in the prime of his life during those years. The hon. the Prime Minister, as well as the hon. the Minister of Defence, both sat on that side.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am really very sorry for the Opposition today, who would have liked to use the Labour Vote for launching a dramatic attack on the Government&#x2019;s labour policy, sorry because they have such an extremely difficult task. To make a case on the facts today, while we do not have labour dissatisfaction, but the greatest degree of labour peace which one can desire, is certainly an extremely difficult task. For this reason I want to say that we are sorry for them, because we have full employment to a large extent and not that series of strikes which those hon. members so fervently desire. Therefore it is certainly a difficult task for them and that is certainly the reason why we have had so very little fire from Opposition side in this debate up to now. <span class="col_4953-4954" refersTo="page_0890"/>The Opposition only had a few hackneyed slogans, as was also illustrated by the last speaker&#x2019;s speech.

<p>If we had found, after the left turn of the Opposition last year when they accepted Black trade unions under the inspiration and at the insistence&#x2014;as we have very clearly understood from the hon. member for Boksburg&#x2014;of Senator Anna Scheepers, that there had been any appreciable insistence on Black trade unions from either Black workers or employers in this country, we should have had a completely different sort of debate in this House today. Then one would really have had fire and fervour in this debate.

<p>The hon. the Minister is completely wrong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We have had the standpoint to which one of the hon. members on this side referred and which should be restated for the sake of the record and its correctness. That is the standpoint of Paramount Chief Matanzima. If he had not adopted this standpoint, but an opposite one, one would have heard a completely different story from the hon. member for Maitland. He likes such drama. Recently Paramount Chief Matanzima said the following in the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg where he addressed industrialists and I should like to quote his precise words for the sake of the record&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My Government has consistently taken the stand that trade unions, with all their potential for disruption, are undesirable and even harmful in a developing country. Like the Transkei where continuing peak productivity is essential, it might well be that some thought will be given at a later stage to allowing the formation of such unions, but for the present, no. If trade unions are ever allowed, their powers will be carefully circumscribed. Commonsense tells us that this is a sophistication we can at present well do without, while the Transkei continues to cry out desperately for extensive and intensive development in all potential growth fields within its borders.</block>

<p>If we had had a different utterance from him, we should have had a different reaction from the United Party today. However, what did we get in the meantime&#x003F; We had the inquiry to which hon. members on this side referred, viz. that of the Free State University, which I do not need to deal with in detail again. This inquiry shows that employers were overwhelmingly in favour of having this system. I think it will be fair if I also refer to another university which instituted an inquiry into the same matter, viz. the University of Natal. Recently they inquired into the same matter and said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following in a pubication &#x201C;A Study of Employers&#x2019; Attitudes towards African Worker Representation&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The major conclusion of the study is that, taken overall, employers in the manufacturing sector of the South African economy are overwhelmingly in favour of the introduction of increased worker representation, but that they show preference for the works committee system over the increased formation of African unions.</block>

<p>That is what the University of Natal found. If we had not had these statements, we would have had a totally different attitude from the United Party. The findings which I have stated are exactly in line with what the chairman of a liaison committee wrote to the chairman of the Central Labour Board the other day. I want to read it out because it is an indication of the attitude of the Blacks in this connection. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The members of my liaison committee, as well as myself, are greatly indebted to you for your expert guidance you gave us in our first experience with the council. No less remarkable is the contribution made to the proceedings as a whole. Here I have in mind your recommendation for a general rise for the lowest paid group in the industry, namely labourers. Most people are beginning to see that the liaison committees, if given proper guidance, can achieve as much success, if not more, as trade unions.</block>

<p>This is the opinion of the Black people which I am quoting here and not that of the employers to whom the University of Natal referred. This is Black opinion which <span class="col_4955-4956" refersTo="page_0891"/>comes down from Paramount Chief Matanzima to the Black workers themselves.</p>

<p>On 25 April 1975, we had 1 955 liaison and works committees which covered 556 000 Black workers. Surely that is an indication that we have a system here which is growing and that the system has viability. Where the United Party, and sometimes their fellow travellers, the Progressives, continually want to create the impression here that the non-recognition of Black trade unions means that we do not give the Black worker proper opportunities for communication, they allege that we are actually giving them something inferior in this system of committees. That is an impression one gains when one listens to the speeches of Opposition members. In countries such as France and the Netherlands, their works institutions were really of special interest to me&#x2014;whether the industrial councils in the Netherlands or the works councils as they are called in France. It was of interest to me to see that one finds in those countries another communication system alongside the trade unions, a system which is playing an ever growing role in the workers relations in those European countries and which the worker is appreciating more and more. In the same way there are also 70 000 so-called &#x201C;company unions&#x201D; in Japan which are comparable with our works committees.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but they are trade unions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they are trade unions, but they are comparable with our works committees because these &#x201C;company unions&#x201D; are just like these industrial councils and works councils to which I have just referred. They are based on enterprise level, as they call it, i.e. things are dealt with on factory floor level. I am glad the hon. member for Pinelands is nodding his head, because I understand Anglo-American sent him overseas some time ago to study things there. For a change he could tell us about the positive things in that direction which he saw when he went there on behalf of Anglo-American. I found his tracks in those countries, to which he had also gone to investigate things. Obviously things did not suit his book and consequently we hear very little from the hon. member for Pinelands. If we look at our own system in comparison with those which exist in Europe and Japan, I think that this liaison committee system of ours is the most ideal system for South Africa, a system which amounts to one being able to get one&#x2019;s Black workers together around a table, normally once a month, to discuss matters&#x2014;whether wages, uniforms, or bus fares. There are a few facets in those other systems from which we can learn something, but in general the system which we have developed here in South Africa, as the inquiries of the University of the Orange Free State and the University of Natal show, is surely the most effective we can have for our own country. After all, this liaison committee system is going to be tested in South Africa against one major basic requirement: To what extent does it contribute to bringing about labour peace in this country&#x003F; That is actually going to be the crucial test to which this committee system will be put. One also finds that in respect of 92% of the 435 strikes which took place in 1973 and 1974 and in which Black workers were involved, there were no works or liaison committees. Only in respect of 8% of these 435 strikes, in other words in respect of 35 of the strikes, was there a committee, whether a liaison committee or a works committee. The fact that at 92% of the places where strikes took place, there were no channels of communication surely proves, I think, the necessity of our employers establishing these channels of communication. It does not help to despair about the necessity of communication at symposiums. Nor does it help to advocate the recognition of Black trade unions indirectly at symposiums and then not be prepared, the next day when one is back in one&#x2019;s own factory where one holds the reins, to establish or to promote the most elementary form of communication there. Moving pleas of that nature do not help us at all. Therefore, I want to say that we expect our employers to do their duty.</p>

<p>A plea was made by the hon. member for Welkom that we make these works and liaison committees compulsory. There is much sense in that. One does not want to do everything which one has to do in this country by means of prohibition, obligation and legislation but one does at least want to give one&#x2019;s people the honour of being enterprising enough to do things themselves. That is why I want to ask our employers, since they have now seen on the grounds of all these findings that this <span class="col_4957-4958" refersTo="page_0892"/>system of committees is the most effective system for our country, that they should really do their part in introducing a system of communication immediately into their enterprises. One of the reasons why they have not yet done so, is because a great number of them have been sitting on the fence up to now. They have been influenced by the propaganda they have been hearing from the opposite side of this House. Many of them have been sitting on the fence awaiting developments. I want to tell hon. members, and through them, the country, that the Government believes that the system of committees is the most effective and that it is the system which is best able to serve the interests of the Black workers in South Africa. Therefore it is the intention of the Government to continue propagating this system, developing it and allowing it to succeed fully in achieving the fine object for which it has been established. Since this is the case, our employers may safely start doing their part in this connection.</p>

<p>In the course of his speech, the hon. member for Pinelands made the quotation which should be rectified, in my opinion. The hon. member referred to the Deputy Secretary of the department, Mr. Botha, who supposedly said, &#x201C;Black unions are on their way in.&#x201D; The hon. member said that Mr. Botha actually knows far better than the Government, better than the Minister and better than everyone, what the true position is. The article to which he referred, appeared in <i>The Star</i> on 22 March. However, I am surprised that the hon. member only saw that newspaper. Surely he reads all the newspapers, does he not&#x003F; Then did he not read that same <i>Star</i> of 24 March&#x003F; That read, &#x201C;Denial: Unions surprised.&#x201D; Did the hon. member not read what the hon. the Deputy Secretary said&#x003F; I quote, &#x201C;Mr. Botha described these claims as totally untrue.&#x201D; Perhaps it suits the hon. member&#x2019;s book just as little to inform us of that as it suited his book to inform us of what he saw the position was with the committee systems overseas&#x003F; The hon. member&#x2019;s record shows that he is a priest and when he has a quotation to make, he can exercise his priestliness fully in this House by providing the facts correctly at all times. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow, who was the main speaker on the United Party side asked me how I saw my task as the Minister charged with manpower affairs. He wanted to know in what direction I was heading and said that it seemed to him as if I was being purely negative in saying that this was not allowed and that that was not allowed.</p>

<p>He said I was doing nothing to encourage productivity, that &#x201C;Government policy&#x201D; was obstructing productivity. As we all know, that is the greatest United Party nonsense which one can find, because what has happened in the sphere of the utilization of Black labour, has really been something phenomenal. In recent years we have had such a reclassification of jobs in all our large industries and in all major industrial council areas, that Black workers today are doing parts of the jobs of artisans which, five years ago or further back, were done by White artisans. This process is a continual one. With the announcement of wages recently, it was announced in the engineering profession.</p>

<p>Since I have been taken to task about wages, I want to say something about that so as to be fair. I have been asked what the Government&#x2019;s wage policy is in respect of Black workers. I want to give it to hon. members with reference to the engineers&#x2019; agreement, which has not yet been officially considered or approved. However, since this matter has been raised in this debate, I think it is suitable to reply. I have been asked what the Government&#x2019;s policy is with regard to increasing Black wages. Here in my hand I have a document in which the increases in wages made from 1968 to 1974, are given. Up to 1970 the annual increases in wages in the case of Whites exceeded those of Coloureds or Bantu. However, in 1971, as a result of the attitude of this Government that ratio pattern was changed. In 1971 the Whites received an increase of 11,5% and the Blacks an increase of 12,3%. Let me mention the very latest figures now. In 1974 the Whites received a wage increase of 8,7%, while the Blacks received a wage increase of 28,5%. It is true that a large difference between the wages of the Whites and the Blacks still exists, but as far as the attitude of the Government is concerned, about which I was questioned, I think that this figure is an indication of What the Government is doing in that sphere.</p>

<p>I have also been questioned about the Unemployment Insurance Act. It is true that we revise that Act from time to time. <span class="col_4959-4960" refersTo="page_0893"/>I can announce that a special committee has been appointed by the Unemployment Insurance Board, to study the whole Act and to come forward with further proposals in connection with the improvement or restructuring thereof.</p>

<p>Then I have been questioned about the training of all groups of workers. The hon. member for Maitland wanted to know what the Government was doing in this regard. The things we are doing in this field are legion. What is being done in the field of training schemes for Black workers, can be argued fully during the discussion of the Vote of my colleague the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. What is being done to train Coloureds as motor mechanics can also be argued with the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations. A tremendous amount is also being done by the Department of National Education in the way of technical training for non-Whites. Therefore I shall not dwell on that. As well as these, there are also the numerous training funds which were established by legislation by this side of the House. There is a whole series of industrial councils. I am not going to list them here, because from time to time questions about them are answered in this House&#x2014;which establish training funds in their various industries so as to be able to train non-Whites more effectively and more expeditiously in that way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs made a plea in this connection that we give the White workers the opportunity to make use of this process of retraining. The hon. member spoke of 76 000 unskilled White workers. I can just tell the hon. member that the Government has decided that this should be done. We have just established a committee which is to consist of the Departments of Labour, National Education, Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations, Indian Affairs and Industries as well as employers&#x2019; organizations and trade unions. That committee has been established to inquire into the training and retraining requirements of industry in respect of Whites, Coloureds and Asians and to come forward with proposals.</p>

<p>There is something else which I want to say in connection with the question of training. Over the past years, the Government has often been criticized here for doing too little in connection with training. The Government has now proceeded to establish the centres to which I referred in brief and which can be fully discussed under the Vote of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. As far as that is concerned, it is really disappointing, after these steps have been taken, to have to read reports such as this one which appeared the other day in <i>The Star</i> under the heading &#x201C;Industry slow on training scheme&#x201D;. In the report it is said that it is a pity that the industrialists, who have pleaded for better training opportunities and facilities for so long do not make full use of these now that they have been established. The same opinion is also expressed in an article in the <i>Financial News.</i> I really want to express the hope that our employers will play their part now that they have received the State&#x2019;s contribution for which they pleaded for so long.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs raised another important matter, viz. the day of 14 August, on which the Language Festival is to be celebrated. The Government has declared 14 August a public holiday to commemorate the coming into being of the Afrikaans language. Because it has been declared a public holiday, this means that people who work in shops and offices will automatically get that day as a paid public holiday in terms of the Shops and Offices Act and also under certain wage determinations m terms of the Wage Act. The people who work in factories and who fall under certain industrial agreements, do not get it. The hon. member for Springs made a plea in this connection. He is supported by representations from the Iron and Steel Workers&#x2019; Association, in which they thank the Government and everyone in this House for the declaration of that day as a public holiday. In all fairness towards everyone who is gathered here, I shall read it. The writer says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should like to make use of this opportunity to thank the members of the House of Assembly and the Senate sincerely, on behalf of our members, for the great step on a special occasion. Be so kind as to convey our thanks and appreciation to them during the discussion of the Vote.</block>

<p>They proceeded to advocate that since the shop assistants and office workers would get that day as a paid holiday and would therefore be in a position to attend the Language Festival celebrations, the people falling under the wage agreements should get it as well. The position in this connection is that in terms of the wage agreements, this should <span class="col_4961-4962" refersTo="page_0894"/>have been negotiated a year ago. The Government has no power to intervene in these wage agreements or to insert any provision. However, I want to make use of the opportunity to appeal to our employers, on behalf of the Government, that they give their workers the opportunity on that day, 14 August, to enjoy that day as a paid holiday. The Afrikaans language means a great deal to us. It is the language which is used by 60% of us in this country and a language which all of us, whether we are Afrikaans-or English-speaking, appreciate and respect. I think it is fitting that it be commemorated in such a way, and I trust that the employers will give attention to this.</p>

<p>With that I conclude my first entry into the debate under this Vote.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to react to what was said by the hon. the Minister. I should rather leave it to my Leader &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026; the Leader of my group, the hon. member for Hillbrow to reply to that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Chairman, I should like, however, to reply to what the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark had to say. He quoted from the speech I made in this House last year in which I was supposed to have said that the young White man in South Africa had nothing to fear if job reservation in South Africa was removed. I still stand by what I said then and I want to assure the hon. member that he has nothing to fear either. I maintain that this is so unless the hon. member himself believes that we are incapable of retaining the lead and the start that we as parents have given to our young people and that they need the protection of the law to enable them to maintain that start and that lead. He is wrong. I am confident that the White youth of today will become the leaders of tomorrow and that they will always retain that position. I do not see why they need to be protected by any law.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to say something about the powers of this Department of Labour and its activities in regard to the protection of the workers. I was pleased to hear the hon. member for Brakpan referring to this subject. I know that there is existing legislation to give this department strict control over the places of work and the conditions of work and the protection of the workers by the exercise of strict control and periodic inspections of the machinery and methods at these places of work. There is also legislation controlling the use of certain processes which affect the health of the employee. We are grateful for the regulations that exist, and particularly, the ones which come into effect on, I think, 1 October of this year dealing with noise in industry. In terms of these regulations steps will have to be taken to combat noise and to prevent the hearing of workers exposed to such noise being detrimentally affected I see that a great deal has also been done in the department in connection with atmospheric tests with the object of combating industrial diseases. I am also aware that such diseases are scheduled in Schedule II of the Act and that if a disease which is mentioned in that Schedule is contracted, such persons will be covered under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act.</p>

<p>I wish to speak particularly about the diseases that are included in the Schedule to the Act and about which I am deeply concerned. I refer here to the diseases contracted by workers in the asbestos and lead industries. The hon. member for Brakpan referred to asbestosis but he only referred to it in passing in relation to its being contracted by workers away from the mines. I know that mineworkers are very well protected as far as asbestosis is concerned. I am more interested in those workers who are not covered by the Occupational Diseases in Mines and Works Act. I know that the hon. member referred to the appointment of the Erasmus commission which is investigating the asbestos industry but I should like to ask whether something cannot be done for those who have been affected by asbestosis in the past. I know that asbestos is used to a very large extent in industry. I wonder just how many people are aware of the extent to which asbestos is used in industry. For instance, virtually all roofing today is made from asbestos cement. A great deal of piping is made from asbestos cement. Asbestos is used as an insulator, as lagging in the covering of steam pipes. It is also used in the manufacture of brake linings. Wherever men work with it, and saw it or drill it, they are exposed to the asbestos dust which causes the dreadful disease of asbestosis. There has been very little control in regard to the elimination of this dust or the monitoring of the effects of the dust on the workers themselves. We should at least try something in the meantime to prevent the contamination <span class="col_4963-4964" refersTo="page_0895"/>of men&#x2019;s lungs by asbestos dust until such time as the findings of the Erasmus commission are made known. I would like to say that the Medical Research Council has done a great deal in regard to the investigation of the effects of asbestos, as has the Department of Mines. It is interesting to read what Prof. Webster has to say in the <i>Asbestosis Research Project</i> of 1970 which was apparently financed by the Department of Mines. Professor Webster states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is regretted that the unit has not been able to assist the non-mining industries which use asbestos, although repeated requests for such assistance have been made. Recently a questionnaire was received by an asbestos manufacturing concern from an international organization and submitted to the unit for the completion of certain paragraphs. The information which this unit could give was indeed meagre.</block>

<p>This is from a report to the Department of Mines. Having been involved in working with asbestos, I know how men who have worked with asbestos have been out of those jobs for 20 years or more and have only then developed cancer of the lungs as result of having worked with asbestos. I had a case very recently where a gentleman who worked on the railways as fitter and who must have got asbestos into his lungs at some stage from the lagging on steam boilers, contracted the cancer only after he had been on pension for three of four years and then died a most terrible death as a result of lung cancer. Mr. Chairman, I ask what we can do for these people and whether it is not possible for the hon. the Minister to enforce precautionary measures such as the compulsory fitting of exhaust systems in places where asbestos-cement is being used or where the asbestos cement is being mixed, and whether monitoring systems cannot be installed whereby men who are working with asbestos or in areas near asbestos plants can be tested regularly to see whether they have contracted asbestosis. I was told by a doctor from the Medical Research Institute that they had discovered at Kuruman or O&#x2019;Kiep, where the big asbestos mines are, that the wives and children of the miners were contracting asbestosis and that they were only getting it because of the presence of asbestos dust in the air in that particular area. Sir, this is a deadly thing and I do not think that the employers are aware of the danger which results from the use of dry asbestos mixed with other materials such as sand or cement.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like also to touch on the use of lead in industry. This is one of the oldest methods of industrial poisoning known to man. It is on record that as far back as the days of the Roman Empire, people developed lead poisoning as a result of the use of lead piping in plumbing. It is amazing to read in this report of the Medical Research Institute how easily lead poisoning can be contracted. We read here, for instance, that a group of 40 employees exposed to lead in a motor assembly plant, where they installed the batteries, contracted lead poisoning. It is reported here that a schoolboy of 11 contracted lead poisoning in a very serious degree through storing his airgun pellets in his mouth. It has also been proved that a builder developed lead poisoning through storing his home-made wine in an old domestic bath with a high percentage of lead in the solder. Sir, this is a very common disease. At the beginning, of course, it is not dangerous, but it can develop into a very dangerous disease once it attacks the kidneys. Then, of course, it becomes fatal.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to give the hon. member for South Coast my sincere support in the plea which he made here for the protection of workers in various industries in which asbestos is handled. If something could be done in this regard, it would be greatly appreciated by hon. members on both sides of this House. I think that this matter could also be discussed very beneficially under the Mines Vote.</p>

<p>Sir, this afternoon I want to associate myself with those who congratulated the hon. the Minister, who is in charge of this honourable portfolio of labour. I want to deviate a little from the general discussion which has taken place here this afternoon, and say a few words about the concept of labour. One of God&#x2019;s commands to mankind when the world was created was: &#x201C;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.&#x201D; From that day on, throughout the centuries, it has always been regarded as an honour and a privilege to work. Since we in this fine country are advocating every day that productivity should be increased, we cannot omit to make an appeal once again to <span class="col_4965-4966" refersTo="page_0896"/>everyone to work harder. There is a tendency among many people today to keep on demanding more remuneration for less work. This afternoon I want to make a plea to all our people to work harder. If this nation wants to make the grade, then all of us will have to do more and more work. All of us believe that facilities should be created for the various races to increase their productivity; this is necessary, but it is the duty of each one of us to make his own contribution. I have already told you, Sir, that when God created the world he said to mankind: &#x201C;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.&#x201D; But the word also tells me: &#x201C;Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise.&#x201D; Sir, it is clear from the Bible that the Creator had no time for a sluggard. He regarded it as a privilege for every person that has been placed on this planet to be able to work. Anyone who knows his history will tell you that it is a privilege to work. Sir, what happened during the depression years&#x003F; I am not reproaching anyone, but in those years it frequently happened that a work-seeker said to an employer: &#x201C;Please give me work; I am prepared to work these two hands of mine to the bone so that my wife and children may eat.&#x201D; Sir, are our people still prepared today to work these two hands which God gave us, to the bone&#x003F; No, all we hear today is criticism from all over. People do not ask themselves whether they are really earning the remuneration they received every day. I feel ashamed when I visit various offices and workshops and see how people, who should have started working at 8 o&#x2019;clock in the morning, only walk into the office or workshop at 8 o&#x2019;clock and then only begin to place the files on the desk or unpack their tools. If you walk into the office at four thirty or quarter to five in the afternoon, you find that the desk has been cleared and that they are sitting there, waiting for the clock to strike five. Sir, go and visit certain departments in Pretoria at 5 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon and see what happens there. You are afraid you might be killed in the stampede for the doors, or along the passage, as they storm out there when the clock strikes five. It is time this message went out to the people of South Africa: If we want to utilize the potential, the wealth which we have here, if we want to retain the privileges which we have here, then we shall have to do more and more work every day. If I do this, Sir, then I, as labourer, am worthy of my hire, as the Word says, but if I do not do this, then I am put to shame. I have already quoted to you, Sir, that Solomon said that we should go to the ant, consider her ways and be wise. We can also learn a lesson from the bee. Who of you here has ever sat down next to a beehive and watched the bees at work. The scientists tell us that the lifespan of the bee is only two to three weeks. What does it die of&#x003F; That bee works itself to death within two or three weeks. I have never yet heard of any person, White or non-White, who worked himself to death.</p>

<p>Yes, the cemeteries are full of people who ate themselves to death. Sir, one morning I stood watching two swallows building a nest. From early in the morning, when it became light, the female and the male swallows fetched clay from a nearby pan. From there they fetched the clay piece by piece and built their nest. That evening the nest was not yet large enough for them to sleep in, and they spent the night on an old beam. That was the first time that day that the two birds had stopped to rest, when it became dark and they were no longer able to mix the clay and the water. They spent <i>2</i>&#x00BD; days building that nest, and when the third day dawned that nest had been completed, and they were able to sleep in it. Sir, let that be a lesson to us Whites. Mankind, whom God created best of all His creatures&#x2014;the product which He was proud of having made&#x2014;will be held accountable for the fact that he keeps on demanding more remuneration today for less work. I think it is time we told the Whites and also the non-Whites, and particularly the Bantu, for whom so many pleas were made here today, that the time for holding out cupped hands is past; and if I may make an appeal to the leaders of our homelands, then I want to tell them that the primary necessity is that the people of a country must learn to work. And if I may address a message in this House this afternoon, I say to those homeland leaders: &#x201C;Let your people work.&#x201D; I say to Lesotho: &#x201C;Do not allow your people to go on strike and cause revolutions; you will starve in Lesotho; teach your people to work.&#x201D; Then they can return and show their country what they earned. Then they can feed their wives and children, for when hunger pangs gnaw at the stomach and the time arrives again, <span class="col_4967-4968" refersTo="page_0897"/>as it arrived in 1933 to 1939, when people queued up for work and many people asked for work and said that they were prepared to work their fingers to the bone &#x2014;I hope we never experience times like that again&#x2014;then I can only say to the hon. the Minister: &#x201C;You have an honourable position; you have charge of this major task. Thank the Lord you are meeting the needs, and I believe that in your time it will not be necessary for us to queue up for work again.&#x201D; For I want to say this, Sir, if one has experienced this, one can appreciate the word <i>&#x201C;work&#x201D;.</i></p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. LLOYD</person>:</from>

<p>In the early hours of the morning of 1 November 1974 this hon. House passed the Second General Law Amendment Act, 1974. In terms of certain provisions of that Act, the Master and Servants Acts, which dated from the previous century, were removed from the Statute Book. At this stage we all said it was a step in the right direction and something on which the National Party and therefore the present Government should be congratulated. You will remember, Sir, that in terms of the provisions of the Masters and Servants Act, it was a criminal offence for a farm labourer or a domestic servant to abscond from service. There were, however, also provisions to the effect that the servant could receive medical treatment and care at the expense of the employer or master. On 19 April this year, our hon. State President pointed out so correctly and strikingly that all people in South Africa should realize once more that the <i>quid pro quo</i> for our rights is obligations. This probably finds no more effective application than especially in the field of the law of contracts in South Africa. The position is that when I purchase a house and the written agreement is drawn up, I may not claim that house in terms of my rights under the contract before I have fulfilled my obligation, viz. the obligation to pay the purchase price or to provide security that it will be paid. The essentials of the contract of purchase and sale we also find in the contract service. The contract of service may be somewhat more sophisticated, but in short it also amounts primarily to my services being sold at a certain price or salary to a particular person or body corporate. The feature of the contract of service today in terms of our modern labour legislation or industrial legislation is that it is put in writing, so that the contract together with the conditions of service constitute the contract of service with the employer, so that I as employee and the employer may know exactly where we stand in relation to one another; that we may know what the rights of the employee and of the employer are, and, on the other hand, what the obligations of the employee and of the employer are.</p>

<p>In the light of what I have just said, I have asked myself the question whether the time has not arrived for serious consideration to be given to entering into written contracts of service in respect of our farm labourers as well as domestic servants and to specifying in writing what conditions of service apply in respect of these workers. Sir, has the time not arrived when we should see these people not only in the light of human dignity, so that they may be able to lead a dignified life, but also in the light of their contractual ability&#x2014; and please note, I am not saying their ability to enter into treaties&#x2014;and as people with whom we can indeed enter into a written contract&#x003F; Sir, today our Coloured people and Black people in South Africa are all learning to read and write. We are proud of that; the Government is proud of that. In many cases the White taxpayers are subsidizing this education to a large extent. But is it wrong then to enter into written contracts with them&#x003F; Is it not by doing precisely this that we shall be giving recognition to their human dignity&#x003F; I think the time has arrived when bodies such as the S.A. Agricultural Union should take the initiative to have a simple, yet comprehensive, contract drawn up, to have it printed and circulated through the agency of the provincial agricultural unions, through the agency of our agricultural co-operative societies and through the agency of our farmers&#x2019; unions, a contract which can be applicable to those labourers, particularly on farms, whose periods of service have a certain degree of permanence, a contract which will embody certain essential things, <i>inter alia,</i> the type of work to be done, whether it is to be general farm work, that of a tractor driver or lorry driver or a combination of one or two or all three of them; in the second place, working hours and working days, and the wages for the work, and not only R2 or R3 per day, but an actual salary scale, so that this labourer may also know that if he performs his duties to the best of his ability, he has the prospect of receiving an increment after a certain period of time, and may also know what the increment will be; and also <span class="col_4969-4970" refersTo="page_0898"/>as far as accommodation is concerned, whether it will be in single quarters or on the basis of family housing; leave and sick leave, medical services and medical care, insurance and workman&#x2019;s compensation benefits. Especially here in the Cape where the Coloured is becoming more rare as a farm labourer, I think it is essential for our farmers to give more and more consideration to the contract of service and the conditions of service, and what is more, to what they are offering and to what other bodies and persons are offering as well as to fringe benefits and incentives. We know that as far as fringe benefits are concerned, our farmers number among the employers in South Africa who provide the largest number of fringe benefits. Just think of rations such as flour and meat, vegetables and fruit, which are provided at low prices or even free of charge, free accommodation and free transport. But the time has arrived when we should also consider, as far as our domestic servants and farm labourers, are concerned, matters such as pension funds, medical funds, group life insurance schemes, and so forth. There are agricultural bodies which are considering these things and have it on their agendas year after year. Perhaps the time has arrived for us to give this matter more active attention. The repeal of the Masters and Servants Acts in South Africa has created a vacuum for those employees and employers, who fell under these Acts. A fine opportunity has been created for them to organize and regulate their own service relations civilly. Somebody should just take the initiative and I believe that the initiative should be taken by the employer.</p>

<p>Next I should like to dwell briefly on another aspect, and that is the utilization of manpower in South Africa. I want to dwell on a single aspect of this only, viz. the hundreds, if not thousands, of boards, committees, commissions, congresses, conferences, foundations, and, I think I may also add, judicial enquiries, which we have in South Africa. We complain of having limited manpower and we hold symposiums to decide in what way we may utilize our manpower to the optimum potential. Then we go ahead and appoint of our best brain power, of our most productive people, to committees, commissions and boards which overlap each other and some of which are not even necessary. If we want to look at one aspect of manpower utilization, we find that we have a Dairy Board on the one hand and a Milk Board on the other hand. In addition to these we have a Fresh Milk Producers&#x2019; Union and before long we shall probably have a Curdled Milk Board as well. If the price of fresh milk were to rise, we should probably have an Anti-Milk Board as well. Have we not reached the stage where we should combine some of these overlapping boards, committees and commissions in order to derive the best from our manpower potential&#x003F; Is it necessary to establish a Bantu Affairs Administration Board consisting of 34 members&#x003F; And then such a board still has an executive committee! Has the day not arrived when we should utilize our brain power potential to a larger extent and more effectively&#x003F; Then there also are the incessent congresses and conferences. Is it necessary for our institutes and other large bodies to hold a national congress or conference every year or every second year&#x003F; I know of no reason why any body or institute should meet more often than once every five years.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pretoria East made fun of farmers, but I shall not follow him in that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I would rather continue to speak about lead poisoning, something I spoke about earlier. As far as lead poisoning is concerned, a shameful practice has taken place in South Africa and has been brought to my attention. Lead poisoning occurs most frequently in factories where the workers work with batteries or the extraction of lead from scrap. When labourers or workers contract lead poisoning they often go off sick without consulting a medical doctor or a district surgeon. They go off sick and stay off sick suffering from initial lead poisoning, perhaps, or even advanced lead poisoning. Then they go back to their jobs and they continue their work because the laying-off period helps to &#x201C;cure&#x201D; them. After repeated sessions of being sick, however, they are, of course, paid off by their employers. The worker is not aware of the fact that the illness he has contracted has been as a result of his work and he goes away to his home where he either recovers or dies from this lead poisoning. I feel that something should be done to see to it that these people are protected by some system of monitoring the places where they work. These workers should be examined regularly to see whether they have contracted lead poisoning or not.</p>

<p><span class="col_4971-4972" refersTo="page_0899"/>It is interesting to see that the National Research Institute for Occupational Diseases undertook such an examination scheme or monitoring scheme in 1970-&#x2019;72. They examined 181 workers in four factories involved in the handling of lead. They did full clinical tests, blood and urine, to look for all the symptoms of lead poisoning. They found that the quantity of lead absorbed by 37% of these 181 men would have resulted in their suspension from work had the prescribed safety levels of the chief medical adviser of the Department of Labour in Britain been followed. At least 35% would have been notifiable under Schedule 2 of our Act. They also found that under our present set-up in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act only 18 of the 181 cases would have been notifiable as against 35%, or roughly 60, if the British standards had been applied. In terms of the standards suggested by the <i>British Journal of Industrial Medicine,</i> 44% would actually have been classified, and the position would have been even worse. The most interesting fact which emerged from this entire survey was that 31 cases were discovered at these factories which were notifiable under normal circumstances. This is a very high figure when one thinks that over the past five years in South Africa only three cases per year have been notified as suffering from lead poisoning. In these four factories the medical research team found 31 cases. In other words, the people themselves are not aware that they are suffering from lead poisoning, their employers are not aware of it and nothing is done about it. In their report the research team came to this conclusion:</p>

<block name="quote">There is a very significant proportion of workmen in lead-using industries surveyed, particularly in the lead acid battery manufacture and lead smelting sectors, suffering from excessive lead absorption and lead poisoning.</block>

<p>Furthermore, they recommend that there should be a much more intense investigation into the incidence of lead poisoning in factories. They also recommend that in all factories where people work with lead adequate ventilation systems should be used to clean the air regularly. They also recommend that all people working with lead should be medically examined. As a matter of fact, one of the biggest lead manufacturers in South Africa approached this institute and asked for their advice on how to install such a system. They employ a full-time medical sister to examine the men working with lead regularly once a week. If it is discovered that someone is suffering from lead poisoning he is immediately moved to another section of the plant. Those who suffer from lead poisoning to a more serious degree are treated clinically. In this particular factory the production rate has gone up, while the sickness rate and the loss of man-hours have come down markedly. The employer is benefiting from this as is the health of his employees. I would like the hon. the Minister to consider how these methods can be enforced on firms who are using lead or which are involved in the making of batteries. It would help prevent the further poisoning of people who work with lead. I realize, of course, that there are certain provisions in the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act dealing with this matter, but these provisions are not being observed or enforced. I suppose it is not possible for the department to enforce them as well as they would like to enforce them. If lead manufacturers and asbestos manufacturers were made aware of the production time lost and if the workers themselves were made aware of what they are being subjected to or being exposed to, we would definitely get a bigger reaction, both from the workers and from their employers. More co-operation would then be obtained from industries working with these two elements.</p>

<p>I would now like to come back to my favourite subject, namely productivity. The hon. the Minister has not answered the hon. member for Hillbrow&#x2019;s charges about the standards of productivity in South Africa. There is no doubt about it that productivity in South Africa is poor. It is probably good among certain sections of the working force, but the average is brought down considerably through the lack of productivity or the poor productivity at the other extreme where one has the so-called cheap labour. This labour is usually considered to be cheap labour but it is not. It is expensive labour, because it does not produce. We are reaching the unfortunate stage in South Africa today where we are being forced to pay higher and higher wages for less and less productivity. We are forced economically, and in the interests of social and industrial peace, to pay higher wages, but we are not getting extra productivity in return from the very people who are getting these wages. It is this problem that is worrying everybody&#x2014;every employer, exporter <span class="col_4973-4974" refersTo="page_0900"/>and manufacturer in South Africa. What is the answer of the hon. the Minister to this problem&#x003F; Are we just going to continue increasing wages without getting increased productivity&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with regret that I have to inform this House that an armed man or armed persons gained access to the consular offices of the Israeli Government last night or this morning, on the fourth or fifth floor of a building in Fox Street, Johannesburg. The person or persons are armed with an automatic rifle or rifles. It would appear that they are holding four to six persons as hostages in the offices. It appears further that no one was aware of this position before about 1 o&#x2019;clock this afternoon, when shots were fired from a window at passers-by in the street and, according to my information, subsequently at the crowds which had gathered there in spite of warnings. According to the information so far, it would appear that 32 people were wounded in this way and that two persons, one White and one Bantu, were killed. It would also appear that some of the persons inside the offices may be wounded or even seriously wounded. It is not known who the armed person or persons are, and up to now no demands have been received from these persons. However I wish to make it clear that under no circumstances will any demands be met.</p>

<p>Both the Israeli Ambassador and the Minister of Justice are on their way from Cape Town to Johannesburg. I wish to give this House the assurance that everything that is necessary is being done, and that high-ranking officers of all the departments concerned with such matters are on the scene. Access cannot be gained to the offices because of reinforced doors which are bolted from the inside. However, it is expected that this matter will be cleared up in the course of the night Hon. members will understand that I cannot elaborate at this stage on the methods because these people are in radio contact, and if the news were to be broadcast at any time this would of course defeat all efforts in this regard. However, I can express the hope that the matter, as I have already said, will be cleared up tonight.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Government and the House I should like to express my deepest sympathy to the next-of-kin of the persons who were killed, as well as to the innocent passers-by who were wounded and injured in this process. Since the task of the people dealing with this matter is being made extremely difficult by crowds that gather and do not want to go home, I want, in this way, to address an appeal to them to leave the central city area. Tomorrow, when I have more and better information at my disposal, I shall inform the House more fully in regard to this matter.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for several obvious reasons, <i>inter alia,</i> in view of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, I want to say nothing further on this occasion about the factual events at the Israeli Consulate in Johannesburg yesterday. Whatever provisional statement there was to make in this regard, has already been made by the hon. the Minister of Justice in his interview. I wish to convey my thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister for the fact that he went to the scene immediately and was present on the spot throughout the night until the matter had been disposed of. Hon. members will understand that many matters of a factual as well as a legal nature will have to be explored and investigated. These matters include questions pertaining to constitutional as well as civil law. Hon. members may rest assured that this will receive attention on the highest level.</p>

<p>By your leave, Mr. Speaker, I wish on this occasion to convey my special thanks and I think also the thanks of this House and of the country as a whole, to all the various Services that were involved in this matter. I am referring to the Police, the Defence Force and the Bureau. I should like to express my sincere thanks to Gen. Crous, his officers and men&#x2014;of all branches to Gen. Biermann, his officers and men and all who were involved, and to Gen. Van den Bergh and his staff. What is particularly gratifying, is that I am able to inform this House that the co-operation between these various Services was not only excellent, but was also maintained throughout on a very high note. This applies not only to the Services, but also to the fire brigade and other municipal services involved. I will be permitted to make special mention of the part played by Gen. Van den Bergh in the negotiations with and in the surrender of the terrorist. These took place on a particularly high level.</p>

<p>Having already expressed my commiseration with all concerned, the next-of-kin as well as the injured, I should again like to express the hope, and we all pray, that all the injured persons will make a very speedy recovery.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in this debate the Opposition has the opportunity of criticizing the Government in respect of labour matters in South Africa and in respect of the way they are handled by the hon. the Minister of Labour. I make bold to say that the hon. Opposition has failed miserably. The fact that five speakers of the joint Opposition have taken part in this debate up to now, as well as the content of those speeches, shows that the Government has a sound labour policy and that the Opposition has very little criticism to pass on the labour policy of the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow began a speech yesterday in which he mentioned a few things on which I should like to comment. In the first place the hon. member referred to the fact that, as he alleged, South Africa has such a low productivity. I want to tell the hon. member that I am surprised that he advanced that argument here. The tables to which he referred are quite unscientific. He cannot apply tables of that kind to South Africa. After all, the hon. member cannot compare the productivity rate of South Africa with that of countries such as West Germany and America, where the population set-up is completely different from that in South Africa. If, for the purposes of the argument, we proceed from the economic development growth of a nation, as Rostow did, we shall have a completely different situation. The hon. member knows that Rostow divided the economic development of a nation into five different phases, namely the traditional phase, the transitional phase; the phase of initial development, the phase of maturity and the phase of high consumption. Do hon. members know that the American population was in the same phase in the period 1910-&#x2019;50 as that in <span class="col_4977-4978" refersTo="page_0902"/>which South Africa is and will be in the period 1950-&#x2019;90&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member where the Black man in South Africa stands in terms of Rostow&#x2019;s various stages of development. Where does the Coloured person stand in that scale of development&#x003F; Where does the Indian stand&#x003F; And where does the White person stand&#x003F; When we take that overall view, the hon. member will have to agree with me that his argument was completely unscientific.</p>

<p>After the hon. member for Hillbrow, the hon. member for Maitland took up the tune and elaborated on the same theme. The false note was only sounded by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town, who eventually, when he came to the question of productivity, sounded such a false note that he became quite irresponsible. When the hon. member said that South Africa had a low rate of productivity because of the fact that this Government was keeping the Black man in South Africa illiterate, I thought that that was an irresponsible statement which the hon. member made. However, the hon. member will get his answer in respect of Black education when the Vote of the Minister of Bantu Education comes up for discussion next week. All I want to tell the hon. member at this stage is the following, and I want to quote &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">An African child has a better chance of getting to school, a better chance of getting to high school and a better chance of getting to university in South Africa than anywhere else on the continent of Africa.</block>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Hillbrow, who accused the hon. the Minister of Labour of being negative in his approach. These very things which the hon. member accused the Minister of approaching in a negative way, these very things are approached in a positive manner by the hon. the Minister. These very things are the cause and the reason for the continued implementation of a successful labour policy by this Government. These are the reasons why we have labour peace in South Africa. The hon. member mentioned that the hon. the Minister had said: &#x201C;Over my dead body will job reservation be abolished.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member mentioned a few other matters as well, basic policies in respect of which this Government and this Minister stand firm, policies which ensure prosperity in South Africa in regard to labour. I really think the hon. member for Hillbrow was extremely negative in his approach. He spoke of productivity and the EDP for 1972 to 1977 and the target we have set ourselves in respect of economic growth. If I ask the hon. member whether we have achieved that target, then the answer is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, over a five-year period. At the moment the growth rate is standing at 6,4%, and the period is not yet at an end. If the hon. member really wanted to be positive, he should have said that South Africa has a high growth rate and that our economic growth rate continues to show a tendency to rise, for these are the facts. Surely this increase in our economic growth rate has a beneficial effect on the standard of living of all population groups, of the lower income groups as well. Consequently it ensures a higher standard of living for all our inhabitants in this country.</p>

<p>If the hon. member wanted to be positive, he should furthermore have argued that the maximum utilization of human resources in South Africa is not only becoming a reality, but that our whole economic and labour policy must be designed to further this end, for the benefit of all population groups in South Africa. By April 1973 there was a shortage of almost 60 000 White workers, according to the <span class="col_4979-4980" refersTo="page_0903"/>manpower survey of the Department of Labour. With the EDP for the period 1972 to 1977, which has set a rate of 5,75% as its target, it means that the demand for White workers will continue to increase more rapidly than the supply and that by the end of 1977 the shortage of White workers will have increased to approximately 82 000. These are the facts, and the hon. member referred to them. However, this in turn means that the number of non-Whites who will have to be absorbed into vacant jobs in the economy will increase by approximately 5 000 a year. Job opportunities in the manufacturing industry alone will increase at a rate of 4,2% a year, i.e. by 57 000 jobs a year. Of these 57 000, approximately 11 500 will have to be filled by Coloured people and approximately 38 000 by Blacks. It goes without saying that in an attempt to ensure maximum efficiency and production, very serious attention has to be given to this fact.</p>

<p>There are three basic requirements we must comply with in order to ensure high productivity among our workers. The first basic requirement is that the workers should be paid a decent wage. In the second place, workers must be trained efficiently so that their productivity will justify the payment of such a wage. In the third place, labour peace must be brought about by establishing good relations between workers and employers. With these three basic objects in mind, the hon. member should have asked, if he wanted to be positive, whether this Government has provided the machinery with which this may be achieved. Then he should at least have come to the honest conclusion that that machinery has in fact been provided by means of works and liaison committees. Proof of this was furnished by, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Welkom, when he referred to the survey conducted by the University of the Orange Free State, and the hon. the Minister, when he referred to the survey conducted by the University of Natal. These surveys came to the conclusion that productivity has in fact been increased in 40% of the cases where that machinery exists. The Government&#x2019;s system of liaison and works committees has established proper channels of communication, and as I have said, it is significant that in 40% of the cases this has already led to increased production. This system has tremendous potential. After all, it is a system in terms of which workers are represented on a company or an enterprise basis and not on an industrial basis, as is the case with ordinary trade unions. It does not only mean that the circumstances of the workers&#x2019; employment&#x2014;their wages, their conditions of service, etc.&#x2014; are improved by this. It can in fact be a powerful means through which the worker can be allowed to participate in the progress and the fortunes of the enterprise for which he works. It would enable him to take a common pride in the undertaking along with the management, and would consequently motivate him in respect of the quality of his labour and the product which is to be produced. I think that if the hon. member had referred to this, if he had come along here and appealed to our employers and industrialists to co-operate by means of these works and liaison committees, in training our people and in providing them with further motivation in respect of their labour situation, he would have made a positive contribution which could have done South Africa some good.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think we have now had an example here of productivity and of labour utilization in the sense that the hon. member for Koedoespoort, who belongs to the right party, a productive party, made a productive contribution to this debate. I do not derive any pleasure out of other people&#x2019;s embarrassment. One finds it difficult to say something when people are in an embarrassing position. The truth, circumstances and other peoples&#x2019; interests, sometimes force one into situations one does not want to be in. The entire Opposition, as they are sitting over there, is political completely bankrupt, and the proof of it is sitting here in front of us in the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>It is simply a fact. It is once again quite clear to us that the entire Opposition, as they are sitting here, are integrationists. They are interested in nothing else but the downfall of the National Party and the National Government in some way or other.</p>

<p>Let us consider the statements we have had in the debate so far. They must tell me whether I am offending them.</p>

<p>It was said that South Africa had a very poor productivity figure compared with that <span class="col_4981-4982" refersTo="page_0904"/>of other countries. It was also said that low productivity is the result of the Government&#x2019;s ideology. It was said further that a &#x201C;crash training programme&#x201D; will solve the productivity problem. [Interjections.] It was said: &#x201C;The Government&#x2019;s labour policy has come to the end of the road&#x201D;; &#x201C;narrow the wage gap&#x201D;; &#x201C;no discrimination of labour&#x201D;; &#x201C;do away with work reservation&#x201D;; in other words, job reservation plays no part in South Africa. It has been asked which Whites are unable to compete with the non-Whites. This is a summary of the statements. These statements amaze me; as a matter of fact, they astonish me. Hon. members complain about the productivity figure, but at the same time they want to enforce increased wages for the workers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mcintosh">

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>Any normal person will know that increased wages and salaries follow increased productivity, and not the other way round. Surely, this is a fact. They say a &#x201C;crash training programme&#x201D; should be followed, as if this is the only factor which promotes productivity. With this &#x201C;crash training&#x201D; one can very easily accomplish the opposite of what one wants to accomplish. They say job reservation only affects 2,6% of the Whites in South Africa. They know only too well that this is not true. Anybody in his right mind will know that this is not true. Job reservation affects the entire economy through the country and, therefore, all the population groups. This they will now have to gainsay. In its entirety it affects the whole of the industrial sphere.</p>

<p>The other question is what the United Party wants to do when we come to, among other things, the Public Service. They must reply to my question and tell me what they want to do. What do they want to do when we deal with the White worker, the Coloured worker, the Indian worker and the Bantu worker in the trade unions&#x003F; Do they want to liaise with them or do they not want to liaise with them&#x003F; The utilization of manpower has become such an important factor in our industrial life today that it is the task and duty of the Opposition party to appeal to the people to see to it that they make the best use of the manpower they have at their disposal. Here is something the hon. members cannot dispute. A few years ago I made a speech on the shortage of engineers we would have. Let us consider the reverse side of the picture. Engineers dealing with research and planning, do work which may just as well be performed by technicians. This also happens in many other occupational spheres. In this way, for instance, architects are often used to draw plans. It is not his task; it is not his duty either and therefore it is a waste of manpower. The engineers for instance point out that 30% of their working time is occupied by work which may just as well be performed by technicians. It was found that escpecially new graduates are of the opinion that they are not being utilized as desired. According to the research of the HSRC 34% of the new graduates said that their training receives very little attention when they are employed and are given tasks to perform. Just how useful the training is, is another question.</p>

<p>The effective utilization of our labour force is the responsibility and the task of every individual employer. It is here that we think a major deficiency exists. Seen from a practical and organizational viewpoint, this is not always, possible. Because we know it, we have to admit that incorrect usage springs from this organizational aspect. When we consider the small engineering firm, we notice that it cannot afford an architect, or an engineer together with a technician. Some solution or other has to be found for it. Then there are other cases where the training cannot be linked to the profession so easily. A person who has a Std. ten certificate is able to do a large variety of jobs. The same applies to the person with the B.A. degree. He is not specialized either and can therefore choose his work from a wide field. I want to plead that training and professional spheres be linked up to a greater extent and that more and more research be done in this regard. With appreciation, I also want to take cognizance of the work the Department of Labour is already doing by means of professional services to bring about this liaison. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#lorimer">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. LORIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during this debate we have heard a considerable amount of nonsense talked about trade unions, especially Black trade unions. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark in particular had a lot to say about that. A certain amount of confusion seems to exist about what a trade union really is. It must be appreciated that a trade union is merely the machinery that is used to facilitate the <span class="col_4983-4984" refersTo="page_0905"/>process of negotiation which is a necessary part of normal and healthy employer/employee relationships. Trade unions do not bring about strikes in themselves. We have strikes aplenty as the hon. member for Pinelands has already pointed out. Strikes are a manifestation of worker discontent and it is important that, where there is discontent and unhappiness with the working conditions, the necessary machinery should exist to channel that discontent into a position where problems can be discussed and solutions found without having to resort to strike action. Whether or not trade unions for Black workers are recognized, this will not prevent strikes. People will withdraw their labour if they are dissatisfied with working conditions. The fact that in recent months and over the last couple of years so many people have withdrawn their labour shows a great deal of dissatisfaction with working conditions. If a union exists, there is a good chance of the problems being resolved before the workers resort to strike action.</p>

<p>I want to warn hon. members on the other side of the dangers of refusing Black workers the right to organize themselves. During the last couple of years we have seen from the many strikes that have taken place that Black workers have begun to realize that they have power. Denied political rights of any sort, they have begun to realize that they have power of another sort, and that is economic power. Black people have begun to realize that this economic power is a very potent weapon indeed. I believe we are endangering South Africa by creating a situation in which economic power is used for political ends and in which wild-cat strikes or illegal strikes are used not to better working conditions but for political advantage. We saw what the position was in the case of so many of the strikes that took place in Durban last year and just before that. In those strikes there was no direct negotiation between employer and employee. Negotiations took place between employer and homeland Government. In other words, it became a political issue. I want to warn members on the other side that this sort of situation must be avoided at all cost. Machinery should be allowed which will enable negotiations to take place between the employees and the employers in any one industry as a matter of course.</p>

<p>If we Whites in South Africa are dissatisfied with our situation, we have the machinery at our command to express this dissatisfaction. On the political level we have the ballot-box. We can vote for or against a member of Parliament, a member of the provincial council and a town councillor. On employment level we can join trade unions and in that way operate legally and on an organized basis. A trade union is at the very least a safety-valve, and that is what is needed for Black workers. Hon. members on the other side must realize that membership of a trade union is a two-edged sword. On the one hand it gives members specific rights, but on the other hand it also gives specific responsibilities to members. I think I am right in saying that for the most part the trade unions in South Africa have exercised their responsibilities in a responsible way. However, after listening to the attitudes expressed by members on the other side of the House I wonder whether certain members on that side are in favour of trade unions at all. Perhaps the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, who expressed himself as against trade unions in various countries, can say &#x2026;</p>

<p>I again cannot get an answer from the hon. member. If the criterion is race, then that is disgraceful and blatamt discrimination. [Interjections.] Allowing Whites to belong to recognized, responsible trade unions and forbidding the same thing to Blacks is totally discriminatory. I find it quite extraordinary to hear the hypocritical chants that we have heard from other quarters about getting away from discrimination, because when it comes to something important, like the rights of workers, the real truth comes out. Discrimination can exist as long as it does not matter and does not affect people as individuals. [Interjections.] We see it as well in the breaking down of job reservation and the industrial colour bar. We hear lots of hypocritical talk, plenty of it. Butter would not melt in the mouths of certain people whom I have heard talk, until we get to the really important matter of job opportunities. Then all these fine-sounding phrases that we hear from the other side of the House are forgotten. I would like to put to the hon. the Minister the urgent necessity to change certain sections of present Government policy specifically on two points, namely trade unions and the industrial colour bar. The present policy is indefensible, immoral, discriminatory and it will result in the long run in embittering industrial relationships. The signs are all there but there seems to be blindness on the part of the hon. the Minister and the Government. During an earlier debate I raised the question of the migratory labour system and I asked whether the hon. members opposite considered this system to be conducive to increased productivity. We have heard talk about productivity today.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should ask the hon. the Minister whether he considers the migratory labour system to be efficient or inefficient. Is it more costly or less costly than normal forms of labour&#x003F; As far as I am concerned it hinders productivity and therefore it is inflationary. Again we have lip service being paid to the fight against inflation, but when it comes to this point the Government&#x2019;s ideology again raises its ugly head and we are expected to live with an inflation rate that is far worse than it need be. We are made to pay for nonsensical policies by decreasing living standards. There are a lot of hon. members on that side of the House with the mentality that it would be better to be poor and separate than rich and together. It would be better to live on &#x201C;mieliepap&#x201D; apart than have a more comfortable existence in a more comfortable and shared society. [Interjections.] Hon. members can make as much noise as they like, but the choice is as simple as this ideology or common sense or, to put it another way, prosperity or porridge. We on these benches have made our choice; we want prosperity and common sense.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to ask the hon. member who has just spoken whether, in speaking of Black trade unions and strikes, he was not aware of the fact that the Schlebusch Commission found last year that there had in fact been certain militant powers behind certain strikes, in Natal, for example. I want to say to the hon. member that he did almost the same this afternoon by suggesting to the Black workers that they are able to achieve this or that if they want to. I want to tell the hon. member that fortunately our Bantu workers in South Africa are responsible people who listen to their leaders, and that their leaders, too, are responsible people.

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I want to come back to the arguments advanced here by certain hon. members yesterday, but before doing that, I just want to say this to the hon. the Minister; I wonder whether he realizes that one of the greatest compliments that has ever been paid to a Minister in this House was paid to him <span class="col_4987-4988" refersTo="page_0907"/>yesterday and is being paid to him today by hon. members on that side. I say this because the Opposition is finding it so difficult to get enough speakers to take part in this debate. We had the situation here yesterday that one of the hon. members spoke for half an hour. An hon. junior member on the other side spoke twice, and another hon. junior member also spoke twice. This should indicate to the hon. the Minister that they have no criticism to pass on his policy. They have no alternative labour policy to the one implemented by the hon. the Minister and his department.</p>

<p>Sir, I come now to the hon. member for Pinelands, who said here yesterday that strikes are much more common in South Africa than in certain other African countries. I want to ask the hon. member whether he is not ashamed of himself as a South African for having made such an accusation here. After all, he knows that the countries to which he referred are not at all comparable to South Africa. These are countries with a very low percentage of employment. In these countries there is almost no employment, and when strikes occur, those strikes are not reported to the world.</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members on that side have spoken of wiping out the wage gap. That may be a popular slogan, but it is an irresponsible one. I want to say to those hon. members that if they are going to wipe out the wage gap everywhere and raise Black wages to an unrealistic level, they will give rise to chaos and unemployment among the Black people in South Africa. Let us say, for the sake of argument, that South Africa has a Black labour force of 3 million people. The ideal is for those 3 million people to enjoy full employment at wages on which they can live fairly decently. The alternative is for only 1 million or 2 million of those 3 million people to have jobe at very high wages; it is only logical that this will happen, because as soon as wages and salaries are increased to an unrealistic level, industrialists and employers will proceed to automatize and mechanize their factories and works, and this will cause Black manual labour to disappear from the labour market, and the upshot of this will be that a million or a large number of the 3 million Black workers will eventually be unemployed and unfed. Sir, I do not say this only because I am a South African and a National M.P.; I say this because I find myself in good company, company which includes overseas experts. I have here on my bench an American newspaper report. The heading of the report reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">High Black wages: American warns: A warning has come from Washington itself that unrealistic pressure to increase the wages of Blacks in South Africa will lead to unemployment, not only in this country, but in other African countries as well.</block>

<p>The <i>United States News and World Report</i> quoted this information from the magazine <i>African Development</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Kenya the average wage of a farm labourer is 25 cents a day. Black farmers in Uganda hire workers from nearby Rwanda at R5 a month. In Malawi few rural labourers earn more than R6 a month, which is prescribed by the Government. In the textile industry of Northern Nigeria the average annual income is R307 a year. In prosperous Cameroon industrial workers earn about R117 a month.</block>

<p><i>United States News and World Report</i> goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many of the African countries with Black governments already have a high urban unemployment rate. There is keen competition for jobs. Governments clip the wings of trade unions which dare to bargain for better wages. What happens&#x003F; Workers leave their families and flock from Botswana, Malawi, Zambia, Swaziland and Lesotho. They travel hundreds of miles to find work in South Africa&#x2019;s gold mines. Attempts to increase the income of Black workers in South Africa may encourage similar actions in countries with Black governments, experts believe. Then people may lose their jobs if employment is reduced to cut down on jobs. Inevitably, many Governments will oppose this tendency. Their aim is more job opportunities, not higher wages.</block>

<p>I may just mention here, Sir, that the labour policy followed by our Minister and his department, in terms of which a minimum wage is determined for certain jobs, is the right one. The employer must pay this, but if he wants to pay more, he is free <span class="col_4989-4990" refersTo="page_0908"/>to do so. It is up to him. We on this side of the House believe that this is the right policy to follow. Then I may just ask hon. members who think that our Black people are working for such low wages whether they realize that no fewer than 900 000, of perhaps 1 million, Black immigrant labourers are employed in South Africa today&#x003F; Almost 1 million Black immigrant labourers are employed in South Africa at the moment. These are the people from the countries where there are no strikes. [Interjection.] I just want to ask hon. members whether they realize that in a country such as India, with its 600 million inhabitants, 400 million have to be content with a salary of less than R4-38 a month. When one looks at these things, I think that the Opposition should not just pay a silent compliment, but that they should rise and convey their congratulations to the Minister in words.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to express a few words of thanks and appreciation to the hon. the Minister and his department for the fine things they are doing, the fine things which they still find the time to do in the midst of their pressing activities. [Interjections.] The department provides work for, <i>inter alia,</i> persons who are unemployed in South Africa. It is a magnificent task which the department is performing there. The department also provides a wage subsidy&#x2014; which amounted to R272 000 last year&#x2014; for persons who are physically unable to compete in the open labour market because of advanced age or physical handicaps. The department subsidizes eight workshops for blind persons to the amount of R470 000 a year. The subsidy on sheltered labour for Whites was increased by 15% in the past year and that in respect of non-Whites by 25%. As far as I know, there are 13 factories which offer sheltered labour to these people who are unable to compete in the open labour market.</p>

<p>Sir, in the light of all the speeches yesterday and the few that have been made today, I want to say once again that we may congratulate this hon. Minister and his department on their fine labour policy which helps to make South Africa the country which enjoys the greatest peace and prosperity in the whole world.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. BALLOT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when one rises in this House for the first time, one feels very humble, because one realizes that one is standing in the highest and most authoritative Chamber in our country. I realize, too, that I have to succeed a great man. Since this is the first time I have risen in this House, I want to begin by paying tribute, on behalf of my constituency and its inhabitants, to my predecessor in this House, Dr. the Hon. N. Diederichs, our present esteemed State President. We thank Dr. Diederichs for his loyalty to his voters, that fine asset in life which money cannot buy. We thank him for the steadfastness and strength of will which he displayed over the years, and for that wonderful gift of remaining calm in the midst of a storm. We thank him for always having persevered in a course of action once it had been adopted. Dr. Diederichs left a very deep impression in our constituency and as a servant of his people he also had to pay a price for his leadership. Dr. Diederichs did not pay this in gold, but, amongst other things, in long hours of work and sleepless nights. For this we convey to him our deep gratitude and sincere thanks.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to those in this House who received me here with so much kindness, and who addressed words of inspiration to me. Furthermore, my sincere thanks and appreciation are due to the hon. members for Losberg and Vanderbijlpark, who introduced me when I made and subscribed the oath.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, allow me now to say a few words about productivity. Productivity is of major importance for the purpose of stimulating our economic growth and enabling it to reach even greater heights. Higher productivity and encouragement to work harder are of great national importance. It cannot be denied that increased productivity is a prerequisite for the strengthening of our national economy, the growth of the national product, and the promotion of the well-being and standard of living of all our population groups. It is the responsibility of every citizen to be enterprising, to show initiative and to analyse his own performance in his work more critically. Everyone must ask himself whether he is working hard enough and productively enough and whether he is making a positive enough contribution to the economic welfare and the development of his country to enable it to reach even greater heights.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, South Africa is the industrial giant of Africa. The Republic has a tremendous production potential, and the welfare which is made possible by this can <span class="col_4991-4992" refersTo="page_0909"/>only be fully realized if we work harder and more productively. Even if we prosper, we must be on our guard and remember that prosperity, just like adversity, presents man with one of his greatest and most important challenges. Increasing prosperity makes the greatest demands on man. If he does not respond to these successfully, he will be destroyed. It is the duty of every employer to afford his employees the opportunity of being more productive where this is not the case already. In this respect the relationship between employer and employee is of the greatest importance. They must take cognizance of each other&#x2019;s aspirations and ideals. The important key lies in the fact that every job must be made worth while and must be invested with responsibility, so that every employee may derive full satisfaction from what he achieves in his work. Let every task he performs be a challenge to him. Let him feel that human life must from its very nature be dedicated to something, a task or enterprise, great or humble, a destiny, glorious or insignificant. Only in this way can we be assured of the most highly motivated people and consequently of high productivity as well. Great attention must be devoted by the employer to the question of recognizing in an efficient manner the human involvement in the business or enterprise. The emphasis must not be laid only on the security and benefits offered to the individual. There are some who believe in having rights without accepting corresponding obligations, but the motivation of workers, with the emphasis on the positive part they play in the progress made by the business or enterprise, has become the most important thing. Let authority be allocated in accordance with responsibility. In this way it will be possible to use every person as a sound springboard in order to create a powerful and balanced economic growth and also to face the great questions of the future with the thought that the economic future is the challenge of today which will determine the tomorrow of our nation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is my privilege to congratulate the hon. member for Overvaal on his maiden speech in this House. I am especially pleased that he dealt with the subject of labour and hard work. When I was at school, I had a teacher who taught me that you get &#x201C;nothing for nothing and very little for six pence&#x201D;. Now it has become &#x201C;nothing for nothing and not much more for five cents Whatever the case may be, I want to wish the hon. member for Overvaal a very productive parliamentary career with very hard work, because it is clear to me that he will enjoy that hard work.</p>

<p>I now want to return to the Vote and quickly rectify two small matters. The <b>first</b> is the remark which the hon. member for Koedoespoort made about what he called a scandalous remark by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. What the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town said was that the Government, for a number of years, as a matter of policy, had pegged the amount which was available for Bantu education and that that was conducive to a lack of skilled workers among those people in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to argue with the hon. member about illiteracy or lack of skill now. In the sense in which I am speaking, both expressions mean the same to me.</p>

<p>Then I also want to say to the hon. member for Meyerton that I am actually sorry he did not consult his Whip before he spoke and came out with the absurd statement that there were too few hon. members on this side of the House who wanted to speak. If he had consulted his Chief Whip he would have known that as a result of an agreement between the Whips the time for the discussion of this Vote has been curtailed and that that was the reason our not allowing more speakers to take part in this debate. [Interjections.] However, if the hon. member would like to have half a dozen speakers, he can have them. They are ready to speak and I must express my regret that these hon. members are really not able to come forward with very positive contributions.</p>

<p>I have now said what I wanted to say, and I come now to that which I do not want to discuss. Firstly, I do not want to discuss work reservation. I remember the days when hon. members on the opposite side, on ministerial level as well, stood up and said to us &#x201C;rather poor, but White&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Is he going to change his viewpoint then&#x003F; I do not want to discuss it now, but it is nevertheless something which will happen as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>I want to discuss something else, something which I believe the hon. the Minister should hear and to which I hope he will devote his attention. During the past weekend a message was addressed to the people of South Africa by the Economic Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister. The essence of that message to South Africa was that we as nation should save more, work harder and produce more. That was the essence of that message. Production is very closely linked to the security of South Africa in many spheres. When I look at South Africa, and I hear about the problems&#x2014;and at one stage yesterday I was deeply aware of problems&#x2014;I can only say that economic soundness and an economic resurgence will give us an answer to many of the problems which seem insurmountable to South Africa today. I have referred to the report of the Economic Advisory Council, and with reference to this I wish to address myself to the hon. the Minister. I do not want to argue with him; I am merely asking him to explain the matter clearly to me, for we have been searching for an explanation throughout the entire debate. That council states very clearly that if we want to maintain the growth rate of 6,4%&#x2014; and no person will doubt that we should do this&#x2014;it will simply mean that in four years&#x2019; time we will have a shortage of 60 000 skilled Whites in South Africa. We will have a shortage of 60 000 pairs of White hands to do the work to give us the badly needed growth of 6,4%. Hs the time not arrived in South Africa when we should stop looking at the colour of a man&#x2019;s hands&#x003F; Is it not true that South Africa was built over 300 years by black, white and brown hands&#x003F; If I were to go to the hon. the Minister this afternoon and say that we should bridge the wage gap and the labour shortage for our own future, I also have to ask where he is going to find these people. He will tell me that we should train the people we have. However, the White man only has a certain ability. He cannot go further than that point. We also know that the vast majority of the Whites today are already skilled people. One therefore has to search on other fronts. Hon. gentlemen can tell me now that the industrialist should train his people. I say that I agree with him. But what industrialist will train his people at his own expense unless he has some measure of assurance that those people have a certain measure of permanency in his service&#x003F; And as soon as I speak of permanency in South Africa, I am in conflict with the ideology of the National Party. Is it not true&#x003F; If I am correct as far as that statement is concerned, I ask the <span class="col_4995-4996" refersTo="page_0911"/>hon. the Minister that he is going to do to cut the knot. It is as simple as that. He can say I am dramatizing if he likes. It does not matter to me what he says about me as person. After all, he as the hon. the Minister and I are both South Africans and surely we both believe in growth, productivity and economic progress. Are we not then aware of the fact that every time we want to raise the growth rate a little, one of the bottlenecks is in fact a shortage of labour&#x003F; Is it not true&#x003F; He can now say what he likes about work reservation and about Black trade unions. I know what history will prove. He should lift the veil for us a little from the secrets he apparently has and which he does not want to tell us about. What is he going to do to cut the knot&#x003F; What is he going to do to bridge the gap between the labour shortage in South Africa and the work that has to be done&#x003F;</p>

<p>I would like hon. members to make interjections, because I want to hit them harder this afternoon than they have been hit for a long time. [Interjections.] I want to start with the hon. member for Hillbrow. He is the shadow Minister of Labour on the side of the official Opposition, and certain newspapers refer to him as the future leader of the official Opposition in South Africa. That will be the biggest disaster that has ever hit the Republic. The hon. member for Maitland referred to a disaster and a state of crisis, but I want to say that the hon. member for Hillbrow will have to do his homework. They are breaking down something very excellent in South Africa. I want to make the statement this afternoon that South Africa, economically speaking, is one of the most powerful countries in the world. My second statement is that the labour rest and labour stability in South Africa is one of the most important reasons for our economic stability in South Africa. The hon. members referred to an acute shortage of White trained workers. How serious is this shortage percentage-wise&#x003F; We have a shortage of 3% in South Africa. What is 3 % when one considers the tremendous development in South Africa&#x003F; If we did not have that shortage of 3%, would the hon. members have preferred unemployment in South Africa&#x003F; Is that what hon. members want&#x003F; The hon. member for Orange Grove advocated Black trade unions today. I want to say quite clearly what my viewpoint is with regard to Black trade unions. We in South Africa have labour peace. Let us consider the position in other countries. Take Italy, for example. I believe one can dial a certain telephone number in Rome where they tell you which trade union is striking. That is the position which exists in many countries in the wold. I want to say in this hon. House that we should pay tribute to the workers of South Africa for the wonderful labour peace we enjoy in this country; we should pay tribute to the labourers and the trained workers in South Africa for the peace we can enjoy here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bodenstein">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not have sufficient time, but I shall come to the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I am asking for injury time. I have no time to waste and I want to come again to the statement I wish to make. The hon. members on the other side, being the Opposition in South Africa, should realize today that the Nationalist Party is governing <span class="col_4997-4998" refersTo="page_0912"/>this country and that the labour policy is closely linked to the political policy in South Africa. If the hon. members should upset the political policy of the National Party, they could speak of Black trade unions in White South Africa. Hon. members have to realize for good and all today that this Government believes in the development and the right of self-determination of the homelands. Do hon. members know what they are doing today&#x003F; Hon. members know that we have labour peace in this country, but they want to demolish something else. They want to demolish the whole concept of separate identities. Hon. members on the other side are creating the impression in the outside world that labour unrest will develop in South Africa and that we shall experience economic problems so that we shall not be able to proceed with the policy of self-determination. Historically it is true&#x2014;I want to be quite honest&#x2014;that many foreign labourers are working in South Africa. This is so, and it will probably continue to be the case in future. But we are giving shape to the homelands. In this process of the homelands obtaining independence, education and all kinds of functions are transferred to them. In this way, labour matters will also fall under them in course of time. When the Transkei, for example, becomes independent and feels that it does not want to function on the basis of works committees, they will have the right to allow trade unions in their own area, but we say that we do not believe in Black trade unions here in White South Africa.</p>

<p>We believe it is not conclusive to labour peace in White South Africa to encourage Black trade unions and that is why we do not recognize them.

In Japan, on the other hand, they have a growth rate of 13% in one year while there is a drop in the growth rate the following year. South Africa, however, enjoys stability and stable growth, of which we should be proud. The growth of a country does not only concern labour, but also the raising of capital managerial training and all kinds of other factors.</p>

<p>The hon. member is being very pious here. He is a person who ostensibly pleads the cause of the Black man, but when a Black labourer walks through his constituency he has a fit. The hon. member is politically dishonest, for although he seems to be the great spiritual strength in this House who wants to speak to the Black labourer, he has a fit when a labourer walks through his constituency. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>South Africa has treated the Black worker in South Africa well, with a tremendous sense of responsibility. But my first priority and my first obligation in this White Republic is the White worker. There must be no illusions about that. I want to make it quite clear we establish technical schools and all kinds of institutions to grant the White labourer an opportunity to an increasing extent of becoming better trained. As the White worker progresses to better positions in this process, I have no objection to Black workers being employed in the positions vacated by the White workers. But I want to say in all sincerity, while there is a White worker who has to fill a certain position because he is unable to get another position, he will receive priority in White South Africa. I am not ashamed of saying that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, South Africa is the workshop of Africa, and the importance of South Africa in the development of Africa should most certainly not be overestimated. Just as we have a common destiny with Africa, the progress of Africa is also bound up with the progress of South Africa in the industrial sphere and the labour peace here in South Africa. It is undeniably so that one component of labour peace and the progress of South Africa, is the confidence overseas countries have in our industrial power and stability and peace in this country. Therefore I want to suggest that it is criminal, that it is detestable and that it is a disservice to South Africa to suggest by means of misleading ideas and words that there is unrest in South Africa, that there is dissatisfaction among our labour force in South Africa and that the Black labourer here in South Africa is on the point of exploding because of his dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>&#x2020;There are hon. members in this House, Sir, who take great pride in their so-called cleverness. I would typify this as being unpatriotic cleverness. [Interjections.] These are people who seem to think that should they get applause from leftist newspapers and reporters, this only goes to prove now absolutely objective they are. If the cap fits, you can put it on. They imagine that this proves how absolutely objective they are, and how international in thought they are as opposed to being patriots and nationalists of South Africa.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to a few remarks made by the hon. member for Pinelands. If I understood him correctly, the hon. member for Pinelands made a statement in this House that South Africa had the second highest strike figure in Africa.</p>

<p>I am sure that this remark will bring him tremendous applause from the leftist circle. Perhaps that is what he is angling for. No real and proper authority was quoted for this absurd statement. I asked the hon. member to supply me with the figures that he had quoted and he did provide me with a half or third of a page of typewritten figures indicating the countries and the figures he had quoted. I noticed that this was a torn-off piece of paper which gave no authority as to where those figures had been obtained. When I asked him verbally what the authority for those figures was, he told me that they had been obtained from the International Labour Organization.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Z. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that is correct. I then surmised that these figures might have been an abstract from some source or other. I wrote the hon. member a little note to ask him whether he could kindly let me have the document that he had referred to but, thus far, the hon. member has not replied to me. This was very clever. Obviously, one must then say that this was a pamphlet issued by the Progressive Party for their information service. [Interjections.] Knowing the Progressive Party as I do, I decided that this could only be slanted against the interests of South Africa. When I consulted the statistical yearbook of the International Labour Organization for 1974, I found the following interesting facts. In the first instance, the list that the hon. member supplied to me was a conglomeration of figures. In one case figures for 1971 were provided; in another case, 1972 figures were supplied. Interestingly enough, in certain cases as far as certain countries were concerned, the worst figures were given. In other cases again the best figures were taken. Obviously, I must say again&#x2014;I do not think the hon. member did it himself&#x2014;that these figures were slanted by the person who compiled the information. The figure that the hon. member quoted for South Africa <span class="col_5001-5002" refersTo="page_0914"/>did not appear in that statistical yearbook. Indeed, the figure quoted in that volume was in respect of industrial disputes and it was 69. Then I compared the figures with the countries which appeared on the little list given to me by the hon. member and I found the following on consulting the yearbook of the International Labour Organization. The highest number of strikes&#x2014; I just want to quote three countries&#x2014;took place in Morocco, where there were 462 industrial disputes. In Zambia, which is halfway down the list, there were 68 strikes, and the country which had the lowest number of strikes was Upper Volta, where there were two strikes. In South Africa there were 69 strikes, so according to that Year Book we were not the second highest on the list, but somewhere in the middle of the list.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Z. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we must bear in mind the reasons why we have industrial disputes in South Africa. The first reason, which no hon. member on that side mentioned, is the fact that we have tribal fighting, which has nothing to do with politics or with colour. We often have this particular problem with people coming from neighbouring countries, not from South Africa itself. Sir, I would like to quote the following from what the hon. the Prime Minister said on 1 April, just to indicate that these industrial disputes are not caused by low earnings, because the earnings of our Black workers in South Africa are higher than the earnings of Black workers anywhere else in Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sover dit die industri&#x00EB;le lone betref, was die gemiddelde loon wat betaal is in 1973 in Egipte R15, Mauritius R17, Marokko R24, Sierre Leone R32, Ghana R45 en, volgens hulle eie bevindings, in Suid-Afrika R71.</block>

<p>The cause of strikes cannot therefore be low wages.</p>

<p>Sir, I had a quick look at the number of working days lost as a result of industrial disputes. Morocco heads the list with approximately 590 000 days. In the middle of the list we find Algeria with about 52 000 days lost. At the bottom of the list is Malawi with 940 days lost, and the number of days lost in South Africa is approximately 3 500. In other words, South Africa is very low indeed on the list. Sir, there is another factor to be looked at, and that is the number of workers involved in these disputes. Morocco heads the list with approximately 82 000 workers involved. Zambia is about halfway down the list, with about 15 000 workers involved. The lowest on the list is Malawi, with 1 500, and the figure in South Africa, where we have a Black labour force of approximately 8 million, is 4 400. Most important of all, however, is the number of working days lost per worker. In Morocco the number of days lost, per worker is seven, in Zambia one and a third day per worker, and in South Africa three-quarters of a day, which indicates that industrial disputes in South Africa are of a trivial, piffling nature. They no sooner start than they stop, which indicates that we have a most peaceful labour force in South Africa. Sir, I would suggest to the hon. member for Pinelands that he should be more charitable towards South Africa. As the hon. the Minister said, priestly goodness should also be displayed in this House. I would suggest, Sir, that the figures of the International Labour Organization are preferable to the figures supplied by the hon. member for Pinelands.</p>

<p>Sir, the accusation was made here that an Under Secretary of the department, Mr. Botha, had adopted a certain attitude with regard to Black trade unions. This statement of the hon. member for Pinelands was a far&#x002D;fetched one, as were the figures he quoted. He grasped at the first straw he could get hold of. He grasped at what could possibly discredit the Government&#x2014;whether it was untrue or whether it was incorrect reporting made no difference to him&#x2014;rather than calling a halt to consider and first read the following day&#x2019;s newspapers. The hon. member is a very clever member; he is a very learned and an eloquent member, and I believe that it is not purely by chance that he did not mention the fact either that Mr. Botha denied that he had said that which had been ascribed to him. Then I want to accept that those hon. members of the Opposition who understand Afrikaans and respect the idiom, will take note of what the hon. member for Rustenburg said. Sir, White South Africa is the natural home of White trade unions, and <span class="col_5003-5004" refersTo="page_0915"/>this is the country of the White labourer. According to our policy the Black man will receive a country of his own. Now I want to ask this question: Should one give the inhabitant of another country a say in the economic situation of one&#x2019;s own people here&#x003F; [Interjections.] For example, should the Italians who work in Germany, be allowed to establish Italian trade unions there while working in Germany&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have now had the greatest collapse in a labour debate I have witnessed since I first came to this House, i.e. since 1953. One asks oneself what the reason is for this collapse on the United Party side. Perhaps the reason lies in the fact that some of their ablest labour generals are no longer with them. This may be. But I think the main reason why we have witnessed this United Party collapse in this debate is the fact that they have no case to oppose to the labour policy of the National Government.

<p>Sir, if the hon. member quoted from a report of the department&#x2014;I do not know which one it is&#x2014;I assume that it is correct. While the hon. member is on the subject of strikes, I wonder whether he would not find the following interesting as well. It concerns the 435 strikes which the hon. member quoted with such glee and which allegedly make South Africa the country with the largest number of strikes. Does the hon. member know what the average duration of those 435 strikes was&#x003F; I have had it calculated. Their average duration was 12 hours and 36 minutes. So it is true what the hon. member for Pretoria West said, namely that the strikes we had were insignificant, a trifling matter. It is certainly not something which should be used by an hon. member of this House to blacken South Africa&#x2019;s image.</p>

<p>Sir, one asks oneself why a collapse of this kind took place. Now it strikes me, in looking at those four newcomers who are sitting over there at the back, that they did not come here because they had defeated a United Party opponent. All four members who are sitting over there came here without having been opposed by a United Party opponent. Just as the United Party collapsed in this debate, it collapsed in those workers&#x2019; constituencies as well. They do not even have a case any more to present to the public outside.</p>

<p>With that I come to the hon. member for Overvaal&#x2014;to whom, by the way, I want to convey my own congratulations on his maiden speech&#x2014;who represents a workers&#x2019; constituency where the United Party did not even have the courage to put up a candidate. I want to congratulate him on the subject he chose, namely productivity. I want to tell the hon. member that his speech was very neatly and very well formulated. I look forward to hearing his contributions to labour debates in the future, even though hon. members on this side receive so little stimulation from the disappearing United Party.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to three contributions which were made yesterday. In the first place I want to respond to the contribution made by the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark. The hon. member made a plea for, amongst other things, the border areas. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The policy of the Government is to promote industrial development in or near the Bantu homelands. This is because the standpoint of the Government, as administered by the Department <span class="col_5005-5006" refersTo="page_0916"/>of Labour, is that we place fewer restrictions on the labour of Black workers there than in metropolitan areas. Where there are restrictions in border areas, these are dealt with by way of exemptions. In fact, there are 45 industrial council agreements and 37 wage determinations at the moment which are applicable in the border areas. This underlines the fact that the border areas are not exempt from wage control. They are part of White South Africa, and because they are part of White South Africa, industrial council agreements and wage determinations must naturally apply to them as well. However, the important point is that in this case waged exemptions are continually being considered. They can apply for this to the industrial councils concerned, and if they do not fall under the industrial councils, they can apply to the Minister of Labour. In the latter case, the policy is always to be accommodating. I should like to take the opportunity of pointing out to industrialists in those areas that the fact that they are operating in border areas does not mean that they are automatically exempt from any of the wage measures. Some of them appear to be under the impression that if they go to a border area, they receive automatic exemption. This is not the case, and for this reason I want to ask the industrialists in those areas to follow the normal procedure in requesting exemptions. Such requests will always be approached with a view to accommodating them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan raised various aspects in connection with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund. His speech testified to a very thorough study of the subject, and I should like to reply to a few aspects which were raised by the hon. member. I think it may be of interest to our workers in general. The hon. member referred to the question of pain and suffering on the part of the worker and to the calculation of this in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. As hon. members know, the purpose of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Fund is to compensate the workman for the loss of his ability to work. It is the responsibility of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner to use his discretion in this regard. Criteria have been laid down in terms of which he uses his discretion, of course, but I must point out to the hon. member that pain and suffering can unfortunately not be measured, and for this reason pain and suffering cannot be one of the criteria in the awarding of benefits. The hon. member also referred to assault. It is true that under certain circumstances this is accepted, as has in fact been shown by various court rulings, provided, of course, that it did not come about through the workman&#x2019;s own fault. The hon. member also referred to the question of the transportation of workmen. It is true that this can be accepted under certain circumstances, for example where there is a contractual obligation on the employer to transport his workers. The hon. member also referred to the question of the negligence of an employer. It is true that when an accident has been caused by the negligence of an employer, a larger amount has to be paid in compensation.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member, as well as the hon. member for South Coast, referred to the question of asbestosis. The way it is calculated, the compensation, is not less favourable than the compensation paid in terms of the Occupational Disease Act. In fact, if one takes the capitalized value of a monthly pension under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, the pension on the basis of 100% permanent disablement, it may amount to as much as R40 000.</p>

<p>The question of apprentices was also raised. In their case it is true that when an apprentice is injured, compensation is calculated on the probable income of the apprentice on reaching the age of 26 years, or on expiry of a period of five years after the date of the accident, or on completion of his apprenticeship, whichever is the most favourable. I may just mention that the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner is at present considering certain amendments which may be introduced here. We shall probably submit these during the next session of Parliament.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast raised various aspects in connection with lead poisoning to which I too want to refer. He dealt with the question of lead poisoning as well as asbestosis. The chapter of the Factory Act in this regard was recently rewritten to promote the health of factory workers in this field. In the case of lead poisoning my department has already drawn up the regulations, but as hon. members will realize, this is a very comprehensive matter which requires wide research. Comment by interested parties is still being awaited in this regard. As far as asbestosis is concerned, I may just mention <span class="col_5007-5008" refersTo="page_0917"/>that the background study of pneumoconiosis, which includes asbestosis and silicosis, has now been completed. But this too is a very comprehensive task and the regulations to be drawn up in accordance with these findings involve a great deal of work. But my department is hard at work at this task. I trust that we shall be able to announce this in the near future. Perhaps I should just mention for general information in this regard that the commission of inquiry recently appointed by the State President into the nature, the occurrence and the proportions assumed by occupational diseases may be a very valuable investigation. It is an investigation which is being conducted by carefully picked experts. They will determine the extent to which statutory measures and existing facilities are being applied for the protection of workers. They will also see where these overlap and make recommendations in this regard, and they will see how the public may be effectively protected against any industrial activities which may prove to be unhealthy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland asked where we were going to find the people for the economic upsurge in South Africa. The Human Sciences Research Council has conducted a particularly thorough investigation into this matter. It concluded that the total labour force of all population groups between the ages of 15 and 74 years was estimated at 7&#x00BD; million units in 1970 and would increase to 10&#x00BD; million by 1980, and 17,8 million by the year 2 000. Now the question remains how we are going to train the people. There are a host of training schemes and I am not going to list them all here, except for mentioning two important facts in this regard. The first is the increase in the number of technical students at our colleges for advanced technical training, who have a key role to play, after all, in the manpower situation of the future. While we had 75 000 registered students at these colleges in 1969, this number had increased to 90 000 by 1973. If one adds to that the fact that the number of students, including those of Unisa, increased from 65 000 in 1968 to more than 95 000 in 1974, one arrives at a good answer to the question of what is being done in this country by this Government to provide for technically trained people for our development process in the future. In this connection one need only think of apprentices. In 1974 we had the magnificent total of 37 330 registered apprentices, which surely goes to show that in this field as well we are doing everything to tram apprentices. Another question which is continually being asked is what we are doing to utilize the Black workers of this country. In this regard as well the manpower survey which is being conducted by my department is of great significance. The latest manpower analysis shows that 1&#x00BD; million Black workers are being used in higher posts. I repeat, &#x201C;in higher posts&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Higher posts include semi-skilled operator posts, which are important supervisory posts, as well as clerical posts, which involve administrative work. The term does not include people from the labouring class. It only refers to high-graded posts. I referred yesterday to the latest proposals made by the engineering industry in regard to wage recommendations. These are in effect that Black workers who with the permission of the Industrial Council can work in their C and D classes are able to earn up to R60 a week. These are high-class Blacks who occupy those posts. So really significant steps are being taken in various fields to meet the demands made by the development of our country.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I think that this department is making a real contribution to the maintenance of labour peace and to the creation of an atmosphere of productivity. Furthermore the department is playing its part, as far as training is concerned, in preparing our people for the growing requirements of our country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the annual report of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, the Secretary for Information gives a summary of the present attitude towards South Africa in countries in which the Department of Information has offices. In several West European countries there are signs that greater propaganda attacks on South Africa are being planned and that the anti-South African <span class="col_5009-5010" refersTo="page_0918"/>movement is being intensified there. Fortunately, judging by the reports, a softening has taken place in most cases and the hostility is showing a downward tendency. We also understand from other sources that there has been an improvement in the attitude towards South Africa. Of course, this is welcomed by all of us. There are various reasons for this improvement, of which the most important is obviously that our publicity men abroad have now departed from the earlier custom of trying to defend the whole policy of the Government at all times. What is now being sold is change, and the image we are getting away from and must get away from is that of a negative policy. This confirms what we have said in debates on this Vote for many years, viz. that we cannot hope for an improvement of the attitude towards South Africa abroad before internal change has taken place and become observable to outsiders. According to the annual report, our information offices abroad have made the best possible use of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech in the Other Place last year and particularly of Mr. Pik Botha&#x2019;s U.N. Statement that we are doing away with discrimination Furthermore, wide publicity has been given to the fact that changes have taken place in the field of sport. In foreign publications, the department speaks of &#x201C;multi-racial sport&#x201D; which we are now practising and great emphasis is also laid on meetings between the hon. the Prime Minister and Black South African leaders. Therefore the emphasis now falls on internal change and almost immediately we are reaping the fruits of new interest overseas and a willingness among news media and opinion formers, to be less venomous and to give us a chance.</p>

<p>In the light of these new developments, there are a few thoughts which I want to express in the few minutes at my disposal. The first is that our position is still delicate in spite of improvements. Incidents at home can destroy in a moment the good work which is done abroad. Recently we had a practical example of this again. The department placed a series of expensive advertisements in the British, American and West German Press. In passing, I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what it cost to place one such advertisement in the London <i>Times.</i> The one advertisement which appeared in London on 4 March had as its heading, &#x201C;Could the next Olympics be in Pretoria, South Africa&#x003F;&#x201D; The advertisement was accompanied by a large photograph of a mixed sports meeting and the advertisement spoke of &#x201C;our Black and White merit teams&#x201D;, and of competition &#x201C;regardless of race, colour or creed&#x201D;. It certainly was an impressive advertisement. It so happened that a sports incident took place almost at the same time in Johannesburg. A traffic constable forced a Black marathon runner from the road in an unceremonious way because he was running together with Whites. The result was that the London <i>Times</i> wrote on 5 March&#x2014;and I quote from a newsletter of the South African Foundation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Could the next Olympics be in Pretoria&#x003F;&#x201D;, asked a South African Embassy advertisement on page 3 of the <i>Times</i> yesterday. The answer appeared on page 7 in our correspondent&#x2019;s report from Johannesburg headlined: &#x201C;Policeman stops African in Whites only marathon.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Here we see a good attempt abroad being thwarted by an incident at home. The department spends an amount of almost R3&#x00BD; million annually on the distribution of information within the Republic. It seems to me that in the future much more of this money should be spent on cultivating a new attitude among our own people in respect of human relations. In other words, the message of change must be sold with much greater enthusiasm at home if we want lasting success abroad. The hon. the Minister himself holds a key position in this respect in the work which has to be done. However, I regret to say that he often creates a far more intolerant image of himself at home than he does abroad. Unfortunately this filters through to foreign countries. I do not have time to mention a series of examples, but the department states in its annual report that it is making more vigorous attempts &#x201C;to establish sounder relationships between the White group and the Coloured group&#x201D;. Those attempts should be encouraged. Unfortunately the hon. the Minister lets no opportunity slip to give the Coloureds an unasked for slap in the face and to tell them that he will refuse to recognize the Coloureds as Brown Afrikaners. Why so negative&#x003F; I am sure that no Coloured person has ever asked the hon. the Minister to recognize him as a Brown Afrikaner. As far as I know, the Coloureds want to be known as South Africans or as Afrikaans-speaking South Africans, if they are Afrikaans speaking. The aggressiveness and the &#x201C;anti&#x201D; attitude of the <span class="col_5011-5012" refersTo="page_0919"/>Minister about a completely unasked-for matter only create bad feelings which do not accord with the work his department is trying to do.</p>

<p>As I have said, this sort of attitude filters through to foreign countries and nothing can be more damaging for an important department such as the Department of information than for the man at its head to acquire the image of someone who displays a different attitude abroad from that which he displays in South Africa itself.</p>

<p>One of the most important sources of positive publicity abroad is the political development around the Bantu homelands. We have no objection to its being advertised whenever political participation is extended in South Africa, under whatever policy. But I notice that a new note has crept into the publicity which is given to the Bantu homelands by the department and the hon. the Minister, and it makes anything but a good impression. It is alleged that the old British imperialism is actually to blame for the fact that the Government cannot solve some of our problems properly. I have here a copy of an interview which the hon. the Minister had with Paul Giniewski. This interview was published in the 1973 autumn edition of <i>Plural Societies,</i> which is published in Den Haag The heading is: &#x201C;C. P. Mulder, South Africa&#x2019;s &#x2018;next&#x2019; Prime Minister, interviewed.&#x201D; That heading is not the fault of the hon. the Minister and I do not hold him responsible for it. But the hon. the Minister told the reporter that the Government would not be prepared to go further that the Act of 1936 in respect of the addition of land to the homelands. Then Giniewski asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Don&#x2019;t you think that in this case the territories of some of the Bantu homelands make them non-viable&#x003F; Let us consider the matter of KwaZulu. It is a patchwork. Is your Government&#x2019;s position not a stumbling block in the way towards independence&#x003F;</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister replied to that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have to be practical. In KwaZulu we have inherited a very difficult problem. The British colonial system ruled Natal, where KwaZulu is situated, for many years. The British did not want to put the Blacks together in one unit, because they were afraid of &#x201C;Black power&#x201D; even at this stage. So they placed the Blacks in little bunches here and there according to a &#x201C;chequerboard pattern&#x201D;. In the course of time vested interests have developed in these areas: Black interests, and next to them, White interests. Now to wipe out these interests, to consolidate KwaZulu into one unit, would be the idea. But it would cost millions to reshift thousands and thousands of people: Bantu and Whites. Politics is the science, or the art of the possible. Therefore we are consolidating KwaZulu into a smaller number of units &#x2026; But one single unit: this ideal is practically not attainable.</block>

<p>Putting all the responsibility for the Government&#x2019;s policy problems on the British colonial policy of those days, which is at best a half-truth, is very unconvincing. The important point is that the impression which the hon. the Minister has created is that he does not have the answer, while he is head of the department. He creates the impression of selling a policy in respect of which he has to admit himself that it is impractical in its final stage. The more the department sells the idea of sovereign independent states abroad, the more it will be confronted with the question of how an area such as KwaZulu, which will consist of ten fragments or &#x201C;little bunches&#x201D;, as the hon. the Minister calls them, can be expected to become a politically viable independent State, even after the 1936 Act has been implemented.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout must excuse my not wishing to join the swine rooting in the mud. I want to discuss this department in general on a high plane. In the first instance I want to refer to the annual report we have before us, the report for the calendar year 1974. In my opinion this is a model annual report. It is outstanding in all respects, outstanding in the information it contains and outstanding in that it actually gives us more than sufficient information. In this regard I should like to refer to page 7, where the Secretary states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department believes it should greatly curtail its public reporting by way of this annual report.</block>

<p>I should like to agree that this report should perhaps be curtailed because we know that this department and its officials, from the Secretary to the most junior official, at home as well as abroad, do not <span class="col_5013-5014" refersTo="page_0920"/>begrudge a single day or a single evening or a single hour in devoting their time and their efforts to serving the interests of this department and of South Africa. The fine results of this, which can be seen throughout South Africa and overseas, too, and which are beneficial to South Africa&#x2014;the hon. member also referred to this&#x2014;are ascribable to the zeal and perseverance displayed by the hon. the Minister and his department. I think we should do well to take cognizance of this. Consequently we could perhaps eliminate a little of the information and concentrate more on the fruits of this department with its officials.</p>

<p>It is the task of the Department of Information to disseminate information at home as well as abroad, at home in regard to the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu and to inform them about South Africa, the policy of the Government and so on. We are short of well-trained staff to disseminate this information. I just want to mention that it takes at least nine months to train such staff before they can be sent abroad or put in charge of an office. I just want to refer to what is stated on pages 77 and 78 of this report. We note that some of the senior officials of the department arrange background seminars in order to train our officials in many fields. I should like to refer to a few of these. There are, <i>inter alia,</i> the following: Various aspects of Government policy; the policies of the United Party and the Progressive Party; the political parties in the CRC; Political parties in the Bantu homelands; Socialism and Communism, neutrality, neutralism and non-alignment; the peace efforts of the United Nations; the pattern of South Africa&#x2019;s foreign trade; pressure groups in South African society, etc. The standard of the training these people are given speaks volumes. In the past 14 days we have been making the acquaintance of this department. We know how thoroughly and well these people are trained. I want to convey my sincere thanks to the hon. the minister for this sound training. We know that seven of the persons who were trained last year successfully completed the language course in French offered by the Language Service Bureau of the Department of National Education. This means that when these people go abroad, they will be able to speak not only English and Afrikaans, but French as well. Even their wives are trained, because the wives stand by the men in our foreign service.</p>

<p>We are very pleased about this sound training.</p>

<p>However, we want to go further in regard to training. One of these days our homelands will become independent and, as the hon. the Minister made known last year, non-Whites are going to be trained for the foreign service. I think we shall have to give more attention to training non-Whites for service in the Bantu homelands, in their own information service, when these homelands become independent. The Transkei and the Ciskei have already requested that certain of their people be trained so that they may have their own information service later on. I should like to ask whether the hon. the Minister would tell us what progress has been made in this regard. For example, I think that some of our White officials should be seconded to those Government departments for a certain period. Some of the Black information officers who are employed abroad could also be used to train people from the homelands. While we are training non-Whites for the information service here, we could train people from the homelands, too, at the same time. Sir, this would be of immense value to these homelands in the future.</p>

<p>In passing, Sir, I just want to drag in one more matter and refer to the guests we receive here from overseas. Other hon. members on this side will discuss our guest programme this afternoon and tomorrow, but I just want to mention here that last year we brought 664 official guests here from abroad. Those guests were received and looked after by the department. Do you realize, Sir, the tremendous influence those guests from abroad could have on domestic opinion and, on the other hand, when they return to their countries, what a tremendous influence they could exert on foreign opinion concerning South Africa&#x003F; I should like to see us possibly bringing these guests from abroad into contact with our policy-makers and opinion-formers in this country to a greater extent in the future, because these visitors from abroad always have a very good word for South Africa when they return to their own countries.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to make special mention today of the dissemination of information in the interior. In the Budget debate this year I referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to inflation and to everything that could be done to check inflation. I called for an effective information <span class="col_5015-5016" refersTo="page_0921"/>programme and I said the following (Hansard, 7 April 1975, column 3634)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Within this programme of action there must, firstly, be a purposeful programme of information for the consumers, a programme of information which, just like inflation, will be continuous. The consumer must be informed at all times about the dangers of inflation. I feel that we speak about inflation far too lightly. We must inform the people far more forcefully about the dangers of inflation. The dangers to every adherent of capitalistic norms that are inherent in inflation, for example, the freedom of consumption, of saving, investing, possession and training, are not always recognized by the man in the street.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I now want to refer specially to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council which, according to a report in yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Burger</i> entitled &#x201C;National Campaign against inflation&#x201D;, requested that a thoroughgoing information programme bee instituted. I quote from <i>Die Burger</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a report entitled &#x201C;Collective programme of action to reduce inflation in South Africa&#x201D;, the Advisory Council recommends that the Government institute a penetrating positive anti-inflationary campaign of education.</block>

<p>Sir, in my opinion it is in the interests of all of us in South Africa, whether a Nationalist or a United Party supporter, whether White or non-White, that we should lend our full support to this effort on the part of the Economic Advisory Council to launch an information campaign of this kind in all spheres throughout South Africa, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he could use his Department of Information to assist the Economic Advisory Council in propagating this idea, and even whether he could make use, next year, of television as well, in order to publicize these matters. Sir, this would be in the interests of the country in general. Now, I do not want to discuss the colour politics which the Opposition harps on every day; I am discussing bread-and-butter matters that affect every man and woman in South Africa and throughout the world.</p>

<p>Sir, let us train our people to contribute towards ensuring that everyone in this country will have enough to eat, that everyone will be economically strong; and that everyone will have employment opportunities. I do not think anyone will take it amiss of me when I ask that this department go out of its way to disseminate information in that regard. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when I spoke earlier, I pointed out that the Bantu homelands are an important positive factor in the department&#x2019;s publicity programme, but that it will increasingly be faced outside with the question of how an area which consists of ten fragments of land can become a viable independent state. My impression, having looked at the department&#x2019;s publicity and also at the sort of answers which the hon. the Minister gives outside, is that he and the department are not prepared for giving answers to this sort of question, and I think that attention should be given to this. Paul Giniewski asked the hon. the Minister another question, which is also the sort of question one is always being asked, and that was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If one or several homelands become independant, will not political danger arise of one of these becoming a foothold for foreign penetration &#x2026;&#x003F;</block>

<p>To this the hon. the Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let&#x2019;s now adopt a pessimistic view, the worst we could envisage. Suppose the Bantu homelands really intend to become subservient to a foreign influence dangerous to the future of South Africa. Then it would amount making a choice, let us say between a black bull, who would like to kill you but who is on the other side of the fence, and a black snake in your bosom who could strike at any moment. I would certainly choose the black bull. Because of the fence. That is, politically speaking, what we are doing &#x2026; But I am optimistic. As I said, we know our Bantu people for 300 years.</block>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Minister that accents of this kind do not seem to me to be advantageous to our image outside, and I think that the hon. the Minister and his department will have to find&#x2014;a better way of presenting to the outside world the question of the homelands, which, as I have <span class="col_5017-5018" refersTo="page_0922"/>said, can be the one positive aspect of the Government&#x2019;s image outside, if it is handled correctly. Now, in his interview with Mr. Giniewski the hon. the Minister adopted a strong attitude about Africa. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not claim any ties with Western Europe any more. We are not West Europeans. We are Africans. Our whole future is bound to the continent of Africa &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, that is a good sentiment. Then he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and if Africans can come to grips with the real problems of Africa: poverty, better education, better health facilities, better administration, the continent could indeed form a stronger unit as such if we reach this stage. Then we would forget the small quarrels about whether our skin is black or white. Then the continent could really play its part in the interest of all its inhabitants, and cease to be looked at as a third-rate place. That is the reason we believe in dialogue &#x2026;</block>

<p>Where the hon. the Minister speaks about Africa, we support his sentiments. He likes to speak about the way our fate is tied to Africa and the fact that we are all Africans. But what I still really miss in the activities of the Department of Information is a real Africa factor. Sir, the department has a desk for African countries and the East. It invited 164 official guests to South Africa last year at a cost of about R&#x00BD; million. They came from South America, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Western Europe, the U.S.A., Canada and one from Japan, but there was not a single African, not a single visitor from our neighbouring states or from those few Black countries with whom we have relations or who are prepared to co-operate with us. I believe that Africa should become our priority. We shall have to forge cultural links with Africa if real understanding is to develop between us and the rest of Africa. I think this should receive the attention of the hon. the Minister, and especially of the Department of Information which, when one comes to think of it, is really our permanent &#x201C;department for d&#x00E9;tente&#x201D; in South Africa. Now, last year the hon. the Minister held out the prospect of suitable Black and Brown candidates being trained for service in the department both at home and abroad. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister how much progress has been made in this direction and what the programme is which the Minister has in mind in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s annual report also mentions that there is likely to be increase in psychological warfare on the international scene. That is a correct appraisal, and in this connection I should to ask the hon. the Minister two questions. The first is: We have a permanent office at the U.N., and I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether he intends to keep this office, our foothold at the U.N.; or is the Department of Information is also reappraising our relations with the U.N. and our position in the world body&#x003F; Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister what co-ordination there is, here and abroad, between the Department of Foreign Affairs and his Department. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I personally&#x2014;and there are others who have had the same experience&#x2014;have gained the impression in certain places abroad that the Department of Information uses a different approach in its activities and publicity from that of our foreign missions, which carry the chief responsibility for policy and action abroad. It is obvious that I am not going to mention names, nor do I intend to mention places. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether care is taken to see that there is proper co-ordination between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the work which the Department of Information does abroad. I think that the hon. the Minister will concede that it is extremely necessary that there be uniform action and that the guidance in this connection should in fact come from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The hon. Minister knows, too, that there is an impression at home that there is competition between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Information, and that the Department of Information is promoting personalities. Government newspapers have contributed more to the creation of this impression than anything else. I should like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comment on this impression which there is.</p>

<p>I see in the annual report that the department is helping the homelands to establish their own departments of information, especially those who ask for them and qualify. I should be glad if the hon. the Minister could give us more particulars about what is being planned and what <span class="col_5019-5020" refersTo="page_0923"/>will eventually be the role of his department when each of the homelands has its own department of information and what the extent of their activities will be. I also read in this report that the department had a project in Zululand where they motivated the Zulus to register as citizens of Kwa-Zulu The report mentions that the opportunity was also used &#x201C;to promote a feeling of national identity and pride&#x201D; among the Zulus. This amazes me, and I must honestly say that it sounds to me like the height of arrogance for a White department to and pride among the Zulus. Does the Zulu promote a feeling of national identity not have an identity&#x003F; Is this something which has to be created artificially&#x003F; Does he not have national pride&#x003F; I repeat that it is arrogant, and that it is a pity that something like this should appear in a report of this sort. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will know what it means; I must honestly say that I do not know what it means. [Interjections.] Yes, paternalism, but to me it sounds like arrogance.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a statement to the effect that the attitude towards South Africa abroad will not change before we bring about certain changes at home. But is the hon. member not aware that the hostile attitude of the outside world towards South Africa is an attitude that has developed in the course of many years owing to a total lack of knowledge, and that the situation has been exploited by reckless and unscrupulous writers and journalists with only one aim, viz. to make money out of this deficiency or short-circuit&#x2014;call it what you will&#x2014;that existed with regard to knowledge, information and experience pertaining to South Africa. This situation developed at a stage in our history when there was a world famine of knowledge and information concerning strange and mysterious continents such as <i>inter alia,</i> Africa, including South Africa. These authors very soon found that the more sensational the story, the better it sold, and the better it paid them. That is why the world has been bombarded and indoctrinated with misrepresentations which later developed into hostility towards South Africa &#x2014;that is already history. How else does one explain the fact that much of the world refuses, in the fact of the facts, to believe that South Africa is developing and uplifting its Black peoples to a level never before known in Africa&#x003F; The <i>per capita</i> income of our Black people is one of the highest in Africa. Their rate of mortality is among the lowest and this may be ascribed to sufficient food and good medical services. Percentagewise, too, they are far more literate than their so-called brothers in Africa. It is safer for the law-abiding Black man to live in South Africa than in many Black states. <i>Per capita</i> of the population they also possess more cars, live in better houses and in addition, enjoy better welfare services than Black people elsewhere in Arica. Those are the facts. It is these facts that have forced a man like Chief Minister Matanzima to say that the awakening of his people as a nation is owing to this Government. I have quoted his words before. But writers overseas do not state these facts because it does not suit them to do so. The world, whose attitude is one of bitterness and hostility, owing to having been shaped for so many years by what has been written about South Africa, still seeks sensation and evidence of so-called atrocities and oppression. There are still many people who make money out of this, as witness, <i>inter alia,</i> the film <i>Last Grave at Dimbaza.</i></p>

<p>In consequence of this situation, the Department of Information is faced with the extremely difficult task of breaking down these barriers of hostility towards South Africa that have been built up so thoroughly over the years, and to confront the world with the true facts. South Africa is one of the few countries in the world in which the Black peoples are being guided along the path of development towards sovereign independence without their having to fire a single shot. This is a political achievement unequalled in modern history. It is unique in modern history. If, therefore, one considers South Africa and its people, White and Black, and the facts concerning them, one would think that our Department of Information ought in fact to have a spectacular and easy task. However, we are not living in normal times, and therefore this department and its Minister have an extremely difficult task. It is the task of this department to afford perspective to the view of South Africa held by the outside world and to ensure that there is a stream of knowledge, information and facts to the outside world; that this stream be normalized and the facts made accessible. This is a difficult task. All the money-makers in the yellow press and all the anti-organizations whose members are professional demonstrators who have never known a day&#x2019;s good and honest work, see to that. Then, <span class="col_5021-5022" refersTo="page_0924"/>too, there are many other political groups, organizations and individuals whom it would not suit for South Africa to reflect a favourable image abroad.</p>

<p>There is one factor that we must not lose sight of, viz. that the enemies of South Africa do not want the peace efforts initiated by our hon. Prime Minister and President Kaunda in Southern Africa to succeed. They want the struggle to be perpetuated and even to be stepped up. Once again it is the task of the department to break down these barriers. These agitators believe that they will not be affected, whatever form the struggle may take now or in the future. That is why they are engaged in this agitation.</p>

<p>It is also the difficult task of this department to arouse an absolute repugnance among influential and prominent people overseas and in Africa, against sanctions, boycotts and terrorism calculated to destroy peace in Africa. If there is one thing we must guard against, it is an ideological conflict between White and Black in Africa, and this is being instigated by many bodies and persons throughout the world.</p>

<p>South Africa follows certain principles as far as its relations policy is concerned. It is our sincere belief that were Africa to consider these in an atmosphere of d&#x00E9;tente, it would find in them elements that would not only be acceptable to it, but which could also serve as an example to it. The issue on which the so-called struggle against South Africa is based, viz. the reasonable upliftment of and provision for our Black peoples, has for a long time no longer been applicable. At this stage, South Africa&#x2019;s Black people are better provided for than the people of the enemies and critics of South Africa. It is not I who say so, but I quote from the <i>Volksblad</i> of 15 December 1974 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Other countries can criticise and find fault with South Africa and its policy, but time will undoubtedly prove that South Africa has done more for its people than some of its most outspoken critics, Chief George Matanzima, Transkeian Minister of Justice, said yesterday at Baviaanspoort near Pretoria.</block>

<block name="quote">He was speaking at a passing out parade of apprentice Bantu warders at the training college of the Prison Service and said that it was notable that a small country like the Republic had undertaken a task of such magnitude in these times &#x2014;the task of emancipating various territories or homelands simultaneously.</block>

<p>Nowhere in the world and at no time in the past has one country seen its way clear to setting itself such a challenge.</p>

<p>For this reason I can rightly say that this is a political achievement unequalled in the world and unique in our time.</p>

<p>This statement by Chief Matanzima is proof that the hostility of the outside world towards South Africa is based on absolute ignorance and the lack of a desire to learn about South Africa. Abroad there is no need to become acquainted with the true facts about South Africa. Our Department of Information must cultivate that need among all prominent people and opinion-formers overseas.</p>

<p>The issue is, therefore, not simply a change in South Africa&#x2019;s domestic policy and its domestic situations, as is stated by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. We therefore wish the hon. the Minister and his department all success in this tremendous task they have to perform for South Africa and its people. The success of this department will be South Africa&#x2019;s success too, and South Africa&#x2019;s success will mean peace, progress and development for the whole of Africa and all its people.</p>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the previous speech he made&#x2014;if I am not mistaken he only spoke for eight minutes; he had two minutes left&#x2014;the hon. member for Bezuidenhout dealt a backhanded blow to the officials of the Department of Information. He said that it was the aim of officials of the department to boost certain personalities. We know that the hon. member was hinting at the position of the Minister. The hon. member still had some time remaining. Why did he not come to this House with evidence so that we could argue the matter&#x003F; It is disgraceful to make an unsubstantiated charge of this kind against the officials of the Department of Information. It is rejected <i>in toto</i> by this side of the House</p>

<p>I should like to discuss the guest programme of the Department of the Information. This programme is not only a very important, but also a very effective function of the Department of Information. We know that its aim is to bring influential people to South Africa, because it is a fact that there are ways in which South Africa can promote its good image apart <span class="col_5023-5024" refersTo="page_0925"/>from writing about South Africa abroad and showing films. In fact, the best advertisement for South Africa is South Africa itself, a beautiful country with a great deal to show and a great deal to offer. An-itinerary for Mr. Don Goodenow, managing editor of the <i>Herald Examiner</i> in Los Angeles, is published in the report of the Department of Information. Mr. Goodenow visited South Africa on the invitation of the Department of Information. I want to point out a certain aspect of the programme as published here, viz. that a person coming to South Africa has ample opportunity to become acquainted with all opinions and the policy of all political parties in South Africa. When we consider persons who are politicians or who occupy positions or hold office in political parties, and if we include the daily newspapers of the Republic of South Africa, then we may consider which political personalities were visited by this person according to the published itinerary. In the first place he had an interview with Prof. S. A. Strauss, the national chairman of the Democratic Party. Subsequently he had an interview with a member of the editorial staff of <i>The Star.</i> He then had an interview with the editor of <i>The World.</i> His next interview was with Mr. B. Rudden of <i>The Daily News.</i> He then had an interview with the United Party member of Parliament for Green Point, Mr. L. G. Murray. Subsequently he had an interview with the hon. member for Sea Point, and another with Mr. J. R. Coleman, the senior assistant editor of <i>The Argus.</i> In all, therefore, he had interviews with seven persons who could state the opposition political point of view. On the other hand, the same person had an interview with Senator Denis Worrall and Mr. J. J. J. Scholtz, the assistant editor of <i>Die Burger.</i> On the National Party side this person interviewed two persons only. In addition, he had interviews with three Coloured leaders of South Africa. It is important for us to know that the persons who come to South Africa are given a true image of the Opposition point of view in South Africa when they meet politicians. It is probably for that reason that this person, Mr. Goodenow, wrote as follows to the Secretary for Information&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I was able to obtain all the information necessary to help me formulate my objective opinion of the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>In my opinion we should extend out sincere congratulations to the hon. the Minister and his department on this objective programme. I think it deserves the support of everyone. South Africa is an important industrial country and there is no doubt that we must bring this to the attention of people from abroad. We can show the people from abroad other things, too. We can also show them&#x2014;and we do, too &#x2014;that we in South Africa have good race relations and that we have succeeded to a large extent in eliminating poverty. We have the privilege of showing people from abroad in South Africa that people of various colours and races are able to coexist peacefully here. In this regard it is important that a Negro professor from America who visited South Africa, a certain Prof. Braithwaite, said that he was amazed, when he visited South Africa, to find no hate between White and non-White in South Africa, and that the policy of the South African Government was designed to eliminate these very situations of conflict that could possibly give rise to a negative situation of this nature. Consequently it is also good to know that so many people have come to South Africa to come and see for themselves the situation we have in South Africa. There were 164 official guests in South Africa during the past year and 284 &#x201C;domestic&#x201D; guests, viz. persons from abroad who came to South Africa and were given some assistance by the Department of Information. Then, too, there were 664 visitors from abroad, giving us a total of 1 112 visitors from abroad received in South Africa. It is very important that we should take note of the various countries from which the visitors to South Africa came. These people came from both the East and the West. There have been people from Japan, New Zealand and Australia and a number of people from the U.S.A., as well as people from the Argentine and many from Europe. This is in respect of the 164 guests who visited South Africa officially. Of course, we do not know where the 284 foreigners&#x2014;they are called &#x201C;domestic guests&#x201D; in the report for a specific reason&#x2014;and the 664 foreign visitors came from, nor do we know how many of them came from Africa. In these times, when we want to coexist with Africa in a spirit of d&#x00E9;tente, in these times when we have so much to show and when we know that much of the prejudice against South Africa on the part of Africa can be eliminated, in my opinion the department and <span class="col_5025-5026" refersTo="page_0926"/>the hon. the Minister can&#x2014;and I am sure they will&#x2014;consider inviting official guests from Africa to South Africa from time to time on a very selective basis. In this regard I think the hon. the Minister will invite specifically anti-communist people, because it is only with such people that we can converse. In the second place we can only invite to South Africa people who are by nature unprejudiced. We shall only be wasting money if we invite prejudiced people or enemies of South Africa here. I should be obliged if the hon. the Minister would give attention to this matter, too, in these times of progress, development and d&#x00E9;tente.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on these benches naturally have appreciation for a great deal of the work done by the Department of Information. There is some of us who have personal experience of what is being done locally to give overseas visitors a better understanding of our country. Many of us have personal contact with members of the staff of the department and we have high regard for them. It hardly needs saying, but we do, of course, support the endeavours made by the department to create a genuine and more honest image of this country abroad. We are glad about the degree of success which the Department of Information has achieved in this regard, but it would be very sad if I were to do nothing this afternoon but to join in the singing of these praises. The hon. the Minister would be very disappointed if I were to neglect my duty and not take a critical look at this department. I want to take a very critical look at it, because I feel rather strongly about this. My objection to the department is, put simply, that too many or many of its efforts miscarry as a result of its acting as an agent of the National Party.</p>

<p>My argument is simply that this misconceived and misdirected brief, for that is what it in fact is, has produced a tendentiousness and a bias and, above all&#x2014;this is the most serious of all&#x2014;a credibility gap which not only spoils much of the department&#x2019;s work, but which in fact negates it in the eyes of people who know. The extent to which the department internally regards itself&#x2014;consciously or otherwise; this is difficult to determine&#x2014;as an agency or arm of the party in power, is a matter about which the taxpayer necessarily has reason to feel quite bitter and quite strongly. I am afraid the department is doing exactly what the National Party does: It equates party with State.</p>

<p>I referred last year to the magnificent publication <i>South Africa 1974</i> which purports to be an authoritative and objective work of reference. In the latest report of the Department of Information to which various hon. members have referred, we are told that this book has been welcomed &#x201C;in all quarters as fulfilling an urgent need to provide an authoritative and comprehensive book of information&#x201D;. I wish this were true, but I am sorry to say that a second and a third look at this book confirms my original impression that in one field of opinion and comment this book is undisguised Nationalist Party propaganda. Whether we like it or not, this is a simple fact. I do not think the hon. member for Waterberg or the hon. member for Sunny-side will disagree with a single word that appears in many parts of this publication, and that is saying a great deal.</p>

<p>Just read the book; I do not have the time to go into that now. Even in the non-controversial sections this book is inept. Just listen to this. In the section dealing with sports policy we are solemnly told&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For centuries today they (the Bantu people) found their recreation in traditional activities such as hunting, tribal dances, even faction fights.</block>

<p><span class="col_5027-5028" refersTo="page_0927"/>That is really going to endear us to the Black people of Africa! [Interjections.] Here and elsewhere we want to tell them that part of their recreation was a little bit of faction fighting! In the name of sanity, Sir, what can we do&#x003F; I can only hope that somebody is going to have a good look at this book. Who gives the Department of Information the right to say of foreign critics&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; nor will domestic changes serve to placate them&#x003F;</block>

<p>That appears in this annual report to which another hon. member has referred. This is what Nationalist Party spokesmen are telling us day and night; this is what they purport to believe. However, the Government is constantly making changes in its domestic policy. Why is it making domestic changes&#x003F; Why is it doing this in the case of sport&#x003F; Partly, at least, to placate foreign thinking. Why otherwise would these changes be made&#x003F; Why must the Department of Information tell us that changes won&#x2019;t placate these people&#x003F; At best I would say that this question of making domestic changes is essentially a political dispute from which the Department of Information should divorce itself entirely. The Nationalist Party&#x2019;s own propaganda machine can do this type of thing. I suggest that the department would perhaps make a few more friends and influence a few more people if it could resist some of this snideness and provocation. Why parade its hatred of the BBC by sarcasm about&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that bastion of fairness&#x003F;</block>

<p>I say this particularly in the light of the success of the department in persuading the BBC to give it time to refute the <i>Last Grave at Dimbaza.</i> What is achieved by this kind of thing&#x003F; It is a strange kind of judgment which expects justice in regard to remarks of this nature. Also, why cannot we accept the fact that at least some of the criticism in the outside world from church quarters is not always leftist of communist-inspired&#x003F; What is achieved by this&#x003F; What do we get out of it&#x003F; It is an exercise in self-justification and very little more. One can go on in this way almost indefinitely. There is so much of it that one cannot get through it. However, listen to this. In the section on West Germany&#x2014;this is really na&#x00EF;ve&#x2014;the department states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Through the aid of left-orientated individuals fugitives and deported persons, particularly clergymen &#x2026;</block>

<p>We know that the Government has an absolute thing about clergymen from abroad and that the divines locally are not really tolerated, but to go around telling the world that we deport parsons all over the place in droves! Surely we can do a little bit better than that&#x003F; Perhaps the hon. the Minister of Information might have a word with the hon. the Minister of the Interior and deport fewer of these pulpitless parsons.</p>

<p>In the minute that is left to me I just want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will please tell us a little more about the internal information division of his department. The report speaks about promoting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; good relations between the internal groups by providing information to all groups.</block>

<p>It has also gone into the field of labour relations. I see that at Kroonstad its office instituted a full inquiry into the causes of labour unrest. This seems to me to be an unusual field for the Department of Information&#x2014;going into what the report calls the relevant ethnic disputes. I do not know whether it has the expertise to do this; it may be desirable: I do not know. However, in this context, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can tell us a little more in regard to the progress that his department has made in making use of the services of people of colour, both at home and abroad. We believe that there are some of these people being trained, but we have not heard much more about it. And as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said, why not bring a few Black visitors to this country&#x003F; The department is spending R2&#x00BD; million more this year than last year and its budget is now in excess of R10 million. This is a great deal of money by any standards. However, nobody would begrudge it if we were satisfied that it was being spent in the broad national interest. I should just like to say that I am convinced that the department would be more successful&#x2014;this is the point I made at the beginning&#x2014;if it would only stop behaving like an arm of the Nationalist Party and <span class="col_5029-5030" refersTo="page_0928"/>would try very much harder to speak for South Africa as a whole.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Parktown, who has just resumed his seat, cannot help being negative&#x2014;subversive in the spirit of his party and his fellow-leftists. The hon. member contributed nothing that was positive here. All he said here this afternoon was food for the enemies of South Africa outside our borders. I should like to make my own speech and consequently I am not going to follow up any further on what the hon. member said.</p>

<p>Our information task is a giant task; it is an enormous task, it is a mighty task. Our information officers abroad comprise a small group of 66 who, in comparison with the 6 800 information officers of a country like America, are a drop in the ocean. These people of ours fight in the front line for South Africa against fanatical militant groups, against hotbeds of leftist liberalism, against mass communication media and against Red onslaughts. They have to cope with a flood of anti-South African propaganda, with a campaign of suspicion-mongering, of misrepresentation and of condemnation. This small group, these 66 men of ours abroad, stand alone against forces of subversion and political terrorism; against double standards and against the lie. They stand like a David of old against the Goliath in their fight for South Africa. Under the guidance of a dynamic Minister and a wide-awake secretary, they are doing outstanding work for South Africa even though there are few of them. They are achieving great success. However, they are still receiving hopelessly too little support from bodies and people in this country. The time has come for South Africa&#x2019;s information task to become a more co-ordinated action, a people&#x2019;s action, a national effort, a demonstration of patriotism and loyalty in order to intercede on behalf of our country and defend its good name. It is really time for us as South Africans, all of us, from all strata of our population, to shake off our lethargy and come to realize fully what &#x00E0; great and important task lies ahead of South Africa in regard to information. Sir, it is no longer possible for any country to live in isolation today. We must pull down the barriers erected against us and we must cast our bread upon the waters. Our task of information must become the task of all our leaders in this country&#x2014;White, Brown and Black. It must become the task of our business men and our industrialists, of our great and strong Press, of our sportsmen, of the close to 700 000 South Africans who tour abroad annually, but what is still more important, Sir, is that the more than 600 000 people who come and tour South Africa annually should be treated in such a way in this country that when they return to their own countries, they will communicate a favourable image of South Africa. Sir, even the boy and girl with a penfriend overseas can have a share in this regard. Each one can be an ambassador for South Africa. We have a tremendous potential. All that is needed is motivation on the part of these people, and now is the time for us to tackle this task with all our might, since a brandnew evaluation of South Africa is in progress. South Africa&#x2019;s extended hand of peace and goodwill has impressed countries and leaders and has created a new climate of goodwill, towards South Africa as well. Ears and hearts have become resceptive to South Africa; everyone that returns from abroad says this. Sir, we want to pay tribute to the hon. the Prime Minister, who has done more than anyone else to open doors to the outside world for us. Our positive message has spread across borders like wildfire and has found favour in the eyes of nations. The Department of Information has persisted in a forceful manner in carrying this message far and wide, and now is the time for influential people in our country, people of all parties, to make a strongly patriotic voice heard to people in the outside world. While saying this, Sir, in the same breath I also want to request certain non-White leaders in this country to moderate their language when speaking in world forums, and not to call in outside arbiters to come and act as judge in regard to what we are doing here in South Africa. We appreciate the actions of some of them. Sir, there is nothing that does one&#x2019;s country so much harm as when one&#x2019;s own people say things that harm one&#x2019;s country. The least we ask of these people, Sir, is loyalty towards South Africa. The Black and Brown leaders of South Africa can play a major role in our peace efforts because there are influential people in Southern Africa who listen to what they say. Sir, our non-White leaders must remember that they are just as little able to escape an armed conflict in Southern Africa as is the White man here.</p>

<p><span class="col_5031-5032" refersTo="page_0929"/>Sir, I now want to address myself to the Opposition in this House. I want to ask the United Party and its political splinters as they are sitting here today, not to say things, in the course of their wild attempts to outbid each other, that will harm South Africa, because our enemies seize on these things. The hon. member for Durban Point, who is unfortunately not present this afternoon, flamed up at me in pious indignation when I made an appeal for loyalty here, but what did the hon. member&#x2019;s leader do only a few days later&#x003F; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition came to this House and used language which was dynamite as far as our race set-up was concerned and which was damning to South Africa&#x2019;s image abroad. Sir, what did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition say in the debate on the Coloured Persons Representative Council&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

Why does a respected Leader do such things&#x003F; Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does this because he is obliged to lay it on thicker than his splinters that come here and bid against him; because those people try to outdo him in energetic, dynamic opposition at every turn, and consequently he has to outbid them. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has to come here and prove that that old warhorse, the United Party, is still kicking, but what is it kicking when it says these things&#x003F; When it says these things, it is kicking South Africa.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. DE BEER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Department of Information devotes its energies to improving South Africa&#x2019;s image abroad. Consequently I believe that people abroad must be convinced of why they ought to know more about South Africa. They must be informed as to how they can utilize and apply this information they acquire concerning South Africa, but the benefit that could accrue to them from a knowledge of South African affairs must also be pointed out to them.</p>

<p>There are a few factors that play a very important part in achieving this aim. In the first place, there is the information staff, who must be effective and efficient. There is the message itself that has to be put across. There are the media available to transmit this message, and then there are the people overseas themselves and their reaction to this message they receive.</p>

<p>As regards the first factor, Sir, viz. the ability of the information staff, I believe that we are all agreed that these people are well equipped and trained to perform this task. When one considers at the second factor, viz. the message to be conveyed, then in this respect, too, I believed there need be no difficulties. As far as the third factor is concerned, viz. the media through which this message is to be put across by the department, it can probably attested without fear of contradiction that information publications such as <i>Panorama</i> and our information films can compare with the best in the world. But now we come to the fourth factor, viz. the people abroad to whom this information is addressed. Here, I think, we are approaching the one matter that could impede the realization of the ideal of the department.</p>

<p>We in South Africa often feel that the whole world is against us. I believe that this view is unfounded and untrue. That there are anti-South African feelings and activities abroad, is true, but they do not compare in any way with the blatant ignorance about South African conditions. Ignorance among people abroad is the biggest problem that one constantly comes up against. <span class="col_5033-5034" refersTo="page_0930"/>This ignorance apparently derives from the fact that the foreign public are unable to appreciate that information concerning South Africa can be to their benefit. Evidently they feel that information concerning South Africa is of no practical value to them. When people purchase articles, then they usually purchase those articles which they believe will be of benefit to them, which they can utilize for their own interests, and in the same way people only take note of information which they believe could be to their own benefit.</p>

<p>That is why I say that one of the cardinal functions of the Department of Information is to improve South Africa&#x2019;s image abroad by informing these people why they should be better informed about South Africa. They must be informed about the benefits for them, too, which knowledge of South Africa could involve.</p>

<p>A major factor which could assist the Department of Information in achieving this aim, is the world press. There are signs at present that the quality of reporting, particularly in the so-called &#x00E9;lite daily papers of the world press, is steadily improving. On the one hand, this can be ascribed to the influence of television as a mass medium. Television reaches more people every day, but owing to the fleetingness of the television image, there is a growing demand for those events which television can only touch on cursorily to be explained and placed in perspective. It therefore seems that in the future the world press will play a more important role than ever as far as opinion-forming is concerned. Well-trained, experienced and widely-travelled editors will, therefore, by explaining events and placing them in perspective, exercise an important influence on the forming of world opinion. If we can cause the editors, who are going to play such an important role in opinion-forming overseas, to be favourably disposed towards South Africa, I believe that this could have far-reaching results for us. I therefore believe that these editors must be persuaded to come to South Africa themselves, in order to gain personal knowledge and experience of the situation here.</p>

<p>The efforts already made in this regard through the guest programme of the department, to which reference has already been made this afternoon, are praiseworthy. We are aware of a number of articles written by former guests of Soth Africa that have already contributed tremendously towards putting our image abroad in a better light. Since the role of the world press in this regard will continue to grow, I believe that we should concentrate to an increasing extent on bringing these editors to South Africa. With the aid of these editors, reporting on South Africa may also reach the prominent leaders of the world. News reports will then probably emphasize the building up and the development of South Africa, and they can be news reports that will not merely reflect events in South Africa as a chain of separate, dramatic events, but as a continuous process of development. Such well-founded information could then penetrate to those people who are the driving force in international politics today. These are the people abroad who are the policy-makers that we must concentrate on reaching through our efforts.</p>

<p>The giant task at present being performed by the Department of Information as regards the building of the image of South Africa abroad is a praiseworthy achievement and I believe that if we can prevail upon the editors of these &#x00E9;lite daily papers to cause the world press to take a greater favourable interest in our case, we should be able to give these great efforts an even greater driving force.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the hon. member who has just sat down, on his very constructive and critical approach to the problem of overseas information. He is in fact the only member on that side of the House who approached the matter critically. It would be very easy to participate in the paeans of praise which are being sung on the Government side. However, I cannot share in this glad rejoicing, because the time is so limited to adopt a critical approach to this Vote in the debate. When one visits the Parliaments of Germany or France or England or America, one finds that not only the Opposition, but also the members of the Government, use the discussion of votes to approach matters critically, to make suggestions and to lodge complaints. In this way they participate in the debate in a constructive manner. However, one does not find this here, and I must say that, in the circumstances, the Opposition has no choice, although I should like to participate in the songs of praise myself because the department is indeed doing good work. However, my time is limited to certain remarks.</p>

<p><span class="col_5035-5036" refersTo="page_0931"/>&#x2020;Sir, I should like to begin by referring to the annual report of the Department of Information, in which they say, amongst other things&#x2014;many of which I approve of &#x2014;that training courses and back-ground seminars have been arranged on various subjects including <i>inter alia</i> the policies of the United Party and Progressive Party. We are delighted that some attention is being given to those policies by the Department of Information, but to judge by the quality of the information that is put out about the policies of these parties, those policies are not yet properly understood. One would like to know where this information comes from. In other words, one would like to know which policy is actually being studied, because I have made careful inquiries and there is no senior person in the United Party, no person in an official position in the United Party, who has been consulted about these policies by the Department of Information. This is a fact. Let us look at the consequences of this particular approach. If one looks at <i>South Africa 1974,</i> the official yearbook, which, I suppose is as good a criterion to go by as any, one sees it to be an extremely expensively and, in part, well-produced book, but one finds that there are two chapters dealing with internal policies, the domestic dispute in South Africa. On chapter, Chapter 13, deals with the policy of multi-national development, and Chapter 14 deals with the Black man outside the homelands. Sir, these chapters have to be read to be believed. I should like, in the brief time available to me, just to show exactly how the problem is approached.</p>

<p>In these chapters multi-national development is dealt with on the basis of six &#x201C;realities&#x201D;. Six statements are put forward as realities, and on these an attempt is made to justify the policy of multi-national development. This is fair enough. There then follows an attack on what they call the only alternative to multi-national development, namely integration, and this is attacked on 21 separate grounds. There are 21 separate arguments used against it. In the Yearbook these arguments are tendentious. They consist of special pleading. There are omissions and there are contradictions, and there is a highly selective presentation of facts. Sir, I use this language deliberately and I will now prove my point.</p>

<p>Let us first of all look at the question of integration itself. It is stated baldly that you either, have multi-national development, or you have integration. Integration is then said to include all alternatives to multinational development, federation, for example, amongst them. In fact, on page 273 it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The crux of the matter is that the alternative to a policy of separate ethnonational development must necessarily be <i>arbitrary</i> and <i>artificial</i> integration.</block>

<p>That is the only alternative, &#x201C;arbitrary and artificial integration&#x201D;. That is how it is seen. [Interjections.] In dealing with the Black man outside the homelands, the following statements are made on page 271&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the programme of change envisaged is a short-term one &#x2026;</block>

<p>There is a short-term integration as well as a long-term integration&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; as advocated by the majority of the African states (normally on the basis of one-man one-vote, popularly known as &#x201C;majority rule&#x201D;).</block>

<p>That is one consequence of integration as allegedly advocated by the majority of African states. On page 272 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of political integration of White and Black and of one-man one-vote&#x2014;especially a system based on voting rights according to merit&#x2014;has been rejected by virtually every African state.</block>

<p>They cannot have it both ways. They say: &#x201C;It is advocated by the majority&#x201D; and yet it is also &#x201C;rejected by virtually every African state&#x201D;. A little further on, on page 272, we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">African political systems are incompatible with that of the Western orientated White South African nation.</block>

<p>However, on page 260 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in its legislative assembly the Transkei combines the traditional system of government by traditional chiefs with that of election on a basis of universal adult suffrage.</block>

<p>Here there is praise for the fact that the Western democratic system has been introduced in the Transkei. Let us look at a few more examples. There are so many that I <span class="col_5037-5038" refersTo="page_0932"/>had trouble in selecting them. On page 272 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The remaining minority group in South Africa, the two million strong Coloured (of mixed descent) people have already indicated that they would opt for a separate existence, distinct from the Black groups.</block>

<p>It may be that they have opted for a separate existence, distinct from the Black groups, but this argument is used to explain that the separate groups or communities or nations in South Africa all want a separate existence. However, what they do not say&#x2014;this is where the halftruth comes in&#x2014;is that the Coloured people are actually seeking a common identity with the White people. Why is this not mentioned&#x003F; Why is only one side of the case put&#x003F; Let us look at an example of tendentious reasoning. On page 273 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Nations defines <i>genocide</i> as the purposeful elimination or destruction of clearly different racial, religious or cultural groups. Integration &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the Department&#x2019;s view&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; must surely lead to the disappearance, rapidly or gradually, of many of South Africa&#x2019;s distinctive groups.</block>

<p>In other words, the policy of integration, which people on this side of the House are alleged to pursue as the only alternative to Government policy, is genocide. [Interjections.] It is a pure and logical deduction from the way this is stated here. There are reckless statistics and inaccuracies all over these chapters. When the authors of this book defend the Government&#x2019;s attitude to the urban Bantu, they say on page 281&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Black worker in the White urban area earns a living and enjoys a life there better than anything that can at the moment be provided in his homeland or anywhere else.</block>

<p>They say this in defending their attitude to the presence of the Black man in the urban areas; they say that he enjoys a standard of living better than he can get anywhere else. On the contrary, when they defend homeland development, they say on page 278&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The foregoing statistics &#x2026;</block>

<p>which are a long list of statistics to prove that Black men are flocking back to the homelands&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; are indicative also of increasing job and living opportunities in the homelands.</block>

<p>You can have it one way or the other. Let us look at their attitude to federation. As I have said, the yearbook makes no bones about it that integration, which is allegedly the only alternate to Government policy, includes federation and then it goes on to say on page 273&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is of crucial importance is that once introduced, the integration model cannot be unscrambled, whereas separate development leaves each ethno-national group the option to negotiate &#x2026;</block>

<p>To negotiate what&#x003F;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a federal or confederal type of relationship with other groups!</block>

<p>In other words, the Government is maintaining separate development with a purpose; it does not want them scrambled. What is wants them to do eventually, is to be independent so that of their own accord, of their own initiative they may negotiate a federal type of government.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the technique applied by the hon. member who has just sat down, namely the snatching of a few sentences from various sources in an effort to discredit the work of this department, is not only ineffective, but, I think, also borders on irresponsibility. I cannot resist the temptation to comment on his denial that the only alternative to our policy of parallelism is one of integration. I think it is time for these people to face up to the facts. By artificially reducing the numbers of Black voters, either at voting level as the Progressives do, or at a national federation level, <span class="col_5039-5040" refersTo="page_0933"/>as the United Party does, is nothing but an attempt to reduce the rate of integration temporarily. Until such time as these hon. members realize this fact and face up to it, and until such time as they face the electorate with this as the only alternative to our policy, they will continue to be reduced in number.</p>

<p>*I should like to speak about something else. The success of the Department of information is rooted in two things. In the first place they have the right people with the right know-how, and in the second place they have the right information upon which they are able to lay their hands at the right time.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of this House for a moment to the ordering of all information activities in South Africa. I want to stress the importance of the science of information in South Africa. I am doing this under the Information Vote with the knowledge of the hon. the Minister because I believe that this matter belongs under this Vote.</p>

<p>The science of information deals with the collecting, the processing, the storage and the retrieval of all relevant information in a country. One may think it unnecessary to want to create another activity in the State machinery, but the availability of the correct information is not only important for a department such as this which deals with a particular facet of information, but also of the utmost importance for various other reasons, of which I want to bring only a few to the attention of this House. Information is, in the first place, necessary for good management. It is very interesting to take cognizance of the fact that in the business world today a definite distinction is drawn between the collection of data and the ordering of such data into proper usable information. Readily usable information is being regarded in the business world today as a major capital asset because it can be used for determining trends, for making projections, etc. As it is an asset for a business to obtain the correct information, so a State which wants to have an effective administration certainly need to be able to do so too. I believe the ordering of the science of information in South Africa&#x2014;its establishment, its promotion and its development &#x2014;is of the utmost strategic importance. If one considers the development of hand-operated information systems into electronic systems today, it is a shock to realize that the State machinery, especially with regard to the revenue of the State, is utterly dependent on the handling of information by a small group of people with the aid of a few machines. What is more, this information is handled by people, most of whom are still young. It is mainly young people who are working on the development, operating and maintenance side. In times of emergency they are the people who will be called up for national service in large numbers. I am trying to point out that not only the collection and ordering of this information are of the utmost strategic importance, but also the people who are involved in those tasks. They are people who are particularly vulnerable in various circumstances. These people are all highly trained people who are not interchangeable. These jobs differ from a clerical job in which people can indeed be interchanged. The work of these people is highly specialized. The capital expenditure and the manpower involved in the practice of the science of information is phenomenal. Already hundreds of millions of rand are spent on this profession annually. It is, however, an art and science of precision to direct the development of information correctly, in other words, to get the development of a particular system of information on the correct basis. Also its maintenance is of the utmost importance. It is becoming impossible for the authorities to carry out audits in bodies which are subject to statutory control when all their information has been computerized. Therefore, as far as exercising statutory control is concerned, we are highly vulnerable, except if we have a particular and centralized source of knowledge which is available to the State as far as these matters are concerned. As far as the tremendous information explosion in countries abroad is concerned, I want to say that we cannot liaise with them unless we are organized ourselves. I believe that this matter is of such strategic importance&#x2014;there are still other reasons I can mention&#x2014;that I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to refer this matter to a Select Committee or to some body which can investigate the matter in detail. I can give the assurance that it will take a year or two to get anywhere near an ordering of this matter.</p>

<p>I wish to emphasize only one more very important matter, and that is the vulnerability of South Africa as a very attractive market for any equipment which is used in connection with the science of information. We are one of the only countries which have shown proper growth last year. <span class="col_5041-5042" refersTo="page_0934"/>It is not difficult for any foreign company manufacturing small apparatus to give 10 million dollars to somebody to establish an industry in South Africa. He would then come with $10 million in his pocket and recruit his staff, who would be strategic and highly trained people, in South Africa. I think it is necessary to tell those people that they may come if they want to, but that we then want guarantees from them in terms of the maintenance of their equipment as well as their not appointing our people but bringing their own experts to this country for a period of three years, for example.</p>

<p>However, such steps have legal implications. A body should be established, one which reports to the highest authorities, as is the case in other countries. In the top 20 countries we are the only one which does not have it as yet. This body should advise the highest authorities, and the practical arm of that body should be in the hands of a ministry such as the Department of Information with a separate secretariate for the science of information, or something of that nature. These powers to be established, should extend outside the State machinery, wider than the Civil Service Commission, over provincial borders to local authorities. It is necessary for us to organize this industry up to that level. Seen from the strategic and economic point of view and with a view to the proper ordering of manpower and having proper control, it is undesirable for South Africa to continue for one single day without the establishment of a body such as this.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Florida started off by criticizing me for using what he called &#x201C;selected passages&#x201D; from the <i>S.A. Yearbook, 1974.</i> I assure him that if he would take the trouble to read those passages, he would find that these inconsistencies and half-truths do in fact exist. In fact, they abound in this book. It is right that one should criticize this book because according to a reply to a question in the House, the cost of compiling the information was R220 000, nearly R&#x00BC; million. The cost of printing was R150 000&#x2014;a total of R370 000 in all. The number of books printed was 7 450; so that the average cost per book was just under R50. When one produces a publication at that cost, one can he expected to produce something of very high quality. One is therefore justified in looking very critically at a book that cost nearly R50 per copy. However, apart from that rather silly remark, if I may say so, by the hon. member for Florida, I thought that for the rest he talked a good deal of sense.</p>

<p>I want to come now to some constructive suggestions about the activities of the Department of Information. I believe that the Department of Information can in regard to its internal task, play a very important part and make a very important contribution in this country. I want to suggest a few examples of what can be done. These examples are taken, in part, from what I have seen done in other countries. I have seen departments of information working for the internal benefit of those countries and for the general education of the people of those countries. I should like to quote a few examples. I think that it must generally be admitted in South Africa that the slaughter on our roads has become practically intolerable. We have, in South Africa, one of the highest death rates on our roads of any country in the world. In fact, according to some statistics I have seen, our death rate on the roads is the second highest in the world. This entails a loss of life, a loss of talent and a loss of skills which South Africa, with its small skilled population, simply cannot afford. One has seen that in certain other countries a campaign has been conducted&#x2014;in the case of Britain, by their Department of Information, and in the case of other countries by organizations co-ordinated by their Departments of Information&#x2014;to teach people road manners, traffic control, road courtesy and all those elements that go into safe driving and a reduction in the loss of life and material loss on the roads. I believe that this matter is so important that the Department of Information, if it will take a little time off from dealing with topics of internal political controversy, could by concentrating on a matter of this kind make a major contribution to the benefit and the welfare of this country. I want to mention another example. In this country we are faced with certain aspects of the fuel crisis and we have a great need to conserve energy. I have previously criticized in this House the tendency on the part of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs to use punitive measures to persuade people to save petrol. I do not believe it can work and it is in fact evident from what has been happening on our roads that it is not working. In such a case one has to gain the co-operation, the goodwill and the enthusiasm of people, and <span class="col_5043-5044" refersTo="page_0935"/>I believe that no department other than the Department of Information is in the position to mobilize psychologically the minds and the will of people to co-operate with the Government in a matter of this importance.</p>

<p>I believe that there is another field and a very fertile field to which the department might direct its attention. Another example which goes without saying is the protection of the environment. This should be done for a number of reasons but, mainly because the nature of a waste economy is to waste and to throw things away, I believe that our environment is suffering severe damage. There are also developments on our coastline, our mountains and our rivers which are destroying a great heritage in this country. I believe that in this field the Department of Information could play a major part in mobilizing public opinion and in creating a mood among the people which would tend to preserve these things for posterity.</p>

<p>Another of our problems has been the lack of adequate communication with our non-White people. We sometimes tend to behave as if we were just a lot of White people talking to White people. When we talk about petrol, conservation, road safety or whatever it is, we tend to use language and images which are only directed at White people. Our Black and our Brown people are part of this country and they also have a contribution to make. It is most important that the campaign of publicity&#x2014;psychological warfare if you like&#x2014; should be extended to those fields so that the Blacks and Browns may also make their contribution which they are well capable of making if their minds are properly mobilized for this purpose.</p>

<p>Lastly, I come to the question of better race relations which is obviously the key to the future of this country. Whichever policy is adopted, whether it be separate development, federation or whatever policy we have in mind, it is essential that it should be based on good race relations, that is to say on goodwill between man and man. We are all conscious of many ancient inhibitions and old habits as well as old kinds of hostility which still exist in our private lives in this country. I believe that the Department of Information can make a major contribution not only to its own policy but to any policy that may be adopted in this country for the improvement of race relations. Fundamentally we have to appeal to people&#x2014;from small children right up to old people&#x2014;and teach them that we can no longer afford discourtesy in this country. They must be taught that we can no longer afford ancient forms of indignity and verbal forms of contempt which are still heard on our streets every day. I believe that the Department of Information, as a department of internal information, has a major duty and a major obligation to perform in these fields. There are examples which crop up every day. Earlier the hon. member for Bezuidenhout mentioned the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s rather unhappy analogy quoted by Mr. Giniewski about the black bull and the black snake. There, unconsciously, one has the kind of language which I think is most unfortunate. All of us have to get out of the habit of talking in these terms. The words &#x201C;black snake&#x201D; are going to be observed by people. They will say: If the Black man in White South Africa is &#x201C;a black snake&#x201D;, what on earth can the Minister&#x2019;s fundamental view be&#x003F; I am not saying that he intended to call the Black man a black snake, but I am saying that the reference to a black bull and a black snake is an analogy into which he fell quite naturally because he was not sufficiently sensitive to the kind of effect his words might have. I do not say that the hon. the Minister is the only sinner in this regard. I believe it is only too common throughout South Africa that we use words, forms of expression and analogies which in fact do real harm. I believe there is a great educational task to be performed in this country. I believe that no racial policy, separate development, federation or any other, will succeed in this country unless it is laid on a foundation of goodwill, good manners and, generally, good human relations. I believe that nothing can succeed if that does not succeed. I believe there is an enormous gap to be filled and that there is a great deal to be done. I believe that the Department of Information in its internal programmes in this country should give a great deal more attention to these matters. If it does so, it might even, who knows, succeed in curing the HNP of some of its worst excesses. Even if I am now putting my targets too high, the task still remains and must still be tackled, if the Department of Information embarks on this, which I consider to be one of the major tasks of internal information in this country, it can count on the full support of this side of the House.</p>

<from><span class="col_5045-5046" refersTo="page_0936"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INFORMATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Information Vote has now being discussed here for a few hours and in the seven minutes which are left, I just want to express a few thoughts. The adjournment of the House will then give me an opportunity to reply fully tomorrow on the attacks which have been made here.</p>

<p>I want to start oft by thanking hon. members in general for the spirit in which this debate has been conducted this year. From all sides, real attempts have been made to express constructive criticism and make positive suggestions which can help the Department of Information in its attempts to increase its effectiveness even further. I appreciate the spirit and attitude in which the debate took place.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary that we should pause for a few moments at the concept of what the task of this department really is. We, and not only we, but all the countries in the world, are in reality involved in a war of words. At the moment the world is fighting not only for financial advantage or the conquest of countries, but to conquer the minds of mankind for various philosophies. In this struggle which is being waged between different countries and different world tendencies, attempts are made from all sides to conquer the minds of people by influencing them with subtle or blatant propaganda or by any means whatever. It is in this propaganda war that the Department of Information and its officials are fighting in the very front-line on behalf of South Africa.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to avail myself of this opportunity&#x2014;I think it is essential that I do it at the beginning of the debate&#x2014;to convey my special thanks and appreciation and to express my congratulations to the Secretary and the Deputy Secretaries of the department and to the officials in general, abroad and at home, wherever they may be for their diligence, for the tireless task performed every day, for the fact that they never spare themselves and that no demand is ever too great, and for the fact that we really have a group of dedicated officials here <b>who</b> will give their utmost to serve South Africa well in the struggle in this connection. I think it is necessary that it be placed on record that we thank these people on behalf of all the parties of South Africa for the great task they are carrying out. I want to say tonight, to the credit of the Opposition. That practically every member of the Opposition who has participated in the debate so far, has paid tribute to the work which is being done by the Department. They have recognized that good work is being done. However, virtually no one could refrain from expressing criticism afterwards, and I welcome that very sincerely, especially the spirit in which it was presented. Tomorrow I shall reply on the whole matter more fully. For the moment I want to conclude by commenting briefly on what the hon. member for Von Brandis had to say in his last speech &#x2014;the positive one; the one before that was a little different, but the last speech I appreciated. He described the cost of the Yearbook as a little too high. It is true that the cost of the Year-book was tremendously high, but the hon. member must bear in mind that the Yearbook had to be built up from nothing. There was nothing we could use as a basis; everything had to be started from scratch.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case, we had to start from scratch. We involved a cross-section of practically the entire population as contributors to the Year-book&#x2014;if the hon. member will look at the Year-book, he will notice that: Journalists from different newspapers, Afrikaans and English, people from the academic world, people from different regions and the department&#x2019;s own people&#x2014;a composition, therefore of all available resources to produce the Year-book. To produce it for the first time, therefore, involved tremendously high costs. As far as the future is concerned, we will obviously proceed on the basis of the present Year-book by only keening statistics up to date, in other words, supplementing them from time to time. In other words, the costs will obviously be spread over a number of years, and, on average, amount to less per book. I hope that this explains the position. We had to start from scratch and the cost involved was, therefore, high.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that I agree with the hon. member about the question of a road safety campaign, and that we cannot afford to lose valuable human lives on our roads. The question is whose task it actually is to launch an information campaign in connection with road safety. The hon. member said that this falls under the activities of the Department of Information. The fact is that a Road Safety Council was specially established and that funds were appropriated specifically to do just that. The Department of Information have a representative in that council, who advises them, with his expert knowledge, as far as is necessary and as far as he is able to do so. In any case, the Government has definitely taken cognizance of the problem and established a specific council to which funds are provided to do the work.</p>

<p>That is what it amounts to. I do not think the Department of Information should take over the work of all the departments in a co-ordinating capacity, which will mean that the fuel crises information service will also have to be undertaken by the Department of Information. The hon. member wants the work of the Department of Planning and the Environment in connection with environmental conservation and the question of pollution to be transferred to the Department of Information as well. He also wants the Department of Bantu Administration&#x2019;s task in respect of human relations to be transferred to the Department of Information.</p>

<p>We cannot do it in this way; it cannot work that way either. I want to tell you immediately, Sir, that specific departments are charged with all these tasks and are at present dealing with them. Where the Department of Information, as the professional department which avails over expert knowledge, can be of assistance, its help is called in and we do, in fact, help. For example, we help with publications of all the other departments when we are asked to do so. I can also tell the hon. member that last year at the Rand Easter Show we had environmental conversation as our theme and won a gold trophy for that specific exhibition. We made a special film <i>Who cares,</i> about the subject&#x2014;some of you have perhaps seen it&#x2014;which cost us R14 000 and which was circulated throughout our country to draw attention specifically to that issue. That is our contribution. However, there are other departments which have specific instructions and tasks. Therefore I want to tell the hon. member that I agree in general with his idea that the expert knowledge of our department should be available to others. At the same time I want to tell him this is, in fact, happening in practice, and that they do in fact make use of it.</p>
