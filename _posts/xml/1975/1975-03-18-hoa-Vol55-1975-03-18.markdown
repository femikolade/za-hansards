<debateSection name="#introduction">

<heading>INTRODUCTION</heading>

<p>The Post Office has once again made good progress in various fields during the past financial year.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to say that the large investments in telecommunications equipment during the past few years have begun to bear fruit in a clearly visible manner since the greater capacity of the system enables us to provide more telecommunications services now than ever before.</p>

<p><span class="col_2803-2804" refersTo="page_1417"/>It is expected that a record number of 123 000 additional telephone services will be provided during the financial year which ends on 31 March 1975; that is 12 000 more than during the previous financial year. At the same time, telex services will increase by approximately 14% and data services by about 50%. A sustained growth in the volume of mail handled was also maintained during the year.</p>

<p>Particulars of the progress made during 1973-&#x2019;74 and of the outstanding characteristics of part of the financial year which is now drawing to a close, are contained in the Annual Report of the Postmaster General which has been Tabled. I should now like to inform the House more fully on what was achieved during 1974-75 and what is contemplated for the next financial year.</p>

<debateSection name="#staff">

<heading>STAFF</heading>

<p><i>Staff Management Board</i></p>

<p>In terms of legislation passed during the previous session, the Post Office Staff Board was abolished and the Staff Management Board established with effect from 1 November 1974.</p>

<p>The new Board comprises the Postmaster-General, as Chairman, and the four Deputy Postmasters-General. We believe that staff administration in the Post Office has now been placed on a sounder footing because the overlapping of responsibility in this field and inconsistencies in legislation have been eliminated.</p>

<p>The indications are that the change was fully justified and that efficiency in the management of the Post Office has been promoted by it.</p>

<p><i>Staff position</i></p>

<p>Because of the keen competition on the labour market, the Post Office could not fully satisfy its labour requirements. It nevertheless succeeded in drawing a satisfactory share of the supply.</p>

<p>In two work spheres in particular, namely those of the technical and telephone operating staff, we were hard pressed to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Despite sustained efforts to recruit sufficient candidates for training in the technical field and to obtain the services of trained persons, a serious shortage of staff on this front is still being experienced.</p>

<p>During 1974 we succeeded in recruiting 213 immigrants abroad, 78 of whom have already assumed duty as technicians and 135 as telephone electricians. This brings to about 630 the total number of immigrants in service with us under contract.</p>

<p>At the same time, 500 trained technicians and telephone electricians resigned during the year&#x2014;approximately 150 more than the previous year&#x2014;while a further 497 semi-trained staff in these categories left the service.</p>

<p>Fortunately the tempo of resignations have decreased since the salary increments came into operation with effect from 1 July 1974, and I trust that this will continue.</p>

<p>At the moment there is a shortage of approximately 2 600 trained units on the technical and semi-technical levels. This represents approximately 21% of the total requirement.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have roughly 2 800 pupil technicians and learner telephone electricians in various stages of training.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 1974, women have been recruited for training as technicians; 10 are in training at present. After completion of their courses, these women will be employed on indoor duties, mainly in automatic exchanges. We are endeavouring to exploit this source of labour on an increasing scale.</p>

<p><i>Improved salaries</i></p>

<p>The salary increases with effect from 1 July 1974 were in the main well received. I trust that these concessions, together with the improved basis of salary recognition in respect of age, educational qualifications and previous appropriate experience that is now being applied, will assist us in retaining the services of trained personnel and draw more persons to the Post Office.</p>

<p><i>Better utilization of staff</i></p>

<p>The aim of the Post Office is still the optimum utilization of its available labour force. To this end, a new division of functions and responsibilities between engineers and technical staff has, for instance, been made.</p>

<p>With the wholehearted support of the staff, it was possible to create a dispensation, through a restructuring of posts, in which the training and abilities of officers can be utilized to even greater advantage <span class="col_2805-2806" refersTo="page_1418"/>than before. Senior technical staff have replaced engineers on certain work phases and, as a result, engineers have been released to perform functions that do justice to their professional status and skills.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that last year I enlarged on the progress made on a wide front in the more intensive utilization of non-White labour on advanced duties.</p>

<p>In 1971 a start was made with the training of non-Whites as telephone electricians. Thus far, 116 of them have completed their training, while 139 are in training at present. We hope to recruit an additional 137 for training in this capacity.</p>

<p>We commenced with the training of non-Whites as technicians in 1974, and 44 have successfully completed the first-year course. It is expected that a further 46 non-Whites will be admitted to training as technicians this year. The availability of instructors and training facilities are limiting factors.</p>

<debateSection name="#postal_services">

<heading>POSTAL SERVICES</heading>

<p><i>Postal codes</i></p>

<p>Last year I was able to say here that the postal codes were well received by the public&#x2014;but this good reaction has, unfortunately, not been maintained. A recent survey revealed that, of mail matter addressed by hand, the percentage on which postal codes appear has decreased.</p>

<p>There has been a slight increase in the number of mechanically addressed mail items bearing postal codes, but this can still be improved considerably. We know that it takes time for organizations using addressograph machines and computers to change their addressing systems, but trust that they will adapt them as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>I should like to appeal once again to the public as a whole to use the postal codes and to follow the good example set by others.</p>

<p><i>Self-service centres</i></p>

<p>A year or so ago the Post Office started with a unique experiment in self-service facilities.</p>

<p>We aimed at providing this type of service to the public in residential areas where we could not economically justify post offices and where the residents would otherwise have had no post office facilities.</p>

<p>Because we could not determine beforehand how efficient the self-service centres would be in the new mode of application and what support they would receive from the public, the first two&#x2014;namely those at Rondebult (near Germiston) and Verwoerdpark (near Alberton)&#x2014;were established on a purely experimental basis.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to say that we have, in fact, received nothing but praise from the residents of the two townships and that we have proof of the success of our experiment. As a result, we shall now continue to provide self-service centres at other suitable places.</p>

<p><i>Philatelic services</i></p>

<p>Our efforts in recent times to promote philatelic sales both here and abroad have been crowned with success.</p>

<p>In 1973, for the first time in our history, we marketed South African stamps through foreign agencies. At present we have agencies in three countries&#x2014;the U.S.A., England and Italy&#x2014;and in 1974 sales via this avenue already amounted to R56 000.</p>

<p>Last year the Post Office participated in two exhibitions abroad, namely in Switzerland and in Malta. We shall also be taking part in two international exhibitions this year: in Madrid next month and in Vienna towards the end of the year. We shall continue making our stamps known in this manner on a selective basis.</p>

<p>On the national level interest in stamp collecting is being stimulated by the annual postage stamp exhibition which is arranged by the Philatelic Federation of Southern Africa. Expenditure on exhibitions and the other activities of the Federation is high. In order also to make a contribution in this connection, the Post Office has taken the initiative in the establishment of a Philatelic Foundation, aimed at rendering financial assistance to the Federation and the promotion of philately in general. The Post Office&#x2019;s financial contribution to the Foundation for the 1975-&#x2019;76 financial year will amount to R5 000.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 1971 the number of deposit accounts have gone up from 631 to nearly 9 000. In that year the sales turnover was R107 000 as against R644 000 in 1974. Over the same period the annual net profit increased from R23 000 to over a quarter of a million rand.</p>

<p><span class="col_2807-2808" refersTo="page_1419"/>To stimulate interest in philately and make it easier to pursue the hobby, the Post Office intends marketing shortly an album that will be ideally suited to the purpose.</p>

<p>It has become established custom to issue commemorative stamps on the occasion of the inauguration of a State President. Consequently I am pleased to announce that two commemorative stamps will be issued when the new Head of State is inaugurated.</p>

<debateSection name="#building_projects_and_housing">

<heading>BUILDING PROJECTS AND HOUSING</heading>

<p><i>Major building projects</i></p>

<p>Altogether 57 buildings, the total cost of which will amount to approximately R18,7 million, are expected to be completed during the present financial year. Furthermore, our planning provides for the completion of 42 works in 1975-&#x2019;76 at an estimated cost of R14,9 million.</p>

<p>In addition to these projects. 12 building works which will be completed later than the next financial year, are at present in progress. The estimated cost of these works is R17,8 million. Is is expected that in 1975-&#x2019;76 building operations will also commence on 46 buildings, the total estimated cost of which will be R17.1 million.</p>

<p><i>Housing</i></p>

<p>During the present financial year, 11 houses were erected for the staff and work was started on 4 more. Forty-two improved properties have been purchased, but transfer still has to be taken of 7 of them. An amount of approximately R1,4 million will be spent in 1974-&#x2019;75 on the houses mentioned and on the erection of a block of 20 flats at Empangeni.</p>

<p>The housing programme for the 1975-&#x2019;76 financial year provides for the erection or purchase of 40 houses and the completion of the Empangeni project. A start will also be made with the erection of 14 flats at Newcastle and 18 at Brits where housing shortages are experienced. It is estimated that an amount of R2 million will be required for the execution of the services planned for 1975-&#x2019;76.</p>

<debateSection name="#conservation_of_fuel">

<heading>CONSERVATION OF FUEL</heading>

<p>The ever expanding activities of the Post Office have necessitated the enlargement of its transport fleet from 7 000 to 7 500 vehicles during the past 12 months. Although more kilometres were covered and a gradual increase in fuel consumption was inevitable, we succeeded, thanks to the cooperation of the staff, in maintaining an average monthly fuel saving of 20% since fuel economy measures were introduced towards the end of 1973.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#electronic_data_processing">

<heading>&#x2020;ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING</heading>

<p>During the past year, the Post Office has once again maintained its tempo of computerizing labour-intensive functions and it is especially pleasing to report that a net saving of R2,25 million could be effected during the year in this regard.</p>

<p>At present attention is being given in particular to the streamlining of the comprehensive telephone and telegraph record and accounts system; on the one hand, to profit from the continuous improvement in computer equipment and techniques and, on the other, to divert more of the manual facets to the computer for execution.</p>

<p>It is expected that from next month onwards all telephone accounts will be produced by the various computer centres.</p>

<p>An integrated and computerized management information and accounts system for the entire Post Office is being planned in co-operation with private consultants. This is a task of considerable magnitude which will take several years to implement in its entirety.</p>

<p>Computerization of the Post Office Savings Bank was one of the most important projects completed in the past year. As soon as the computer processing is centralized in Pretoria later this year, remote dialling by means of the Post Office gentex system will provide a speedier and more efficient savings bank service to the public. Since computerization, interest is calculated on daily balances, a considerable advantage to all depositors.</p>

<p>In order to obtain optimum use from our data facilities and to improve the quality of service still further, it is planned to link most of the cities of the Republic with the large central computer in Pretoria by means of data transmission systems.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#telecommunications_services">

<heading>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES</heading>

<p><i>Telephones</i></p>

<p>A total of 1 857 113 telephones were in service at the end of March 1974. It is expected that a record number of nearly <span class="col_2809-2810" refersTo="page_1420"/>123 000 additional services will be provided during the present financial year, bringing the new total to about 1 980 000 at the end of this month.</p>

<p>The provision of these additional telephone services is in itself a big undertaking. Still more telephone installation work is, however, tied up with population movements and the substitution of one type of service for another. Approximately half a million applications for the various types of services are now being handled annually.</p>

<p>On 31 December 1974, deferred applications for exchange line services totalled 96 959 (or 4,66% of total needs) as against 94 249 at the end of December 1973&#x2014;which came to 4,84% of total needs at that stage. The increase in the number of deferred applications can be attributed mainly to the fact that considerably more applications for telephone service were received last year than in 1973.</p>

<p><i>Automatic telephone exchanges</i></p>

<p>The manual exchanges at Gobabis, Hammarsdale, Hlobane, Langkrans and Okahandja have been converted to automatic working. It is expected that the manual exchanges at Blackheath, Coronation, Eersterivier, Ingogo and Licthenburg will be converted to automatic working before the end of the financial year.</p>

<p>If matters go according to plan, approximately 89 000 additional lines at 81 existing automatic exchanges will be available at the end of this financial year.</p>

<p>During the first ten months of the present financial year, sixteen new automatic exchanges with approximately 20 000 lines were put into operation in existing automatic exchange areas. It is expected that a further ten new automatic exchanges with approximately 11 600 lines will be in operation at the end of the financial year.</p>

<p>The programme for next financial year provides for the conversion of 73 manual exchanges to automatic working. This will bring about the automation of telephone services at, <i>inter alia,</i> Malmesbury, Franschhoek, Wellington, Brits, Tzaneen, Empangeni. Margate, Utrecht, Port Shepstone and Vryheid.</p>

<p>With a view to providing telephone service to waiting applicants in existing automatic areas and to relieve the congestion in certain areas, 96 automatic exchanges will be extended with a total of approximately 120 000 lines. In addition, approximately 30 000 lines have been planned for these areas.</p>

<p><i>Microwave systems</i></p>

<p>The microwave systems between Klerksdorp and Lichtenburg and those between Klerksdorp and Kimberley have been completed.</p>

<p>Work on the installation of television links for the relay of television programmes is proceeding well, but all the equipment has not yet been received and much of the work will be completed only later this year. Everything possible is being done to ensure that overseas suppliers fulfil their undertakings with regard to the delivery of equipment.</p>

<p>Access roads and towers for the Bloemfontein-Bethlehem, Johannesburg-Hartebeesthoek (earth station), Johannesburg-Rustenburg, Kimberley-Upington and Nelspruit-Lourenço Marques systems are well advanced. Roads for the Pietersburg-Tzaneen system are nearing completion.</p>

<p>Planning has already been undertaken for possible new routes between Durban and Empangeni, Vryheid and Johannesburg, Windhoek and Walvis Bay, Scottsburgh and Kokstad. Bloemfontein, Aliwal North and Queenstown and George and Oudtshoorn.</p>

<p>Besides the television channels that will be made available by means of microwave systems, channels for purely telecommunications purposes will be provided over most of the routes mentioned, as well as over a few others, during the new financial year. However, most of our funds and manpower available for transmission works are now being applied to the completion of the country-wide relay network for television.</p>

<p><i>Telephone directories</i></p>

<p>The computerization of the present 12 white page telephone directories was completed with the issue of the 1974-&#x2019;75 Western and Southern Cape telephone directory. This change-over was a large task which inevitable resulted in a delay of several months in the normal publication dates of telephone directories. It is planned to return to, or as near as possible to, the original dates of publication.</p>

<p>An arrangement whereby advertising debits of most of the telephone directories are raised through the medium of telephone accounts and paid on a monthly basis, was introduced in collaboration with the Post Office&#x2019;s official advertising contractor. It is <span class="col_2811-2812" refersTo="page_1421"/>expected that this new arrangement, which is generally preferred by advertisers, will produce substantial additional revenue for the Post Office.</p>

<p>The Orange Free State and Northern Cape telephone directory, previously issued as a combined directory, has been divided into two separate publications with effect from the 1974-&#x2019;75 issue. Apart from other advantages, this will bring about a considerable saving of paper.</p>

<p>Similar and even more substantial benefits will accrue from the omission of the yellow page sections from those combined white and yellow page directories which subscribers in other directory areas may obtain on demand in addition to their own directory.</p>

<p>The abridged directories are being distributed solely to ensure the smooth operation of the telephone system and the yellow pages are not essential for this purpose. Where the yellow pages are published as a separate volume, the books will also be distributed only in the directory areas to which they are proper. Savings in paper and printing costs of over R500 000 per annum will be achieved in this manner.</p>

<p><i>Inland telegraph and telex services</i></p>

<p>Telex services are still increasing at a rate of about 14% per year and it is expected that the number of subscribers will reach 10 850 at the end of this month. This represents an increase of 1 330 during the 1974-&#x2019;75 financial year. Efforts to reduce the waiting list of some 900 applicants are being hampered by a shortage of technical staff.</p>

<p>Since the capacity of the Durban telegraph exchange will soon be inadequate, a larger and more modern semi-electronic exchange is now being installed there. Owing to basic differences between the old and new exchanges, the numbers of most telex subscribers in Natal will have to be changed when the new exchange is commissioned towards the end of the year.</p>

<p>Altogether 736 telegraph offices, some of them situated in Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, are now connected to the public telegram switching network&#x2014;also known as the gentex network.</p>

<p><i>Data transmission services</i></p>

<p>Although still relatively small in comparison with telex and telephone services, data services are growing at a faster rate than either of those two, namely at about 50% per year.</p>

<p>With a view to placing computer services also within the reach of smaller business concerns who do not find it worth their while to rent transmission channels on a full-time basis, time division multiplexing equipment will shortly be provided by the Post Office which will allow the joint use of a channel by a number of small users. In this manner a channel suitable for transmissions at a speed of 4 800 bits per second can be divided into say 24 channels of 200 or 4 of 1 200 bits per second, or a combination of both. In view of this concession, we expect that the number of data services will in future show a considerably higher growth.</p>

<p><i>Maritime radio services</i></p>

<p>A new building for the radio receiving station at Port Elizabeth has been completed and equipment is now being transferred from the old to the new building.</p>

<p>Radio stations which are at present controlled from Cape Town, have been put into operation at Mossel Bay, Cape Agulhas and Struisbaai. One transmitter at Cape Columbine has been commissioned and this station, as well as the new stations at Cape St. Martin and St. Lucia, will be completed before the end of next month.</p>

<p>Arrangements for the remote operation of the station at East London are at present being rounded off. New stations at Port Nolloth, Port St. Johns and Luderitz will be completed during the next financial year.</p>

<p><i>International telephone service</i></p>

<p>The capacity of the international telephone exchange in Cape Town has been increased and this enabled us to commence, in November last year, with the provision of a fully automatic telephone service to the United Kingdom. Thus far the facilities are available to subscribers on the Witwatersrand, in Pretoria and in the Vaal Triangle only. These facilities will, however, be available to all subscribers connected to automatic exchanges towards the beginning of next year.</p>

<p>A second international telephone exchange will be brought into operation in Johannesburg during next financial year. This exchange is required more particularly for the extension of overseas subscriber dialling and the utilization of satellite communications <span class="col_2813-2814" refersTo="page_1422"/>channels from the beginning of 1976.</p>

<p>Direct telephone connections exist between South Africa and 24 other countries. Altogether 486 telephone circuits are available&#x2014;as against 381 on 31 March 1974&#x2014; for the disposal of telephone traffic to 169 countries with which agreements are in force concerning the handling of calls. During the 1974-&#x2019;75 financial year, telephone service was introduced to Chad, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Iceland. Mali, Panama, Papua-New Guinea, Roumania, Syrian Arab Republic and South Vietnam.</p>

<p><i>International telex service</i></p>

<p>During my Budget Speech last year I mentioned that direct dialling facilities for telex subscribers were available to 30 countries.</p>

<p>Overseas telex traffic has increased so rapidly that the international telex exchange in Johannesburg has had to be enlarged considerably during this financial year. For the first time in our history, the revenue from outgoing telex calls for one month exceeded the R1 million mark.</p>

<p>Thirty different routes and more than 480 telex circuits are used to handle the traffic between South Africa and 172 countries. More than three-quarters of this traffic&#x2014; namely 86%&#x2014;is disposed of by means of direct subscriber-to-subscriber dialling. We contemplate raising the percentage of direct dialling to 95 by the end of the year.</p>

<p><i>Satellite communications services</i></p>

<p>The civil engineering work on the satellite earth station at Hartebeesthoek, near Pretoria, has reached an advanced stage and is expected to be completed by June this year.</p>

<p>Telecommunications equipment for the station itself is at present being manufactured in Europe and its installation will commence in July. The components for the two antennae are being manufactured mainly in South Africa.</p>

<p>It is expected that a new telecommunications satellite for the Atlantic service will be launched from Cape Canaveral during July this year. When our earth station is put into operation, at the beginning of next year, we shall obtain channels to the Americas and Europe via this satellite.</p>

<p><i>Contracts awarded to private firms</i></p>

<p>The services of the private sector have, as was the case in the past few years, again been used as extensively as possible in the execution of the Post Office&#x2019;s telecommunications programme.</p>

<p>It is expected that R18 356 000 will be spent during this financial year on the laying of underground cables, the building of access roads to microwave relay stations, the building of microwave towers and the installation of telecommunications equipment. For the previous financial year this expenditure amounted to more than R17 million.</p>

<debateSection name="#new_telephone_system">

<heading>NEW TELEPHONE SYSTEM</heading>

<p>Needless to say, the Department is giving the highest priority to the extension of the telephone system and the improvement of the quality of service.</p>

<p>In the first years of the Post Office&#x2019;s greater autonomy, the emphasis had of necessity to fall on the provision, with due regard to our financial and manpower means, of essential services for which the demand was great and, simultaneously, the building-in into the telecommunications system of essential additional capacity which was&#x2014;and still is&#x2014;a prerequisite for the improvement of the quality of service.</p>

<p>Some considerable time ago it became evident that because of the phenomenal progress in the development of new switching techniques and the many advantages inherent in their application, we had to consider the gradual replacement of our ageing electro-mechanical switching system with a modern electronic one in the further extension of our system.</p>

<p>Because of the labour-intensive nature of the operation and maintenance of the older switching system, such a change could in the long run provide a solution to our chronic technical manpower problem in this particular sphere.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall my mentioning in my Budget Speech two years ago that we were undertaking a study of the different switching systems and techniques with a view to making a well-considered change. This comprehensive study has now been completed. It involved, <i>inter alia,</i> research abroad by some of our foremost telecommunications engineers and technicians as well as visits to South Africa by overseas experts.</p>

<p><span class="col_2815-2816" refersTo="page_1423"/>The choice is of fundamental importance to our country. Not only will it determine the switching system that will have to serve the country for a generation or even longer, but it might be the key to overcoming some of the problems with which we have struggled for so long in our efforts to give South Africa an efficient service in every respect.</p>

<p>In considering the offers of six leading telecommunications firms, it was difficult to find a valid basis of evaluation because so many technical, financial and other considerations were involved.</p>

<p>It is understandable that the existence of an own South African telecommunications industry, which, over the past two decades, has been built up laboriously but in a good spirit of partnership on the initiative of the Post Office, in which a high content of local manufacture has already been realized and in which approximately R74¼ million, including current assets, has been invested, should weigh heavily with us&#x2014;also factors such as the following in so far as they relate to the new system:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Capital and operating costs.</li>

<li>(b) Compatability with the old switching system&#x2014;the two systems will have to function side by side for a long time.</li>

<li>(c) Suitability for local manufacture, having regard to the fact that we want to be self-sufficient as far as possible.</li>

<li>(d) Greater efficiency and additional facilities.</li>

<li>(e) Staff and training requirements emanating from the change.</li>

<li>(f) Flexibility and adaptability of the system.</li>

</ol>

<p>One of the most important conditions stipulated was that the firm whose system we chose should be prepared to licence other approved suppliers to manufacture the system in South Africa. In order to make economic manufacturing possible, there must, of necessity, not be more than one electronic switching system for the whole country. Standardization is also dictated by maintenance considerations.</p>

<p>We finally came to the conclusion that, in the light of all the relevant considerations, the Siemens CP44/CP24 system would be the most suitable system for our purpose. The CP44 type will be used for the large and medium size exchanges and the CP24 for smaller exchanges. An additional advantage is that the latter type can also be made available in independent mobile format.</p>

<p>Because certain adaptations and rounding off in development are still in progress in respect of the CP44, the ESK 10 000E system&#x2014;from which the CP44 evolved&#x2014;will be used in the interim.</p>

<p>It is expected that the first of the smaller exchanges (CP24) will become available towards the end of next year, and the CP44 a few years later. There will, of course, be a gradual switch-over to local manufacture. Imports will be resorted to only to an extent which, particularly during the transitional period, will not cause disruption in the local industry.</p>

<p>Apart from the greater efficiency of the system and the facilities it can provide&#x2014;such as push-button dialling&#x2014;the indications are that it will effect a saving of 75% and more on technical manpower for maintenance purposes. It has been calculated, for instance, that only 20 technicians would be required to maintain the automatic exchanges in the Pretoria area as against the 150 now employed for this purpose.</p>

<p>In respect of accommodation it is expected that a saving of more than one third will be effected on the space required for apparatus, while installation costs will amount to only about 25% of that of a corresponding electro-mechanical system. Contrary to earlier expectations, capital costs will also be less.</p>

<p>We do not by any means want to imply that the system of our choice is better than one or more of the other systems offered. In certain respects it is better than some and in other respects it is, in turn, surpassed. The fact of the matter is that in our judgment it is the best system for our particular circumstances, due regard being had to all the relevant considerations.</p>

<p>Gradual switching-over will undoubtedly place high demands on both the Department and manufacturers, but I know that we can count on them.</p>

<p>A memorandum in which more detail about the whole matter is furnished, is being distributed separately.</p>

<p><span class="col_2817-2818" refersTo="page_1424"/><i>French participation</i></p>

<p>For various good reasons, both South Africa and France desire that the trade ties between our two countries should be strengthened.</p>

<p>Arising from the recent visit to South Africa of the French trade mission, the Government has decided on participation in the telecommunications industry by an affiliate of the French industrial giant CGE. Negotiations in this connection will be conducted with the present suppliers.</p>

<p>I should like to use this opportunity to welcome the French, in advance, most heartily as a partner. We look forward to a long period of hearty and fruitful co-operation.</p>

<p>We realize that they will feel disappointed that their highly developed&#x2014;although, for all applications, still largely untried&#x2014;electronic system was not chosen, but know that they will understand that for technical and economic reasons it was not possible to do so at this stage.</p>

<p>The decision by no means detracts from our acknowledgement of the excellence of French technology. Although the switching system they offered was not chosen as our first electronic system, we have no doubt that it can develop into a serious future competitor.</p>

<heading>*FINANCES</heading>

<p><i>The 1974-75 financial year</i></p>

<p>I am glad to be able to say that on the financial front, despite the continued high rate of inflation, this financial year was a good one for the Post Office.</p>

<p>According to the latest estimates our revenue will come to R447,3 million, which is almost R5 million more than the amount budgeted for. The higher revenue is attributable in the main to improved traffic flow in the telephone system and is an indication of the fruits to be expected from our large spending during the past few years on the augmentation of the capacity of the system.</p>

<p>On the expenditure side, our operating expenditure is now estimated at R415,3 million, which again is R2 million less than the amount budgeted for. This is attributable to the improvement of our financial control measures and a larger than expected increase in productivity.</p>

<p>Capital expenditure is estimated at R 182,2 million, which is also nearly R2 million less than the amount originally estimated. This decrease, however, results from delay in the delivery of equipment and not from a decreased need of funds for the financial year.</p>

<p>Particularly on account of more rapid escalation in the prices of equipment than was expected, we would in fact this year have needed about R4 million more than the amount budgeted for. The delay in the delivery of equipment entails, however, that expenditure of approximately R6 million has to be carried forward to next financial year.</p>

<p>For the Post Office an important financial development in this financial year was an outstanding net increase in the public&#x2019;s savings investments in the Post Office Savings Bank and National Savings Certificates. This followed the increase in the rates of interest and improvement of the facilities of the Post Office Savings Bank with effect from 1 August, and the issue of a new series of National Savings Certificates on 1 October last year.</p>

<p>Investments in these services have for years grown very slowly&#x2014;from 1 April 1966 to 31 March 1974 the net increase was only R10 million. The increase in this financial year, however, is estimated to amount to R55 million.</p>

<p>As the Post Office Savings Bank and National Savings Certificates were taken over for its own account by the Post Office on 1 April last year, the additional funds which the public now invests in these services are available for investment in the Post Office itself. The full amount of the increase is therefore being applied to capital expenditure.</p>

<p>It is perhaps as well that I remind hon. members at this stage that the stocks in which Savings Bank and National Savings Certificate moneys were invested by the Treasury in years prior to the transfer of these services to the Post Office, were transferred to the Post Office together with the services. These stocks, to a total purchase value of R262 million, have been retained untouched. A number of the stocks expire every year or two from this year until 1996.</p>

<p>It is the intention&#x2014;depending on circumstances obtaining from time to time&#x2014;to cash the stocks only as they expire and to apply the funds invested in them gradually to capital expenditure in this manner. The <span class="col_2819-2820" refersTo="page_1425"/>first expiry of stock to a substantial amount will only take place in 1978. In the normal course of things the stocks will, therefore, for many years constitute valuable reserves financing for the Post Office.</p>

<p>I must also again point out that the use of Savings Bank and National Savings Certificate moneys for capital expenditure does not involve anything new or unsound. This is the purpose for which funds invested in Government stock have always been used, and it does not affect the security of the public&#x2019;s investments. As I have said before in this House, investments in the Post Office Savings Bank and National Savings Certificates are still investments with the State, which are certainly among the soundest that exist.</p>

<p>We originally budgeted for financing capital expenditure during this financial year from, <i>inter alia,</i> a Treasury loan of R58 million and new foreign loans of R20 million.</p>

<p>When I submitted my Budget last year, it was quite impossible to predict what increase in the savings service investments would flow from the increases in the interest rates and the other improvements in the services; to be on the safe side, no provision was made at that time for additional loan funds from these sources.</p>

<p>The use of the additional funds from the savings services now enables us to take up only R20 million of the R58 million Treasury loan this financial year, and to do without the foreign loans originally contemplated.</p>

<p>The loans being taken up are being limited to a total which will leave an estimated amount of R6,7 million as a shortage, with which we are closing the financial year. This shortage is being carried forward to next financial year, and is in the meantime being financed from floating funds at the disposal of the Post Office.</p>

<p><i>The 1975-76 financial year</i></p>

<p>For next financial year we are estimating operating expenditure at R482,6 million and capital expenditure at R213 million, that is to say, a total expenditure of R695,6 million. This is R98,l million, or 16,4%, more than the total expenditure for the present financial year.</p>

<p>We expect to earn R530,1 million in revenue which is an increase of R82,8 million, or 18,5%, above that for the present financial year.</p>

<p><i>Tariffs</i></p>

<p>The steep rise in the estimated expenditure necessitates the introduction, with effect from 1 April, of the tariff increases which I have already announced.</p>

<p>Two years ago, with effect from 1 May 1973, a few tariff increases were introduced on a selective basis. Although we were able to avoid tariff increases last year, costs and inflation have increased to such an extent since 1973, that the Post Office has no alternative but to increase tariffs in 1975-&#x2019;76.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the tariff increases will yield additional revenue of approximately R37,5 million during the financial year, amounting to roughly 7,6% of the revenue that we would otherwise have received. This additional revenue is included in the estimated revenue figure of R530,1 million which I have mentioned.</p>

<p>I should explain at this point that the tariff increases had to be announced earlier because, in response to representations by them, organized commerce and industry have been given an undertaking that they will be informed of general tariff increases as long as possible in advance. They require sufficient time to arrange their affairs accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Financing of expenditure</i></p>

<p>For financing our total expenditure of R695,6 million, we shall have available&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) the estimated revenue of R530,1 million;</li>

<li>(ii) a provision of R64,7 million which, is made in our operating expenditure for depreciation and higher replacement costs of capital assets;</li>

<li>(iii) a Treasury loan of R40 million and other loan facilities of R13 million that have already been arranged;</li>

<li>(iv) loan funds of R30 million that are expected to be made available from the Post Office Savings Bank and National Savings Certificates; and</li>

<li>(v) new foreign loans of R11,5 million that we are contemplating at this stage.</li>

</ol>

<p>The total of these amounts falls R6,3 million short of the expenditure. This remaining requirement, together with the shortage of R6,7 million carried forward from <span class="col_2821-2822" refersTo="page_1426"/>the previous financial year, will leave a total shortage of R13 million to be carried forward to 1976-&#x2019;77.</p>

<p><i>Loan financing</i></p>

<p>As hon. members may recall, the Franzsen Committee on Post Office Financing recommended in 1972 that the Post Office should aim at achieving a position where the proportion of its capital requirements constituted by borrowed funds (i.e. loans from the Treasury and from all other sources) is approximately 50%.</p>

<p>For the past few years already, the Post Office&#x2019;s approach has been to purposely borrow less each financial year than the amount which would, in addition to the amounts available from operating, be required in that financial year to fully finance the capital expenditure for the financial year. In that way a planned shortage is each year carried forward to the next financial year.</p>

<p>These planned shortages are not deficits on operating&#x2014;the Post Office continues to show a sound operating surplus each year. What they amount to is simply the utilization of floating funds that are available to the Post Office as operating capital, since, needless to say, this is more economical than raising money on loan.</p>

<p>It remains the position, however, that the use of such funds takes the place of additional loans that would otherwise have had to be negotiated for capital expenditure. I consider, therefore, that for a realistic application of the proportion of loan financing recommended by the Franzsen Committee, it is necessary for the purpose of calculating that proportion to take such funds into account.</p>

<p>As that amount by which loan funds fall short of the amount that would have been needed to balance our books at the end of a financial year is, in fact, borrowed, we must, in my opinion, each financial year count it as loan funds for the purpose of calculating the proportion of loan financing.</p>

<p>For next financial year we would, in addition to the funds from operating and the loan funds of which I have given particulars, require loan funds of R13 million to balance our books at the end of the financial year.</p>

<p>Calculated on this basis, our loan financing in next financial year will come to 50,47% of our capita] expenditure.</p>

<p><i>Form of estimates</i></p>

<p>Pursuant to my earlier reference to the integrated and computerized management information and accounting system on which we are working, I should just like to mention here that the Post Office is also giving attention to the introduction of a unitary budget and target budgeting. I shall on a later occasion report to the House on the matter.</p>

<p>I should like to conclude by expressing to the Management and staff of the Post Office my appreciation of their devoted services during the past financial year.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by associating myself with the words of appreciation expressed by the hon. the Minister in respect of the Postmaster-General and the staff of the Post Office. We on this side of the House fully agree with those words of appreciation and we shall say more about this in the course of the debate.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The word &#x201C;welcome&#x201D; would be totally inadequate to express the feeling of South Africa when it hears of the announcement of a new telephone system for South Africa which was made this afternoon. I feel rather like the farmer who sees the top soil blowing away after the worst drought in history but sees a little rain cloud on the far horizon. The announcement of the Minister this afternoon is like that rain cloud which may bring relief to a telephone-parched South Africa which has laboured under the tremendous disadvantages which we have gone through in recent times. If a crisis was needed on the Witwatersrand, for instance, where some 30 000 or 40 000 telephones were out of order because of bad weather and where telephones were out of order for three or four weeks at a time in some areas, then at least we now have a decision which was so desperately needed, viz. to embark on a new system for the future. It does net deal with the backlog of 96 000 people who are waiting for telephones nor with the 2 600 telephone technicians <span class="col_2823-2824" refersTo="page_1427"/>who are needed by the Post Office. Neither does it deal with the fact that while one-third of the world&#x2019;s telephones are estimated to be of the old Strowger system&#x2014; the two-step system and the system we have here&#x2014;and while another half is believed to have gone over to the cross-bar system, South Africa chose to go with the minority, the other one-sixth of the world, in the system which we have lately installed. I hope that the hesitancy which appears in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech where he says that this system is not necessarily the best, is not an indication of any doubt whether there may be a repetition of the mistake of 15 years ago when we decided to standardize against the stream of the whole world which move over to cross-bar switching and left only South Africa&#x2014;apart from those who could not afford to change&#x2014;to follow a different route. I hope that the system which has now been selected will be one which will give South Africa a good telephone system. Let me warn, however, that it is not going to happen tomorrow. We are not even going to start on the electronic system for another four or five years. The hon. the Minister did not mention that the CP24 which will start to operate next year is not an electronically controlled system. It is only the CP44 system which is the electronic one. A start will not be made with the installation of the new electronic type till a number of years hence and therefore it is going to be a long time before we have any results from the electronic system.</p>

<p>I want to make only one more point now, a point which must be made now. This Budget has shooed in quietly, so much so that it may pass unnoticed, an extra burden of R38 million on the users of the telephone and postal services of South Africa. It means an increase of nearly 8% which, by announcing it as arranged in advance, no longer comes as a blow. This Budget has another feature against which we want to protest at this early stage That is the question of asking the telephone user of today to carry the burden of developments for the future. In 1974 we took exception to the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s target of 50% from revenue&#x2014;I have the quotations here with which we shall deal later&#x2014;and in 1972 we lodged our objection as well. Now we find the Minister claiming that R13 million is included in loan funds when in fact it is not a loan. He is not paying any interest on it, and is pretending that he has balanced the financing of his capital so that 50% comes from loan funds and the rest from revenue. In actual fact he has not balanced his financing. The telephone user is paying R119 million of the R213 million capital budget while loan funds are accounting for only R94 million. R13 million of the amount to be paid is in fact neither current revenue, nor is it loan capital. Even if we exclude that amount, it still means that R106 million must come out of the pocket of the telephone user while only R94 million will come from loan funds. Therefore we dispute that the hon. the Minister is following either the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s recommendation or his own policy. Indeed, he has gone beyond his own policy. He is misleading the telephone user when he claims he is financing half his capital out of revenue and half out of loans. In the debate we shall show that even financing on a 50:50 basis places a totally unfair burden on the user of the telephone. We shall also show that it will result in ever escalating tariffs without the problem ever being solved.</p>

<p>In order to consider this Budget further and to be able to deal at greater length with the burden placed on the user of the telephone, I move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill, now before us for the Third Reading, has remained unamended during the previous stages of the Bill as they were discussed in this House. The Bill retains the provisions of clause 2 to which we objected both at the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage. The retention of this clause makes the Bill unacceptable to us at <span class="col_2825-2826" refersTo="page_1428"/>this stage as well. The hon. the Minister and the Government have lost a golden opportunity to delegate meaningful authority to the Coloured Representative Council and the S.A. Indian Council in this measure and to recognize the factual position of the diversity of interests and desires in the various parts of the Republic. The Government has lost the opportunity of releasing to some extent the stranglehold of the Group Areas Act. This stranglehold not only applies to where we may live and with whom we may associate, but also to where individuals may trade. When I speak of &#x201C;individuals&#x201D; I speak of individuals of all races, all the separate communities which together constitute our South African nation. What necessitated this amending Bill? In terms of the Licences Act of 1962 trade licensing powers were vested in the Central Government. As has emerged during the discussion of this Bill, the Commission of Inquiry into Trade Licensing appointed in 1964 recommended that licensing powers should be decentralized to the provinces. That has been done. The provinces have their own ordinances. The hon. the Minister concedes that those ordinances are not uniform. It is understandable that that should be so, because each province has its own approach and its own problems to deal with. Each province has adopted ordinances that are applicable and appropriate to the diverse circumstances and local attitude in each of the provinces. Therefore each province should in so far as trade licensing is concerned be at liberty to do its own thing in its own way. However, this attitude and approach is not acceptable to this Government. They conflict with its political philosophy. Therefore, the hon. the Minister has come forward with this measure which we now have before us, the effect of which is to reimpose his discretion in regard to this now diversified control of licensing in regard to when permits should or should not be granted for trade purposes to persons who are disqualified to own or occupy property in proclaimed group areas. In this measure he ignores the provincial councils, the local authorities, the Coloured Representative Council and the Indian Council. There is not even an obligation on his part to consult them. This attitude makes a mockery of any professed intention of extending the powers of these bodies. Surely the decision to permit trade across the confines of the Group Areas Act should take into consideration the wishes of the relevant province or the relevant council or the relevant local authority? By introducing this measure, I believe that the hon. the Minister and the Government have lost an opportunity of delegating the power to grant permits in terms of the Group Areas Act for the purposes of trade licences, in White group areas, to the administrators of the provinces, in the case of Coloured group areas to the CRC and, in the case of the Indian group areas, to the Indian Council. If he had done this&#x2014; and he has the power to do so under the Community Development Act; he has the power to delegate to officials the authority to issue permits&#x2014;and placed the matter squarely in the hands of the administrators in the case of White group areas, the Chairman of the CRC in respect of Coloured group areas and the Chairman of the Indian Council in respect of Indian group areas, he would have been acting in the spirit of the statements that have been made by the hon. the Prime Minister &#x2014;that he is seeking out the commissions and bodies to which representatives of the various communities should be appointed. The hon. the Minister and the Government have lost that opportunity by persisting with the measure as it is. No recognition is given to those people in those councils. Had he done what I have suggested, he would have indicated direction and the necessary adaptation; he would have indicated confidence in the various legislative and administrative bodies that are part of the government of this country. The reason for his failure to do so is obvious. The hon. the Minister wishes to retain and will retain under this Bill the discretionary power in his own hands. He indicated that he wanted that discretionary power so as to enforce uniformity. He wanted to use licensing as a lever to implement the compulsory aspects of the Group Areas Act and to compel the resettlement of traders no matter the extent of their vested interests and no matter the practical or adverse effect of this upon individuals.</p>

<p>This Bill before us is, therefore, not one that we can support. So we shall oppose the Third Reading.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have already in dealing with the Second Reading of this Bill, gone over very thoroughly the field which the hon. member for Green Point has now covered once again. There <span class="col_2827-2828" refersTo="page_1429"/>are perhaps just a few points which I should stress again. My department is not requesting new powers in terms of this Bill. The few bodies that are being brought in as a result of these unavoidable circumstances that have arisen, are not being brought in because my department so wishes. It is due to the circumstances prevailing. What is more, it is the recommendation of that commission which the hon. member for Green Point invoked that it should be seen to that the provisions of the Act be carried out in the proper way once again. This is being done here; we are carrying out the recommendations of that commission. The provinces are free to decide which specific licences will be necessary; they have done this, and they have done so in various ways. My department, too, has a responsibility in this regard. It cannot simply delegate its powers. It has a responsibility towards every licence-holder as a disqualified person in a group area. The day he is resettled, my department has to provide resettlement opportunities for him. We even have to go so far as to give him the same surface area. We even have to go so far as to subsidize his rent, as we are in fact doing in virtually all cases to enable them to become properly resettled. My department has that responsibility. The hon. member is creating the impression that this is simply an everyday matter. In the case of first allocations it is, in the first place, in respect of a small number of trades that could be practised and that are not covered by the original Act.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill which has now come through to its <span class="col_2829-2830" refersTo="page_1430"/>Third Reading stage with two amendments having been accepted by the hon. the Minister in the Committee Stage, contains provisions which will deter landlords from harassing tenants by interfering with their peaceful enjoyment of their rights of tenancy. While this is welcomed&#x2014;in fact some of the provisions of the Bill have been improved by amendments during the Committee Stage while certain further amendments are to be considered by the hon. the Minister in the Other Place&#x2014;I believe that the proposed readjustment of the basis of determining rental is of such a drastic nature that it must outweigh those considerations which I have said are welcomed. We must realize that these changes in the determination of rental will drastically affect those thousands of tenants who are of necessity obliged to seek accommodation in rent-controlled premises.</p>

<p>The Bill as it is before us, will satisfy neither the landlord nor the tenant. It is as it were an interim measure linking rentals to escalating building costs and then imposing the burden of those escalating building costs on tenants. Above all the hon. the Minister has in this measure not done what one would have expected him to do, namely to try and find some way in which the tenant will not be loaded with this excessive burden. Although there have been suggestions in the Committee Stage on clause I as to how that could be done and how we could meet the problem, the hon. the Minister has not seen his way clear to accept those amendments. This is an extraordinary situation that that should have been the attitude of the hon. the Minister, because one wonders if he has really appreciated what this Bill will do as far as housing is concerned. While we have been debating this matter, we have had a report from the Department of Statistics which indicates that the number of new houses and flats which were planned in January this year, was the lowest for that month for the past five years. At the same time the strange position is that, and I quote from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In contrast to the lower building plans for houses, the figures for non-residential projects have reached a new record for the end of January.</block>

<p>That is the situation. We must view this measure and with this additional load of rental, we must view it as to where the burden is to fall if this measure goes through in the form in which it is now before us. We have suggested to the hon. the Minister, but he has rejected it, that he could deal with this problem of the conflicting entitlement of landlords and tenants by using a method of tax incentives, not only to encourage buildings, but also to provide an added reasonable return to the owner of controlled dwellings. By that he could obviate them loading a further burden of increased rentals on the tenants, e.g. by allowing the landlord a better return through some tax incentives. The hon. the Minister, however, says that it does not really matter as the burden can be carried, that there is no need to worry as most of the people who are living in rent-controlled premises are wealthy. That is a fallacious argument and I want to &#x2026;</p>

<p>I do not want to waste the time of the House with a lot of detail, but according to the last figures available, there were at the end of 1973 only 16 590 persons accommodated in old-age homes, State homes and in subsidized homes. At the same time the total number of White social pensioners, namely old-age pensioners, war veterans and disability pensioners, was 156 000. Many of them must somehow subsist in rent-controlled premises, either in homes or several of them in one flat, etc. If that is so, how can we now pass a Bill of this nature which must result in increased rentals far beyond the increase in the incomes of these pensioners? One knows that planning takes place to try to provide for these people, but housing for these people is not going to be supplied within a very short time. The hon. the Minister knows that in my own constituency there is the Green and Sea Point old-age home scheme, <span class="col_2831-2832" refersTo="page_1431"/>which has been on the stocks for years. The building of this home is to be commenced towards the end of this year. According to the last information given to me by the hon. the Minister the premises which are to be demolished to make place for this old-age home, will be vacated in September this year. But in the meantime the people who will not be able to move into that home must be protected so that they will not have this unnecessary burden placed upon them.</p>

<p>I believe that this new basis of valuation will place a burden on these people which they cannot possibly carry. It is no good enacting provisions, the remaining 20 clauses of this Bill, to protect tenants from harassment and from improper actions by landlords if the tenants, because of the increase in rent, are in any case not going to be able to afford to stay in those premises. This is going to happen in a vast number of cases. This Bill has much to commend it, but those portions of it which are commendable are completely outweighed by the Minister&#x2019;s insistence on pursuing and going through with this new method of determining the valuation for rental purposes.</p>

<p>One feels that the hon. the Minister has attempted to sugar the pill&#x2014;I am referring to clause 1 of the Bill&#x2014;by wrapping around it all these other acceptable 20 clauses so that one will decide that it is worthwhile and that the Bill should be accepted. But the core of that pill is still far too bitter to be swallowed. I think it is necessary to reinterate that I do not think there is anybody in this House who would not like to see rent control go, but rent control cannot go while there is this continuing imbalance between supply and demand in so far as housing is concerned. The task of rent legislation, a task which is not tackled in this Bill, is to see that there is an equitable return for the landlord, but not to load the whole burden on the tenants, when there are extraneous factors such as inflationary building costs. At the same time one has to see to it that the rentals are reasonable although landlords cannot be expected to carry the whole burden of an indirect subsidy of tenants who are in controlled premises. That is why we have asked during this debate that the hon. the Minister should show some realism in dealing with this problem of supply and demand, to bring some new thinking to bear, instead of merely working on different formulae in determining rentals. We feel that he should bring in other factors to help him solve these problems, which will continue to exist as long as there is this imbalance. Because this Bill does not do that and because the core of the pill we are asked to swallow is far too bitter and will certainly not be something which will be welcomed by tenants, and because it does little to solve the problems of meeting the requirements of both landlord and tenant, we will oppose the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the legislation we are dealing with here, the legislation amending the Rents Act, is recognized by all parties as one of the most difficult types of legislation to deal with because it concerns problems that affect individuals. On the one hand, it affects the interests of investors in immovable property, and on the other, the interests of lessees dwelling in those buildings. I believe that this is among the most difficult types of legislation to formulate in such a way as to satisfy all parties. In my opinion, in his reply to the Second Reading debate the hon. the Minister stressed this very point. He said that it was virtually impossible to satisfy all interested parties by means of legislation of this kind. This situation to which I refer arises out of the conflict between the interests of the lessee and those of the lessor, a conflict that has come to the fore in various Acts through the years. Historically, we know that the rent control legislation came into operation shortly after the First World War. During that period there was a shortage of accommodation, and the ordinary law of supply and demand pushed up the rent for flats. War measures were implemented and eventually legislation was passed, the Tenants Protection (Temporary) Act (1920). That concept &#x201C;temporary&#x201D;, which was included in the name of the Bill at the lime, has become rather permanent because ever since then we have been struggling with the formulas necessary to strike a proper balance between the interests of both the lessee and the lessor. During the Second World War and subsequently, the process of industrialization took place, the migration to the cities and this aggravated the housing crisis even further. We then had to pass additional legislation. The existing Act is, in point of fact, basically an Act passed in 1950 and subsequently altered from time to time to adapt to circumstances as the Government concerned saw fit. Let us be clear about this. The Government cannot adopt the stand-point <span class="col_2833-2834" refersTo="page_1432"/>that it has to protect the interests of the lessee as against those of the lessor or <i>vice versa.</i> The Government has to find a formula that strikes a balance between the claims of both groups. The legislation we are dealing with today is, in my opinion, an effort to strike such a balance between a lessee and lessor. It is easy for members of the Opposition, who do not carry the responsibility of government, to level criticism from one side or another. As an example of this, in the Second Reading debate the hon. member for Durban Point championed the standpoint of the lessee here, while the hon. member for Walmer brought up the standpoint of the lessor. In fact, therefore, in dealing with this legislation they were running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. It is very easy for the Opposition to level criticism at this legislation. It is far more difficult for a governing party, carrying the responsibility for the implementation of the legislation, to find the formulas which, on the one hand, strike the balance to which I have referred, and at the same time state the matter so clearly and lucidly that the legislation may be implemented by those bodies to which its implementation is entrusted and by any person who wishes to make investments in this field. I might just refer in passing to the totally different situation prevailing in Germany today. I read somewhere last week that in Germany, between 200 000 and 300 000 flats are standing empty. They are now appealing to the Government to subsidize those flats. There the situation is just the opposite, viz. the lessor and not the lessee is requesting protection. According to what I read, the German government has turned down that idea. The aim of this legislation is, then, to arrive at a compromise between lessor and lessee. For the lessor, the return must always be sufficient to make the investment worthwhile, while for the lessee the rent must be attractive enough in relation to his income.</p>

<p>We know that rent control is limited to certain buildings. Therefore it does not affect all buildings where accommodation is rented. This legislation is only applicable&#x2014; as far as the striking of a balance between lessee and lessor in regard to a specific series of buildings is concerned&#x2014;chiefly to those buildings constructed before May 1966. There are certain other buildings that have subsequently been placed under rent control, but this was done by way of special application. Consequently, the argument advanced by the hon. member for Green Point really falls a little flat as far as these aspects are concerned. Buildings that are being constructed now to provide accommodation may be constructed under existing circumstances, i.e. any rent may be asked for them. Therefore, the incentive to construct buildings and obtain a good rent, exists. There is no restriction on any entrepreneur to construct a building and obtain a paying rent for the dwelling units in a specific building. What this legislation envisages is to afford those who invested in blocks of flats or dwellings before 1966 a reasonable return on their money. If this were not done, it would mean that those who had invested in a building in respect of which the rent was limited in terms of outdated formulas, would not really get the same return on their investment as those who had, for example, invested in industry or in the stock exchange&#x2014;not even the same as those who had invested their money in a bank or other financial institution and earned interest on their money.</p>

<p>The aim of this legislation is, therefore, to accommodate those people to a certain extent. This is one side of the picture. The other side of the picture is, of course, that the excessively high interest rates on mortgages on rent-controlled buildings are being removed and that this will afford the lessor a certain degree of relief. There are, largely, the two legs on which this legislation stands. On the one hand, the person who invested his money in a dwelling construction project 10, 15 or even 20 years ago is being afforded the opportunity to get a return on his money, in view of the fact that we are faced with a rate of inflation in our economy. On the other hand, the lessee is being protected in that the excessively high interest rates that are being charged on mortgages can now no longer count against him. In my opinion the step taken by the Government here is entirely in accordance with the concept of balance between lessor and lessee.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with the hon. member for Green Point when he states that we are going to impose an excessive burden on lessees by means of this specific legislation. May I point out that apart from this legislation, which in itself is of a social nature and will therefore have a social effect, the State, for its part, will also make a major contribution as far as the provision of subsidized housing is concerned. Here I am not referring only to the houses that are being constructed by the National Housing <span class="col_2835-2836" refersTo="page_1433"/>Commission or the housing schemes of municipalities or other bodies. I think that we can refer with pride to the good record of the Government in regard to the provision of funds for old-age homes throughout the country as well. Here in the Boland there is hardly a town that does not already have an old-age home that has been or is being constructed from funds made available for this purpose by the Government. The Government is aware of the needs of our elderly people and pensioners. I believe that the Government is doing its part in this regard by providing funds for the construction of old-age homes. The hon. member for Green Point, who is also a lawyer, knows that the valuation in terms of building costs is not the only factor to be taken into account. The Rent Board is and independent and semi-judicial body, and when the Rent Board sits, therefore, it is expected of it to utilize, <i>inter alia,</i> one or more of the prescribed factors. One of the factors is the calculation of the building costs by the quantity surveyor, less depreciation. Other factors are the municipal and divisional council valuations and a sworn building society valuation. The purpose for which the premises or land is used must also be taken into account. Another important factor is the rent value of controlled premises of a similar class, nature or situation in the area. This is a factor that usually leads to a tempering valuation being placed on buildings.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>But it is now uncontrolled.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pienaar">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>The determination of the value is done for the purposes of rent control. It has nothing to do with new buildings that have just been constructed and are not controlled. It deals specifically with buildings under rent control. All those factors I have mentioned, must be taken into account. The Rent Board is not obliged to take a single factor into account to the exclusion of everything else, whether it be the municipal valuation, the sworn valuation of a building society or the quantity surveyor&#x2019;s calculation of what the cost of construction would be under existing circumstances. They are not bound to that; they need only take all or any of these factors into account and then reach a fair decision. My experience of Rent Boards is that it is far from always that they pass judgments that satisfy the lessor, precisely because they maintain a balance in these matters by taking into account the rents determined for other similar premises in their vicinity.</p>

<p>If we take all this into account, I think that the hon. the Minister has a balanced piece of legislation here, legislation that tries to make concessions on both sides and tries to eliminate existing areas of friction. I do not want to say that this is going to be the last word as far as rent control is concerned. This kind of legislation has to be adjusted from time to time, depending on prevailing circumstances. I believe that after a year or two we shall possibly have to adjust clauses such as clause 1 again, As hon. members know, the principle in accordance with which a Rent Board must act is that it must determine the value in terms of these factors I have mentioned, factors that all have a certain effect on each other, and then to work out a kind of average. For the rest it is merely a calculation. This, too, is what was stipulated in the Youngelson Case that has already been quoted in the debate on this piece of legislation in the House. I believe, therefore, that what we have here is a balanced piece of legislation. We should do well to let it go through In my opinion, because its implementation will be placed in the hands of experienced people on the Rent Boards and the Rent Control Board, it is very probable that they will reach fair decisions. In conclusion, may I just remark that if fair decisions are not reached or if the provision of this legislation are not properly implemented by the Rent Boards and the Rent Control Board, there is still, as a last resort, the Supreme Court, to which one can go on review, and this is something that has been done on a number of occasions in the past with far-reaching consequences for the interpretation of this specific Act I believe that all the necessary safety measures have been incorporated and that what we have here, therefore, is a balanced piece of legislation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Government is not doing it and that is why this Bill is here before us. The Government is imposing certain statutory restrictions and for the rest it is passing the buck. It is not itself accepting financial responsibility for bridging the gap between a rental which a tenant can pay and the reasonable return which an owner can expect on his building. It has a negative approach and is indulging in negative tactics. That is why it has introduced this measure. That is also why this measure is not going to assist materially in the provision of more accommodation. As the hon. member for Green Point indicated, the problem is the provision of adequate accommodation. If there was a reasonable balance between supply and demand one would not require restrictive legislation of this nature. It is because the Government fails to give inducements, to provide incentives that one has this imbalance. This causes the Government to rely simply on restrictive legislation. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I think he has been very reasonable in many of his decisions and attitudes in regard to the application of the Rents Act. Many hon. members have borne witness of this during the course of the debate on this Bill.</p>

<p>Frankly, I was disappointed in the hon. the Minister and the attitude he adopted during the debate on the various stages of this measure. I would have thought that he would have come to this House and made use of the occasion to announce a new deal for tenants and landlords, some really positive change in the Rents Act that would have got him away from the 27-year-old dilemma and the agony which the hon. member for Bellville apparently has to endure.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the hon. the Minister can still try before this debate is over to indicate a positive approach. The hon. the Minister must just indicate to this House that the Government has in mind accepting financial responsibility for bridging the gap between what the tenant can pay and what the landlord should reasonably receive on his investment. Until the hon. the Minister gives that indication he will continue to find himself in that dilemma and have continually to introduce amending legislation to try to patch up a situation in a way which never really overcomes the problem.</p>

<p>The amending Bill that is before us deals with three major areas relating to rent control. The first is in regard to the factors relating to the amount of the reasonable rental to be determined by the Rent Board; secondly, there is the prevention of the harassment of tenants by unscrupulous landlords; and thirdly, there is the granting of permission to the hon. the Minister to make conditions under which he may determine the decontrol of buildings which are at present under rent control. I want briefly to discuss the impact of this measure, should it be passed, under these three headings.</p>

<p>First of all, there is the question of the adjustment of reasonable rental which has been adjusted both, in relation to the adjustment of percentages and the adjustment of the basic value to which these percentages have been applied. I want to put this question to the hon. the Minister: Has he in advance determined the effect of this? Can he tell us whether as a result of this Bill which he has introduced into this House rentals are going to increase or decrease?</p>

<p>What is the percentage? Does the hon. the Minister believe that there should be a 20% increase? Would he accept that as reasonable? [Interjections.] No, Mr. Speaker, the Minister has dealt with it in generalities, but he has not indicated what his assessment is of the impact of this measure should it be passed. I want to give the hon. the Minister a couple of illustrations of the effect that it can and is going to have in a considerable number of blocks of flats, especially older blocks of flats which were built well before 1966. Sir, in a block of flats on which, there is no mortgage bond&#x2014;and there are many older blocks of flats where this applies&#x2014;the total impact of the increases of &#x00BD;% in the interest rate, &#x00BD; on depreciation and maintenance and 2&#x00BD;% on the value of the land will be, as I think the Minister will agree, to push up the rental by 27%. That we can agree on; it is purely a question of arithmetic. Does the hon. the Minister believe that that is a reasonable increase to introduce into rentals for older buildings at this time? I hope the hon. the Minister will deal with this when he replies to the debate. I raise this because he is aware that in my constituency, where there are large numbers of older buildings, there was a rental increase last year of 38%, to which could well be added a further increase of 27%. I think the hon. the Minister should tell us whether he believes that that is reasonable and whether it is the Government&#x2019;s attitude that an increase of 38% plus 27% is the kind of rental increase which pensioners and others should endure. The Minister should not have come to this House with percentages and an assessment of basic values unless he could determine in advance what impact this would have on rentals. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, the impact of increased percentages is in fact going to be greatest where the buildings are older and where the replacement value less depreciation is relatively low in relation to the value of the land. In old buildings where the replacement value less depreciation is relatively small in relation to the value of the land, the increase in rental is going to be greatest, and the increase in rental is going to be smallest where the buildings are relatively new, where they were built just prior to 1966 and where the replacement value of those buildings is relatively high in relation to the value of the land. The impact of this new formula of the Minister&#x2019;s is going to load very, very severely the rentals in very old blocks of flats and it is not going to load nearly as severely the rentals in comparatively new blocks of flats. When one looks at the kind of people who occupy these two categories of flats, one will find that the older blocks of flats are generally occupied by the older people, by the pensioners, by people living on fixed incomes, and they are going to be the people who will be hardest hit by this. I want to show this to the hon. the Minister in terms of one or two figures. Let us take three examples, one of which, I gave during the course of the Committee Stage, where the value of the land constitutes 50% of the total value and the value of the building constitutes 50%. The total impact of the percentage increases in those circumstances will be 27,2%. Sir, if one takes a relatively new building, where the value of the building is 75% and the value of the land is only 25% of the total, in other words, where the proportion is three to one, then the impact of these increased percentages is going to be a rental increase of 19,4%, so, in the case of a relatively new building it will be 19,4%. But if one takes a very old building where the value of the building is only 25% and the value of the land is 75% of the total value&#x2014;and there are dozens of examples of this in the Cape Town area; there are dozens of examples in the Green Point and Sea Point constituencies&#x2014;the combined impact of these percentages will be a rental increase of 34,6%.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about older blocks of flats which are not mortgaged. There are very many of the older blocks on which there are no mortgage bonds. The hon. member must be very careful. This is the total impact of these percentage increases. In the case of the relatively new blocks of flats, there is going to be a very small increase in the rentals, but in the older blocks of flats, especially in the city areas where land values are high., there is going to be a dramatic increase in rentals. This is what is going to happen. The greatest impact is going to be on old blocks which are generally occupied by retired people with relatively low incomes who live on fixed incomes without the advantage of cost-of-living adjustments, and it will also apply particularly in areas where land values are high. Those are the two areas which are going to be badly hit, and the combination of these could, I believe, <span class="col_2841-2842" refersTo="page_1436"/>have a crippling effect on the lives of many old and retired people living in the densely populated areas of the cities of South Africa. I would be pleased if the hon. the Minister could produce figures this afternoon which would refute this. I think it would set at rest the uneasy minds of many, many thousands of older people living in these older blocks, retired people, who see that this is going to have a crippling effect on their standard of living and indeed on their mode of living. I hope the hon. the Minister, if he cannot give us figures to refute this, will say that he believes that the Rent Boards should use their discretionary powers to the utmost to protect the older tenants from this onslaught which is going to be made on their meagre living standards at the moment; and, further, that the Minister will give this House, before the Bill is put to the vote at Third Reading, the assurance that he will keep the effect of this Bill under constant review and that if our figures are correct, and this has the impact that we believe it will have, he will come back to this House and see that there is an adjustment made at the earliest possible opportunity. I do not believe that the older people living in constituencies like Sea Point can accept an increase of 38% last year and a further increase of something up to 34,6% should this Bill be enacted.</p>

<p>Secondly, in determining reasonable rental, the Minister simply locks this into the building cost index. He simply says that as the building cost index rises, so the rentals of people in rent-controlled flats will rise. That is the effect of saying that the dominant factor must be the replacement value less depreciation. As the building cost index rises, so the rentals must rise. As I pointed out earlier, largely because of the Government&#x2019;s labour policy, the building cost index is rising faster than the cost-of-living index. The locking of rentals into this index is going to have an inflationary impact which will be felt particularly by the poorer and older people living in the urban areas.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>He is not saying that, so he agrees that there will be a further increase. What is happening is that the Minister now says that perhaps the biggest single component of household expenditure, which is rental, is now automatically going to be locked into the building cost index, which is moving ahead faster than the cost-of-living index. This is going to be highly inflationary. In fact, it is geared to inflation. There is no incentive whatsoever under this new system on the part of the building owner to try to retard the rate of increase in rentals. Nor has the hon. the Minister indicated any relief which he is prepared to give to people in the lower income groups when they are caught up in the new cost-of-living spiral which he is proposing in this measure. He must tell us what he intends to do. Is he just going to sit back and see these older people suffer, or is he going to accept the responsibility which this Government should accept and that is bridging the gap between what these people can afford to pay and a reasonable return on the investment of the building public?</p>

<p>Much of what has been said in this debate has concerned the plight, understandably so, of people in the lower-income groups, older people, pensioners and others. But it is undoubtedly a fact that certain owners are going to be hit by the reverse gearing of interest rates, where the interest rates on bonds are at the moment higher than the 8&#x00BD;% which the hon. the Minister now proposes should be used in calculating a reasonable rental. I want to make it quite clear that we in these benches have no sympathy whatsoever for the unscrupulous landlord or building owner who manipulates the provisions of the Act in order to create a situation where he can pass on heavy interest charges to tenants who should be protected under rent control. But I am concerned about the significant number of <i>bona fide</i> investors, people in the private sector who are assisting the Government by providing the capital in order to provide housing for the people whom this Government is not prepared to <span class="col_2843-2844" refersTo="page_1437"/>assist in the provision of accommodation. I am concerned about <i>bona fide</i> investors of this kind who will be quite satisfied to accept a return of 8&#x00BD;% but who as the Minister knows, because of high interest rates on <i>bona fides</i> mortage bonds which they have been required to take out in order to construct such a building, will find that the return on their money is considerably reduced below the figure of 8&#x00BD;% which the hon. the Minister finds reasonable. Where there is a <i>bona fide</i> investment in property which has a social plus factor&#x2014;in other words, it is assisting in providing accommodation for certain categories of people&#x2014;and where accommodation is provided especially for people of the lower-income group, retired people, pensioners and others, I think it is unfair for the Government to penalize the owner of that building instead of accepting responsibility itself. I believe that the Government is being unfair, that it is evading its responsibility; it is passing on a partial solution of a severe social problem to private enterprise rather than accepting some responsibility itself. Equally it would be quite wrong under the circumstances of today to require a tenant to pay more than he can reasonably afford considering his total income.</p>

<p>Because there is a social problem, I come back to the point which we in these benches have made before. It is the responsibility of the Government to bridge the gap between the rental on the one hand and the return on the other. This Minister owes it to the House and to the public to say that the Government sees it in this way. He can carry on saying that we have a dilemma, but he must assure us that he is going to get rid of this dilemma and that the Government is going to accept responsibility.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>It is because of this that the Bill fails hopelessly. It fails to provide the protection, it fails to provide the return and it fails to provide the adequate accommodation which is necessary for these people in the cities. I say to the hon. the Minister that he should think positively. He should think in terms of providing more housing, more accommodation in the urban areas. He should think of positive incentives, financial and other incentives to encourage the private sector of the South African economy to provide this accommodation and to assist him with this problem. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, when he replies to this debate, to express the Government&#x2019;s attitude in positive terms instead of relying solely on the negative, restrictive provisions of legislation such as this.</p>

<p>The second area was the area of the harassment of tenants Undoubtedly the Bill has gone some way to stop the unscrumpulous, callous landlord from harassing tenants who otherwise would be able to enjoy the tenancy of accommodation in a peaceful and happy way. There have been improvements. Penal sanctions have been increased. The hon. the Minister has indicated that he will not be prepared to accept the amendments of the hon. member for Houghton that the penal sanction should involve a gaol sentence. I hope the hon. the Minister will keep this under very close observation&#x2014;he said that he would&#x2014; and that he will report to the House in a year&#x2019;s time to satisfy this House that he has not only kept it under observation, but that he is prepared to take the initiative himself if landlords are still trying to evade this provision of the Act.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton has moved that included in breaches of the law should be the refusal to accept payment. I hope that the hon. the Minister will look at this again as he said he would and perhaps introduce a provision to this effect in the Other Place. This practice is becoming rife and there are more and more instances of companies, for example, outside of Cape Town, who require payment by tenants resident in Cape Town to be made in Johannesburg. The tenant then finds that after sending three or four registered letters they come back not accepted. In circumstances like these court actions ensue. The tenant is then required to enter into legal proceedings in order to get the case withdrawn. It is expensive and is also a form of harassment. I have on file a number of cases of where this has taken place only recently in Cape Town. I think the hon. the Minister should also consider in the Other Place whether provision should not be made that the place at which the payment has to be made should be readily available to the tenant. Such a provision could state that it must be in the magisterial district, within the city limits, where a person takes up residence. But I think for landlords to purchase blocks of flats in one city and then require tenants <span class="col_2845-2846" refersTo="page_1438"/>once again to go through the expensive procedure of sending postal orders, cheques or registered letters and then suffering the uncertainty as to whether their letters have been received, is a form of harassment. I I think the hon. the Minister would do well to examine this matter before the measure goes to the Other Place.</p>

<p>The final point I want to mention is the question of introducing conditional decontrol. In this respect the hon. the Minister has gone some way towards giving us assurances. I hope he will state in unambiguous terms that when he feels that he has to go in for conditional decontrol, he will ensure that there is protection for the existing rights of existing tenants. I believe that many tenants are terrified merely at the introduction of this measure, because it is going to make the decontrol of blocks of fiats either totally or partially easier than it was before. It is for this very reason that I believe the hon. the Minister must give a public undertaking that one of the important factors which he will take into account in thinking about conditions for decontrolling is the tenancy of existing tenants and that a period should elapse prior to any of those people losing their rights to occupy those premises. I also want to warn the hon. the Minister to be careful, in applying decontrol differentially within one block of flats, that he does not create additional tensions not only between the tenants and the landlord but between certain categories of tenants and other categories of tenants. Nothing could be worse than within one block of flats to have two sets of procedures operating. One set of tenants may feel aggrieved because they do not have control over flats they have started purchasing due to rent control, while the other set of tenants are fighting for the continuation of rent control because they do not want to lose their right to occupy those premises. I know it would be easy for the hon. the Minister to say that we can make a variety of exceptions. They might seem reasonable on many grounds, but I think the hon. the Minister is aware that there are blocks of flats where there is a differential interest between one group of tenants and another. It is going to be a very bad social problem if within a block of flats you are going to have competing groups of tenants with different vested interests in either having rent control or getting rid of rent control.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to warn the Minister as well not to play into the hands of landlords who indicate that they can get partial decontrol of buildings and use this as a form of harassment of tenants in order to get them to either start paying or to purchase individual flats. He is aware that it is a practice to invite, suggest to or even to coerce tenants into starting to buy flats because there is going to be an application for decontrol. I hope that the hon. the Minister, when he becomes aware that in advance of decontrol the owner has persuaded or coerced tenants into purchasing their flats, will use this as a negative factor and that he will not allow the possibility of decontrol to be used to get people to purchase flats and then have the landlord come along and say that since a number of people have purchased flats, he would now like the block to be decontrolled.</p>

<p>This Bill does assist in preventing a certain amount of harassment and it does regularize aspects of decontrol. In the main, in respect of the provision of accommodation, in seeing that there is a fair return on the investor&#x2019;s money and at the same time that there is a reasonable rental which the tenant can pay, this Bill falls short of what is required. Perhaps it is not the fault of the Bill itself. Perhaps it is the fault of the Government, which is still wrestling with the dilemma with which it has been confronted already for the past 27 years, because it has been negative in its whole approach to this matter. The Government should have acknowledged this as a social problem and should have been prepared to solve it as such and not, merely pass it on to the private sector.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Sea Point concluded with the issue of decontrol. I should like to add one thought for the hon. the Minister to consider. Very often when he receives applications for the decontrol of flats, they are found to come from so-called &#x201C;owners&#x201D; who are, in fact, not resident in those flats. Where a block of flats has been emptied of its legitimate tenants, such as some of those which have been emptied by South African Property Portfolio Managers, those flats are then sold, very often to absentee purchasers who buy them for holiday flats or for other purposes. An application is then submitted for decontrol of the building and it seems to be a simple and straightforward case. Here is a block <span class="col_2847-2848" refersTo="page_1439"/>of flats where there are no tenants left. There are only the owners who have bought their own flats, or mainly such &#x201C;owners&#x201D;. The fact is, however, that those owners are not living in the flats. They do not want decontrol for their own convenience. They want decontrol so that they can sub-let those flats as holiday flats at an uncontrolled price because once a building is decontrolled, its use is completely free of control. The flats can then be let for the purposes which, in some cases, were suggested as an inducement to have the flats bought. Let me mention Kangelani, which was before this Minister&#x2019;s time, that famours building which is now called Golden Sands. There the purpose in selling the flats was their subsequent use as holiday flats. The purchasers were told not to worry, they would be able to let the flats as holiday flats at R100 per week. That is how the original owners obtained the prices they did. The eventual outcome involves a long story which I shall not go into. Some of the tenants were saved in that building and are still resident to this day. The basis for decontrol on the grounds of sale should, however, be very carefully investigated to find out who, in fact, is living in the flats. It will often be found not to be the holders of the shares which allegedly &#x201C;sell&#x201D; the flats.</p>

<p>I do not want to repeat the arguments of the Second Reading or Committee Stage. I shall simply associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Green Point and the hon. member for Sea Point in regard to the replacement value, the increase in percentage and the effect this will have on rentals.</p>

<p>What I do wish to refer to is an attack which makes it necessary for me to restate the attitude of this side of the House. I have been attacked publicly in the Press by two landlords on the grounds that we accused landlords of being unscrupulous, that we are driving them out of business and that we are making vicious or unfounded attacks on them. These letters have been published in the Press and therefore I think they must be answered. It should have been unnecessary for me to say that when the hon. member for Green Point and I referred to unscrupulous practices, both of us made it very clear that we excluded the majority of landlords and were referring to a minority. In fact the hon. member for Houghton interjected: &#x201C;Yes, but they seem to control a lot of flats.&#x201D; I myself emphasized this was a minority and paid tribute to the genuine decent landlords, who did not take advantage of loopholes. I want to make it very clear that we are not attacking landlords in general but that we have in fact specifically named certain cases. I have named South African Property Portfolio Managers and can add a few others with whom I have had trouble from tenants, such as Mr. Thackeray of Leith Properties and Mr. Willers. My knowledge of this practice is confined to these three and two or three other instances in the whole of Durban. I agree that a firm like S.A.P.P.M. controls a large group of buildings and therefore affects a lot of tenants. But, I have said, I want to make it quite clear that my attitude and the attitude of the hon. member for Green Point specifically excluded landlords in general and referred only to specific cases.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is necessary that I should refer to the two attacks that have been published in the Press. The one attack was by a Mr. Youngleson who wrote a very strongly-worded letter in which he attacked me personally in that he accused me of being slanderous and unfair to landlords. I think it is fair to point out that this Mr. Youngleson was the effective owner of King&#x2019;s Hall where the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department did a very good job indeed, for which I am very grateful. As a result of the work of his department, the owners of this building, Mr. Youngleson&#x2019;s company, went or were taken to court. The case was taken on appeal and eventually it went to the Appellate Division where the view of the regional Rent Board was upheld. It is in the case of buildings such as these that the Bill which is before us will help to close the loopholes which are left. It involved forcing tenants to take meals, putting some furniture in the flats and saying that it was an &#x201C;accommodation establishment&#x201D; because bed and breakfast were being supplied. For that reason they maintained that the building was no longer a controlled building. If I could have back some of the hours I spent trying to assist tenants in that building, I would be a very happy person. Therefore I can understand that Mr. Youngleson may not be a great admirer or a great friend of mine.</p>

<p>The other is a more serious case. I have specifically been accused of giving false information and I have, therefore, to deal with it. A Mr. F. J. Mitrie said: &#x201C;We as the owners of the building mentioned (Ambassadors, <span class="col_2849-2850" refersTo="page_1440"/>which I mentioned in my speech) strongly object to this uninformed statement &#x2026;&#x201D; He went on to say: &#x201C;For the benefit of your readers (including Mr. Vause Raw, who incidentally is so ill-in-formed that we have serious doubts as to his reading ability) we wish to make known the true facts in the matter.&#x201D; Let us look at the &#x201C;facts.&#x201D; I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ambassador House or The Ambassadors, in Pine Street, was declared a slum and condemned. A demolition order was obtained by the Department of Community Development and served on the owners at that time.</block>

<p>He went on to say that it then stood derelict and vacant and then he explained how he, the great, noble developer, rescued it by saving it from demolition and then reconstructing it. What are the facts? I have been accused of giving wrong facts, but everyone of his facts is untrue. Ambassadors has never even been the subject of a hearing by the Slums Court and it has never been declared a slum. It has never even been considered as a slum, but Mr. Mitrie said that it was declared a slum, and that a demolition order was obtained from the Department of Community Development. The fact is that a company called Admir (Pty.) Ltd. applied for a demolition order on 14 April 1970. Then Mr. F. J. Mitrie of F. J. Mitrie (Pty.) Ltd., agents for Admir (Natal) (Pty.) Ltd., applied for that demolition order to be changed to a reconstruction order in April 1973. The application was received by the department on 10 July 1973. In other words, it is untrue that it was declared a slum; it is untrue that the department served a demolition order on the owners, and it is untrue that the department wanted the building demolished. It was as a result of the voluntary request of Mr. Metrie that the reconstruction permit was approved by the department after his application in July 1973. So there are three direct lies in the attempt to make out that I gave wrong information. Indeed, every single fact is completely accurate as I stated in this House. I raise this because the department is brought into disrepute by the allegation that it had the building declared a slum, that it demanded the demolition and that it was, therefore, responsible for the tenants being thrown out of that building. The contrary is true. The department gave every assistance to protect the tenants of that building. They helped to get alternative accommodation offered to the tenants and to give the tenants more time to find accommodation. Ultimately they agreed not to have the building demolished. I think it should go on record that not only did the department no act against the interests of the tenants, but it did everything in its power to help them. I think it is only fair that, when members of the public choose to attack members of Parliament for acting in the interests of the public and their constituents, the facts should be also stated loudly and clearly.</p>

<p>We have attacked what is wrong in this Bill. We have attacked the minority who victimize and maltreat tenants and we have sought to obtain protection for tenants as a whole. But because our recommendation and representations have not been accepted, we shall not be able to support the Third Reading.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not propose to take up much time of the hon. House on this particular issue. For various reasons I was unable to put a point of view during the first two stages when this measure was under discussion, and therefore I should like to do so now. Not only do I have a very great personal interest in the subject matter of this particular Bill, but I believe it is true to say that in my constituency probably 99,5% of the constituents live in rentcontrolled premises or, at least, in rented premises. As far as our general views on this piece of legislation are concerned, these have been expressed by various members on this side and I do not propose to refer to that at all. I want to deal with only one specific issue, and that is the issue that is really dealt with in clause 12, namely the harassment of tenants. More particularly, I want to deal with the intimidatory activities we have seen in the past. More than two years ago I thought it necessary to draw attention to this particular issue. I did so at the time by way of a special debate. What we have in this measure before us is, I would imagine, largely a result of the investigation which the hon. the Minister had conducted prior and subsequent to that event. I imagine that those findings have now been embodied in this particular piece of legislation. When I raised this matter more than two years ago, it was of interest to me to see the reaction there was. The hon. the <span class="col_2851-2852" refersTo="page_1441"/>Minister was certainly sympathetic and said he would look into it. He was in fact considering what amendments could be made to the Rents Act. Certain landlords attacked me viciously as well, obviously in the same way as they have attacked the hon. member for Durban Point. I wonder whether there should not be legislation to protect parliamentarians against this kind of unwarranted abuse from the outside. In my case the then chairman of the Property Owners&#x2019; Association put it as follows at a public discussion of this matter. He said that I had exercised my parliamentary privilege when I made gross reflections on landlords and although he had no parliamentary privilege he certainly had the privilege of fair comment on matters of public interest. He then discussed the special debate that I had initiated in this House and referred to me in the following way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Either Dr. Jacobs has no understanding of free economic processes or he does not believe in free enterprise or his logical faculties are so weakened that he thinks one product or service can be isolated from the economy, or perhaps he just has not had the time or the opportunity to study the matter properly and we should send him a copy of our memorandum.</block>

<p>That copy of their memorandum has just reached me after two years. Needless to say, I made no accusation at any time against landlords in general. Indeed, at the time I prefaced my remarks by saying this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think I should in all fairness say that all landlords are not guilty of the charges I am making here today. There are very many of them who are decent, honest citizens who see the provision of low-cost housing as a legitimate financial investment, whose treatment of tenants is kind and humane and who are rendering a useful service to our community.</block>

<p>I think it is most regrettable that some of the landlords who seem to me to be protesting too much, should attack members like the hon. member for Durban Point and myself when they have obviously not taken the trouble to look at our Hansards. Quite clearly they have no idea of what we in fact said.</p>

<p>As far as I was concerned the major charge at the time was levelled at a gentleman, Mr. Wainer, who operates mainly in the Johannesburg area. It was of interest to me to study his reaction. He took no notice of what we said. He in fact boasted that no one could really touch him; he was cocking a snook at the Government. He said that by raising the matter all that we were doing was playing politics. As far as I can see he then went on in precisely the same way as he had done before, and because he had been allowed to get away with this others followed suit and tried to do exactly what he had been doing.</p>

<p>The situation that this legislation is intended to cope with has not changed radically over the last two years as far as I can see. From certain landlords we still have the behaviour that smacks of racketeering of the worst kind and we still have wicked exploitation of people who cannot fend for themselves. I regret to say that we still have certain modern Shylocks in South Africa whose greed knows no end. The number of court cases that we have had has not been a deterrent at all. These people are playing with vast sums of money and they are not interested in normal provisions such as we have had in the past. There is amongst the public and people who are tenants, a feeling of absolute helplessness. I am only hoping that the new provisions which the Minister has embodied in this legislation will help us cope with the serious situation that has arisen. To illustrate the sort of helplessness that you get from people, I want to quote from one letter. This gentleman who wrote to me, in fact wrote on behalf of the United Tenants&#x2019; Rights Association and he signs his name. I will not mention his name now because he indicates that he has sent the hon. the Minister an affidavit in which he makes certain accusations. The affidavit that I have is not signed so therefore I will not quote from it. I assume that this has reached the hon. the Minister; if so, he might wish to refer to it when he replies. Here there are certainly amazing allegations that are being made. This man contends that in the pursuit of helping people who are tenants in flats, he has handed over 100 sworn affidavits or statements to the Police, He says that each statement or affidavit deals specifically with an alleged wilful intimidation or harassment of tenants and was signed by them. He claims that although he has brought this to the notice of the Police and <span class="col_2853-2854" refersTo="page_1442"/>of all sorts of other people and of the hon. the Minister and his department, no action has been taken whatsoever. He makes, to my mind, some very far-reaching accusations against members of the Rent Board and talks about trips to California and all sorts of other things which I think certainly require immediate investigation. He ends up this document by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All the above matters have been brought to the attention of the Minister of Community Development and other Government officials, both by my own person and by sworn affidavit, and nothing has been done about them. I have never been challenged on my allegations.</block>

<p>Sir, I do not want to take this matter any further, except to say that this quite clearly is very serious, and I would imagine that the hon. the Minister will take steps to investigate it. Sir, there are all sorts of rumours going around as to what certain landlords are doing and the extent to which they are harassing and intimidating tenants. If one-tenth of the rumours are true, then I believe that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton was certainly justified. If only a portion of them are true, then in any other society but our own these landlords would have been shot, and in our society I think they certainly deserve the strictest censure. Sir, we have welcomed that particular portion of the legislation because we are hoping that it will improve a situation that we have been very concerned about. I just want to say to the hon. the Minister that I think this is merely the end of one round in this war. I think this first round has been won handsomely by some of these landlords, because it took us nearly two years to introduce this legislation. I want to say to him, too, that already they are thinking of all sorts of other loopholes. Some of the loopholes have now been blocked by this legislation, but I am quite sure that already they are looking for other loopholes and that they are already operating in a different field. One of the things that they are doing, of course, is to use the Sectional Titles Act We know that people like Mr. Wainer and Mr. Mouton are buying up old buildings. Without doing anything to the buildings, they start making everybody&#x2019;s life a misery because they keep on sending to the block of flats agents who are allegedly purchasers of these flats when in fact there is no intention whatsoever of really renovating the buildings. What they then do apparently is to ask these tenants to sign a deed of sale. The tenants pay a deposit; a higher rent very often follows, and then when they move out they are told to disappear and the so-called deed of sale is cancelled because there is a &#x201C;roukoop&#x201D; clause, and so the same process is repeated over and over again. I believe that this is one of the loopholes which follows from this Act. I am told that other devices are being used as well, and I think the hon. the Minister will have to look at this because many thousands of people are going to lose a lot of money. Sir, when it is put to these gentlemen they admit it. I have here a headline in the <i>Property Mail,</i> &#x201C;Wainer admits: My deeds of sale against the law&#x201D;. Here is a man who admits that what he is doing is against the law. I think we can legitimately ask what is being done about that sort of situation.</p>

<p>I have only one last comment. As I understand it, this Rents Act provides&#x2014;and I have in mind the introduction of television &#x2014;for only one television aerial to be sited on a block. As I understand it, you have a particular kind of aerial for black and white television and a totally different kind of aerial for colour television. It seems to me that this is an issue to which the Minister will have to give attention, because quite clearly if you have one kind of television aerial only, you will prevent some of your tenants from using the other kind of television. If you have an aerial for colour television only, you will force every tenant in that building to spend more than R1 000 to buy a colour set because, as I understand it, that kind of aerial will not be suitable for ordinary black and white sets. The point that follows from this is that in this Bill, as I see it, no provision is made for property owners of a rent-controlled building to be able to recoup the installation costs of TV aerials or their maintenance. One would imagine that in this particular case, if my information is correct, this is also a matter which the hon. the Minister would have to attend to.</p>

<p>Sir, as I have indicated, although this side of the House is opposed to the first principle embodied in this particular measure, we do welcome that portion of it which tries to contain the activities of some of these ruthless landlords.</p>

<from><span class="col_2855-2856" refersTo="page_1443"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that we are now reaching the end of a Bill which, I believe, has quite rightly given rise to a very extensive discussion and which has been dealt with in detail. I think I can tell hon. members, including those opposite, and I think that they will accept it when I say this that from the outset I have entered this debate with the standpoint that I wanted to listen with an open mind to all the arguments raised by the Opposition. I think that in the course of our discussions the hon. members opposite have found this to be the case. I should also like to extend my sincere thanks for the contributions made by that side of the House, particularly in those instances where they have perhaps given me a better insight into their actual problems. I have already conveyed my appreciation of the contributions made by this side of the House.</p>

<p>Sir, at the start of my Second Reading speech I said that this was a difficult Act to administer, and in my reply to the Second Reading debate I made it very clear that there were aspects of this Bill which I was not happy about and about which I believe no one could be happy. This I spelt out very clearly. I tried to find answers to these things. Hon. members opposite know that I referred to this form of what is really nothing but discrimination between people in the same category on a specific date, even at a specific hour in 1966. On the one hand, one has people with a property to which a stigma attaches, because it is restricted by an Act, and on the other hand, an hour later, one has people in the same category to whom that stigma does not attach and who are not subject to those restrictions. This is a situation about which no reasonable person can easily be happy. Now there are three possible solutions. As I have indicated, if everyone were to be placed under rent control, we would drive people away from this industry and by so doing, do more harm than good. The second solution is to free everyone from rent control and say that the free market mechanism must take its course. But then we create the situation in which we do not strike the required balance, to which I shall refer later. I think that the hon. member for Sea Point was extremely unfair this afternoon, and he must expect me, too, to be unfair. This is in respect of the balance that must be struck. Consequently only a third possibility remains, namely that by means of legislation, an attempt be made to adopt reasonable measures by means of which the optimum degree of fairness towards both of the sides with conflicting interests can be reached. This is what I have tried to achieve and I fear that hon. members opposite have not been able to argue convincingly that I have not succeeded to a reasonable extent by means of the measure at present before the House. Consequently, I do not want to deal any further with the arguments that have been raised except to tell the hon. member for Hillbrow that the affidavit to which he referred, reached me a few days ago. That affidavit will receive the necessary attention. However, I do not want to say more about that at this juncture. An hon. member was kind enough to let me have a look at the document from which the hon. member for Hillbrow quoted extracts referring to Wainer, and I did in fact read it. It concerns the Sectional Titles Act and I accept that the Department of Justice, which administers that Act, will probably take cognizance of it.</p>

<p>I now want to refer to the hon. member for Sea Point. If my memory serves me, the hon. member was not present for the greater part of my reply.</p>

<p>Oh, he did read it? Well and good, that improves my position. [Interjections.] He therefore knows what my difficulty and my questions were. He had the opportunity, this afternoon, to furnish a reply to the questions which I put to other hon. members opposite, too, to which I did not receive replies. The hon. member did not attempt to answer those questions either. On the contrary. The hon. member for Sea Point tried to ride on the back of political popularity among his voters, and in both directions, too. [Interjections.] He said that the lessor should be assured of a reasonable income and that the lessee should be assured of a rent that was within his means, irrespective of what his means might in fact be. In addition, the hon. member repeatedly pointed a warning finger at me and said: &#x201C;I am warning the Minister; I am warning the Minister.&#x201D; He only suggested one solution: The Government <span class="col_2857-2858" refersTo="page_1444"/>would have to pay in the difference. The hon. member for Carletonville asked him whether he was suggesting a subsidy, but he did not reply to that. He knows what my difficulty and my questions are, but he has not tried to reply to them. He knows what they are, because I stated what they were in my reply to the Second Reading Debate, and he read that, after all. I stated what the Government was doing and the amount of money that was being spent. Other hon. members quoted statistics to indicate how much money was being spent in various fields to assist people in respect of inexpensive housing. With reference to the amendment by the hon. member for Green Point I asked whether, if we took fiscal and other monetary steps, they would have to apply to everyone. I also asked whether there would have to be a means test. In addition, I want to know how one could ensure that the benefits of such measures would be transmitted to the lessee. Should one, then, have control? should one have rent control throughout on all properties? Is one only going to provide these benefits in respect of a certain group of lessees, namely those in recent controlled premises, or is one also going to provide these benefits to a different group of lessees who live in uncontrolled premises and who one would normally expect to pay more than the people in rent-controlled premises. Rent-controlled premises are not available at all times to all people in the lower income groups. The hon. member knows that these are my difficulties and that these are the questions I asked. However, the hon. member did not make the slightest effort to answer these questions. All he could do was to warn: &#x201C;I warn the Minister. He also mentioned the example of 75% with regard to old buildings. This was the logic we had from the hon. warning member for Sea Point. As far as these old buildings are concerned, the position has been reached where 75% of the value represents the value of the land, while only 25% represents the value of the improvements on it. In the normal course, the position is that it is accepted that about one-third of the value of the property will be the value of the land and about two-thirds will be the value of the improvements. What will any normal thinking businessman do when such a position is reached? What will he do when this disproportion has been reached? He will want to realize the value of his land and replace the improvements on it by improvements that will be in proportion to the value of his land. That is what any normal thinking businessman would do.</p>

<p>Precisely. Now I have the warning hon. member exactly where I want him. That person must therefore let that building fall into disrepair at the expense of his lessees until the stage is reached at which I have to say that it may be demolished because the condition of that building is poor. That is the kind of argument we have had here. However, my department provides this man with a reasonable formula that enables him to make adjustments and corrections which again enable him to continue to provide a service to the community. That hon. member adopts the standpoint that if a man&#x2019;s net rent income was R6 000 ten years ago, it would still have to be R6 000 today. I do not adopt that standpoint. In other words, there must be the necessary increases in the income of this man, too, just as is the case throughout the entire community, including pensioners. The purchasing power of our money is dropping. However, the hon. member has furnished no reply in this regard, except to say that the Government must intervene and put things right. The hon. member is aware of the questions I asked, because he read my speech; however, he did not mention how I should deal with the situation I put to him.</p>

<heading>TRADE PRACTICES BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this debate was adjourned last night I was telling the hon. the Minister of certain trade practices which I believe to be undesirable and to which I believe he should pay attention. I specially mentioned certain hire-purchase practices and I believe that the hon. the Minister should consider it his duty when this Bill becomes law to use his new powers to protect hire-purchase customers from their own ignorance and from the sharp practices to which they have been exposed for so long. If the hon. the Minister and applied his mind previously, I believe he could have used other laws to curb these malpractices which have been going on, but undoubtedly in its wisdom, the Government decided not to take action. We sincerely hope that he will now take action in terms of the powers&#x2014;which were mentioned by my hon. friend from Constantia as being those contained in provisions other than clauses 10, 11 and 12&#x2014; which we are prepared to concede he should have. I also want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to another practice which I believe is one against which he should act in terms of the powers he will now receive. I refer to the Christmas hamper and stamp clubs. From the smile on the face of the hon. the Minister I can see that he must have been in touch with Mr. Roelofse who has, I understand, been conducting a particular inquiry into these organizations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am thinking of a Christmas present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, I see; the hon. the Minister is just thinking of a Christmas present. That is the whole point with these clubs. The way they operate is to appoint agents who sell stamps which are affixed to a card on a periodic basis, weekly or monthly. When the holder of that card submits his card to the firm concerned at Christmas time, he receives a Christmas hamper. Various malpractices have grown out of this practice. They invite participation from all sorts of people and they publish a catalogue which contains illustrations of various hampers. When the person receives his hamper he finds that it is nothing like the one he ordered, <span class="col_2861-2862" refersTo="page_1446"/>that is, if he receives his hamper at all. Recently there have been instances&#x2014;I was involved in the investigation into one of these clubs&#x2014;where people did not receive their hampers. Not all the threats in the world from me could even get them to supply the necessary hampers. We had the situation of an African woman in the Hammarsdale area being beaten up by people who had contributed faithfully during the months of the previous year but who had not received their hampers. The people blamed her but she did not even get her commission from the particular firm. I am glad to be able to say that only last week I was able to get a cheque from the company concerned due to the efforts of one of the local newspapers. I was able to hand this cheque to her and she has refunded the amounts to the persons concerned. Certain questions arise. Again I must say that the hon. the Minister and the Government are culpable in this respect because I believe they could have acted against these clubs before. These clubs receive deposits, but are they recognized as deposit-receiving institutions? Surely we could have stepped in on that point? Then there is the question of unclaimed money. These clubs do not maintain trust funds. I believe that, if these clubs are to be allowed to continue with their activities, they should be compelled to maintain trust funds in which all unclaimed amounts are placed. At the moment the unclaimed amounts become the cherry on the top when the profits are calculated. I believe these clubs should be compelled to account in some way for the unredeemed stamps.</p>

<p>I have given just two examples of malpractices which have arisen. Because of these, I believe the hon. the Minister must have the powers he asks for, except for those which are contained in clauses 10, 11 and 12 of the Bill. We have heard what three speakers on the other side of the House have had to say, but none of them has given any concrete examples of exactly what the intention of the Minister is in this regard. The only subject they did mention was advertising. The hon. member for Klerksdorp in particular devoted almost all his time to dealing with what he considered to be malpractices in advertising. The hon. the Minister must be aware that advertising is the lifeblood of commerce and industry today. We could call advertising the arteries of the business world not only in South, Africa but throughout the world. Commerce in particular depends upon selling and upon advertising to sell its products.</p>

<p>Let me give an example of this. Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will remember, as I do when I was a small boy, that there was only one brand of tea everyone bought and that was Mazawattee tea. That brand was sold mainly on the advertisement, which appeared in those days, of the little old lady with the big glasses who had with her a little pup and a little girl. Today that brand of tea is hardly sold because they stopped advertising it. Today one buys Five Roses, Joko, Three Trees or one of the other brands that are advertised. The hon. the Minister is asking for certain powers in connection with advertising. I want to say to him that we are prepared to give him those powers but I must also issue a warning: He must be careful how he applies these provisions because he can do commerce and industry in this country incalculable harm.</p>

<p>There is another aspect to this question of advertising. It has long been held in the law of South Africa that an advertisement does not constitute a binding contract but that it only constitutes an invitation to do business. Is it the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s intention to upset that situation in the practice of law in our country? If we look at exactly what powers the hon. the Minister has asked for in this Bill regarding the prohibition of certain provisions in advertisements, <i>we</i> find that his asking for such powers could be construed as an attempt to upset the position as it exists today. Naturally, a person makes his advertisement as attractive as possible.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>As I said, I believe every person makes his advertisement as attractive as possible to invite other people to come and do business. I have a couple of examples of such advertisements with me. The hon. member for Klerksdorp mentioned the example of the plots that were being sold at the seaside. That advertisement appeared with a glossy picture showing a lovely beach., a beautiful blue <span class="col_2863-2864" refersTo="page_1447"/>sea and, in addition, a shapely blonde. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he thinks he should buy the blonde as well because she appears in the picture? Does the person who responds to the advertisement demand that he must get the blonde as well when he buys the plot? He does not do so. The point is that the advertisement is merely an invitation to do business. I have another example which arrived in my mail the other day. It comes from a local firm. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">FREE&#x2014;R100 to R200 could be yours now. Are you buying a new car? You will after asking about these fantastic, one-time unbeatable offers. If you buy &#x2026; (a particular brand of motor-car), you can get R200 in cash; if you buy &#x2026; (a different brand), you can get R150 in cash; and if you buy &#x2026; (a third make), you can get R100 in cash.</block>

<p>The rules are also printed in this advertisement. They state that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The offer is available from now until 1 March 1975. Buy any one of these cars &#x2026;</block>

<p>Depicted on the facing page&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and you will receive a cash benefit direct from &#x2026;</block>

<p>the company&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to help your cash payment, help your hire-purchase deposit or to help increase your trade-in value or to keep and to spend on yourself.</block>

<p>Now, here is a benefit which is being offered by way of an advertisement by a firm. I am in agreement with the hon. the Minister. This does not constitute grounds for a civil action. I do not believe that on the strength of this anybody could sue and claim R200 from the firm. However, in terms of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Bill, this becomes an offence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Which clause?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a trade coupon in terms of the definition of &#x201C;sell&#x201D;. Clause 10 states &#x2026; [Interjections.] I will come to clause 11&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall, in connection with the sale of any goods &#x2026;</block>

<p>And when one looks at the definition of &#x201C;sell&#x201D; it includes an advertisement, this piece of paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; supply or give any trade coupon.</block>

<p>Now, let us look at the definition of &#x201C;trade coupon&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Trade coupon&#x201D; means anything whatsoever which, either by itself or together with any other thing or act. entitles or purports to entitle the holder thereof to receive or to participate in any competition for, any benefit.</block>

<p>Such person will receive a benefit of R200 by this means. Let us go on to clause 11. I know the exceptions. Clause 11 states <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<p>The provisions of section 10 shall not be so construed as to prohibit &#x2026;</p>

<p>I think that the hon. the Minister is now referring to paragraph (b). [Interjections.] Which one is he referring to? Which one does the hon. the Minister want me to look at? [Interjections.] Very well, let us look at paragraph (c)(i)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The supply or giving to any purchaser of any goods of a document or token entitling the holder thereof to receive on demand payment of a sum of money bearing a proportion to the price paid for such goods.</block>

<p>There is no proportion whatsoever to the price of the goods. When it comes to the provisions of clause 11, the exceptions, in every case I can give the hon. the Minister an example which is not covered. I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question across the floor of the House. In my supermarket I conduct a competition once a year. We have a grand birthday promotion in which we give things away. One year we sold 1 500 pairs of panties at one cent per time.</p>

<speech by="#mills">

<from>Mr <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. W. MILLS</person>:</from>

<p>What were they doing before that?</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from><span class="col_2865-2866" refersTo="page_1448"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Together with this promotion there is a system whereby every customer who passes through the check-out receives a ticket with a number on it. That ticket entitles that person to come back on a Saturday morning to play Pick-a-Box, a competition in which we give away 20 prizes. I want the hon. the Minister to tell me which of the exceptions under clause 11 will cover me in that instance?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall reply to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not covered by paragraph (a) because it is not a commission. I am not covered by paragraph (b) because it is not a discount as such. I am not covered by paragraph (c) because it bears no proportion whatsoever to the price paid. So it goes. Let me say this to the hon. the Minister. I am one of thousands of supermarket owners who do the same thing every day. I am only one of these. Is the hon. the Minister going to prosecute all of us? Is he going to prosecute every advertiser on Springbok Radio? What actually happens? Take the Surf Show, &#x201C;Pick-a-Box&#x201D; or any other show. People are invited to go to the SABC office. When they arrive there they are issued with a ticket. That ticket is drawn out of a drum and then they are entitled to participate in the competition. When we look at the definition of &#x201C;trade coupon&#x201D; we find that it includes the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or to participate in a competition for any benefit.</block>

<p>Every one of those competitions must be outlawed immediately these provisions have become law. I think the hon. the Minister does not know what he is doing. Sir, here is another advertisement by a firm whose name I will not mention&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A fabulous gift for the discerning man.</block>

<p>Then on page 2&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Receive this fabulous gift when you visit the so-and-so counter of such-and-such a firm. This firm has a fabulous gift for the discerning man &#x2026; Receive this fabulous gift free with any &#x2026; purchase of two products or more. One gift per customer.</block>

<p>Sir, this will be outlawed by this Bill when it is passed and I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is really serious when he asks us to pass a Bill which reads that the Minister may prohibit the giving of any benefit to a customer. Sir, how can he in all seriousness ask us to pass a Bill like this? I cannot accept that this sort of benefit is to the detriment of the public of South Africa. The hon. member for Paarl, who is unfortunately not here at the moment, made the point yesterday that traders only offer advantages for their own benefit; that there is no benefit for the consumer. Sir, it is statements of this kind which do the harm that is done, particularly to the supermarket business in this country. They are made by uninformed people who make these irresponsible statements without ascertaining the facts. What are the facts? In exactly the same way as advertising is the lifeblood of commerce and industry in this country, I believe that the trade gimmicks, if you want to call them that, of giving the customer some benefit, of having loss leaders, of offering prizes in a competition, are absolutely essential to the businesses of South Africa today, particularly in the field of supermarkets. I believe that it is due to those gimmicks that the cost of living in South Africa has been kept within a reasonable limit, because the supermarkets today are working on a far lower percentage mark-up, a far lower percentage profit, than they have ever worked on before. Why, Sir? Because of the volume of business which they do. These systems which are used&#x2014;the prizes which are offered and the loss leaders&#x2014;are used with the object of increasing turnover. Sir, one business that I know of was in the situation up to a couple of years ago that because it had a small turnover, it had to mark its goods up between 25% and 30%. With the increased turnover which resulted from the use of these gimmicks, from these loss leaders, from these benefits which have been given to the public, that business is today marking up no more than 15%. It is claimed by some of the larger supermarkets that they have no mark-up at all, that they in fact sell a lot of their products at cost price, and that all they work on is their cash discount of 2&#x00BD;%, and in some cases 5%. I know, Sir, that this can happen because I have used it, too, in certain instances, but unfortunately I am not big enough to have such a small mark-up and still make a living. One of the national firms, a world-wide concern, which gives <span class="col_2867-2868" refersTo="page_1449"/>away thousands upon thousands of rand every year in prizes, in special offers and in discounts, made a profit a few years ago &#x2014;I have not been able to get the latest figures&#x2014;of R7 million. When we went into this to discover what exactly this R7 million represented, we found that it represented 0,05% of the firm&#x2019;s turnover, which means that its net mark-up was 0,05%. Sir, nobody can expect it to be less than that. If that firm had not spent the thousands of rand that it did on advertising, on giving away prizes, on making special offers, on reducing its prices, it would never have been able to exist on that low percentage of profit. I hope that this debate, not only now but in the later stages, will once and for all give the lie to the story that traders, when they give prizes or benefits, are doing so only to catch the customer. I do not believe that is true. It is done to catch one&#x2019;s opposition because it is a fact today that the supermarket which gives the better prizes, the better reductions, the one that does the better advertising, is the supermarket which is doing the turnover, and that is the supermarket, Sir, which is making the profit.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with another aspect. In the African areas of South Africa a practice has grown up whereby a national concern&#x2014;and I think in this case I must name it; it is the manufacturers of Surf, the washing powder&#x2014;has a number of travelling vans which go around to various African communities where they put on a cinema show in the daylight, in the open air, and they put on a show of the programme that we know on the radio as &#x201C;Pick-a-Box&#x201D;. The African people from miles around gather around this truck and they have a wonderful afternoon&#x2019;s entertainment with a number of their people competing in &#x201C;Pick-a-Box&#x201D; and winning prizes. Straight away this firm is in trouble because it is giving prizes and advertising one of its products, whether it is Surf or any other product. But at the end of the show what invariably happens is that vouchers are given out to those Africans present, and those people have come to expect this. This voucher reads: &#x201C;Go to your nearest supermarket and buy a packet of Surf and you can have 5 cents off the price&#x201D;. Sir, we collect thousands of these and we cash them with the firm concerned, which refunds to us the amount of money we should have collected but which we have not collected in view of these vouchers. Now. Sir, this is a trade coupon. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what is wrong with this practice, and if there is nothing wrong with it, where is the exception in clause 11? I do not see any exception in clause 11 which is going to allow this firm to continue with that sort of advertising, and I want to say now that if they are forced to stop that sort of advertising, it is only going to do the Black people of South Africa a disservice, because it is the volume of turnover which allows their product to be sold at the low price at which it is sold today. Sir, turnover is the important thing in commerce today and turnover can only be achieved by advertising.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. the Minister is right in thinking he must take action against certain unsavoury trade practices. I believe he needs our support to do this, and he will get our support. However, I cannot in all seriousness support a Bill which provides that &#x201C;subject to the provisions of section 16 the Minister may &#x2026; prohibit the giving or supply of any benefit, or impose in respect thereof such conditions as he may think fit&#x201D;. I believe that 99% of the benefits which are given today to the consumer public, particularly those which are more apparent to the public, are to the advantage of the public and are keeping the cost of living down. They have had a detriment effect on the small trader. The small trader, the small grocer, is disappearing in this country, but whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is not a matter for discussion under this Bill. I believe, however, that from the point of view of the consumer, the housewife of South Africa, these benefits are to her advantage. I support the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the only reply I am able to furnish at this stage to the argument advanced by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South is the following quotation concerning the clarity and the correctness with which Acts are drafted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the degree of precision which is essential to everyone who has had to draft Acts of Parliament which, although they may be easy to understand, people continually try to misunderstand and in which, therefore, it is not enough to attain a degree of precision which a person reading in good faith can understand, but it is necessary to obtain, if possible, a degree <span class="col_2869-2870" refersTo="page_1450"/>of precision which a person reading in bad faith cannot misunderstand.</block>

<p>That is the only reply I want to make to the argument advanced by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South.</p>

<p>I should like to support the legislation. I think it is very good legislation because by its nature it protects the consumer against exploitation, malpractices and deception. I believe that all hon. members support this aim of the legislation. However, the legislation also goes further. It also envisages the protection of the trader. The traders are protected in terms of clauses 18, 20 and 21 in that, in terms of those provisions, they will be able to advance certain defences. After the expiry of a period of two years, no claims or charges may be laid against them. They are also exempted from claims in regard to advertisements they have published, provided, of course, those advertisements comply with the requirements set in the legislation. The legislation goes even further, because it even protects the professional advertiser. In terms of clause 18, the professional advertiser advertising the dealer&#x2019;s goods cannot be caught in the trap of malpractices as regards advertisements and consequently he, too, enjoys the protection of this legislation. The manufacturers, suppliers and sellers of goods are protected under clause 15, too, so that if malpractices occur which disturb the relations between suppliers and sellers, the necessary protection exists. Clause 10 incorporates the principle that the supplier of the trade coupon is also protected.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Klerksdorp dealt with the advertising industry in great detail. We have just heard that advertising is the life-blood of any industry and we fully endorse that, but we have never yet heard that the life-blood of an industry is based on malpractices. When one reads it in good faith, one finds that basically, this legislation is designed to eliminate malpractices.</p>

<p>The Bill also places advisory machinery at the Minister&#x2019;s disposal in the form of an advisory committee. I agree with the hon. members who have argued in favour of great care and prudence being exercised in the composition of this committee. However, we shall also have to bear in mind that in his Second Reading speech, the hon. the Minister said that he would invite interested parties to nominate persons from whom he could constitute the committee. The legislation also provides for the appointment of inspectors and exceptional preventative powers are afforded the Secretary.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of the advisory machinery. The first is that it protects the trader, the seller, against possible victimization. The second aspect of this is that it creates the possibility of the identification of malpractices. I now come to the argument advanced by hon. members on the other side of the House in regard to the omission of those sections of the Bill dealing with trade coupons, namely clauses 10, 11 and 12. Vague statements have been made to the effect that this would be outstanding legislation as long as clauses 10, 11 and 12 were excluded, but not one hon. member opposite has thus far succeeded in furnishing us with any example or any motivation to indicate why these clauses supposedly weaken the legislation. Hon. members opposite were very vague about this whole matter. In the one instance, the hon. member for Walmer said. &#x201C;The provisions of the Trade Coupons Act are in conflict with the provisions of the Bill, and as such the inclusion of those provisions cannot be accepted.&#x201D; Only a few minutes later, however, the same hon. member said that these clauses &#x201C;have been reintroduced in this Bill with some slight differences&#x201D;. In the one case there is a serious conflict and in the next there are only minor differences. However the hon. member did not succeed in indicating what these minor differences were. The hon. member went back 40 years and hauled old skeletons out of the cupboard. But that is not relevant. What was argued 40 years ago in connection with Act No. 18 of 1935 is entirely irrelevant, because situations then were totally different to those prevailing today.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite are simply unable to read the Bill in good faith. The question of what is wrong with giving something away for nothing has also been asked and hon. members have argued about this at great length. However I want to make the statement that nothing is being given away free. I want to mention two examples in this regard. In one way or another, anything that is given away free is recovered from other consumers. I my self know of a case where a trade coupon was issued involving eight tokens. This practice can be calculated very precisely by means of statistics. One of these eight <span class="col_2871-2872" refersTo="page_1451"/>tokens was withdrawn from the trade for a long period to allow the turnover to reach a specific level before that withheld token was reintroduced into the trade coupon campaign. This, therefore, is a malpractice because it is recovered in one way or another. At some stage it is worked into the price again. The hon. member for Walmer referred to court verdicts and law reports in regard to, <i>inter alia,</i> a matter concerning soap, in which a trade coupon offered a car as a prize. I want to make the statement that this is a malpractice and therefore this is another of the reasons why these three clauses should remain in the legislation. When a car is dangled before people as a carrot to induce them to buy a packet of soap, there is no relation between the price of the item and the price of the car. The quality of the item that is offered for sale bears no relation to this. In other words, a person is no longer buying the item because of its quality, but because the carrot that is dangled before him is a car. The manufacturer therefore has no motivation to maintain the quality of his product. The second instance I want to mention is the fact that the issue of supply and demand is now being neutralized, because the product is no longer being purchased owing to the demand for it, but owing to the fact that there is a car to be won by the purchaser. In my opinion this is a malpractice. It also constitutes unfair advertisement because the advertisement no longer concerns the quality of and demand for the product, but the fact that a car is at stake. Here we are dealing with malpractices, and for that reason the clauses in this legislation should be retained. These trade coupons are basically a form of advertisement, and as such are also liable to malpractices. By its nature, therefore, control of trade coupons belongs in this legislation. The same malpractices that can arise with regard to advertisements can also arise with regard to trade coupons. The third argument is that the measurements being adopted here directly protect the consumer. The same measures are adopted in the case of advertisements. Consequently these measures, too, belong in this legislation.</p>

<p>I should like to quote an example to indicate why provisions of this nature should be incorporated in the legislation. I shall not name names. The case I want to mention concerns an advertisement for a radar warning unit. The unit can be purchased and installed in a motor vehicle so that the driver may be warned when he approaches a radar speed trap. I now want to quote an extract in order to indicate how this unit is advertised (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Snooper is not an invitation to speed. It has been designed to assist the conscientious driver to maintain a legal speed and to ensure that he does not inadvertently exceed the speed limit before entering a radar zone.</block>

<p>If that is not the greatest possible deception, then I do not know. If there is no radar trap, how is this &#x201C;Snooper&#x201D; going to assist the conscientious driver to maintain the legal speed?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not propose to elaborate on what the hon. member for Wonderboom has said, except to say that he started off by going through the clauses from his point of view, while we on these benches certainly want to go through the clauses from our point of view. The process is going to be quite different from what we have as yet heard either from the right or the left of us. In his Second Reading speech, the hon. the Minister said that the purpose of this legislation was to make it possible for the Government to act against practices of this kind&#x2014;meaning undesirable practices. He said that it was desirable for the Govern ment to have the necessary legal powers at its disposal. He also said that the Bill now before this House was the result of protracted negotiations conducted with interested organizations in an attempt to formulate a Bill which would afford the consumer public the necessary protection without, however, putting unnecessary burdens on the private sector. We would agree that that is an extremely laudable aim and we have no difficulty in supporting it. One must, however, remember the caveat, i.e. the word's &#x201C;an attempt&#x201D;. We on these benches agree with the motivation behind this piece of legislation, i.e. to provide protection for the members of the consumer public against false or misleading information in regard to either the properties or the price of products which are on offer now or will in future be on offer. A business must, of course, conduct itself in a reasonable and fair way and to the benefit and not the detriment of the consumer public. That is clearly in the interests of business itself, as well as being in the interests of the general public. It naturally follows that where a <span class="col_2873-2874" refersTo="page_1452"/>minority acts in such a way as to negate that principle, there should be appropriate machinery both to protect the public and to punish the transgressors. With that, too, we have no quarrel.</p>

<p>However, the facts of the matter are that this Bill is drafted in such a way that it raises fundamental issues. I am not referring to the re-enactment of the Trade Coupons Act with which two of the speakers to the right of me were certainly obsessed, or to the affairs of Colgate Palmolive. Up to now the party to the right of me has been totally concerned with clause 10. 11, 12 and 24. As for the rest, the principal spokesman of the United Party, had the following to say, and I refer to his Hansard:</p>

<block name="quote">These are features which we have no difficulty at all in supporting. In fact, we support them whole-heartedly.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">If the hon. the Minister is prepared to excise from this Bill the trade coupons provisions, i.e. clauses 10 to 12 and certain other consequential matters, then we would have no difficulty in supporting the Bill and I would certainly withdraw the amendment that I propose to move.</block>

<p>Then finally he said if it had not been for the trade coupons provisions in this Bill, the Bill would have been a timeous and advisable measure. That is really rather fascinating because in the other clauses this Bill as it is drafted affects the following fundamental areas which are of concern to every businessman and every individual in South Africa. What is proposed here is a totally unwarranted interference with those things. These provisions concern the rule of law, the rights of individuals, the powers of the Minister to discriminate, the powers that are given to the Secretary for Commerce and they also contain an unreasonable provision in regard to the responsibility of executives of a company or a corporation in the management of their business. It is our view that the culprits are those who indulge in the sort of business malpractices which were mentioned by the hon. the Minister, and that they constitute a small proportion, a small number of the entrepreneurs or of the management class in the corporate enterprises within our country. The legislation as it is drafted &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am drawing a distinction between this party and the party on my right at the moment. I shall come back to the hon. the Minister in a minute. The legislation as it is drafted at the moment will or could interfere in a totally unjustifiable way with those who conduct business which in any way falls within the purview of this Bill. Where this fails is that in an attempt to draft it in such a way as to catch a small number of wrongdoers on a very small portion of the spectrum, anybody who is engaged in the activities covered by this Bill is brought within the ambit of the provisions of this Bill. As such, as we intend to demonstrate, it is bad law. It is a ham-handed attempt to punish an extraordinarily small number since at the same time it exposes the whole gamut of people engaged in this business to its power. It is simply another example of over-kill which I hope to show to the hon. the Minister. As such we on these benches can neither accept, nor support this measure.</p>

<p>Before I go on to demonstrate in detail to the hon. the Minister where we find this particular legislation objectionable, I should like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, while in favour of legislation to protect the general public against misleading advertisements and practices, declines to pass the Second Reading of the Trade Practices Bill because&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) it gives unreasonably wide powers to the Minister and to the Secretary for Commerce which could lead to unjustifiable interference with legitimate business practice; and</li>

<li>(b) it runs counter to the rule of law and undermines the rights of individuals.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>I want to refer to the particular clauses of the Bill in order to draw to the attention of the hon. the Minister what we find offensive. I should like to repeat to the hon. the Minister that we are not objecting to the small number of culprits or miscreants who will be affected by this Bill, but we are simply looking at how the legislation as it <span class="col_2875-2876" refersTo="page_1453"/>is drafted at the moment will affect anybody in a particular business, the vast majority of whom behave in a fair and reasonable manner. To start with clause 2, I want to say to the hon. the Minister that this is one of the few clauses which we consider to be an improvement on the previous draft Bill which was submitted during the last session. We are not going to quibble over this clause in view of the assurance given here that it remains within the discretion of the Minister to decide who the particular representatives are going to be who will serve on his Trade Practices Advisory Committee. We are in favour of the fact that the majority of the representatives will now broadly speaking represent the private sector. We assume that, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, that committee will be as broadly representative as possible of the various skills. We are also pleased to see that it is now essential for the Minister to get the recommendation of this committee before he can take formal steps. Having given recognition to the importance of the private sector&#x2019;s representation on this Trade Practices Advisory Committee by stating that only three of its members shall be in the employ of the State, will the hon. the Minister in respect of clause 3(2), which states that &#x201C;the quorum for and the procedure at any meeting of the committee shall be determined by the Minister&#x201D;, be prepared to give us an assurance that as far as the determination of a quorum is concerned, never less than half the members present shall represent the private sector?</p>

<p>It is in clauses 5, 6 and 7 that we come to our fundamental objection to this Bill as drafted. Clause 5 simply deals with the delegation of powers by the secretary. Clause 6 gives the secretary the right to demand information from any person, but it does not qualify in any basic sense or in one particularly important sense, the type of information which may be required. It simply states that any person is under a legal obligation to produce that information. In this regard we would like to raise with the hon. the Minister the question of legal privilege, which is something to which we will return with regard to clause 7. In terms of clause 7, the inspectors, who may simply be appointed by the secretary, have extremely wide and far-ranging powers granted to them. They may enter any place they choose to at any time. They may inspect any document and they may seize and retain any article as they see fit. As the clause reads now, there are no qualifications at all. Here again I would like to raise the question of legal privilege such as exists between a lawyer and a client. Is such a legal privilege to be included? I hope the hon. the Minister will answer this question in his reply. The legal privilege is the one fundamental principle of law in South Africa which has not yet been broached. In terms of subsection (6) of the same clause these inspectors, having entered a place of their own choice, having inspected the goods and having seized goods, again with no qualification, are entirely exonerated from any liability. The State and the inspectors are not liable for any damages suffered as a result of the exercise of their power. There is no reason in our opinion why anyone should bear damages suffered without redress if that person is subsequently found to be not guilty of an offence. As the Bill stands, that is the situation.</p>

<p>Let us go on to clause 8. This clause states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall in respect of any business disclose any information which came to his knowledge in the performance of his duties or functions in terms of this Act, &#x2026;</block>

<p>with certain exceptions. We on these benches are not at all happy with those qualifications. No information of any kind whatsoever should be disclosed other than that which may be required in terms of this Bill. Why is there the qualification in relation to the non-disclosure by any person of information in respect of any business? An inspector may come across information of a personal or other nature which has nothing to do with the business. He is not in any sense precluded from subsequently disclosing that information.</p>

<from><span class="col_2877-2878" refersTo="page_1454"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Let us look now at the provisions of clause 11(e). This paragraph deals with the supply or giving to a purchaser of any goods of a document or token entitling the holder thereof to receive a sum of money or goods. The intention here appears to be to permit a manufacturer of goods to make available other goods produced by him at a reduced price or at no cost by way of granting a discount in respect of another purchase. That appears to be the intention of the provision. If our interpretation is correct, will the hon. the Minister tell us why the exclusion refers only to goods produced exclusively by that manufacturer? When the hon. the Minister replies to this debate, will he tell us whether he is prepared to extend those provisions to cover a parent and subsidiary situation. In commercial activity it is appropriate to consider groups rather than individual companies.</p>

<p>When we come to the end of clause 11 &#x2014;and this touches on what was said by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South &#x2014;would the hon. the Minister be prepared to add a further exception to provide that these provisions shall not be so construed as to prohibit charitable, educational and ecclesiastical institutions which employ devices very similar to trade coupons for fund-raising purposes? The hon. the Minister would have no difficulty in making such provision and enforcing it so that such institutions would not be affected.</p>

<p>We have another fundamental objection in regard to clause 12(2). This provision appears in the Bill in a number of places. It states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Different notices may in terms of subsection (1) be published in respect of different goods, services, benefits, &#x2026;</block>

<p>There is no problem up to there, but then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; areas, businesses or persons.</block>

<p>Can the hon. the Minister give us examples to justify the granting to him of the power or the ability to discriminate between areas, businesses or persons? We would have thought that the thrust of this provision would be directed at the actual trade practice of making misleading statements. In the law as it stands, if two businesses follow the same misleading practices, the Minister has the power to prohibit one but not the other. I hope that the hon. the Minister will agree with us that that is the case.</p>

<p>Let me say to the hon. the Minister that we welcome clause 14 subject to the solution or satisfaction of the objection that we have just raised which recurs in subsection (2) of this clause. We think that the disclosure of the minimum amount of information in an advertisement is a very good thing. This is something which is overdue in South Africa. There is however our residual objection in relation to subsection (2) in this connection.</p>

<p>As far as clause 16 is concerned, I should like the hon. the Minister to consider the provisions of clause 16(l)(a)(ii). This subparagraph states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In which all interested persons are requested to lodge objections or representations regarding the proposed notice, in writing with the secretary before a date specified in the provisional notice.</block>

<p>What we would like to ask the hon. the Minister is whether he will consider making provision for a minimum, period as a practical measure. The period that we have in mind is four weeks, so that people will have that period in which to lodge their objections or to make representations.</p>

<p>Clause 16(3) provides that after consideration of any recommendation referred to in subsection (2), the Minister may publish the notice in question in the <i>Gazette</i> We have already mentioned that the Minister can only take the formal steps after a recommendation. If that is in fact so&#x2014; and this deals with the provisional notice referred to in earlier clauses&#x2014;would the Minister be prepared to consider amending that clause to read that he will either publish a final notice or that he will publish a notice withdrawing the provisional notice, because that would cover both and remove any uncertainty? When we come to clauses 17 and 18, in conjunction with the other powers given to the Minister and to the secretary, may we just express our concern that the range of these powers, particularly in the relation to provisional notices, may well in extreme circumstances put a small company out of business. These powers could at least during that period cause severe financial damage to such a business. Sir, in general we on these benches find the procedures very far-reaching. Very wide powers of discretion are given to the Minister or to the secretary, and the exercise <span class="col_2879-2880" refersTo="page_1455"/>of these powers could have a very serious effect upon the conduct or the profitability of a business, and therefore we would strongly recommend&#x2014;and we intend to propose an amendment to this effect&#x2014;that there should be some provision for an appeal to the courts, which is not contained in this legislation.</p>

<p>Clause 22 deals with the vexed and thorny problem of the liability of executives, managers or employees for certain acts of commission or omission. Sir, we find this particular clause extremely difficult to accept because it is very far-reaching. Commercial reality in large businesses really dictates that if a person joins a large corporation he normally has to fill in a form which covers a number of things. The form may say, for example, that he cannot deal in the shares of that company without advising the board and that he accepts various other conditions. If in that form the management has expressly forbidden certain things, then I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that the inference should be that the management had taken every reasonable step, unless the contrary is proved, whereas this clause places the onus of proof on the management.</p>

<p>Sir, as I have said, if and when this Bill comes to the Committee Stage we will be proposing a number of amendments. This Bill, in a very direct way, affects the rights of an individual both under the law and to conduct a business without interference when he is doing it in a fair and ethical way. Because the powers granted in this Bill go far beyond what is required&#x2014;obviously the reply from that side of the House will be that there is no intention to use these powers&#x2014;we on these benches can neither accept nor support this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are many things which the hon. member for Johannesburg North said and dealt with with which we agree. Some of them I will deal with in the course of what I want to say, but I want to point out in the first place that the history of our particular law in South Africa shows a continuous trend of protective action towards those who for a variety of reasons have been unable to fend for themselves. This is why in the earliest of times protection was afforded already to minors, to women acting under their husbands&#x2019; influence, and generally to persons suffering from some incapacity. With the development of commerce, it became necessary to protect the ordinary individual against misrepresentation, against concealment, against defective goods, etc. With modern advertising techniques the problem has become more serious, since even the most sophisticated consumer is often taken in by skilfully prepared sales patter, prepared by trained psychologists, and by the sharp practices of cunning operators. Exploitation of the consumer is not unique to any one particular country but flourishes particularly where there are undeveloped and inadequately educated people. The days of buying land for a handful of beads might seem to be past, but even highly intelligent people are often taken in by deceitful techniques. But in having this approach we need to be careful that in seeking to protect the consumer, we do not inhibit competition nor stifle initiative, nor tilt the scale too far against the producer or the seller, and that all that legislation should in fact do is to level the scale to let all operate on an equal footing. Now, there has been quite a lot of legislation for the protection of consumers which has not been mentioned in the course of this debate, such matters as the Hire Purchase Act, the Limitation and Disclosure of Finance Charges Act, the price control legislation, the monopolies legislation, etc. In this particular piece of legislation before us we are really dealing with three things: Firstly, to protect the people against deceitful advertisements; secondly to deal with certain undesirable trade practices and, thirdly, to re-enact the trade coupons legislation. I think the legislation in fact is incorrectly named the Trade Practices Bill, and would be more correct if called a Consumers&#x2019; Protection Bill, because I think this is really the function which it seeks to fulfil. I should like to deal individually with all three broad principles, and I should like to deal, firstly, with trade coupons because the people even to my right&#x2014;and I want to make it quite clear, to my right&#x2014;have been mainly preoccupied with trade coupons.</p>

<p>Sir, the prohibition against trade coupons is not a new principle, but is a re-enactment of the 1935 legislation, in some respects wider and in others more elastic than the former legislation. There can be two views in respect of trade coupons. If we take, for example, the best known trade coupon, the trading stamp, it is to be found in many countries of the world. But what is interesting is that in the countries where trade coupons are permitted, they initially <span class="col_2881-2882" refersTo="page_1456"/>started off with a tremendous volume of use and then gradually became less and less attractive, and in the main the result has been that it is the cash price and the quality of the goods that form the real attraction. It is only when trade coupons are an added attraction, as for example in some countries where petrol of the same quality and price is sold, that they become of value because then there is something to be obtained in addition to price and value. A trade coupon is, in fact, merely a form of advertisement and one needs to ask what sort of advertisement or incentive is the most desirable. Is an advertisement in the visual form of a pamphlet, newspaper, film, etc., the most desirable form of advertisement? Is it perhaps more desirable to have sound advertisements for example in radio, or advertisements by cash discount with coupons offering a discount if bought? Is it perhaps more desirable to get a discount at the point of sale or by the collection of coupons? Is it, in fact, more desirable to advertise by means of samples so as to encourage people to buy once they have tried the product, or is it better to do so by means of incentives in order to get them to buy a particular product by associating it with another product? The present legislation has as its aim to permit discounts, to allow tokens in order to get discounts and to receive associated products. In that one agrees with the legislation. However, I think it fails to allow the tokens to be given in advance in order to obtain a discount and it also fails to allow for tokens in order to get associated products in a reasonable fashion. I shall deal with that in some detail in a moment.</p>

<p>May I point out some of the problems? In terms of clause 11(b) of the Bill, an offer to give a discount is permitted, but clause 11(c) permits the supply or the giving of tokens only to purchasers or users of services and not to prospective purchasers or the public at large. This is what appears to prevent the giving of tokens in advance of a purchase in order to obtain a discount. This is one of the clauses which require amendment.</p>

<p>I may say that when the Bill was originally read a First Time last year, I prepared some 30-odd amendments when I was involved with the party on my right, and I still intend moving those amendments.</p>

It also ignores companies which import, assemble or distribute but do not manufacture or produce. This again appears to require amendment.</p>

The first two create no serious problem, but the word &#x201C;sell&#x201D; creates a problem as it includes in its definition the term &#x201C;advertise&#x201D;. This means that in terms of clause 10(a) a trade coupon may not be given in connection with an advertisement as defined. The argument is that this prevents the giving away of samples, as the hon. member for Walmer has said. It prevents radio shows in the form of advertisements in which prizes are given away. That is the argument which was advanced by the official Opposition. In my view the argument that this prevents the giving away of samples, is incorrect. It arises by virtue of a failure to distinguish adequately between a benefit as defined in clause l(ii), which may be prohibited by the hon. Minister in terms of clause 12 and a trade coupon as defined in clause l(xiv) which is subject to absolute provisions pursuant to clause 10, unless exempted in terms of clause 11. A &#x201C;trade coupon&#x201D; is anything that entitles the holder to receive a benefit or to participate in a competition for a benefit. It is not the benefit itself. To give a sample therefore, is not to give something which entitles you to receive a benefit or to compete for it. It is a benefit in itself. However, to give a token to get a free sample would in fact be prevented. For example to participate in a radio programme without tokens and to receive a prize in a game of skill, will not be a trade coupon and will not be prohibited. However, to receive a token in such a programme which entitles the participant to receive a benefit or to compete for a benefit, would be a trade coupon. Competitions on the radio or on television, when it comes, which involve a degree of skill and which do not involve the handing over of something, to enter or compete, are not hit by these provisions. I believe that in respect of giving tokens to enable people to enter or to receive this, I believe that there should be an amendment.</p>

<p>There should also be amendments in order to allow consumers to purchase goods at a discount and to get tokens in respect of them and there should be tokens to allow them to send for samples. There should also be tokens to allow them participation in competitions as advertising activity without payment by an entrant. I believe that all this can be achieved by amendments and does not in itself justify the rejection of this entire Bill. There are other, however, matters which I believe justify the rejection of this Bill and those are infringements on the rule of law. To that end, I too want to move an amendment:</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, while approving the principles contained in the Trade Practices Bill in terms of which the issue of certain trade coupons is to continue to be prohibited and consumers are to be protected against misleading advertisements and undesirable trade practices, declines to pass the Second Reading of the Bill because it embodies provisions which infringe basic concepts of the rule of law.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I want to motivate this by saying that one can observe all three principles contained in this legislation without infringing the rule of law. If there are to be inroads, into the accepted principles of the law of contract, the fundamental rights should, however, continue to be observed.</p>

<p>Let me examine the inroads into the rule of law. Firstly, clause 6. This enables the Secretary to get any information relating to any business. There is no protection against self-incrimination while we believe that there should be no obligation to incriminate <span class="col_2885-2886" refersTo="page_1458"/>and protection should, therefore, be incorporated here. Secondly, in terms of clause 7, the inspectors can, without notice or even a suspicion of an offence and without a specific warrant, enter, seize and open. There should, surely, be a warrant for a specific business which is to be examined and for specific offences which are to be investigated. Businessmen should not have their businesses ruined by the seizure of goods for offences which may never be proved. On top of it all, there is no compensation for damages, even if innocent or even if the inspector has acted negligently. The hon. the Minister will recollect the debate which has recently taken place in this House on the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill. The provisions in regard to search and seizure in this piece of legislation are more Draconian in many respects.</p>

<p>The third instance is that the hon. Minister is being given power to discriminate between businesses and even persons, in terms of clause 12(2) and clause 17(3) for example. One cannot have one law for one person and another law for another person or one law for one business and another law for another business. Law should apply to all and should not differentiate between person and person. The fourth is a form of censorship, which I believe is unnecessary, and which is introduced in terms of clause 14 on which. I will enlarge upon shortly. The fifth instance is that in some cases decisions may be made without giving the effected persons a hearing and certainly with no right to cross-examine or to give and lead evidence. For example, under clause 17 there is to be no hearing at all while there is no right to cross-examine in terms of clause 16. The sixth point in regard to the breach of the rule of law is that there is no right of appeal, against ministerial decisions to a court of law. Clause 16 should, in our opinion, be amended to allow for this. The seventh point is that there is a presumption of guilt against the owner of a business in respect of the actions of his employees and he cannot rebut this by proving that he gave instructions to his employees not to carry out the said actions. Here we already have seven infringements of the rule of law which are unnecessary and unwarranted and which should be removed from this legislation if it is to be passed.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with prohibition against advertisements which are misleading or false. I want to make special reference to clauses 9 and 13. The common law already provides civil remedies for misrepresentation and penalizes such misrepresentations if it is made with knowledge of a falsity or is a fraud. There can be no objection to legislation against false advertisements. The intention, no doubt, is to achieve clarity about the law and also to enable members of the public to obtain relief from the criminal courts without expense. I want to make a number of points here. Firstly, it is not entirely clear from the provisions of clause 21(1) whether it is the intention to create a new civil remedy as well. In our view this should not be the case and we shall move an amendment accordingly. For a reason which is very difficult to understand the clause on page 16 of the Bill has the following provision&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The waiver, either expressly or implied, by any consumer of any right which&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) is conferred upon him by this Act;<br/>or</li>

<li>(b) is conferred upon him by any provision of any other law, if such waiver will derogate from any provision of this Act;</li>

</ol>

<p>One cannot waive the provisions of the criminal law. Presumably then, there must be a reason why a waiver is included here. I think we need to be told whether, in fact, the hon. the Minister has in mind that there should be civil remedies flowing from this particular provision.</p>

<p>The second aspect to which I should like to refer is the fact that a major advertising medium is the radio. In due course, I have no doubt, television will also become one. It is therefore surprising that these media are not expressly mentioned in the definition of &#x201C;advertisement&#x201D;, in clause 1(i). Although these media are referred to in broad terms in clause 1(i)(c), we feel that they should be expressly mentioned.</p>

<p>Thirdly, in our modern business world there is not only fraud to induce sales and services. There is also fraud in respect of leasing and hiring. These provisions are not included in the reference to &#x201C;consumers&#x201D; in clause 1(v), nor under the term &#x201C;sell&#x201D; in clause 1(xi). We believe that these media should be included.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the introduction of the Post Office Budget yesterday represented the annual assault of the Government in its traditional battle against the backlog. Although the Budget has indicated to us that a valiant effort has been made on the part of those concerned in trying to win this battle, I am afraid that the enemy is still entrenched and the backlog remains as it was. In some respects the enemy is even more firmly entrenched than before while in other respects we see some signs of the strategy having resulted in a potential breakthrough. Financially&#x2014;if I may use the same metaphor&#x2014;the Government is using the wrong troops. It is using the battle-weary user of the telecommunications system as its permanent front-line troops. It expects the same people who have been carrying the burden to continue to carry it. It is also stretching its manpower resources too thinly over the field. Here I would like to pay tribute to those people who are bearing the tremendous strain of trying to provide an efficient service for South Africa without the wherewithal to make this possible. I have some experience of the hours worked, of the sacrifices made by those who have been involved particularly during some of the breakdown periods like the floods in the Transvaal and in other areas. I know what they have done to try to restore services as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I repeat that the Government is using the battle-worn and battle-weary telephone user as its main financial weapon. It is not calling up its reserves because it has not got the reserves to call up. At long last this year it has called for new weapons but it knows and the department knows that it will be years before those weapons can be brought into action.</p>

<p>Unfortunately our time is extremely limited in this debate. The official Opposition has a total of only 70 minutes for this entire debate. It is therefore necessary for us to try to pinpoint our criticisms of this Budget. This I want to do by moving the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the Post Office Appropriation Bill because, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></block>

<ol>

<li>(1) the proposed method of financing capital expenditure will&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) place an unnecessary burden on the public of nearly 38 million rands in increased tariffs during the next year;</li>

<li>(b) necessitate ever-increasing tariff rises in every following year; and</li>

<li>(c) result in present users of telecommunications services carrying an unfair share of the capital cost of all postal services to future users;</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) there is no evidence of imaginative action to solve the critical shortage of technical and semi-technical personnel; and</li>

<li>(3) the country is consequently faced with having an inefficient telephone service for an indefinite period ahead.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>This amendment that I have moved pinpoints our three main complaints. There is one in the financial field, one in regard to staff shortages and one in regard to the Government&#x2019;s failure to win the battle of the backlog.</p>

<p>*Firstly I want to mention that we noticed that the hon. the Minister, like the <span class="col_2889-2890" refersTo="page_1460"/>hon. the Minister of Transport, deviated from the tradition of a one-language speech, the tradition of using English and Afrikaans alternately, by using both languages in his speech. As I said in another debate, we support this. I believe that the more often we use both languages in this House, the better it is for bilingualism in this country.</p>

<p>In the first place I want to deal with capital expenditure. The hon. the Minister told us that he had achieved the ideal of 50%-50% from revenue and loan funds in this Budget. When it was first suggested, we opposed this principle. We opposed it again last year. I should like to quote from last year&#x2019;s Hansard of 13 February 1974 what the hon. member for Constantia said in this regard (col. 824)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We on this side of the House have never agreed with the recommendation of the Franzsen Commission. We believe that financing such a high percentage as 50% from internal sources, means that revenue charges have to be set at a higher level than is necessary and the result is inflationary.</block>

<p>&#x2020;In 1972 he said the following in connection with the formula, and I quote from Hansard of 23 March, column 4050&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first is what the effect of this policy is on the tariff structure of the Post Office and to what extent tariffs will have to be increased in order to carry out the policy of generating internal finance for capital expenditure.</block>

<p>*As far back as 1972, and on several occasions last year, we warned that tariffs would have to be increased continually if 50% of capital expenditure had to be covered from Revenue. We are even more opposed to this Budget which is before the House today. The hon. the Minister said in his Budget speech that he was meeting 50% of his capital expenditure from Loan Account and 50% from Revenue Account, but obviously that is incorrect. What are the facts? The fact is that the capital expenditure in this Budget amounts to R213 million and that only R94 million of that amount is being defrayed from the Loan Account. In other words, only 44% of the capital expenditure is being defrayed from Loan Account and 55% from Revenue Account&#x2014;an amount of R112 million.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that telecommunications alone, not the total capital Budget of the Post Office, will require an additional capital expenditure of R1000 million over the next ten years. That is the figure forecast in the brochure on the new telephone system received yesterday. That means, Sir, that R100 million a year will have to be found. If we follow this principle, then whereas this year tariffs have had to be increased to find R38 million, next year they will have to be increased even more to find a larger amount and the following year they will have to be increased further to find a larger amount&#x2014; exactly what the hon. member for Constantia warned about in 1972. He warned that if this formula was followed, tariffs would have to be increased each year to find the additional money. Sir, telephone services are budgeted for 15 years. Some of them last longer. Some of the telephone equipment that we are using now is 50 or 60 years old, but let us take 15 years, and let us shorten the amortization period to ten years. The position then is that if that money is funded partly by loans, today&#x2019;s user, instead of having to pay R50 million of the R100 million spent each year on telecommunications, will have to repay one-tenth of the capital each year plus interest. That means that if you took it to its utmost and took into account depreciation over a period of ten years, your telecommunications user would be paying a far higher annual amount than he would have to pay by amortizing loan funds. Let us take the repayment at 20%&#x2014;10% capital redemption and 10% interest. It would be much less, of course, and it would only be for half the period because you would be making capital redemption payments each year. Over ten years the telecommunications user would pay R200 million towards the capital account, whereas if 50% of that R1 000 million is funded by revenue then in the same ten years he is going to pay R500 million, a difference of R300 million or two and a half times as much. Sir. the Post Office is a monopoly. It could not survive otherwise, because it could not be competitive if it had to finance its capital programme on this basis. What is happening is that the telecommunications user of today is being forced to pay for capital services for users of the future. Today we are having to pay for the capital which is required to supply telephones for future generations. Just as we are opposed to this 50% formula, so are we even more opposed <span class="col_2891-2892" refersTo="page_1461"/>to the suggestion of a unitary Budget which will disguise the extent to which every person who makes a telephone call is contributing twice as much as he needs to, in order to pay for a telephone call that his children will make in ten years&#x2019; time.</p>

<p>The telephone and telecommunications service is to the Post Office what highrated traffic is to the S.A. Railways. It is the goose that lays the golden egg, the telephone user being the goose. He is being made a goose of by this system. In this year there will be some 6% or 7% more telephones supplied to the public and there will be 15% more traffic. However, the profit, according to the last figures that we have has gone up by 66%. So, where you get 6% more telephones and 15% more traffic, the telecommunications profit has gone up by 66%, from a figure of R30 million to R50 million. On top of that R50 million we are now being asked to pay a tariff increase amounting to R37,5 million, that is over and above the R50 million profit which they have shown in the last year. Surely it is a basic business principle that increased turnover means a greater profit, which in turn means lower tariffs or prices, but in the hands of this hon. Minister increased turnover means increased profits plus higher tariffs. It just does not make sense. That is the first and one of the major objections which we have to this Budget.</p>

<p>The chaotic situation which we have in the telephone services of South Africa is, what is more, an indefinite one. We realize there are reasons. There has been bad weather, there has been this, that and the other. Last year for instance. I suggested a disaster squad which would be available to fly into a flooded area to help to deal with the disaster situation. It was not taken very seriously, if one judges by what happened on the Witwatersrand earlier this year.</p>

<p>Whatever figures one may quote, and however one may blind people with statistics, facts remain facts, and one of the facts is that the telephone service in South Africa today is a shambles. On the Witwatersrand in particular, they have had representation after representation; and even people pleading that the nerves of their telephonists are so shattered that they are having to have medical attention, because the strain of being a telephonist is more than many people can take. I must say that in the short time that I was in Durban during January, it was the worst period that I have ever experienced in so far as dialling was concerned. There were wrong numbers, premature engaged signals, the cutting off of calls half-way and crossed lines; it was simply chaotic. So whatever statistics one may bring along, the fact is that the telephone service is chaotic and a shambles. In the battle of the backlog, I regret that the Government is on the losing side. There is no point however in flogging a dead telephone, and I think that we should appeal to the Government to try to look for some immediate steps and to tell us, for instance &#x2014;I ask the hon. the Minister to tell us&#x2014; what he is doing about investigations in depth into the reasons for cable faults. The hon. member for South Coast will deal with this in more detail; as an engineer he can deal with it more technically. This is the sort of thing we want to know. What is being done to deal with the situation? Has thought been given, for instance, to seeing that when a new township is set up it should be a condition of that township&#x2019;s development that telephone cables are laid to service that township? What sort of cooperation is there between town planning and the Post Office? Does the Post Office know what future town planning is? It does not seem like it, because when a new township appears it often takes years before the people who move into that township can get a telephone service. What sort of planning is that? What is the breakdown? What is being done to ensure the sort of co-operation and the advance planning that is necessary? Local authorities demand that if a block of flats is built telephone connection pipes are laid for telephones. Surely that principle could be extended to the provision of cables for a whole new development area.</p>

<p>And what about the recruitment for the 2 600 technical and semi-technical people we are short of in the Post Office? There is nothing imaginative about the recruiting. There are advertisements in the newspapers or a trip overseas to look for people. Particularly with the recession in Europe now we should be able to pick up qualified People, but our recruiting is unimaginative. We think we have reached the end of the world when we find 100 Black people who can be trained. We should be training a thousand, and you cannot tell me that there are no Black people looking for work and wanting to be trained. You cannot tell me they are not available. What is wrong is that we are not going out to look <span class="col_2893-2894" refersTo="page_1462"/>for them. There is no imagination in our whole approach to our recruiting. I want to ask whether the SABC is carrying its share of the capital burden, or whether the telephone user has to carry it. We read for instance that there are 7 000 km of microwave and 500 km coaxial cable&#x2014;a capital investment of R8 million in preparation for television alone. What proportion of that capital is the SABC paying, not to mention the FM reception in Durban which apparently cannot be heard because of television? Sir, I have not the time but I have here a full page of suggestions which I will possibly be able to complete during the Third Reading debate. These deal with the unprofitable services and labour intensive services in regard to which the only answer of the Post Office is that where there is labour intensive service, the tariff must be pushed up or the service reduced. That is their only answer. If the service is unproductive or unprofitable they push up the tariffs.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I will give you my answers, Sir. Bring in your postal user and let him make his contribution. I have six positive proposals which I will make at a later stage of the debate to show how the user, if given the right inducement, can adjust his normal business practice to remove much of the labour intensive work of the Post Office. The businessman is doing it anyway and by proper liaison and co-ordination he can use the same amount of labour and divert it to the right direction to take the burden off the Post Office. There can be more mechanization. Stamp machines could be equipped to put the code on envelopes so that when letters are posted they go straight into the sorting machine. There are all sorts of imaginative ideas which we do not get implemented because the Post Office is a monopoly. It is a monopoly and therefore has no competition. I believe this House can provide some of the challenge which competition would provide in private enterprise and I suggest to the Government members that they try to shake their brains up somehow and make even one contribution to help the Post Office.</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the hon. member for Durban Point, and I have the amendment which he moved, in front of me. I shall refer to it in the course of my speech. It reminds me of an old saying, but I shall not quote it because it is unparliamentary and the wrong inferences may perhaps be drawn from it. Sir, the hon. member began his attack by referring to the 50/50 formula. I want to tell the hon. member that he did not do his homework. The hon. member said that 55% of the financing will come from revenue. Surely that is not the case. I should like to quote what the Franzsen Commission had to say at the time concerning the source from which this revenue should be derived. After they had referred to the 50% which should be financed from loans, they said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The remaining 50% of the capital requirements ought to be financed from funds generated by the Post Office itself and which ought to cover the following: (a) depreciation, consisting of (i) provision for the replacement of assets at historic costs; (ii) additional provision to cover the higher costs which will be applicable when the assets are actually replaced; and (iii) provision for the possible earlier replacement of assets as a result of technological development; and (b) the surplus of revenue over expenditure. This surplus of the Post Office should also cover the annual redemption payments in respect of outstanding loans.</block>

<p>According to this direction of the Franzsen Commission we are far behind as far as this redemption from revenue is concerned. That is not what that hon. member and his party are alleging. After all, the data is very clear. There are loans to the amount of R40 million from the State, R13 million plus the R30 million of the Post Office Savings Bank, and foreign loans to the amount of R11,5 million. Surely the surplus of R13 million is not derived from revenue. The hon. member is trying to imply that it derives from revenue. Surely it is not revenue.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Is it a loan?</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from><span class="col_2895-2896" refersTo="page_1463"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>It is a loan. This amount of R13 million is, in one respect, financing of creditors, the utilization of credit facilities. It also derives from bank overdrafts on which the Post Office can rely. It derives from moneys which are in transit. Let me put it to the hon. member in this way: Suppose it were not available now. These moneys which we are now voting must be paid and will be paid. There is no other revenue, of any nature whatsoever, from which this R13 million can be financed. The Post Office has the power to borrow from the State or to borrow money overseas, and it can do so on its own. If that money cannot be obtained from revenue or from these other sources which I have mentioned, then loans have to be raised. These are, therefore, loans. Sir, even if I discuss only this one aspect this afternoon, I think it would be useful if we were to elaborate a little on this. The Franzsen Commission stated very clear that provision ought to be made for the replacement of assets at historic costs. That is the price which was paid for the assets which has to be written off. What is the position now in respect of the assets of the Post Office? Here we now have the position of exchanges and instruments that are obsolete and worn out. Although they can still be used for ten, 15 or 20 years, it does not pay the Post Office to continue to do so. They have to replaced. In other words, the total cost of those assets now has to be written off. The Franzsen Commission rightly went on to point out that the replacement value of assets should be used in future, because the assets which have to be purchased in future will then cost far more than what they cost five or 10 years ago. This question of inflationary bookkeeping is, by the way, something which the business world is discussing at length today. What does the hon. member want to do with that figure? When we purchase an asset, such as the new telephone service, can he tell us that that asset is going to last for 40 or 50 years before becoming obsolete? Adequate provision should be made now for the writing off of that asset against revenue, so that the future generation, when it in turn has to purchase a new asset, does not have to pay too much. The hon. member states in his amendment that we are taxing the future generation to the extent of R38 million. Surely that is not true. Where does the hon. member get that from? I want to tell the hon. member that that is not the case. I shall return to that point again at a later stage in my speech.</p>

<p>The hon. member states that there is a tremendous backlog in the provision of telephones. Does the hon. member realize that the applications for services which have not yet been provided in relation to the telephone services which are being provided, is only 4,95%? This percentage is the lowest for the backlog in telephones since 1968. It has never been so low. Everything in this country is growing and flourishing and the hon. member should not try to imply now that this situation is so deplorable while the backlog of telephones is so low. The hon. member forgets one thing, which is that South Africa is growing and flourishing as a result of the good work of this hon the Minister and this National Party Government. People who have never before wanted a telephone are now applying for one.</p>

Shakespeare said: &#x201C;Mine honour is my life; both grow in one; Take honour from me and my life is done.&#x201D; Apparently the hon. members on that side of the House do not want to give the hon. the Minister, the Post Office and its staff the credit which is due to them. I think that life will pass the hon. members by if they are not careful.</p>

<p>I want to refer again to the tariffs. The hon. member complained about the tariffs which have been increased. I want to ask him who is complaining about that. On 29 January the hon. the Minister announced that the tariffs would be raised with effect from 1 April. The hon. the Minister gave <span class="col_2897-2898" refersTo="page_1464"/>an undertaking to commerce and industry that they would be informed in good time of when the tariffs were going to be raised, so that they could set their own house in order. I just want to tell hon. members what happened. Who did in fact complain? Not commerce, not industry; in fact, no one complained when those tariffs were announced. The most criticism that was levelled at us came from Mr. Arthur Grobbelaar of Tucsa. He said, according to <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 30 January 1975 [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<p>Although the increase is understandable, it will unfortunately be an added incentive to inflation. However, if the Post Office utilizes the revenue to expand and improve its services, one can adopt a sympathetic approach to this matter. However, I think that this will badly undermine the country&#x2019;s efforts to combat inflation.</p>

<p>This was the worst criticism he had to level at it. What have we actually done now? South Africa as a whole wants better service. The hon. member asked for more telephones, but he does not want to pay for them. He wants the bulk to come from loan funds. He and his party want to pass on the cost of what they are enjoying today to the future generations. That is not justifiable. That is not fair. Surely we cannot burden future generations with tremendous loans. In any case, if we were to raise major loans, where is the interest to come from which has to alleviate the burden? What is more, where is all the money to come from to repay the debt? It must, after all, come from revenue. He may score for one year, but after that he will be in the same boat again. We are doing this in accordance with a far sounder and more scientific method. Let us consider the increased tariffs for a while. The hon. member stated that the telecommunications system should not finance or subsidize the Post Office, that is, if I understood him correctly.</p>

<p>Let us consider the tariffs which will be raised, as has been announced. What has happened in respect of telecommunications? Let us consider automatic trunk calls in the first place. It is true that the relevant tariffs have been increased, but the tariff increase became unavoidable owing to the sharp rise in maintenance and operating costs. How can we prevent the tariffs from being increased if the operating costs have risen? Everything in the country has become more expensive. Salaries and wages have increased. There are an enormous number of things the Post Office must have, and which have to be imported. The cost of these things has also gone up. The tariff for an automatic trunk call of three minutes over 100 km was 16 cents and has now become 24 cents. What is the situation overseas? In the United Kingdom, for example, the corresponding tariff is 28,5 cents as against 24 cents in South Africa. In West Germany the tariff is as high as 90 cents. There is therefore a considerable difference if we compare our country with other countries. Only when we compare the tariff with that in other countries can we see how low our tariff really still is. We should be grateful that the tariffs in South Africa are so low; we should not kick up a fuss about them. Let us consider the tariff for manually dialled trunk calls in South Africa, based on a call of three minutes. The minimum cost of a manually dialled call is already more than 25 cents, and it is increasing rapidly. At the existing tariffs of four cents, nine cents and 18 cents for calls over distances up to 100 km, the basic costs are not nearly being recovered. Surely we cannot allow this position to continue. Who has to bear that cost now? Surely one cannot allow nine cents to be charged for a call while the actual cost involved is 25 cents. Who is going to subsidize this system. The hon. member for Durban Point or the next speaker on his side must give us this information.</p>

<p>Telephone rentals have increased from R36 to R42 per annum. The present rental does not cover the fixed annual cost at all. Once again, by whom or from what source should that cost be redeemed? I want to mention as an examule the annual rental for telephone exchanges in certain countries of Western Europe. It appears that the position in Western Europe is far worse than it is in South Africa where we are paying R42 per annum. In West Germany the rental is R100-32, in the United Kingdom R39-60, which compares very favourably with ours, and in Holland R64-80. Consequently there is a considerable difference in comparison with what we are paying in South Africa. I think that we are fortunate that we have a Minister and a department which are providing telephone services in this country at a relatively low cost. The telephone installation <span class="col_2899-2900" refersTo="page_1465"/>fee in this country was only increased from R20 to R30. This does not even cover the labour and transportation costs involved, and those costs are increasing all the time. In the United Kingdom this costs R63-50, in West Germany R52-20, in Holland R51-30 and in Sweden R46-50, although Sweden is an extremely wealthy country which ought to be able to do it for less. We therefore compare extremely favourably with the rest of the world. In fact, we are the cheapest of all. In respect of all the sectors I have mentioned there is not one country which compares favourably with us except in the case of telephone rentals in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Let us look at the conveyance of post. I want to express my gratitude today for the fact that an adjustment has been made in this regard. A change has now been made in the case of commercial articles, second class postal articles, which are not the same as printed matter and samples. The tariff has been increased from two cents to three cents per 50 g. Do you know, Sir, that the estimated loss during 1974-&#x2019;75 on these second class postal articles&#x2014;i.e. primarily commercial articles, will be between R8 million and R10 million? Consequently there is no justification for despatching commercial articles, including statements of account and Christmas cards at this low tariff any further. I therefore think that it is a very good thing that these tariffs have been increased. What is the situation in respect of our newspapers and periodicals which are despatched? Since 1925 this material has been sent through the post at ¼ cent for 250 g. Only in 1971 was this increased to &#x00BD; cent. Now it is being increased to two cents per 250 g. Surely this tariff for newspapers and periodicals is therefore highly uneconomical. The loss in respect of the conveyance of this material consequently amounts to R3 million. Why should the Post Office finance and subsidize this section from other sources? The hon. member must tell us why, or does he not agree that these tariffs had to be increased? The question is why the newspapers and periodicals should be subsidized, and on whose part this should be done. The increased tariffs which they are now going to pay will only bring in an amount of R879 000. This is not a major increase. It looks like a high tariff, but it does not mean a great deal of money for the State. There is still a tremendous loss. So we can continue to enumerate whole series of these things. However, I feel that it is not necessary to convince the hon. member further that things are as they should be.</p>

<p>We would do well to consider the function of the Post Office. We passed a law here. I am relying on the hon. member&#x2019;s good judgment, and I want to tell him what is stated in the 1968 Act. I am referring to section two, which I am going to quote to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The affairs of the department shall be administered on business principles, due regard being had to the promotion by means of efficient postal and telecommunication services, of commerce, industry and agriculture in all parts of the Republic, and to the promotion of the Republic&#x2019;s foreign trade.</block>

<p>Included in this, apart from the Post Office having to be a business undertaking, is the statement that services may be rendered, and in general this is the view which should be adopted here. We know that the Act provides that if a service is rendered at a loss the Controller and Auditor-General shall submit an account annually, which may be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. If the hon. member is of the opinion that a service is being rendered by the Post Office here which should in fact be financed from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, why does the hon. member not point this out to the hon. the Minister and say: &#x201C;This service should be subsidized by the Central Exchequer&#x201D;? The means are there for the hon. member to do this. Why does the hon. member not put forward a proposal that a specific service should be subsidized?</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not have very much time. We can argue this matter further during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p><span class="col_2901-2902" refersTo="page_1466"/>There is another aspect I want to discuss which is this: What else is the Post Office doing in general? I want to put the hon. member wise to the fact that apart from a few things which he could perhaps think of, the Post Office is in many respect not merely supplying telephones and delivering letters. There are many other services which the Post Office is rendering. There is, for example, the tremendous building programme which the Post Office has to undertake itself. In this country it is expensive to do this; it is not all that easy. We cannot simply connect up a telephone every day. The big problem is to establish the exchanges first. The building has to be erected, and then the exchanges have to be put into operation. The necessary material and machinery has to be imported. In addition we in South Africa have the difficult position that it is not always possible to deliver the equipment on time. The hon. member knows that just as well as I do. We cannot blame the department and the hon. the Minister for things which are not as they should be. I want to repeat that the Post Office does not merely provide telephones and deliver letters, but that it renders other services as well. The hon. member himself has probably seen the wonderful Post Office annual report. I want to thank the hon. the Minister and the department for the wonderful annual report. It is as complete as one could wish it to be. I am speaking on behalf of this side of the House when we express our appreciation in this regard. Not one of us will object, because it is such a good and excellent report.</p>

<p>On page 62 of the report mention is made of the agency services. Do hon. members realize that an amount of R370,7 million is being handled by the officials of the Post Office, whether in the form of payments, or in the form of moneys which are collected? I should like to enumerate the whole series: Community Development&#x2014; collection of rental and loan redemption; customs and excise; inland revenue; provincial administration (Cape); pensions which are paid&#x2014;a service which is being rendered to our old people. Let us now see what our post office receives in return. They receive a meagre remuneration for this. No one else will collect this money for the commission the Post Office receives for it. In addition there are the pensions of the S.A. Railways that are being paid, and there is the work which is being done for the Treasury. Surely the Post Office is performing a great task and we should be grateful for this.</p>

<p>I just want to make the position very clear to the Opposition. When we think of the Post Office, we must also think of the minor sacrifices which those people make. Although they regard these as minor sacrifices, these are of great importance to South Africa. This reminds me of something Emerson once said, namely that good manners consist of small sacrifices. It would be good manners if this House of Assembly also acknowledged the minor sacrifices of the Post Office workers on behalf of South Africa. I referred to the money which is being collected. The Post Office receives only 2% on the sale of revenue stamps and licences, 1% on the amount paid in respect of loan levy certificates, one-eighth per cent on credit issues and 2&#x00BD;% on direct sales in respect of excise stamps on tobacco, and so on. I can continue to enumerate the whole series. I think the Post Office is rendering very good service to the people of South Africa. I think hon. members ought to take that aspect into consideration.</p>

<p>I now want to consider another matter. The hon. the Minister told us yesterday that the public should co-operate as far as our postal codes are concerned. However, there are many other spheres as well in which the public can make matters far easier for the Post Office. I am thinking, <i>inter alia,</i> of the postmen. Frequently there are no letter boxes on garden gates. I want to make an appeal to our people to place a letter-box at every gate. We also find that the letter-boxes for blocks of flats assume all kinds of shapes and sizes. Our people should preferably put up standard letter-boxes in all blocks of flats. I do not know through what channels the appeal should be made, perhaps over the radio or perhaps in the Press. However, if the people of South. Africa would all help, the delivery of post would take place far more easily. We know that the Post Office is in arrears with the provision of telephones. We also know that one frequently cannot get through when one makes a call. However, I think that we should try to make telephone conversations briefer. We should be more judicious in the use of the telephone. This applies to all of us. I also think that we can apply standardization to a greater extent as far as the size of envelopes and postal articles which have to be delivered are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_2903-2904" refersTo="page_1467"/>In conclusion I want to say thank you very much to the Minister for the fact that Pretoria is now going to be given a post office which will be worthy of the capital. I said in the Railway debate that Cape Town and Johannesburg had their beautiful stations, but that Pretoria did not yet have a station or a post office which was worthy of this capital. Let us be given a post office there which will not only attract attention from all quarters, but which will also be able to render good service and redound to the credit of us all. I also want to ask that when this post office is being finalized and given its final touches, we shall bear in mind the past history, the historical events which took place on that square, and in which, the building which is going to disappear possibly played a part. We hope that some symbol of or link to the history of the past will remain, so that we do not lose that link.</p>

<p>A microwave tower is to be erected on Lucasrand. This happens to be in my constituency. We do not know when work on this tower will be commenced, and therefore we would be pleased if the hon. the Minister could perhaps, at this stage, give us a little information in regard to what has been decided. We know about all the speculation concerning it&#x2014;for example whether there is going to be a restaurant or not. We would ask that the construction of that microwave tower be expedited so that Pretoria, in which there is at present a good service, but in which there are also justifiable complaints, may also have that service, and particularly, too, in view of the fact that we are going to have television next year. It would be a good thing if it will also be possible for us to watch television.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to say this to the hon. the Minister: Thank you very much for this Budget and thank you very much for the excellent way in which the Post Office and its officers have during the past year dealt with the affairs of the country. I want to say that we consider ourselves fortunate at having been able, at these low tariffs, to have received so many services from this hon. Minister.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Sunnyside has told us that we are lagging far behind with the 50/50 formula as far as the spending from revenue funds is concerned. I do not know where he got that from. If he refers to page 1 of the Estimates of Capital Expenditure he will see the financing resources. If he adds only those first two amounts, i.e. amounts from revenue and provision for depreciation and high replacement costs of capital assets, he will see that these amount to R112,2 million. This is derived from revenue, from a revenue source, and represents more than half the total amount of R213 million. I therefore do not know to what the hon. member was referring when he told us that we were lagging far behind in respect of the 50% expenditure. To my mind we have exceeded the spending from revenue funds, because it exceeds 50%.</p>

<p>The hon. member also objected to the fact that we want to burden future generations with the amount of R38 million. This is as far as the increased tariffs are concerned. The hon. member said he felt that future generations should not pay interest and redemption in respect of capital assets on which money is being spent at present. In this case I cannot understand the hon. member either. If he had read the report in connection with the new telephone dialling system, he would have seen that under the present dispensation as far as the telephone exchange is concerned, we have equipment which has been in use for more than 80 years. I am sure that the equipment we are going to purchase now will not have become obsolete in 10 or 20 years&#x2019; time. I believe it will still be useful in 50 years&#x2019; time. Therefore, I cannot follow the argument of the hon. member at all. We are now buying durable equipment which we hope will last as long as the old equipment we are still using today.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that every one wants a telephone and that this is the reason for a shortage of telephones. This is quite correct. Everyone wants a motorcar and everyone wants a refrigerator. Life does not stand still. I do not know whether the hon. member is perhaps retrogressing. [Interjections.] The hon. member also said that no one complained about the new tariffs. He told us that the people who said that they are glad that new tariffs had been introduced, had said they were sure the services would improve because increased tariffs had been introduced. I do not know whether the hon. member could go and tell this to his voters. I do not think I could go and tell this to my voters. The hon. the Minister has already told us we must not think that we would be getting improved services simply because tariffs had been increased. He told us we <span class="col_2905-2906" refersTo="page_1468"/>would have to struggle along in this way for the next four or five years. The hon. member also referred to the unavoidably high operating costs. He says this is inevitable.</p>

<p>Sir, I think there are many things which could be avoided. One of the things which could be avoided is the money which is still being spent on apartheid in post offices today. Let us do away with those signs in our post offices. Let us remove the partitions and built-in cubicles we find in our post offices. We could then use the same staff to serve everyone. I am sure that we would be able to reduce the operating costs of the Post Office in this way. I really do not see any need for maintaining apartheid in the post offices. The hon. the Prime Minister said we should have a totally new dispensation in regard to the different races in this country. We should be satisfied to be served on an equal footing with the other races in post offices. We are quite satisfied to be served on an equal footing with them in the shops, in the banks and in the building societies. Why could we not be served on an equal footing with them in a post office? I think these are costs which could be avoided.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir. I have only 20 minutes. I do not think I shall have time to reply to questions. Perhaps the hon. member could put his question at a later stage.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, the hon. member for Durban Point says in the amendment moved by him that there is no evidence of imaginative action to solve the critical shortage of technical and semi-technical personnel in this Budget presented by the hon. the Minister. The Minister in his speech, on page 2, says that there is a very serious shortage, and on page 3 he says that there is a shortage of 2 600 personnel in the technical and semi-technical fields. Sir, I wonder if part of the Minister&#x2019;s trouble is not the fact that he does not treat his staff well. I think that is probably part of the trouble, because if he looks at the reply that he gave to question 28 on 14 March he will see that in connection with telephone exchange operators, he expects them to work an average of 8&#x00BD; hours a day, and in addition they work an average of 2¾ hours a day overtime, a total of 11 hours. What time do they get off during the day? For lunch they get 30 minutes and the very maximum they can get for tea is 20 minutes, a total of 50 minutes therefore in a working day of 11 hours. I think that is disgraceful. I believe that unless the Minister is prepared to improve the conditions of telephone operators he is not going to get more telephone operators. He is going to go on getting the resignations that he is getting at present. Sir, if that applies to telephone operators I think it probably applies to other staff as well. I think it is high time the hon. the Minister went into this question of the working conditions of his staff. I think if he went into it properly, he would find that there are many improvements which could be brought about, and I think he would then find that his requirement campaign would improve by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another question in regard to staff and that is the training of non-Whites. What does the Minister say? He has a very lame excuse. He says that he cannot train more non-Whites because the availability of instructors and training facilities are limiting factors. Surely in a time of serious crisis and shortage of personnel he must make provision for that. Surely he must provide the instructors and facilities. If they are not there today, then he must provide them for tomorrow, and if he could not provide them last year then he must provide them in this financial year, but the Minister does not say anything about this in his speech&#x2014;not a word. I say that the hon. member for Durban Point is quite correct when he says the hon. the Minister is quite unimaginative in regard to his staff shortages. I suggest that the hon. the Minister should go into this matter and see whether he cannot tell us, when he replies to this debate, what he has in mind. Can he hire premises? Can he build premises? Can he get facilities? Where can he get instructors? Can he train them? Or is his trouble that he only has White instructors and does not want them to instruct non-Whites? That might be the reason. In any event, let him tell us what the reason is.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot understand it. Another reason why I say that the hon. member for Durban Point is correct is that we are now in the electronic era <span class="col_2907-2908" refersTo="page_1469"/>and electronics is a most fascinating job. Everybody who has worked with electronics says it is a most fascinating job and they do not want to leave the job. What is wrong then? There must be something wrong with the way in which the Minister is training these people in electronics. Is he not making it attractive enough, or is he making them work too long hours? What is the reason? There is another strange thing. I notice in RP.13 of 1975, on page 6, under the item &#x201C;Miscellaneous&#x201D;, there is an item 1(4), which refers to incentive bonuses. I do not know for what purpose the incentive bonus was used during this financial year, but for whatever purpose it was used, the Minister says that he is going to spend R190 000 on incentive bonuses during this year. But what does he propose for next year? He proposes a very great reduction. He only proposes using R55 000 for incentive bonuses. There must be some reason for this. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will tell us. I would think that an incentive bonus is something to help the staff to be a little more productive, or to make their work more interesting for them.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, in the very short time at my disposal I want to go on to another point, and that is the point also raised by the hon. member for Sunnyside. The hon. member for Sunnyside said that he felt that there were certain ways in which the Consolidated Income Fund could subsidize the Post Office. I do not know whether I agree with his ideas, but I also have some ideas on the subject as to how the Post Office can run at a profit in respect of some of its transactions. You will remember, Sir, that I asked a question. No. 30 on Friday, 14 March, about the basis on which Government departments paid the Post Office for services rendered to them. It was a most revealing reply. The hon. member for Sunnyside referred to one or two items, but let me read the whole lot, because this was tabled and I am afraid that nobody has really had the opportunity to study it. For the distribution and sale of revenue stamps and licences, the Post Office gets 2%<i>;</i> for the payment of loan levy certificates, 1%; for the issue of consular stamps, 1%; for the distribution and sale of tobacco excise labels, ¼% for the collection of investments in Treasury obligations, ¼%<i>;</i> repayment of savings obligations, R2-25 per certificate; for the collection of moneys on behalf of the National Housing Fund, 18,8 cents per transaction; for payment of pensions and grants, 11 cents per voucher; for the payment of Railway pensions, 8 cents per voucher, and for telephone services to the S.A Railways, 50% of the full tariff. Now, Sir, any business which is going to show a profit is certainly not going to do business on this basis. It may be argued that if they let there Government departments pay more, then in the end perhaps we will pay a little more income tax or perhaps we will have to have an indirect tax on this, that or the other, and therefore we must keep these tariffs low. But I think that is no excuse. I shall tell you why I say it is no excuse, Mr. Speaker. It is no excuse in my opinion because I believe that the Post Office is a trading organization, and as a trading organization it must strive to make a profit. It does not need to make an enormous profit, but it must strive to make a profit, and you cannot make a profit if you allow a collection fee of only ¼%. Have you ever heard of anything like that? This collection fee is really something &#x201C;uit die ou doos&#x201D;. I do not think there is a responsible business institution in the country today that would collect some of these items at under 7&#x00BD;%, and vet we are here talking in terms of figures like one-eighth per cent and 2% in the case of the sale of revenue stamps. That is no commission, no commission at all. Surely, when you handle a responsible sale like the sale of revenue stamps, you must be realistic in laying down the commission. Incidentally, I think the only reason why post offices sell revenue stamps is because it is a most responsible sale. You have to be very careful about the sale of revenue stamps, otherwise you find trafficking in these stamps and people do all sorts of things that they should not do. Now why give the Post Office only 2%? Why do they not get 10%? That would be a fair commission. Mr. Speaker, when one goes through all these items one realizes why the postal part of Posts and Telegraphs is run at a loss. It is because of all these jobs done by the Post Office for virtually nothing. I say that the hon. the Minister must not again tell us in a Budget debate that he has not changed' these tariffs. This is a way in which he can find extra money to balance his Budget. If he had this extra money from proper commissions in respect of this work done by the Post Office, he would not have had to come here today and ask for R38 million in extra tariffs. Based on these ridiculous figures which I have just referred to, in the year 1973-&#x2019;74 Government departments contributed <span class="col_2909-2910" refersTo="page_1470"/>almost R131 million to the Post Office. Let us assume that this is put on a business-like footing. Let us assume that instead of one-eighth per cent the Post Office will collect 7&#x00BD;%, that instead1 of 2% they will take 10% and that generally these tariffs are increased fivefold. That will then mean that we will be able to multiply the amount paid by Government departments to the Post Office by five. Five times R13&#x00BD; million is certainly a great deal more than the R38 million which the hon. the Minister is asking us for today.</p>

<p>Yes, of course. He would not only be able to reduce the tariffs, but he would also be able to do a great deal more in regard to those parts of the telecommunications system that have to be replaced. Cables, for example, are most important and should be replaced as soon as possible with the finest cables available, cables that can withstand the vagaries of the weather and anything else which may affect them. At the moment the Minister is completely up in the air as far as telecommunications and stored programme control are concerned. He seems to forget that although stored programme control is all very well at the end where you are going to push out messages, you have to have cables to carry the messages. Unless the Minister is prepared to do something about the cables, he is not going to have an improved service. He is going to have wonderful sending stations in the various telephone exchanges, but he certainly will not have the means of carrying those speech channels to the subscribers so that they can have unbroken conversations without crossed lines and so forth.</p>

<p>I am afraid, Mr. Speaker, that my time has almost expired. I had hoped to be able to deal also with other aspects of capital financing, but I am afraid that I shall not have the time. I want to say in conclusion that I support the amendment of the hon. member for Durban Point. I do believe that the hon. the Minister should pay particular attention to the matters raised in this debate, and give us full replies to our queries and the suggestions we have made. I do remember that on a previous occasion the hon. the Minister glossed over the rather telling question we put to him and answered only those he felt he could. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to answer these questions, because I believe that that is the only way in which, through this debate, we will get a proper telephone service, a proper telecommunications service and a proper postal service in the country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to follow up to any great extent on the remarks made by the previous hon. speaker. He spent a number of minutes on the speech preceding his, namely the speech by the hon. member for Sunnyside. He repeatedly stated that he was unable to understand the hon. member. However, that does not surprise me. I want to tell him that we understand the hon. member for Sunnyside and that the hon. member for Sunnyside understands the Budget. That is more than I can say for the hon. member for Wynberg.</p>

<p>Probably there is no question that both sides of the House&#x2014;this side of the House carries the responsibility, while the responsibility of that side of the House is to advance sound and constructive criticism&#x2014; have one thing in common, viz. that both sides desire an efficient and sound post and telecommunication system. Hon. members on both sides of the House have tried to ascertain how this is to be obtained. In the first place, thanks to a good National Party Government, which has ensured a very sound and strong economy, South Africa has a need for a sound and efficient post and telecommunication system. If a demand for a service of this kind did not exist, it would be foolish for anyone to try to provide a service. Consequently there is, in the first place, a need for a good service, and this need has been created by the sound economic policy of the National Party Government. In the second place: When one wants to establish a good service, one must have the funds for that service. I can probably say without fear of contradiction that the funds to build up a good telecommunication system do exist. One need only look at the Budget to be impressed by the amounts being budgeted. One need only look at the Budgets of the <span class="col_2911-2912" refersTo="page_1471"/>past few years to see that the funds voted are becoming progressively more every year. When I say &#x201C;progressively&#x201D;, I do not mean &#x201C;progressively&#x201D; in the sense of the Progressive Party. If, after one has established the need, one has the funds, certain material or equipment is required. The equipment can be purchased if the necessary funds are there. The final item necessary for the utilization of the funds and the equipment and the establishment of the communications system, is the human material. This is really the bottleneck in South Africa. This bottleneck exists thanks to a sound economy in South Africa in which everyone competes for the services of trained staff. I could devote all the time at my disposal to the staff question in the post and telecommunication system. I want to quote an article that appeared on the 13th of this month in <i>Hoofstad</i> [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A new dynamic spirit is prevalent among the Post Office staff, whose aim it is not only to provide better service, but also to improve the standing of the Post Office in the eyes of the public. An indication of this. Mr. Rive said, was the fact that the productivity of the Post Office has risen by 18,7% as against the National 11,8% over the past four years.</block>

<p>Since mention was made of the Postmaster-General in the extract I quoted, I want to tell the hon. Opposition that it surprises me that on the one hand they praise the Postmaster-General and his whole staff while in the same breath they blame the hon. the Minister for the rotten service. This simply does not make sense, because the two are surely linked. In any event, I shall come back to this.</p>

<p>The improved utilization of the staff is a matter that receives continual attention from the Government, I want to quote what the hon. the Minister said in his Budget speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The aim of the Post Office is still the optimum utilization of its available labour force. To this end, a new division of functions and responsibilities between engineers and technical staff has for instance, been made. With the whole-hearted support of the staff, it was possible to create a dispensation, through a restructuring of posts, in which the training and abilities of officers can be utilized to even greater advantage than before. Senior technical staff have replaced engineers on certain work phases and, as a result, engineers have been released to perform functions that do justice to their professional status and skills.</block>

<p>In other words, what is necessary to utilize the available manpower to the best advantage of South Africa and the Post Office is being done by the hon. the Minister and the top management of the Post Office. Last year the hon. the Minister had the following to say about the staff development (Hansard, Volume 50, column 2030)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to equip them adequately for their tasks, 14 officers holding senior positions in the Post Office were given the opportunity to complete the Advanced Executives Programme conducted by the Business Leadership of the University of South Africa &#x2026; The Post Office is also continuing with the presentation of seminars in modern personnel management to its supervisors at all levels. In addition to the many White supervisors who have benefited from these seminars, 60 Coloured, 20 Indian and 48 Bantu supervisors have attended similar seminars since 1971.</block>

<p>In this regard I just want to come back to what the hon. member for Wynberg said. He wants us to employ more non-Whites, but I know how they want to employ non-Whites: They want to employ them at the lowest levels. In contrast to that, the Post Office is doing outstanding work by training non-White staff in the supervisory posts as well. This is of great importance. The hon. member for Wynberg was concerned about the question of who would train the non-Whites. Well, these people will train their own people.</p>

<p>I am going to quote from Post Office documents to prove what the Post Office is doing and how thoroughly they are doing it. The staff know what they are doing with regard to every facet of the work. I should like to quote what the Postmaster-General said on the occasion of the official opening of the 40th congress of the Post and Telegraph Association of South Africa in Johannesburg on 11 March this year. Remember, this is the head of the Post Office, in whom I have the fullest confidence. In fact, I make bold to say that South Africa finds itself in a fortunate position in that it has a person like that dynamic person as the head of the Post Office, a <span class="col_2913-2914" refersTo="page_1472"/>person who is not deterred by criticism, but continues with his task. I quote what he said [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This brings us to the point at which we must realize that we shall never combat inflation as effectively as our potential allows us to unless we develop our own abilities and the abilities of those under us to their full capacity.</block>

<p>This is in fact what the Post Office is doing. He goes on [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the USA about 18% of the population is in management or the professions in some capacity. In South Africa we Whites do not constitute a full 18% of the total population. All of us together are not enough to manage effectively only the technical, professional and managerial spheres in a modern developed country.</block>

<p>The Progressive Party will probably say &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">It is true that the Post Office has taken the lead in, for example, the training of Brown and Black people as technicians and, in addition, is already training them in other spheres in our country primarily to serve their own people and to relieve the burden on us Whites.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN TONDER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I agree. However it is primarily, to serve their own people, in contrast to the Progressive Party which wants to use them primarily as slaves. I could still quote at length from the Postmaster-General&#x2019;s speech and could perhaps tell you that since 1968, more than 200 officers excluding technicians, have already obtained diplomas&#x2014;in a three-year course &#x2014;in public administration, public accounts and finance, electronic data processing, systems analysis etc., while 122 officers have obtained bachelor and master&#x2019;s degrees. At the moment 138 students are studying full-time and 40 part-time at South African universities in various key fields with the aid of Post Office bursaries. Is there anyone in South Africa who can say that the Post Office is not developing its staff situation in a dynamic way and training its people? I could quote from a number of documents bearing on the staff situation. Here is the department&#x2019;s annual report, an outstanding report. Under the heading &#x201C;Training and staff development&#x201D; the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As one of the largest employers in South Africa, the Post Office must to a large extent provide in-service training. During the year, 550 officers of all races attended seminars on modern personnel management, eight completed work study courses and 313 attended organized lectures. &#x2026; A further 45 full-, time bursaries were awarded for the 1974 academic; year: 34 B.Sc.-Electrical Engineering, 10 for B.Comm and one for B.Sc-Computer Science...</block>

<p>So one could continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Altogether 112 university students, 24 of whom are in their first year, are at present studying full-time and 31 are studying part-time at nine South African universities with the aid of Post Office bursaries extending over two to five years, depending on the duration of the course. R83 704 was spent on bursaries during the 1973-&#x2019;74 financial year.</block>

<p>Let us come back to what the Post Office itself is doing. At Olifantsfontein, between Germiston&#x2014;please note, Germiston&#x2014;and Pretoria, the Post Office&#x2019;s Olifantsfontein Training Centre is to be found. Those of us who have had the privilege of seeing what is being done there, have only the highest praise for that fine training institution at Olifantsfontein. Intensive training of technicians is undertaken at the department&#x2019;s modern and well-equipped training college built at a cost of R2 million at Olifantsfontein and commissioned in 1971. At any given juncture about 1400 technicians are at some or other stage of training and the Post Office spends about R7 500 to train just one technician. Apart from this, about 1 300 learner telephone technicians are in the process of training. In their case the training cost is about R4 040 per pupil. A technician&#x2019;s training period lasts for three or four years, depending on the course followed. As far as telephone technicians are concerned, the training extends over a <span class="col_2915-2916" refersTo="page_1473"/>period of two years. It is clear, therefore, that if one considers all the evidence, the Post Office is doing its job thoroughly.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at the existing staff. On 31 December last year the grand total of officials in the service of the Post Office was 64 475. 4 043 of them are technicians, but the demand for technicians at that date was 5 360. In other words, there was a shortage of technicians and there is a good reason for that&#x2014;they are lured away. There were 5 856 White telephone electricians and technicians in service and the demand was for 7 197, thus representing a shortage of 1 341. The number of approved posts for White learner telephone electricians and technicians was 1 592 whereas 1 525 were in service, a difference of 67. This is very close to the total number required. Even women are being trained as technicians. In 1974 a start was made with the training of women as technicians. Ten women are being trained at present and we hope that this number will grow.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of resignations. I want to give an indication of the resignations with regard to three categories, viz. pupil technicians, telephone technicians and learner telephone mechanics. In 1971 the total number of resignations was 569. In 1972 it rose to 941 and in 1973 it dropped to 720. In 1974 there were almost 1000 resignations. There is one aspect that causes us a great deal of concern. The Post Office is also the training centre for the private sector because the private sector lures away many of the trained staff of the Post Office. Many members of the Opposition represent the private sector and capitalism.</p>

<p>If one&#x2019;s neighbour steals one&#x2019;s oxen and one&#x2019;s plough, then surely he cannot point his finger at one later on and say one has no crop. I should like to make an appeal to the private sector. They cannot have two things at the same time. They cannot have their cake and eat it. If technicians are lured away, they cannot expect to have a good telephone service, because if the technicians are not enticed away, then the private sector can demand a good telecommunication system.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the Post Office. In paying tribute to the staff, I should like to start with the hon. the Minister. We have a dynamic Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. At his side is the Postmaster-General, to whom I have already referred, and his top management. Then there are the 64 000 Post Office officials, down to the humblest postman who delivers the mail. They are all humble people who do outstanding work. The Post Office is not without its achievements. One need only look at the activities at Olifantsfontein and Derdepoort, on the other side of Pretoria. The engineers and technicians of the department are all dynamic young men who put everything into the struggle for the department and for South Africa. Let us take a look at one of the instruments developed in the Post Office. The instrument is known as the Charlie box. It is a mini-computer, a service test unit. It was designed by Post Office officers to test the quality of service along the many and various routes of the complicated Witwatersrand automatic telephone exchange system. These Charlie boxes named after the Post Office design, register the rate at which calls are successful or unsuccessful, between the exchange in which the instrument is installed and other exchanges along the automatic network. Furthermore, the Charlie box can pinpoint telephone traffic bottlenecks and/or service interruptions at any point of the network and give the alarm even before users become aware of abnormal congestion. This is an outstanding invention. To begin with, 20 of these Charlie boxes are being installed in exchanges on the Witwatersrand, Later they will be installed in other centres in high telephone traffic areas throughout the country. Then, too, there is the party-line telephone service system. This system makes it possible for rural subscribers with party lines, too, to dial direct. This system was designed by Post Office engineers in cooperation with local manufacturers of telecommunications equipment to serve the rural party line user and for the benefit of South Africa.</p>

<p>It is with the greatest pleasure that I support and acclaim this Budget by the hon. the Minister.</p>

By <span class="col_2917-2918" refersTo="page_1474"/>making this fanciful suggestion the hon. member for Germiston District has chalked up another notable first. I congratulate him on his imaginative inventiveness, if nothing else.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member professed to be puzzled as to why the Opposition was criticizing the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. There seems to me to be a fairly obvious reason for this and that is that the Nationalist Party has been in power in this country for nearly 27 long years. It only seems like 270 years, but it is in fact 27 years! I think it is only fair to ask them to take some of the responsibility for the situation in which we find ourselves today.</p>

<p>I want to say quite categorically that the major problems of the Post Office today are due to short-sightedness and a lack of imaginative planning in the past. I think any reasonable person will agree with this. There was also political prejudice in days gone by which made it impossible for the Government to see the labour situation in perspective. Today this country is still plucking the bitter fruits of that past incompetence and myopia. What is the major problem today? It is obviously a manpower one. I think we are all agreed on this There is not enough skilled labour to go around to cope with the increasingly heavy work load. Nothing makes people quite as mad as a telephone which either does not function properly or does not function at all. I would say that public indignation and anger about the telephone system is due primarily to the deficiencies in the service rather than the shortage of telephones, however serious that may be. If you have not got a telephone, you are just depressed, immeasurably depressed. However, if you have got a phone that does not work, you just get properly mad. There are quite a number of people in this country who are very nearly that. I would say that if the Post Office in its own and the public interest would only improve its maintenance service, the level of public criticism and annoyance would drop immeasurably and almost immediately.</p>

<p>Much to the surprise, no doubt, of the hon. member for Germiston District. I should like to pay tribute to the drive of the Postmaster-General and his readiness to face reality and to be realistic about things. I believe that his achievements often in the face of almost insuperable odds have been quite remarkable, despite the Government and despite the worst and best efforts of politicians. When he addressed a telecommunications conference at Kimberley, the Postmaster-General pointed out that with proper training the major work connected with the installation and maintenance of television sets could be done by other than skilled labour; in other words, by labour which required less than three years&#x2019; training. He said, in fact, that more than ⅔rds of the manpower needed really required no more than one year&#x2019;s intensive training. He went on to say that it would be a pity and an unforgivable waste if we were to use highly-skilled manpower on such work. He could see no cogent reason why non-Whites should not to a considerable extent be employed in this sphere, especially in the operative and semi-skilled spheres. My question is simply this: Since there are clearly not enough Whites available for the work, why does the Post Office not make far, far greater use of non-Whites who have been specially and specifically trained to do maintenance work, work which calls for much less than maximum skill? We heard from the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications yesterday that 116 non-Whites have completed their training as electricians and that 139 are in training At the same time 44 have completed the first year course as technicians and 46 are to be admitted for training this year. We know the problems associated with training programmes. I am not talking about the political problems in this connection. But, surely, in view of the emergency in the telephones sphere, could these numbers not have been trebled or even quadrupled? Times are abnormal. Why not adopt abnormal procedures? Why not institute crash courses for maintenance work only? Sir, there must be countless telephones all over South Africa that could be repaired with a minimum amount of skill. I am thinking not only of the two dozen or so public telephone boxes on the Johannesburg railway station which never seem to me to work, but there must be thousands of these that could be repaired and maintained with the minimum of skill. Why do we not train an army of people to do this kind of work? Sir, I would like to see a telephone subscriber who objects to a man of colour repairing his telephone. If he does, let him wait. He will have to wait a little while.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>It is for this reason, Sir, that I was a bit dismayed to see in the annual report of the Postmaster-General that the non-Whites qualifying as technicians will do so for service &#x201C;in their own areas&#x201D;. Surely, Sir, this will defeat the whole object of the kind of training that one has in mind, and it will certainly not make the kind of contribution to the solution of the Post Office&#x2019;s difficulties that is so badly needed. Surely, in heaven&#x2019;s name, if a man is trained to do certain work, let him do it where the need is greatest, which happens in most cases to be the so-called White areas, because that is where the telephones are located. At the same time, Sir, I would like to say it is pleasing to see in the same report that in collaboration with White staff associations, non-Whites will in future also undertake certain facets of cable-jointing, overhead and underground line construction, and fitting and wiring of buildings in White areas. I would like to say categorically that this is a positive move in the right direction and is to be warmly welcomed. Mr. Speaker, while we are on the subject of the greater use of Black or Brown men in the Post Office&#x2014; and I know that this is not a panacea for all our ills, but I believe that it can make all the difference between an inefficient and an efficient service&#x2014;I would like to say something briefly about the wages gap between White and non-White. Sir, in 1973 the average wage of White staff in the Post Office was R3 695 a year; for Coloured, R1 253, for Asians R1 913, and for Africans R875. A year later the figures were R4 064, R1 296, R2 057 and R920. In other words, while the average White wage went up 10,1%, that of Coloureds went up only 3,8% of Asians 7,5%, and of Africans 5,5%. Sir, I am aware that averages of the nature that I have quoted can be misleading, but it remains <i>a</i> fact, however rough and ready the calculation is, that the gap&#x2014; this is the important thing&#x2014;between White and non-White wages in the Post Office is not being narrowed; in fact, it has been widened, and on this occasion, unless I am wrong, it has been widened not only absolutely but also percentage-wise. Sir, this seems to me to be something to which the Minister should devote some &#x201C;daadwerklike&#x201D; attention pretty soon, because this surely is in conflict with the whole trend of Government intention if not of achievement. According to my calculations, based on figures which were supplied by the Minister of Statistics on 25 February, the average income of a White Post Office employee in 1974 was R339 a month, while the average of the three non-White groups, Asians, Coloureds and Africans, was R87. The average for Africans was R77, and according to figures given this week by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications 1 see that the average annual income of Black people was R600&#x2014; R50 a month. Mr. Speaker, these are pretty alarming figures. If we remember that the recent poverty datum line estimates vary from R99 for a family of five in Soweto to between R93 and R112 for a family of six in different centres, as calculated by the University of Port Elizabeth, then even bearing in mind the care with which such estimates should be treated, I believe that the average of R77 for Africans and R108 for Coloureds in general is indefensibly low. In fact, it is not a living wage, certainly not as far as Africans are concerned, and I doubt very much whether it is as far as Coloureds are concerned. Government spokesmen are very fond of telling the private sector that there is nothing to prevent them from paying their employees a living wage. Well, I suggest that the Minister takes a very long and critical look at these wages, and while he is doing so I suggest that he should have a few words with the hon. the Minister of Labour and see whether he cannot persuade himself to allow Black employees in the Post Office to form a recognized body which will be able to negotiate about wages and conditions of work. One would like to know at the same time whether Black workers are in fact consulted about things like job evaluation and changes in job levels. The hon. the Minister has on occasion paid tribute to the White technical staff for their realistic approach and co-operation on the question of employing Blacks in White jobs. That is fine, but what has the Post Office done to ensure a realistic approach in regard to the co-operation of Blacks, when the latter may not even form a registered trade union? I believe there is great scope for improving the mechanism for consultation with Black workers, and I hope the Minister does so.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to follow up what the hon. member for Wynberg said about apartheid. I would like to appeal to the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications <span class="col_2921-2922" refersTo="page_1476"/>to do a Nico Malan in the Post Office; in other words&#x2014;I am trying to be realistic about this, Sir&#x2014;to remove all unnecessary apartheid restrictions in post offices throughout the country. I am not asking for the moon. I am not saying that all separate facilities must be abolished immediately, although obviously that remains the ideal and that is the direction along which we on these benches would emphatically go. But why not start with the abolition of stupid and unnecessary segregation and remove compulsion from it, and let people go where they want to. So many of these separate facilities, particularly in the smaller post offices, serve no purpose and are simply hurtful. They are a constant affront to human dignity, and they are simply a symbol of rejection. The Post Office, I believe, could give a lead to the country if it were to take a broader and more realistic view of this matter. There may be cases in large post offices, particularly, where separate collection and despatching facilities would serve some practical purpose, but let these be determined on the basis of need, on the nature of the service and not on the colour of the customer. There are countless cases where separation is simply senseless and unnecessary. If there was ever an example of discrimination based solely on colour, it is in the provision of totally unequal and often inadequate facilities for people of colour which one finds in so many post offices. While there are notable exceptions, depending very often on individuals, it is often true that inadequate service in these circumstances accompanies these so-called separate facilities. Sometimes, one regrets to say, one has seen at the &#x201C;hokkie&#x201D; next door to where one is standing, that the service to persons of colour leaves a very great deal to be desired and compares very unfavourably with the service given to Whites. And of course, Sir&#x2014;and this will appeal to the modern mind in the Post Office Administration&#x2014;inadequate service is usually inefficient, which is precisely what the Post Office management and the public at large do not want. So here, I believe, is a fruitful field for action.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Germiston District must pardon me if I do not follow up on him, but I just want to tell him that since the Government tells us every day that this is a land of milk and honey, we can only blame the Government if we do not get the milk and the honey on our bread.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I wish to speak about the Savings Bank and the National Savings Certificates which are sold by the post offices and the methods by which it is done. First of all, the position has changed. Once we looked upon the Post Office Savings Bank as the poor man&#x2019;s bank. It was where everyone who did not have a lot of money to invest in building societies or in the bank went and stuck his modest rand away and drew his interest. This position has now been changed since last year by the hon. the Minister and by the Treasury. They have made a Post Office investment a very valuable investment for the middle-class investor and also for the person who is having tax problems. We thought, when these concessions were announced last year by the hon. the Minister, that this would make a big difference to the takings of the Post Office Savings Bank. The hon. the Minister wishes to finance the department by loans from this savings bank and we think this is commendable, but the way the savings bank has gone about its business is regrettable and I for one feel that their efforts have not been very good. I am not criticizing the staff or the Post Office&#x2014;that must not be construed&#x2014;but I am criticizing the way in which the department has gone about availing itself of these extra facilities and concessions.</p>

<p>Let us first of all take the savings bank where the common people, the ordinary people, Whites and non-Whites included, go and bank their money so that it is easily available. In this field the Post Office has a terrific advantage. It pays 5% on current account as against the 3&#x00BD;% which is paid by the building societies. In addition, the interest paid by the Post Office is tax-free while the interest paid by building societies is not. Yet we find on reading the report &#x2014;and I hope I am reading it correctly&#x2014; that on page 59 it is stated that the Post Office has a total savings investment of only approximately R170 million. As against that, I notice from the building societies&#x2019; report that at the end of last year they had investments in their savings banks to the value of R1000 million. I want to know why there is such a big difference. Why can we not avail ourselves more fully of these investments from the general public?</p>

<p><span class="col_2923-2924" refersTo="page_1477"/>We are also disappointed as regards investments in the National Savings Certificates. Let me say at once that these National Savings Certificates are a wonderful investment for anyone who has tax problems or who wishes to save money. An investor can go along and invest his money at 8,33%, tax-free, with a limit of R15 000 per person. As against this, the building societies can only give you 7&#x00BD;% with a maximum of R10 000 per taxpayer, not per person. There is a vast difference and yet we do not seem to be cashing in on this. What is the problem? On Friday, 21 February, I asked the hon. the Minister what the value was of (a) National Savings Certificates, (b) Savings Bank Certificates and (c) Premium Bonds (second issue) sold during each month since the commencement of the latest issue. The figures which the hon. the Minister gave me bore out my own feelings in this respect. I went to a small post office in a town which shall be nameless and made some inquiries about these investments, after hearing the very excellent terms announced by the Minister last year. They could not tell me about it, but referred me to a little pamphlet which was stuck to the wall in a glass case. I read it and then asked whether they had certificates. The reply was that they only had a limited number, that these had all been sold and that I would have to wait for the next month&#x2019;s allocation. I was told that I would have to go to a bigger post office to get savings certificates.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is surely not the way to do business. The figures which the hon. the Minister gave to me are very revealing. For instance, he said that in October 1974, the first month during which these savings certificates were sold, the takings from the sale of the certificates rose from R8,5 million to R13,l million. In other words, the increase was of the order of 50%, which was to be expected after the announcement was made. In the next month, November, the value of certificates sold dropped by 22% to approximately R10,2 million. In December the value dropped by another 33% to R6,8 million. Yet the hon. the Minister tells us in his report that he expects an increase of about R55 million in investments for this year. I do not know how he reconciles these figures.</p>

<p>I am not criticizing the Post Office in respect of the investments and I am not trying to suggest that they should steal business from the building societies, but in this very report we are told that the public has invested some R71 500 000&#x2014;the hon. the Minister may correct me if my figures are not correct&#x2014;in Union Loan and National Savings Certificates. Yet the total investment in fixed deposits and sales of shares with the building societies totalled over R4 000 million. Surely, the Post Office is entitled to a bigger share. If one wonders about the cause of this, it is very easy to find an answer. First of all the facilities which the Post Office offers to the prospective buyer or investor cannot compare with those offered by banks or building societies. The Post Office is drab and it usually has a scruffy look about it. You talk to people through iron bars or brass bars at best, you stand in queues and everybody around you can listen to your business when you are inquiring about investments and about how much you are going to invest. In other words, there is no privacy. Surely this is no way to get money out of people. I suggest that the hon. the Minister should take a good look at the way the investing public are being treated. You cannot expect middle class people who are having tax problems and to whom this is a very good method of investing, to go to these places and to buy shares.</p>

<p>Yes, they should get a few attractive young ladies. This brings me to the second point I want to raise. In the very same question I asked the hon. the Minister whether the Post Office staff entrusted with the issuing of these certificates and bonds receive special training. The hon. the Minister quite honestly said &#x201C;no&#x201D;. This is just not good enough because these things are not that easy to understand. The prospective investors do not know how to invest their money and they do need some advice. Surely you do not expect the postmaster to deal with each of these investors. I think that the persons who are entrusted with this should be properly trained.</p>

<p>This brings me to another point. The hon. the Minister is getting away with murder. Do hon. members know that the charges involved in the selling of certificates and the work spent on the Post Office Savings Bank is not reflected in this Budget? A very healthy profit should be shown on this. The general taxpayer is paying for these services and yet we are not benefitting by them. I have here a photograph <span class="col_2925-2926" refersTo="page_1478"/>which shows how the Post Office in Germany launched their bond issue. Blokes were dressed in fancy uniforms and they were blowing bugles all over the place. It was a gala occasion. I am sure that our Government can do better than it is doing at present.</p>

<p>The other point I want to draw attention to is the lack of advertising. In the first month this scheme got off to a good start. It received a lot of publicity from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech, but what other advertising have we had on these investments of the Post Office? Very little indeed. The hon. the Minister told me that he had spent R5 000 on radio advertising and R37 000 on other advertising. I can tell hon. members that one building society spends over R1 million a year on its advertising alone. This is certainly no way to try and draw business.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall give it content. What were the statements which their chief spokesman, the hon. member for Durban Point, who is otherwise a very pleasant man, made today? He made three basic statements. He said: There are chaotic conditions in the Post Office in the financial sphere, there is a staff shortage and then there is the failure to eliminate the backlog.&#x201D; The hon. member for Parktown who is laughing so delightedly there, was formerely the editor of <i>The Star.</i> When he discusses these things, he always comes back to the colour problem. According to him, this is apparently the only problem faced by the Post Office and South Africa. He is living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. In a business enterprise, one does not only have colour problems, one also has problems in respect of capital formation, amortization, interest, efficiency, etc. I want to congratulate <i>The Star</i> on the fact that there has at least been an improvement as far as editors are concerned. In <i>The Star</i> of 31 January 1975, under the heading &#x201C;Poaching adds to &#x2019;Phone Backlog&#x201D;, the present editor wrote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the waiting list for telephones numbering 95 000 &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is a mistake. It is actually 98 000. We are not ashamed of it.</p>

<block name="#quote">&#x2026; a figure hardly changed since March 1974, the Postmaster-General and his staff are probably bracing themselves for the annual fusilade &#x2026;</block>

<p>These are the little crackers that will be let off&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; from commerce, industry, the general public and of course Opposition M.P.s. No doubt this year the criticism will be more barbed than ever before because of the proposed increases in telephone charges. A not insignificant proportion of these high charges and the paying of more for an increasingly unsatisfactory service result not from shortcomings in the Post Office but from short-sightedness and greed in the business community. The Post Office spends millions of rand per year training staff for the telephone service. Its trainees, instead of getting out into the field to ease the Post Office burden, are being bought off by private enterprise, leaving the public telecommunication service as <span class="col_2927-2928" refersTo="page_1479"/>short-staffed as it ever was. Inevitably, in order to retain staff the Post Office will have to pay increasingly competitive wages, an expensive practice with TV creating an abnormal demand for technicians in the next few years.</block>

<p>The private sector are the very people whom the Progressive Party assist and support. I am sure that the hon. member for Parktown will acknowledge that I am right. The hon. member for South Coast spoke about the &#x201C;middle class&#x201D;. I do not like these labels; where does he get these terms &#x201C;middle class&#x201D; and &#x201C;high class&#x201D;? In other words, there is also a &#x201C;low class&#x201D;. I want to say that the people who support the hon. member&#x2019;s party&#x2014;in other words, the capitalistic class, the people with the money &#x2014;are the very people who entice staff away from the Post Office to the private sector. Let us have no illusions about that. It is the people who support his party who do not come up with a story about colour, but who entice these White technicians away from this service department to that party&#x2019;s private sector to enrich themselves. They must be in no doubt about that. Is it fair to create this impression, that this department is in a chaotic condition?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bodenstein">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, very well; as far as the telephone service is concerned. I say that this is an unfair statement to make. Let us look at the set-up after 1968 and the expenditure on telephones since then. In 1968, R29,9 million was spent on this. This year R 153,6 million is being spent on telecommunications. Notwithstanding this backlog&#x2014;I have the greatest sympathy for people who are waiting for telephones; I myself have had experience of this&#x2014;the backlog is less than it has ever been percentage-wise. I shall prove this: In 1969 it was 6,06%, in 1970, 6,07%, in 1971, 7.66% and so on. This year the waiting list is 4,95%, percentage-wise. This is the lowest it has been for many years. Is this not an achievement? Let us take a look at the increase in capital expenditure by the Post Office. Do you know what the expenditure has been in the years since the Post Office became independent? In 1964-&#x2019;65 it was R26,4 million but from 1968 onwards it rose. In 1969-&#x2019;70 it was R73,7 million and in 1974-&#x2019;75, the capital expenditure by the Post Office was R 182,2 million.</p>

<p>Well, I did not say that it was one of the best in the world. If I were a banana-eater like that hon. member, I would have no pride in anybody. [Interjections.] I apologize to the hon. member for what I said about him.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at what happens in America. I quote from <i>Fortune,</i> July 1973, <span class="col_2929-2930" refersTo="page_1480"/>where it is said that prices are high and deliveries very often impossible, and&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It cannot operate as a self-sustaining business without continually raising rates and sacrificing service.</block>

<p>Let us have a look at England. When anyone speaks about England in this House certain members from Natal get the most beautiful smile as if they were in another world. In the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> in an article called &#x201C;First-class letters to cost seven pence&#x201D;, it was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Huge increases in postal, telephone, parcel and other post office charges were proposed yesterday in the biggest series of price increases ever to come from a nationalized industry. They were coupled with warnings of more rises next year and immediately brought widespread protest from consumer bodies. The main proposal is aimed at raising an extra £649 million in the financial year starting on 1 April.</block>

<p>*The reasons for this are simple. A business enterprise, whether it is in the private sector or whether it is the Post Office&#x2014;also a business enterprise&#x2014;have to increase tariffs in times of inflation in order to provide efficient services. There can be no doubt about that. Consequently it is essential to increase tariffs in South Africa. A new electronic telephone service is being installed, and I am convinced that it will be an extremely successful service. There will be a saving as far as the manpower shortage is concerned, the very point about which the hon. member for Parktown had so much to say. When this system is functioning, we shall be able to make do with 75% fewer staff than we are employing today. This will be made possible by this electronic set-up. The Post Office is a dynamic department that is engaged in all kinds of development in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>However there is still expenditure and financing. The hon. member for Durban Point records his objection to the fact that no further loan funds are being used to develop the Post Office. The Franzsen Commission was made up of people who knew and understood finance. It is ridiculous to say that the greater the loan capital, the less the responsibility of the consumer, because as the loan capital increases, interest and amortization have to be taken into account. The lifetime of the specific commodity must also be taken into account. It makes no difference whichever kind of body it is&#x2014;whether it is a Government department, a local authority or a private body&#x2014;if it only concentrates on loan capital then eventually it must necessarily be placed in a situation of extreme financial embarrassment. The Franzsen Commission specifically and intentionally compiled a formula that is being applied by the department. The department deserves to be congratulated on following this commission&#x2019;s report and handling the financing on that basis. I want to say that the Department of Posts and Telecommunications is a dynamic department. I say this notwithstanding the telephone backlog and the problems we are facing. One need only look around one to see what is going on in the department. I am now going to mention my own constituency because I have been challenged to do so. I am going to mention Rustenburg as an example. Rustenburg is a region that has been developing rapidly. This is the position everywhere in South Africa today, with our rapid growth rate. Development on a gigantic scale is taking place throughout the country. There is the development at Saldanha Bay, there is the second Sasol and developments of all kinds in the mining industry. In the mining industry itself there are members of the managements themselves who speak with the greatest respect of the wonderful and immediate service that has been provided by this department, notwithstanding difficult circumstances. Rustenburg has also undergone a period of rapid growth. I have the statistics before me. Over the past year, more than R400 000 has been spent on construction work for the Post Office in connection with the provision of an additional storey for the purposes of an automatic exchange. The automatic exchange has been expanded by 1950 lines. Since then, 196 exchange connections and 671 night and weekend services have been provided. All outstanding applications for telephone services for which cable leads are available will be dealt with during the second half of 1975. In other words, there will then no longer be a backlog. The cost of the exchange equipment and the installation thereof amounts to R653 000. The microwave system between Johannesburg and Rustenburg is expected to be completed in June 1975. 240 additional <span class="col_2931-2932" refersTo="page_1481"/>telephone channels will then be made available. The number of channels can be substantially increased later. The cost of this project is estimated at R661 000. Here is a case of R1,71 million having been spent on one growth point in the course of a year or two. It is the same throughout the Republic. This department is providing a service in growth points in the interests of the development of South Africa. South Africa has a growth rate that compares favourably with that of any country in the world. We cannot get away from the fact that under present circumstances there is a backlog in the telephone services. We have to accept that. In a country that is developing rapidly and dynamically, the standard of living rises, and a weak party like the United Party dwindles. A party like the National Party, again, has provided South Africa with opportunities. This party acknowledges and appreciates South Africa&#x2019;s potential. This department is engaged, in a far-sighted fashion, in expanding and providing a service for the development of the Republic. Notwithstanding criticism, the Post Office has a staff that worked day and night during the recent stormy conditions in the interests of South Africa. They were loyal towards the department. We must stop being so critical about the poor telephone service. We must adopt a more positive attitude and state that we are grateful for what has been achieved, often under difficult circumstances. The hon. member for Parktown must also learn a lesson. He must not always be referring to more non-Whites to the exclusion of everything else. That is basically wrong. We believe in the training of non-Whites and consequently we cooperate with the staff associations. We are training the non-Whites to provide a service in their own areas. Why this present this contrast and say that as soon as the non-Whites are available, there will be no problem. Hon. members opposite know that that is not true. There are all kinds of factors that give rise to this situation. Let us show a greater degree of calmness and efficiency in &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall deal with some of the points made by the hon. member for Rustenburg during the course of my speech. I think that I am the ninth speaker to take part in this debate. This long-suffering House has listened patiently now to eight different viewpoints expressed, if I may say so, with varying degrees of skill and displaying a sliding scale of technical knowledge. Like others, I do not pretend to be an expert on technical matters. I speak as a layman and perhaps, like the hon. member for Rustenburg, as a politician, but certainly not as an aspirant candidate for the post of Postmaster-General which is so very well filled by the present incumbent.</p>

<p>I have been allotted 10 minutes to speak, and although I had studied the estimates and the speech of the hon. the Minister carefully, I am sure that you will agree with me that it is in fact very difficult to react in such a short period to the broad matters that have been placed before us <span class="col_2933-2934" refersTo="page_1482"/>today. I am compelled to mention only one or two aspects which come to mind. In doing so, I want to follow up some of the remarks made by the hon. member for Wynberg and the hon. member for Parktown. Although I know that it is an unpopular subject with Government members, I want to talk about the advancement of non-Whites in the postal and telecommunications services. I also want to discuss the question of the narrowing of the wage gap as well as the services available to non-Whites generally. I say this because these matters go to the very root of the problems that are facing the department and the public, in the services that are being offered. The seemingly unending and extensive backlog of telephone applications can be ascribed, if the hon. the Minister is to be believed&#x2014;and I believe him&#x2014;in no small measure <i>inter alia</i> to the acute shortage of trained technical staff. At a stage where there is a shortage of 2 658 technical personnel in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, it is surely ineffective to announce most blandly as the hon. the Minister did yesterday that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We commenced with the training of non-Whites as technicians in 1974 and 44 have successfully competed the first year course. It is expected that a further 46 non-Whites will be admitted to training as technicians this years. The availability of instructors and training facilities is a limiting factor.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, three points are immediately apparent. Firstly, I find it absolutely incredible that the Government has waited all these years, after being hammered on this point for almost a decade until 1974. i.e. last year, to train non-Whites as technicians; secondly, that the Government&#x2019;s planning even now is limited and so timid as to allow only 46 or so non-Whites to be admitted for training as technicians in the following year; thirdly, that more adequate preparations were not made to ensure that sufficient instructors and training facilities were available. Sir, taking into account the unabated staff shortage, the long discerned increase in telephone applications, the high growth rate which we are experiencing in the industrial, the mining and the business sectors and the growing demand from a fast developing non-White area for telephone services, surely it is obvious, against this backdrop, that the plans disclosed by the Minister to utilize staff in a better manner have come too late and are too timid and rather like a drop in the ocean. Only last year we were told in regard to the homelands, in the Minister&#x2019;s speech that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Post Office had taken steps to ensure that Posts and Telecommunications services in these territories are in future administered in such a way as to facilitate their transfer to homeland Governments when the time arrives.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I want to warn that unless a far more dynamic programme of technical training is urgently embarked upon, the hand-over in years to come will be a fiasco. At the present slow rate of progress there will not be sufficient trained personnel to look after the difficulties and problems which will be encountered within the Republic, let alone in eight under-developed independent areas.</p>

<p>Sir, to move on, there is clear evidence that the Government is at last doing something about creating career prospects for various grades of non-White staff. It is also clearly stated policy that the wage gap must be narrowed. The question I wish to pose&#x2014;and it has been posed earlier&#x2014;is whether these changes are being introduced in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner as emergencies arise, or whether there is a systematic and planned programme which is being implemented? The staff estimates which are before us illuminate the situation very clearly. Of the estimated 23 410 non-White employees, only 666, or 2,8%, will be employed at salaries with scaled ceilings of R3 600, or above. In the White sector, of 43 625 employees some 33 000. or 74%, will be employed at similar salaries. In the R6 300 category and above, there are some 3 300 White employees, while a single Black man or Coloured or Indian can aspire to such a job. Sir, this is not good enough. It is not something that we can be proud of. When one speaks of careers as opposed to jobs. I tend to feel that it is the duty of this Government to provide vocational opportunities for all races, opportunities which involve real responsibility, satisfactory outlets for energy and endeavour, and an income which will secure a reasonable standard of living for the thousands of families involved. If one looks at the very lowest grades of employees, one finds that only 700 are White people out of the 43 000 who earn less than R2 000. and none earn less than R1 200. On the other hand, of 23 000 non-White <span class="col_2935-2936" refersTo="page_1483"/>employees, over 15 500 earn less than R1 000. Sir, that is a sum which even for a labourer, certainly in the urban areas, cannot sustain a family with any degree of dignity. Has the time not arrived when the basic minimum wage for all races should be set at at least R1 200 per annum?</p>

<p>Finally, on this point, despite Government-stated policy, a Bantu counter clerk with a Std. 8 qualification performing the same functions as any other clerk and having the same training as other clerks, starts with R1 087 and proceeds over four years to reach R3100. His White counterpart, with the same training, starts at R3 480 and progresses over only three years to R4 680. He starts at a salary to which the non-White can never aspire. Where is the justice in this, Sir? Where does the Government&#x2019;s policy of eliminating discrimination fit in, if at all, into this picture? Sir, my time is up. I must say no more. Therefore, <i>inter alia,</i> to record matters which I have not had time to debate, I would now like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the <i>Post Office Appropriation Bill</i> because&#x2014;</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you know, there is one thing which disappoints me in my erstwhile colleague from Sandton, and that is his preoccupation with colour politics. He, like the hon. member for Parktown, cannot get away from it. No matter what we discuss, that is all they bring in. They are not interested in the users of these services in South Africa. They are not interested in whether people can get telephone services and things like that. All they are interested in is colour. Then the hon. member comes here at the end with an amendment with five legs which have already been dealt with by members of this party, the real Opposition in this House, the party which is in fact in front of that party, not to its right and not to its left or anywhere else, but in front of it in every way. The hon. member mentioned the question of the Post Office Savings Account. My hon. friend from South Coast has just spent 12 minutes discussing this with the hon. the Minister and to far greater effect than the hon. member for Sandton. He discussed the question of a basic minimum wage and he appealed for a minimum wage. He knows, Sir, or he should know because he was in the party long enough, that we have done this for years and years. Now who is guilty of plagiarism?</p>

<p>But, Sir, I am afraid I have no time to waste on those hon. members. I want to discuss with the hon. the Minister this afternoon a most important matter which has come to my attention. I drew his attention to it by way of a question last week, whereupon the hon. the Minister intimated that his department was aware of the fact that certain envelopes had been opened in the post and that certain letters had been incorrectly placed in the wrong envelopes. I want to quote now from a letter which has been received by the complainant in <span class="col_2937-2938" refersTo="page_1484"/>this matter from the Postmaster-General, in which he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A microscopic examination of the accompanying envelope has revealed that the item was in fact tampered with after it was initially sealed. It has unfortunately not been possible to establish where and under what circumstances the tampering took place. I should like to assure you that letters are not opened by the Post Office unless delivery thereof cannot be effected and the sender&#x2019;s name and address do not appear on the envelope.</block>

<p>Now, I happen to have the envelope here, and the sender&#x2019;s name and address do appear on the back of it. So I can accept that the Post Office authorities did not open the envelope. Now I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has taken any action since he received this complaint from Mrs. Corrigan of Pietermaritzburg Has he taken any action at all? He sits dumb; he does not answer. I must assume from that that he has taken no action. I believe that in this country tampering with the mail is a very serious offence. What is the Minister going to do about it? Is he going to lay charges against these persons unknown? Is he going to ask the police to investigate this matter, or does he bear some knowledge of this interference with these letters which he is not prepared to divulge to this House?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not &#x201C;tragic&#x201D; at all. But I want to say to that hon. member now that if there is a matter of security involved in this, we will be the first to assist and to defend the hon. the Minister if the security of the State is at issue. If there is anybody who is authorized to investigate mail and to open letters in order to investigate what is written in them, why does the hon. the Minister not admit it? What does he have to hide? All I want to know from him is whether there is anybody who is authorized. We asked this question earlier: Is anybody authorized to open letters? Is it the Bureau for State Security? Is it the Special Branch? If they are entitled to open letters, let the hon. the Minister have the courage to stand up this afternoon and admit it, and admit that under special circumstances they do take this action. However, at the same time I believe that the hon. the Minister must give this House and the people of South Africa an assurance that this power is not being abused. What are the circumstances in this case? A young lady at university in England writes to her mother. A young girl writes to her boyfriend. Quite by coincidence the mother and the boyfriend are both domiciled in Pietermaritzburg. The boyfriend gets the daughter&#x2019;s letter in the girlfriend&#x2019;s envelope and the mother gets the girlfriend&#x2019;s letter in the daughter&#x2019;s envelope. How does this come about? Is this purely coincidence? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is a very good question too. What steps has the hon. the Minister taken to ascertain whether it was an unauthorized or an authorized person who did open these envelopes? Let me quote further from the letter of the Postmaster-General&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the scant information available it is not possible to trace the whereabouts of your daughter&#x2019;s letter. However, it does occur to me that whoever had been tampering with your mail most probably erroneously included your daughter&#x2019;s letter in an envelope intended for somebody else.</block>

<p>How naïve! I want to repeat the question that I have asked earlier. What steps has the hon. the Minister taken to ascertain who did, in fact, open these envelopes? [Interjections.] The letter goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this event the latter party may go to the trouble to return it to your daughter, provided it bears her address.</block>

<p>The letter ends&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am sorry about the loss of your daughter&#x2019;s letter and also that I am unable to establish who tampered with the item.</block>

<p>What steps did he take to try to ascertain that? I do not believe that he did very much. On 14 March I asked the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) By whom was the letter opened, (b) on whose authority, (c) in terms of what statutory authority was such action taken, (d) for what purpose was it done...</li>

</ol>

<p>The reply of the hon. the Minister was&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) to (d): Unknown.</li>

</ol>

<p>I do not think he cares either. I want to say here and now and I want to place it on record that we on this side of the House view the tampering with the private mail of individuals in the most extremely grave light. I believe that the hon. the Minister owes it, not only to this House but to the people of South Africa as well, to give us an explanation. As I say, if the security of the State is at issue he must have the courage to stand up and admit it and we shall support him. If this is merely a further infringement and interference in the personal rights of individuals in this country, however, he stands condemned this afternoon as the head of a department which stoops to these depths.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South pointed out, with reference to what the hon. member for Sandton had said, that they are actually the official Opposition in this House. Right at the outset, I want to say that the allegation which was made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, is scandalous. We are dealing here with a Budget of a few hundred million rand, but in his speech this afternoon that hon. member tried to create the impression that the Department of Posts and Telecommunications is arbitrarily opening peoples&#x2019; postal articles or letters. This afternoon I listened with great sincerity to the speeches which were made in this House on this important matter. I cannot do otherwise than to say that we have been hearing for many years already what we heard today from the hon. members on the opposite side of the House. I get the impression that as a result of the internal problems in their own party, hon. members on that side of the House are no longer prepared to work. I listened to the hon. member for Durban Point, who was the main speaker on that side. I want to give him the assurance that I believe in all sincerity that the contribution which he made to this debate this afternoon was a very feeble one. Now, what criticism did that side of the House level? We heard the same hackneyed story which we have had to listen to from one year to another, the same hackneyed story of a shortage of telephones, of a waiting list and of the chaotic situation which is allegedly prevailing in our telephone service in South Africa, as well as in the Department of Posts and Telecommunications itself. What we had in addition this afternoon, was the fact that the hon. the Minister had been forced to increase tariffs in South Africa.</p>

<p>At the outset, I should like to avail myself of the opportunity to break a lance for our Post Office officials. Hon. members on this side of the House have already referred to this and I should like to do so again because I am aware of the fact that when we are dealing with the Department of Posts and Telecommunications, it is a department which is obviously easy to criticize. This department is obviously easy to <span class="col_2941-2942" refersTo="page_1486"/>criticize, for when we dial a number and we are not put through immediately, then it is the fault of the &#x201C;damn Post Office&#x201D;. When we have to stand in a queue at a post office, to buy a stamp, and we are not served promptly and quickly, then the &#x201C;poor Post Office service&#x201D; is blamed. It is a recognized fact that the Department of Posts and Telecommunications is the biggest department in the whole of South Africa. It is a department which performs an enormous task in South Africa from day to day. I say without fear of contradiction that this department is one of the departments in South Africa which works the hardest. For this I want to congratulate every official from the Postmaster-General down to the lowest-paid official very sincerely, especially on the fact that they decided a year or two ago to work longer service hours in the interests of South Africa. I wonder whether the hon. members who are gathered together in this House realize for one moment what this means for South Africa. In general, it means a 5% increase in productivity. Since there is a shortage of 4,8% in the industrial sector, one wonders whether there would not be less talk of labour shortages in South Africa if each one of us were to try to work harder. Tens of thousands of Post Office officials declared themselves willing to do that. It is instructive to note that the gain in terms of labour is more than 875 000 manhours per annum. This was a commendable effort on the part of this department, which to my mind may justifiably be emphasized. I want to convey my sincere thanks to those officials once again. I should like to link to this that when an appeal was made to South Africa to save petrol because of the energy crisis, this department took the lead in this matter. In spite of the fact that the number of vehicles of the department increased from 7 000 to 7 100, a saving of approximately 20% was achieved.</p>

<p>We could continue in this way to discuss the achievements of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. To my mind one of the most important announcements which the hon. the Minister made in this House yesterday was the announcement that South Africa is going to get a new telephone system. Even the hon. member for Durban Point, when he discussed this subject, greeted it with great acclamation. He was obviously very pleased about it. He said <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<p>The word &#x201C;welcome&#x201D; will be totally inadequate to express the feeling of South Africa when it hears of the announcement of the new telephone system for South Africa which was made this afternoon.</p>

<p>He was very pleased. I have paged through this memorandum on the new telephone dialling system for South Africa. It is, of course, technical. It was in the last part of his argument yesterday evening that the hon. member for Durban Point presented the actual barb. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hope that the hesitancy which appears in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech when he says that this system is not necessarily the best, is not an indication of any doubt that there may be a repetition of the mistake made 15 years ago.</block>

<p>Immediately after this extremely important memorandum had been tabled, the hon. member for Durban Point tried to conjure up spectres and create the impression that this new system which is going to be introduced in South Africa, might again not be a good system.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point went further in his argument and said that the public of South Africa must realize and understand once and for all that it will not be possible simply to introduce this system in South Africa overnight. I want to tell the hon. member that we in South Africa find ourselves in a particularly fortunate position, because we have scientists of stature here, among the best in the world. When I look at this memorandum which has been tabled, I believe and accept that it was preceded by intensive studies. Obviously it cannot be introduced overnight, but will take a few years. Nevertheless I believe that this is a marvellous breakthrough for our telecommunications in South Africa. Therefore I want to give the hon. member for Durban Point the assurance that I believe that we shall make very beneficial use of this new system for 30 to 40 years, perhaps for many decades.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. W. DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point as well as other hon. members in this House tried to make a major issue of how our telephone service in South Africa is supposedly one of the worst in the world. They went further and made a major argument of the waiting list of approximately 96 000 which we have in South Africa today. In this regard I should like to express a few thoughts for the record. Before I come to the matter which I actually want to discuss, I think that it would be interesting to go back into the history of telephone services in South Africa for a moment. On 31 March 1940 there were almost 202 000 telephones in the country. During the next five years, the network grew by 47 000. I accept that there was a war on at the time and that other circumstances contributed to this. From 1945 to 1950 the increase was 136 000 and from 1950 to 1955, a total of 228 000. Therefore, in those five years there was a greater increase than the total which had been connected by 1940. The 613 000 telephones which there were on 31 March 1955 had increased to 818 000 on 31 March 1960. All the indications are that with this Budget we shall have more than two million telephones in the country during the course of this year. It is being said now that there is a backlog of telephones. Admittedly, this is true, and we regret that this is the case. We should like to have seen that every person in South Africa could obtain a telephone immediately. Let me briefly give you the reasons why there is a backlog of telephones in South Africa. In the first place, I want to address myself to this side of the House, because we have created an unprecedented demand for telephone services as a result of the high growth rate, particularly of the industrial, mining and business sectors of the economy. After all, it is a recognized fact that we, in a developing country such as South Africa, which is developing rapidly from day to day and which is maintaining a high growth rate&#x2014;every day reproaches that the growth rate in South Africa is too low are hurled at us on this side of the House by hon. members on that side of the House&#x2014;can expect and understand that a tremendous burden will be placed on the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. We have only to walk down the streets of Cape Town for a moment to see how many buildings are being built. The hon. member for Durban point knows what the position in Durban is. If we go to Johannesburg, we shall see that there is tremendous growth everywhere. If we think for just a moment of the trust which not only South Africa&#x2019;s citizens place in the economy, but also the trust from beyond the borders of South Africa then this is an irrefutable proof that as a result of this National Party Government there is trust in this country, and as a result of that we have tremendous growth. If we think of our growth points such as the Saldanha project and Richards Bay and others which I could mention to you, then surely it is obvious that those areas will make a heavy demand on the Department of Posts and Telecommunications and that telephones will have to be supplied to those areas. I just want to mention as an example that in my own area, Welkom, there was almost nothing 20 years ago. Our telephone service was most certainly one of the poorest and I want to tell you that as a result of this department&#x2019;s actions&#x2014;and I say this with pride&#x2014;there are no complaints whatsoever in my constituency in respect of telephones. I want to tell you that if there is any person in that area who wants to complain about the excellent telephone service on the Free State goldfields as a whole, then I think he needs to have his head read.</p>

<p>This National Party has seen to it that the standard of living in South Africa has been raised. We have a standard of living in South Africa&#x2014;and now I am referring to the Whites as well as to our other coloured peoples&#x2014;which is very certainly one of the highest in the world and because this is so, this National Government has seen to it that almost every person in South Africa today can afford a telephone. As a result of this it is obvious that in the years which lie ahead, too, heavy demands will to an increasing extent be made on his department. I want to tell you that even the Black people in South Africa, viz. our Bantu, our Coloureds and our Indians &#x2014;and the department can take note of this &#x2014;will want to obtain telephones to an increasing extent as a result of the increased standard of living in South Africa. Another important reason is the extraordinarily high figure which appears in respect of telephone transfers as a result of subscribers who are continually moving and who also make a heavy demand on the Department of Posts and Telecommunications.</p>

<p><span class="col_2945-2946" refersTo="page_1488"/>The hon. member for Germiston District referred to how the Department of Posts and Telecommunications were toiling day after day as a result of the acute staff shortage. Now the question can be asked: What is the Government and the Department of Posts and Telecommunications doing to try to remedy the acute shortage which has arisen in an effective way? I can say with pride that the Post Office has taken the lead, for example, in the training of Brown and Black people as technicians. This is an important breakthrough, and we are already busy training them in other fields primarily&#x2014;and I stress this&#x2014;to serve their own people and to alleviate the burden of the Whites. The Post Office feels that it is not only its duty to train the non-Whites to make a major contribution, but that it must enable its White workers to achieve optimal development. Ever greater efforts are being made in this connection. During the last few years, more than 3 000 officers on the first and intermediate levels of supervision have been involved in seminars on modern personnel management. At the beginning of 1974, a management course for senior officials was introduced. So far 47 deputy and assistant directors and equivalent ranks have completed the course successfully. Fourteen very senior officers have already completed the advanced management programme at Unisa successfully. Since 1968, more than 200 officers with the exception of technicians, have obtained diplomas in a three-year course in public administration, public accounts and finances, and electrotechnical data processing and systems analysis, etc. A total of 122 officials have obtained baccalaureus and masters degrees. At the moment there are 186 full-time and 40 part-time students studying at South African Universities in a number of directions. We must convey our praise and appreciation to the staff associations for their realistic approach to the training and utilization of non-Whites. As long as there is a National Party Government in South Africa, the White staff know that they will always be-protected in the process. I can elaborate for hours on the commendable efforts of this department, but my time has almost expired. As a result of the rapid economic development which is taking place in South Africa today, it is a problem to keep pace at all times with the development of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. Mention has also been made this afternoon of our telephone services in South Africa. I can show with chapter and verse what the position is in respect of telephone services in other countries. In Germany the position is much more serious&#x2014;unfortunately I do not have the time to quote details. However, I want to quote the following in regard to France:</p>

<block name="quote">France takes a gloomy pride in having Europe&#x2019;s worst telephone service.</block>

<p>I can also indicate what the position is in Holland, Luxemburg and Italy. For interest&#x2019;s sake, I just want to conclude with one further quotation relating to Brazil. I do it to indicate what the position is in other countries. It is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Robert Langford, who used to work in our town as an actor, theatrical manager and producer, was talking yesterday about a city with the worst possible telephone problems, and it is not Johannesburg. &#x201C;You have to go to Brazil for a really king-size telephone headache&#x201D;, he said a few hours after he flew out from Jan Smuts for his present base in London. &#x201C;I will pin-point the trouble spot. It is Sao Paulo, quite the most hideous concrete jungle I have ever seen. Sao Paulo&#x2019;s population has mushroomed from 45 000 to more than 5&#x00BD; million in less than 100 years. It has grown too fast for everyone, especially anyone who wants a telephone. To get a telephone laid on a Sao Pauloan has to wait anything up to five years if he is lucky. Sometimes the wait is a lot longer. It is not only putting your name down and hoping for the best. There is more to it than that, much more.&#x201D;</block>

<p>These are interesting facts for those who complain every day about our Post Office service in South Africa. I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;First of all the Post Office calls for a 250 dollars fee just to enter your name on the waiting list. After that, with unfailing regularity, several annual payments of 250 dollars are called for until the total is about 10 000 dollars.&#x201D;</block>

<p>To obtain a telephone in Sao Paulo, therefore, one must pay 10 000 dollars.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I just want to say that I believe that this was a good Budget. The criticism that came from hon. members from that side of the House, and I say this <span class="col_2947-2948" refersTo="page_1489"/>with great respect and esteem, was very feeble. I foresee that this department, with the great demands which are being made on it will continue to go from strength to strength in the years which lie ahead. I say this because every Post Office official is inspired with one fundamental ideal, and that is to render only the best services to South Africa and its people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. W. B. PAGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to see that the hon. member for Rustenburg is sitting close to the hon. member for Welkom because this gives me the opportunity, as the saying goes, to get two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rustenburg has told us that our telephone system is not the worst in the world while the hon. member for Welkom has regaled us with stories about the telephone system in Sao Paolo in Brazil. I would like to cap both of their stories by telling them of a telephone conversation I had with a business associate in Durban who told me about a friend of his who had just come from Ethiopia. This friend of his says that South Africa is a wonderful country expect for the telephone system which does not compare with that in Ethiopia. In dealing further with the speech of the hon. member for Welkom. I am sure that you. Sir, are delighted to hear from him that you are now going to be able to get through to Welkom by telephone. I understand that that has been one of the most arduous jobs in South Africa over recent years. I should also like to say that I think that the hon. member for Welkom and other hon. members on that side of the House would do well on every occasion that a good, sound thinking United Party member makes a speech clearly outlining a problem and tramps on a Nationalist&#x2019;s corn, not to hold up this little ghost of the so-called internal problems of our party. They are non-existent and we are getting a little tired of it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Let us now get down to something practical&#x2014;as my friend the hon. member for Point has put it, the battle of the backlog. We talk too much about our glorious future; I think it is the present that needs a little attention. As long as we have our present party-line system in this country I shall continue to call it an imposition which no modern society should ever have to suffer or endure. The difficulties and frustrations caused by this system are without parallel, particularly in areas of concentrated farming such as one finds in the sugar industry on the Natal coast and in Zululand. I want to refer particularly to the problems of the sugar farmer in order to illustrate the difficulties that are experienced with the party-line system. The lot of these sugar farmers, to say the least of it, is indeed a sorry and sad one. In many cases they have adopted an attitude of despair in respect of the value, if any, of their telephone system. The hon. the Minister again referred to the sterling work done by the Post Office in regard to the saving of fuel. This is commendable and I do not want to dampen his enthusiasm in this area of endeavour. I wonder how he would feel, however, if I were to tell him about the many thousands of kilometres that have to be travelled by frustrated sugar farmers trying to contact millers, suppliers and others in respect of their business because they are unable to use their inefficient partylines? Neighbours on parallel party-lines have long despaired of making contact with each other by telephone. More often than not they have to resort to using vehicles and the subsequent wastage of fuel is a natural consequence of this fact. Cane farmers also live with the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads in the form of fire. Fire is a very real hazard to the cane farmer. I am sure there is no need to impress upon the House the need for an efficient and effective communications system in the dry season, namely the winter months. Hon. members have to witness only one cane fire to appreciate the gravity of what I am saying. Incidentally, while on this subject, I want to say that the harvesting of cane is a long process; it is not something which is done overnight; it takes nine months. It commences, at the latest, early in May and it is not concluded until, at the earliest, late in January of the following year. During this period of nine months the farmer relies heavily on his haulage equipment which is prone to break down because of the terrain in which it works, the difficulties under which it operates and the nature of the work it is required to do. These breakdowns require quick action on the part of service companies who are contacted by telephone and they in turn contact their service vehicles by radio. That is the theory; that is how it should work, but in practice the story is, more often than not, quite different. In practice the farmer usually battles for over an hour or more to get through to the <span class="col_2949-2950" refersTo="page_1490"/>local service agent, and, when he finds that he cannot get through, he gives up in desperation and drives into the village, only to be told that the tractor serviceman is working on his next door neighbour&#x2019;s farm. They then get through to him on the radio, and by the time the farmer gets back to his farm the job has been done, but for this I can assure you that no thanks are due to the telephone.</p>

<p>I could go on and on with this tale of unhappiness. Sir, I must express disappointment in the fact that the hon. the Minister did not even touch on the subject of party lines in his Budget speech this year. Not only is this disappointing, but it is also surprising when one refers to his Budget speech last year in which he dealt at length with party lines and even went on to tell us what the tariffs would be for the new automatic system which is envisaged. The annual report of the Postmaster-General, I regret to say, also glosses over this issue. In fact, I would like to say that it almost abandons it. It glosses over it with gay abandon; it is just left in an &#x201C;airy-fairy&#x201D; state.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. W. B. PAGE</person>:</from>

<p>This is a pitiful state of affairs right throughout the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to get away from the farms and back to the towns. I would like to deal with that happy hazard of dialling and hoping. You dial carefully and meticulously according to all the instructions which are printed in the telephone directory, and then you start hoping. I can assure you that prayer does not help. You can only hope that the number you have dialled is the one of the subscriber who answers the telephone. More often than not, it is not. Sir, this occupational hazard is fine for business houses because the Receiver of Revenue takes over 40% of the enormous additional revenue that accrues to the Post Office, as a result of the fact that people get wrong numbers. It is not so funny for the housewife who may be battling to get through to the butcher but repeatedly gets the bottle store, and heaven knows, she probably needs the bottle store by the time she does get through. This situation, Sir, is all the more aggravating when each such aventure costs eight cents&#x2014; speaking of this costing eight cents, the hon. member for Welkom has told us that everybody in South Africa can afford a telephone. Sir, I wonder if he has ever heard of a pensioner? I do not think that a pensioner can even afford the rental, much less the cost of a call&#x2014;permit me to explain how this can cost eight cents; it is quite simple. Exchanges in the automatic exchange areas are grouped. One exchange in each group is designated as a measuring exchange. Woe betide you, Sir, if you are unfortunate enough to find that you are told that your service will now be channelled through another exchange and that as from such-and-such a date your new number will be so-and-so. I say woe betide you. Sir, because I suggest that you should look very closely at the small print, as you may find that your home, like many others around you and in fact, practically the whole of your suburb, is well within the 10 km of the radial distance from the exchange that is currently serving you, but because the new exchange to which you have been told you will be channelled is out of that 10 km area, in other words further away, you have had it, to use the vernacular; you simply pay, and you are now in the happy position that it costs you eight cents to get the wrong number&#x2014; to get the wrong number continually. Sir, I make a sincere appeal to the hon. the Minister to give consideration to cases such as the one I have just outlined where they involve, in particular, dormitory suburbs, where they involve the home owner and the housewife. The housewife has had enough. To quote the classic example which, as the Minister knows, has existed in La Lucia and in Glen Ashley just north of Durban&#x2014;the one is a suburb of Durban and the other is immediately north&#x2014; when, if a housewife wants to telephone a trader in Durban North, which is immediately adjacent, she finds the cost of such call to be eight cents although they can practically throw stones on each other&#x2019;s roofs.</p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to deal very quickly with this new practice of the collection of mail by postmen from post boxes. I feel that this is something which the hon. the Minister could well have a re-think about. Many complaints have been received from constituents in Durban North. Pinetown, Queensborough, Umhlanga Rocks and Westville, stating that they are not satisfied <span class="col_2951-2952" refersTo="page_1491"/>with this service because they find that their mail takes too long to get to its destination.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telecommunications">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, from the Opposition speeches to which we have been listening this afternoon it is very clear that their criticism has very little substance. We have had various patterns of criticism here, even to the melodrama of the hon. member who is not present here at the moment, but who will probably return in a moment, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, to whose speech I shall reply in a moment. I hope an hon. member will have him informed. We even had references to Ethiopia, the former domain of Haile Selassie, alleging that the telephone service in that country is better, according to the United Party view, than the telephone service in South Africa. It does not surprise one to hear this from the United Party. That is their dilemma. That explains why they are what they are today. It is that disparaging attitude to South Africa. That is their basic problem, with which they are saddled, and it is probably the problem which will accompany them to the grave. Sir, if one wants to refer to other countries, as we had this reference to Ethiopia, Haile Selassie&#x2019;s country, where the telephone service is allegedly better than ours, then I can tell the hon. members that there are quite a number of other countries with which one could also draw comparisons if one is so eager to draw comparisons. Perhaps it would interest you to know that the other day, while I was on this trip of mine to study the operation of the liaison and works committee system, I visited a highly industrialized country such as France, and there no less a person than the representative of a very large electronics company told me at dinner table that in France it was a common saying that half the people in France were waiting for a telephone and the other half were waiting for the dialling tone. This is now being said of a major country such as France, a highly industrialized country, and a country for which one has great respect. What one really missed in this debate, Sir, was not so much the adulation and commendation of the department&#x2019;s activities, but mention of the fact that we have during the past year installed 123 000 telephones, a record number, something which I think does indeed deserve mention, even by the Opposition. It is a particularly great achievement that we have been able to install 123 000 telephones in this country during the past year. That the waiting-list has grown, is, as I stated very clearly in my Budget speech, due to the fact that we have during the past year received even more applications, for this dynamic country, South Africa, is developing so rapidly that no telephone system can keep pace with this tremendous development which we have in South Africa. Our development is taking place at such a tremendously rapid rate that the provision of telephones in many areas, simply cannot keep pace with it. Townships spring up overnight. The other day I was paying a visit to the town of the hon. member for Kempton Park, where we opened a beautiful new post office, and there I saw the new parts that were springing up in Kempton Park. It is completely impossible for the Post Office to keep pace all the time with the demand for telephones when towns spring up like toadstools in this rapidly developing country. Therefore one must be realistic and realize that it is completely impossible for any administration to provide telephones like something which one offers over a counter. I think we have over the years certainly given an account of the increased capital we received. However criticism is being levelled at us, and I should like to begin with the criticism of the principal critic, the hon. member for Durban Point. He had quite a lot to say about the 50/50 formula, and also asked why this generation should pay for the next generation. He wanted to know why this generation should bear such high tariffs for the sake of the next generation. Is this not the pattern in any developing country in the world? The present generation, we, are today enjoying the benefits of Iscor and the Vaal dam, to mention only two major undertakings which were constructed quite a number of years ago. To judge from the age of some of us who are sitting here, those undertakings were constructed by a previous generation. Yet we are today enjoying the benefits of those tremendous assets which were built up at the time. It is only natural that each generation should make its contribution, not only for its own sake, for what person lives only for himself, what nation only for itself? A person lives for his country, and the cause which goes with it. We are making our contribution as well to the people of the future, and so, too, will they <span class="col_2953-2954" refersTo="page_1492"/>have to make their contribution to those who come after them.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member spoke at length about the Franzsen Committee&#x2019;s formula. Perhaps I should remind the hon. members that the Franzsen formula was decided upon after very thorough consideration. As hon. members will remember, we had the benefit of the advice of the very efficient Franzsen Committee on which the Postmaster-General, a Mr. Brown, also served. The committee went very, very thoroughly into this whole matter. They also had in mind the policy of the International Bank for Reconstruction. The International Bank for Reconstruction laid down as one of the guidelines for all developed countries in the world that the expenditure from internal funds should be approximately 50% in respect of capital expenditure. The Franzsen Committee had this guideline in mind when it considered the whole aspect of financing. The committee then submitted the recommendation which today is the basis of the Post Office&#x2019;s financing. I do not think we can grumble about that. The persons who served on the committee were able people, and when they submitted their report, were acclaimed by all knowledgeable people as people who did an excellent job. The Post Office intends continuing with its financing policy on the basis recommended by the committee.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about the contribution which the SABC makes in this regard. I can say that the SABC pays us rental according to an approved formula in respect of the circuits which we provide. We had discussions with them and we came to an agreement on the formula which is applicable today. I can also say that the formula is based on the principle that the Post Office will receive a profitable fee. We do not have a sort of Father Christmas approach to this matter. The formula is really based on business considerations and we regard the formula as a good business proposition. It offers us a reasonable profit. I think that ought to satisfy us in this respect.</p>

<p>The hon. member also wanted to know what kind of co-operation there was between the Post Office and town planners. There is very close co-operation between the Post Office, the town planners and the municipalities. Our officials have continual discussions with them. When new towns come into being, they know in advance about them and they have the necessary discussions with them. It is impossible for us, however, to lay power cables in advance. He said that it could be done in the same way as with telephone cables. It can be done and it is done on certain occasions, but we only do it where it is really necessary. In many cases we lay the telephone cables in the same trenches in which the municipalities lay their cables. On the other hand, we cannot afford to lay millions of rands worth of cables too far in advance because we must get the money back. If we do not, the Opposition will really have something to complain about in a debate like this.</p>

<p>He also wanted to know what we were doing about cable faults. We are doing quite a lot about it. Only last night at the opening of the Post Office Sports Association tournament, which I had the honour to open at 6 o&#x2019;clock last night, I met some of the technicians from the Free State. They told me that they had been working on the Reef for the last couple of weeks in order to get things going. That is exactly what we are doing. We recruited teams from various centres in South Africa and I am very grateful indeed to them that they came to Johannesburg to help us. As I told hon. members on previous occasions, not all these people are so taken up with Johannesburg as some of our Johannesburg members because some of them still regard Johannesburg as a place where a good boy should not be.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the R1 000 million which is needed for the switching system and which is mentioned in this brochure. That amount only refers to the switching system and not to the whole telecommunications lay-out and development plan for the next 10 years. As a matter of fact, I foresee that the amount which will be spent on the telecommunications network will be double this R1000 million mention in this brochure.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg wanted to know about the training and the availability of instructors for training purposes. The hon. member for Parktown also referred to this but I shall refer to his remarks within a few moments. I am afraid that we do not have sufficient instructors, neither White instructors nor Black instructors. As a matter of fact, it is not only we who do not have enough instructors. Even the technical colleges do not have enough instructors to meet our demand. That, then, is the hard facts of the matter. We do not have enough instructors but if we had more we would have been able to do more in the field of the training of non-Whites.</p>

<p>*With reference to the question put by the hon. member for Wynberg on the overtime people are working. I just want to draw attention to the fact that the reply which was furnished, and to which he referred, referred only to the area of the Cape Town central telephone exchange. For the sake of fairness I just want to say that this really does not apply to the whole of South Africa, but only to this area. He also wanted to know about the meagre percentage basis in accordance with which we are remunerated for the services we are rendering. He referred to a half per cent, an eight per cent, and so on. That is true, but one has to take into consideration that we also, in return, receive many services from other departments. It is not only we who render services to other departments; they in turn render services to us, and for that reason it is a question of one hand washing the other. All this is taken into consideration when this percentage is determined.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the bonus schemes.</p>

<p>&#x2020;He spoke about the decrease for the provision of incentive bonuses He referred to the fact that the amount estimated for 1975-&#x2019;76 was R55 000 as opposed to R190 000 for 1974-&#x2019;75. Well, we have abolished certain bonus schemes where the production could not be effectively measured and where there was the danger of abuse. It is really a problem to judge productivity correctly. If one is going to pay these bonuses for a certain level of productivity, one must be in a position to measure that productivity. One of the great problems a country always has is to ascertain its productivity figure. To measure productivity in any country is one of the most difficult things there is. It is not a question of exact figures. One cannot simply rush data through a computer and expect a true and correct figure to appear. This problem is also encountered in the Post Office. There are different sorts of work in respect of which it is very difficult indeed for us to measure productivity so accurately that we are in a position to pay bonuses. Such a system naturally leads to abuse, something we want to prevent.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Sunnyside replied very effectively to the misrepresentation by the hon. member for Durban Point of the capital position. I want to thank him sincerely for the straight forward explanation which he furnished in that regard. The hon. member also referred to the question of the Pretoria post office building, and the microwave tower which is going to arise there. He asked for further information about it. We plan to have the main post office in Pretoria, which will be build on Church Square, ready by 1980. Because one has so much appreciation for Church Square, with the old Raadsaal on the one hand and the Palace of Justice on the other, this Post Office is being planned with great circumspection so that it will fit in with those two historic buildings. The new post office must not be so high that they will be dwarfed, and it must fit in with them architecturally. I want to give the assurance that the planning of the post office as well as the planning of the administrative building of the Provincial Administration, which will also fit in with the new post office, will take the historical character of Church Square into account. As regards the microwave tower which the hon. member wanted to know about, I want to say that it is being planned to erect it on Lucasrand. It is estimated that it will cost approximately R5.5 million, and that the tower will have been completed by 1978. I have already seen the design for this tower, and I must say that it is very striking. I honestly think that the microwave tower which is going to be erected on Lucasrand, as with all the other fine things which Pretoria has to offer, will be a credit to and a fine beacon for Pretoria.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown, of course, also complained about the telephone service. At least he did not make a wide <span class="col_2957-2958" refersTo="page_1494"/>detour to Haile Selassie, but he did complain about the quality. This is not what it should be, and we keep on saying on this. We have explained to you the problems we are facing. We hope to have this under control within a reasonable time. With reference to the telephone complaints, the appeal which the hon. member for Rustenburg made to the private sector ought to be stressed. On a previous occasion the Postmaster-General also made an appeal to private sector not to poach our technicians and at the same time expect us to maintain a service which is so good it puts us in the category of a utopia. The necessary attention was not given to that appeal, for the people think, as one says in English, that they &#x201C;can have it both ways.&#x201D; The Post Office staff can be poached and at the same time they can expect a good Post Office service. Unfortunately it does not work that way. Therefore I should very much like to emphasize the appeal made by the hon. member for Rustenburg to the private sector, namely that people should act with the utmost caution in this regard. If they are going to lure our people away, they are nothing but a lot of Eulenspiegels. No one can cut off his cloak at the bottom and add what he has cut off at the bottom to the top and expect to have a longer cloak. The cloak is still the same. In the meantime all that has been accomplished is to cause disruption in the Post Office.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Wynberg and Parktown took it upon themselves to plead for the abolition of separate amenities at Post Offices. Perhaps I should draw the attention of the hon. members to the fact that the previous member who advocated this, the hon. member for Florida, did not return to this House. The day he advocated this I asked him to put it to his constituency and to receive a mandate for this from his constituency. If he then received such a mandate we could listen again to what he had to say. You know what happened to him. The National Party representative for Florida is now sitting at the back there. That is the mandate. In other words the separate amenities must remain. I want to be very clear in regard to the question of separate amenities. Separate amenities have in fact been introduced in our post offices for the sake of sound race relations. These have been established to maintain sound relations between Whites and non-Whites. For decades these have worked very well. There is no reason whatsoever to abolish them. On the contrary. If we really want to aggravate race relations in South Africa, all we need to is abolish such essential and natural arrangements as these separate serving localities in our post offices. I concede that the number of sign-boards at some places could be reduced. Sometimes there are to many sign-boards. In fact, I noticed the other day with the opening of the post office at Edenvale that there was not a single sign-board in spite of the fact that there were separate serving localities for Whites and non-Whites. This is a matter for which local postmasters and bodies bear responsibility. This does not alter the fact that the separate amenities are in fact there, and these will remain because it is necessary for sound relations which this Government is maintaining in this country, and wants to maintain in future.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown referred to the narrowing of the wage gap. He referred to the returns, and arrived at the conclusion that no real narrowing had taken place. This is not a true picture of the matter, although the wage figures to which the hon. member referred, included all non-Whites. However, a great many of these non-White workers fall into the lowest, the bottommost labourers&#x2019; categories. In respect of the higher grades of non-Whites, however, one finds that there has during the past year been a significant narrowing of the wage gap in the Post Office, as in the Public Service. We intend continuing to narrow that gap in future. For that reason the figures mentioned do not present a precise picture of the good work we are in fact doing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown also referred to the question of the non-White liaison body on staff associations. Since 1969 already the Coloureds have had a recognized Coloured Persons&#x2019; Post Office Workers Association The Indians have had one since 1973. Since the beginning of this year extensive liaison machinery has been created in the Post Office for the Bantu staff. This liaison machinery operates on three levels. The lowest level, which is the direct and most important level, consist of the workers themselves. In offices, sections or workshops where there are at least 20 Black workers, one Black worker who has had at least two years&#x2019; service is elected by his fellow-workers as their representative or a spokesman. Five of these representatives on the second level serve on a regional labour committee in the department. Together with the regional director <span class="col_2959-2960" refersTo="page_1495"/>of the department and other persons they comprise these regional labour committees in the Post Office. They hold quarterly meetings and discuss the interests of the Black workers, and help to prevent labour unrest. There is opportunity for very wide discussion. On the third level we find the Labour Board, which has now been established in the Post Office. The Deputy Postmaster-General is the chairman. The Labour Board discusses matters relating to the regional committees, and expresses opinions in that regard. In this way a liaison system for Black workers has now been established in the Post Office which really ought to work very satisfactorily. It is really a system which corresponds to that of the Railway, and on the Railways this system has already been working very satisfactorily for a considerable time. I expect this system to produce good results in the Post Office as well.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for South Coast referred to the savings bank and to national saving certificates. He complained that we were not drawing enough money for the savings bank. The other side of the story, however, is that the building societies and the banks are complaining that we are drawing too much money. That is a very serious situation. They feel that we offer such attractive interest rates and other facilities that we are proving to be unfair competition. We have taken note of that because we believe in live and let live. In consequence, the Treasury and the Postmaster-General will have to discuss this matter because basically the Treasury and the Minister of Finance determine the conditions which apply to these savings. The fact that we are not drawing enough is a matter to which. I referred in my speech yesterday. I said that over the past ten years the Savings Bank has not shown much of an increase but that in the past year it had increased considerably owing to all the new and attractive aspects which we have introduced. I do not think there is anything I can do to improve on the position as it is.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South very melodramatically used the question of a certain letter as his point of attack on this Budget. In this regard I want to tell the hon. member that apart from the statutory provision in terms of which letters which are undeliverable or are in conflict with the Post Office Act or other statutory provisions are opened in the dead letter office, the Post Office itself has no power to open letters. This is the first point I want to make to the hon. member. The Post Office has no other power. The Post Office Act, however, allows a letter to be made available by the Post Office to a competent authority, at the request of such authority, for examination if it is in the interests of national security. This provision was inserted after the Potgieter Report brought this to our attention in 1972. The interception of a letter by the Post Office can therefore only take place for reasons of security upon a written request of a person authorized thereto by the State Security Council to make such a request. In addition that request shall also be considered by the officer appointed thereto and especially authorized to do this, and not by any officer in the Post Office. Thirdly, that officer must satisfy himself that the interception is necessary. As far as this letter it concerned, in regard to which we had all this melodrama, I just want to say that the Post Office has no knowledge of the opening of the letter to which the hon. member referred. Nor, with reference to what I have just told this House, did we receive such a request from the State Security Council for the interception of such a letter either. It is now being expected of me to investigate this matter further. I would urge the hon. member to follow this matter up a little further. The hon. member himself referred to the fact that these letters came from the same source&#x2014;England. Is it not possible that the people, at the point where these letters came from, made a mistake by placing the letters in different envelopes?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlanga referred here to telephone charges according to the radial system. In reply to him I should like to say that we formerly had the so-called grid system which was under perpetual criticism also because eight cents instead of four cents had to be paid per call unit beyond a certain point. Whether the radial or the grid system is applied, the fact remains that a line must be drawn somewhere beyond which a higher unit rate must apply. We are satisfied that the radial system we are now applying is a fairer and a more scientifically precise method of demarcation than the old grid system. I am afraid that no system will be able to satisfy everybody.</p>

<p>Schedules 1 and 2:</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. the Minister replied to the Second Reading debate, he seemed to think that because in other countries half the people were waiting for telephone services and the other half were waiting for the dialling tone, that excused the position in South Africa. It seemed to me that the, hon. the Minister was suggesting that be-&#x2019; cause everyone else was inefficient, we should be proud of the fact that we are' also inefficient. I just cannot understand that sort of argument. I do not think it, washes, and I think that if the hon. the Minister feels that that is the way in which he is going to reply to genuine complaints about the way he conducts his department, I think he should start thinking all over again and see whether he cannot apply his mind to the complaints and the questions raised by hon. members on this side of the House.</p>

<p>*The hon. the Minister referred to townships which were springing up like mushrooms and said that townships such <span class="col_2963-2964" refersTo="page_1497"/>as those could not expect a telephone service, but in the same breath the hon. the Minister said he was receiving the full cooperation of town planners when townships are established.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It seems to me that the hon. the Minister placing the emphasis on the wrong point. Where we want the co-operation is at the time when townships are planned, and we want continuous liaison between the planners of the townships and the hon. the Minister. The Minister must be in touch with what is going on, he must know whether the plots in the township are selling like hot cakes, and he must also know whether houses are being erected. He should be in constant touch. When he sees these things going like wildfire, then he must start laying the tables. He must not wait until the houses have been occupied. He must not wait until the business area has been completely built and then say, &#x201C;I am sorry, I have no cables; I cannot give you telephones; you will just have to wait&#x201D;. I am under the impression that that is the attitude of the hon. the Minister. I do not say it is the attitude of his department. I do not think it is the attitude of the Postmaster-General, but I do think that the Postmaster-General is entitled to a little encouragement from the Minister and I do not think he is getting that encouragement. I believe that the hon. the Minister should look into this matter more carefully and try to apply his mind to it.</p>

<p>Sir, on the question of capital and the financing of capital requirements, what does the hon. the Minister say in his reply?</p>

<p>*He said that the Vaal Dam was built by a previous generation and so was Iscor, but what the hon. the Minister did not tell us was whether the Vaal Dam and Iscor were financed from Revenue Account. I do not think this was the case, and this is the whole point. The point of the argument is not that the Vaal Dam and Iscor were built by a previous generation; the argument is that capital works in the Post Office are being financed from Revenue account today. If these capital works are not only intended for this generation but also for later generations, why should they then be financed from Revenue Account? Why could loan capital not be obtained for this purpose? I am very sorry, but the hon. the Minister had hold of the wrong end of the stick altogether.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then the hon. the Minister says that the Franzsen Commission decided on a certain formula in regard to the financing of capital works for the Post Office. But the hon. the Minister does not tell us and remind us that the Franzsen Commission sat for many, many years. That may have been the situation in which the Franzsen Commission found things when they started their deliberations. I think they started 10 years before they finished, they sat quite a long time ago, and I think conditions have changed very much since then. I do not like the attitude of the Minister, who says, &#x201C;The Franzsen Commission decided that 15 years ago, and what they decided 15 years ago is good enough for me and I am not going to inquire into it&#x201D;. I would like to know why the hon. the Minister does not inquire into it again. I want to know why he did not do it this year. He has not told us that he is going to inquire into the question of financing capital works next year. Are we to understand that the hon. the Minister is going to stand by the recommendation of the Franzsen Commission made 15 years ago and that he is going to say, &#x201C;I am not going to introduce any improvements on the commission&#x2019;s recommendation; I do not see why I should&#x201D;? Sir, I am perfectly certain that conditions in regard to services provided by the Post Office have changed very considerably in the last 15 years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What is more, he is exceeding Franzsen&#x2019;s recommendation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he is. As I pointed out in my Second Reading speech, the hon. the Minister is doing far better than Franzsen ever wanted him to do. He is financing more than half of his capital works out of income. The Minister brushes aside my suggestion that other Government departments should be charged on a proper basis for services rendered to them by his department. He brushes it aside by saying that other departments also provide services to the Post Office. The services provided by other departments are enumerated on page 10 of R.P. 13&#x2014;&#x2019;75. The departments which provide services are the Departments of Public Works, Social Welfare and Pensions, Community Development, Foreign Affairs, Mines, Justice, the Department of the Controller and Auditor-General and other departments. What does it add up to? This year it amounted to just over R1,5 million. This is chicken-feed compared <span class="col_2965-2966" refersTo="page_1498"/>with what other departments get from the Post Office. If the hon. the Minister uses this as an argument for saying that he is not going to revise the tariff which he applies to other Government departments, his argument is nonsensical. I believe that the hon. the Minister must have a look at that formula. He must have a look at the way in which he charges other Government departments. I am pretty certain that if he does that, he will not need to increase these tariffs by one cent this year. He will have more than enough money. The burden will be equally spread right over all the Government departments and the taxpayer will not feel the load in the same way as the telephone user is feeling it today and will feel it particularly after 1 April. I do not think that the hon. the Minister has replied satisfactorily to any of the matters which we have raised.</p>

<p>The way in which the hon. the Minister replied to the question I raised in regard to bonus incentives I thought was puerile. The hon. the Minister said that it was difficult to judge productivity and that the only way in which one could pay an incentive bonus was if you could judge productivity. He finds it very difficult to do so. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has never heard of a study known as job evaluation. Has he never done anything like that in his Department? Surely he has. He must have a job evaluation system in his department; he must know what the value is of every work that is done in his department. He must know that if a man does more than what is required of him, he is entitled to a little extra. Surely, that is what the incentive bonus is for, for higher productivity than can honestly be expected of a man. If he wants things to be efficient, then surely he must hang the carrot in front of the donkey to get him to walk. I think this is a very simple matter. The hon. the Minister says: &#x201C;I am sorry, I can do nothing about it.&#x201D; He throws his hands up in the air and he says: &#x201C;I am not even going to spend as much this year as I spent last year. Last year I spent almost R200 000; this year I do not even want to spend R55 000.&#x201D; This is the answer we get. No, I do not think the hon. the Minister is playing the game with this House.</p>

<p>*Then we have the question of separate development. The hon. the Minister told us that we should go back to our constituencies and obtain a mandate from them if we do not want separate development in the Post Office. He says there is no reason for abolishing separate development. However, what does the hon. the Prime Minister say who is sitting in the bench next to him? The hon. the Prime Minister says we must put a stop to this kind of thing which hurts people. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have come back to a discussion of the financing of the capital programme of the Post Office. It is very clear to us that the United Party is not adopting the same standpoint in the Post Office Budget debate as they adopted in the Railway Budget debate.</p>

<p>In what way?</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>I shall prove that hon. members are dealing with these two aspects completely separately. The hon. member for Durban Point said yesterday that we shall never be able to make up the backlog from our capital provision. This implies only one thing, viz. that too little capital is being provided to make up the backlog. That is what that hon. member is implying. However, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat said that we must spend capital. He wants us to lay down the necessary cables in new townships, whether there are houses there or not. Therefore he wants the capital to lie there without accumulating interest until inhabitants move into the township one day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not say that.</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>But that is what the hon. member implied. [Interjections.] Not one of the hon. members who were so wise said where the capital is to come from. Everyone criticizes capital being drawn from revenue. They are against that, but truly, not one of them said where the capital is to come from. When we were dealing with the capital Budget last year, the hon. member for Durban Point asked how the hon. the Minister could allow a growth of only 9&#x00BD;% in his capital programme, because according to the hon. member, the rate of inflation was between 10% and 11%. He asked how one could ever make up a backlog if inflation would consume one&#x2019;s whole programme. Those are the arguments which those hon. members use. They accuse us of not making sufficient provision but, as I say, not one <span class="col_2967-2968" refersTo="page_1499"/>of them says from where the funds are to be obtained. Only one way remains then, viz. that if one wants to make up the backlog in telecommunication services, one must make use of loan capital. That is the only way out.</p>

<p>When we were dealing with the Railway Budget last week, the hon. member for Maitland said that the Railways could not be run profitably because the interest burden was too large and that something would have to be done about that. What they did not want to be done in the case of the Railways, they now advocate for the Post Office. How is one to understand them? In the one case, the burden of interest is too heavy, but when it comes to the Post Office, they say that capital must be borrowed&#x2014;making the burden of interest even heavier. I really cannot understand the argumentation of those hon. members. When we look at the Budget, we shall see that the Post Office already carries an interest burden of R61 million, in other words, 11&#x00BD;% of the revenue, which is not too high. We heard in the Railway debate that the burden of interest of the Railways is between 13% and 14% of its revenue. Here it is only 11.5%. As against this, the steps which the Government is taking in respect of the Post Office, viz. to finance from revenue, is a very sound policy. The hon. member for Constantia is always saying that inflation is the archenemy of our country. These measures &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>You also say so.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is the case: I agree with him. If an organization finances its capital from its revenue, as the Post Office does, it is in fact anti-inflationary. But the hon. members do not want this either&#x2014;on the contrary; they advocate that we should encourage inflation indirectly. [Interjections.] Now I want to know how the hon. members justify their argument. The Post Office works partly on a cash basis. Let us look at the capital for which this Budget makes provision. It comes to an amount of R213 million. In the past four years we have spent between 82% and 84% of the annual capital programme on telecommunication services. Of the amount for which we are budgeting this year, we are providing 85.4% for telecommunication services. After all, it is a legitimate share of the capital amount which is spent on services. The hon. member for Durban Point said yesterday that he objects to our providing R119 million of this R213 million from revenue. The hon. member just mentioned a figure. I could have told him what one can say about figures, but I shall rather not do so because it will probably be unparliamentary. Of the amount of R119 million, R43 million is earmarked for depreciation. Then 50% of this amount is still added to the depreciation to make provision for the increased replacement costs. In other words, R64&#x00BD; million of the R119 million must be used for replacement costs in the vast network which the Post Office in South Africa has at its disposal. Surety this is not for capital expansion; it is for replacement costs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Is depreciation of 30% an ordinary depreciation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>It means that in this Budget an amount of R47&#x00BD; million is being budgeted in respect of further expansion of capital services. When one calculates this amount in relation to the total capital, programme, one gets a percentage of 22,3% which to my mind is not unhealthily high. Let us take a look at our capital programme. In the financial year 1972-&#x2019;73, only R12 million was budgeted. Therefore, that R12 lion was related to the provision for expansion from revenue and did not include depreciation. This was 18,7% of the amount which was budgeted for the capital programme.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Chairman, I am slightly old-fashioned. I mean 18,7%. In 1973-&#x2019;74, the percentage was 14,9%.</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>In 1975 the percentage was 15,7% and for the financial year 1975-&#x2019;76 it is 22,3%. I think that it is a fair and legitimate part of revenue. Let us look at depreciation. In 1972-&#x2019;73 provision was made for depreciation to the amount of R35 million, in 1973-&#x2019;74, for ah <span class="col_2969-2970" refersTo="page_1500"/>amount of R41 million, for the following year, R48 million, and now provision is being made for an a mount of R63&#x00BD; million. I think it is very important that we maintain the formula which was prescribed by the Franzsen Commission. I think that it is encouraging to find that we can finance our Post Office in such a way that it is not necessary for us to incur foreign or other loans for everything and to pay tremendous interest rates on these. If we think that we have to pay R61 million in interest at the present moment, while we have introduced an increase of 7,6% in tariffs, which only gives us a revenue of R38 million, we can think what amount we shall have to supplement in the future by means of tariffs, just to pay the increased burden of interest. There is a formula according to which depreciation is calculated. The percentages are not arbitrary. A certain percentage of it is levied for replacement of properties, a certain percentage for vehicles, and so on. In other words, the provision for depreciation takes place on a predetermined basis. Therefore I think that the hon. members are advancing a nonsensical argument when they say that too much is being provided from revenue.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to refer to one local matter, to the Vaal Triangle, and in particular to Vanderbijlpark. I want to express my thanks and appreciation for the fact that the hon. the Minister has made provision in this Budget for about R¼ million for the erection of a new exchange. It is expected that R160 000 will be spent on this project during the financial year. I know that in recent years there have been certain problems in this rapidly growing area. The hon. the Minister is also aware of this. As far as our industrial areas and our business centres are concerned, I am grateful that the demand can already be met to a reasonable extent. Now I should like to address a plea to the hon. the Minister. Iscor has accelerated its building programme tremendously. An average of more than a house per day is being build and two areas are being developed where more than 800 houses will be built in the coming year or two. We are aware of the burden which has been placed on the department, but I want to ask that that programme be speeded up if possible. In this I want to include the Bedworth Park residential area which is situated between Vereeniging and Vanderbijlpark, and which will fall under the Vanderbijlpark exchange. Even there services must be rendered.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to refer to the appalling damage which is caused by vandalism in our country. Over the last six years, damage amounting to almost R500 000 has been done to apparatus, equipment, etc., and I am asking for very stringent action to be taken against the people who are guilty of this. I believe that they should not be fined, but should be imprisoned as a matter of course. Really and truly, if a citizen does not appreciate the facilities of his own country, I think that there should be no mercy for him. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark unburdened himself of many profundities here on the financing of the Post Office. In the process he <i>inter alia</i> levelled an accusation at the hon. member for Maitland on a matter relating to the Railways. I just want to remind the hon. member that in the case of the Railways it is against the law to finance mere capital expansion and development from revenue. Surely we have an example here of where this is being financed from loan funds.</p>

<p>On two previous occasions I devoted a considerable portion of my speech in this debate to an analysis of the volume of post handled by the Post Office. Today I just want to refer briefly to this, with particular reference to what the hon. the Minister said in his Budget Speech, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A sustained growth in the volume of mail handled was also maintained during the year.</block>

<p>Naturally the Minister was not able to furnish us with statistics. Unfortunately we do not know whether this sustained growth was in reality an exceptional growth. Nor do we know whether this sustained growth related to second-class or to first-class postal articles. Consequently I would appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could tell us how the growth compared for example with the year 1969-&#x2019;70, a year which, in respect of the volume of post handled, was a peak year. In that year a really large volume of post was handled in South Africa. If we were able to compare the latest position with that year, we would be able to see whether we have made any real progress. Since 1969-&#x2019;70 there has been a definite tendency to a smaller turnover of volume in respect of a large number of categories, particularly in respect of agricultural post. That tendency has manifested itself in spite <span class="col_2971-2972" refersTo="page_1501"/>of the population growth and economic development. In the year 1973-&#x2019;74, however, there was an increase, compared with the previous year, but if one compares this with the figures which appear on page 52 of the Annual Report, one finds that that increase was in reality attributable mainly to an increase in the number of newspapers which were handled. In other words, this was a growth in second-class post, therefore not a category from which the Post Office could make a profit. I know the hon. the Minister will say that greater use was made of telecommunications, but I assume that this was not the principal cause of the decrease. I also want to tell the hon. the Minister that the growth in the volume of airmail was also not of such a nature that it could in any way have been the cause of this decrease. I have taken note of the fact that mention is made in the Annual Report that the statistics for previous years were unreliable, or rather that the statistics for this year are more reliable than those for previous years. The fact remains, however, that we have to accept that those statistics were valid enough to reveal a tendency. This tendency, and I have no other evidence for it, is that there has been a gradual annual decrease in first-class post. I am not going to make an issue of whether it involves 2 million or 20 million articles, but the fact remains that in the volume for the year 1973-&#x2019;74 there was a decrease of 240 million articles in comparison with 1969-&#x2019;70. I accept that this may be an unreliable figure, but it nevertheless indicates a tendency. I want the Post Office to accept that, when one does not make use of certain facilities, it means that there is a certain amount of consumer resistance in that regard. That consumer resistance could in the first place be due to unrealistic tariffs, or, in the second place, to inefficient service. I believe that what the Post Office should really do, is to establish beyond any doubt what categories of postal articles most readily produce a profit for the Post Office. Once they have established this, they must take positive steps in respect of those categories to bring about an increased turnover. With that in mind, I want to advance a plea this evening that the Post Office should for example, make more effective use of private aviation companies, to enable a better airmail service to be offered to more parts of South Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I am aware of the fact that the Post Office does utilize, for instance, the services of Cape Air and Namaqua Air. Although I have no definite information I assume that the Post Office is also making use of the services of the larger aviation companies in the Transvaal. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the Post Office has only scratched the surface of this particular method of increasing its turnover.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the House adjourned I was appealing to the hon. the Minister to see to it that the Post Office utilized the services of private aviation companies for the distribution of airmail. I want to take the province of Natal as an example. In Natal one finds that every major town has a daily scheduled flight connecting it with Durban and in some cases also with Johannesburg. My information is that the Post Office does not utilize all the facilities available to it. There are several flights from Empangeni and Richards Bay to Durban. There are also flights from Margate, Pietermaritzburg and Ladysmith to Durban. There are daily flights from Dundee to Durban and from Dundee to Johannesburg with feeder services to Newcastle and Vryheid. Anyone who has tried to communicate by means of ordinary surface mail with a person in Northern Natal knows that this is a time-consuming operation. One can also say that the telecommunications service, especially between Empangeni and Durban, is virtually nonexistent. If the hon. member for Eshowe, who is normally a quiet member, were to participate in this debate, he would be able to vouch for this. The phenomenal growth which is going to take place in the Richards Bay/Empangeni complex, as well as in Newcastle, will of course ensure the viability and the profitability of such a service. Apart from that, I believe that the people living in those areas, i.e. the people of Newcastle, Dundee, Empangeni and Vryheid, are entitled to a better, quicker and more efficient postal service.</p>

<p>I now briefly want to refer to two other matters. I believe the time has come for the Post Office to take a policy decision in this regard. The first concerns radio communications and the allocation of frequencies, <span class="col_2973-2974" refersTo="page_1502"/>a matter which is controlled by the Post Office. In South Africa we have a limited number of channels available for radio communication. A large number of these channels have naturally permanently been taken up by the Government for essential services. I am not criticizing that. What I should like the Post Office to do, however, is to reconsider the division of the channels into interlocking cells, each with a diameter of 160 km. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the start of his speech the hon. member for Durban Central, who has just resumed his seat referred to the number of postal articles handled by the Post Office. By implication, what he really wants to know is what steps are being taken to increase that number of postal articles. As I see it, the number of articles handled is not the point at issue. The point at issue is the quality of service provided by the Post Office, the ability of the Post Office to handle what is given to it thoroughly and efficiently. I contend, and I am convinced that I am correct, that up to now the Post Office has always handled the work given to it with the greatest efficiency. Consequently it is unnecessary for the Post Office to seek extra business. The service rendered by the Post Office is such as to enable it to expand its services. When he took part in the Committee Stage earlier on, the hon. member for Wynberg harped on that same old topic, viz. separate entrances and separate facilities in Post Offices. He wants this to be done away with. The hon. the Minister had already referred to that matter very effectively earlier in his reply and pointed out to the hon. member that separate facilities were essential for the sake of good race relations in this country. This is true, after all, and the hon. member knows it. What one cannot understand, however, is the insistent harping and hammering on this one topic. I want to tell you that the Whites in this country are getting tired of the continual grumbling of the Opposition, to the effect that those things that have been introduced in order to preserve peace between the races in this country should be done away with. I want to tell you that if the United Party should continue in this fashion, it will suffer an even greater defeat at the next election that it did last year. What the hon. member did was to come and play politics here, because his position in Wynberg is at stake. After all, we know what the circumstances are, and we know how he had to fight against the Reformists in the ranks of the United Party to be able to get the nomination again. Now he has to butter them up a little, otherwise next time he will be without a seat.</p>

<p>There are a few other matters which I should very much like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister in the very short time at my disposal. They are matters relating to my constituency.</p>

<p>I could begin&#x2014;and I do it with the greatest pleasure&#x2014;by thanking the hon. the Minister and his department for the voting of &#x2026; [Interjections.] Yes, we on this side of the House are always positive in contrast to the negative attitude we get from that side. Provision is being made here for the construction of the new exchange in a part of Springs, an exchange that will eventually cost R425 000. I am told that it will carry about 3 000 extra lines. Together, therefore, with the main exchange which is still under construction at the moment and which will carry approximately I 600 additional lines, the backlog in Springs ought to be eliminated before long. But now there is something else in this regard which I want to bring to your attention, Sir, and this is that, as has already been announced, the second Sasol is going to be situated somewhere to the east of Springs. Now, it is immaterial exactly where it is going to be situated, but what is material here is that the second Sasol is going to be built in that vicinity and that Springs&#x2014;it is reasonable to expect&#x2014;will have to accommodate the growth that will stem from this.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, not only is it going to be another Nat seat; it is going to result in a second Nat seat as well. In order to accommodate that growth, it is essential that an efficient telecommunications system should be established there. I have already referred to the approval that is being requested for the construction of an additional exchange there, but I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it <span class="col_2975-2976" refersTo="page_1503"/>would not be possible to expedite the construction of that exchange. I accept that in ordinary circumstances that exchange would only be completed by about 1980, and that is not unreasonable. However, bearing in mind the circumstances that have arisen in the meantime, I want to ask whether it will not be possible to expedite the matter a little. That is the first point.</p>

<p>The second point is that as we see it, owing to the growth that is going to take place there as the result of the coming of the second Sasol, that exchange will not be able to accommodate the extra load, and for that reason I want to ask whether it would not be possible at this stage to consider the possibility of extending the other exchanges in the vicinity of Springs in good time.</p>

<p>The third matter is one I have already raised with the hon. the Minister, viz. a concession in respect of telephone fees for our social pensioners. I know that there are many problems in this regard and there is no time to deal with them this evening. I realize what the department&#x2019;s difficulties are. I also realize the problem of principle that is involved here. However, when one considers those old, and in many cases, ill people, then I think one is justified in saying that they really deserve a concession. It is not for me to say what form that concession should take. I should prefer to leave it to the sound judgment of the hon. the Minister and his department to consider whether they could not accommodate these old people in one way or another in this regard. I must honestly say that in my opinion we owe them some form of assistance.</p>

<p>A great deal has been said about the coming of television and the effect this will have on the labour position in the Post Office, particularly as far as the technical section is concerned. In the fourth place I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the time has not come for the television industry to be burdened with the cost of the training of these technicians. On the same subject I again want to plead, as I did last year, that women be utilized on a larger scale. At the same time I want to say that in my opinion, greater use should also be made of existing technical institutions for the training of married women in particular, who could then be used in suitable positions in the Post Office.</p>

<p>In regard to university bursaries to which reference has also been made, and for which I, too, want to convey my thanks, I want to ask whether the time has not come for greater attention to be given to the schools at an early stage with a view to recruitment and the advertising of the services of the Post Office. Pupils can be approached in their matriculation year and informed of the benefits of a career in the Post Office. In most cases they will already have decided on their field of study and in those circumstances I want to ask whether they should not deliberately be encouraged, even from Std. 7, to join the Post Office service, particularly with a view to the variety of careers offered by the Post Office.</p>

<p>As far as philately is concerned, I want to ask whether consideration could not be given to making available an album, as referred to yesterday by the Minister in his Budget speech, in a form intended for children and pupils. What I have in mind here is a simple kind of album which the pupils could buy and which could stimulate their interest in this field. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. member for Springs makes a plea on behalf of pensioners and asks that they receive special consideration from the Posts and Telecommunications Department, I can assure him that he has the wholehearted support of this side of the House. We have been pleading for this for years and I am pleased to see that at last we are hearing something of an echo in this regard from the other side. In any event, I can assure him that he has the full support of hon. members on this side of the House in regard to pensioners.</p>

<p>The hon. member also touched on the question of recruiting in schools. I am surprised to hear that not enough has been done because I know that most centres have a careers week for their schools. Whether these are run by Rotary or other public-spirited bodies, I cannot say, but I know that Government departments usually have their stalls erected there. If my memory serves me correctly, the Department of Posts and Telecommunications was not backward in coming forward in that respect. Sir, I must cross swords with the hon. member when he attacks my colleague, the hon. member for Wynberg. All the hon. member for Wynberg was doing was <span class="col_2977-2978" refersTo="page_1504"/>to make a plea that discriminatory petty apartheid should be done away with.</p>

<p>The department should never leave any stone unturned to endeavour to improve and maintain the arteries of communication which exist in this country. When I say that, Sir, I want to include everybody because, to my dismay, I cannot help feeling when I read the publications which were issued in regard to this Budget that the department is White-orientated. It forgets that it has a vast Black and Brown market knocking at its door to do business with it. But before I come to that theme. Sir, there are one or two complaints which I feel I must bring to light. When we had the recent heavy rains in Durban, the lines were out of order and I was not pleased to find this headline in a newspaper: &#x201C;Phone crisis is a scandal.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I think it was a scandal, because people were without telephones for up to about a fortnight. Surely there must be something wrong with the organization somewhere. That sort of thing should not happen in a modern State like this. My other complaint is in regard to the men who work in the exchanges at night in the country districts. I do not know whether they are part-time or full-time operators, but the point is that while this does not apply to all of them, they are generally ill-mannered and have no idea of what it means to give good service. I often wonder how many of them are asleep when you do happen to phone a country town in the middle of the night. It takes hours and hours to get a reply, and when they do come on the line eventually they are short-tempered with you, and that in turn makes you short-tempered with them. I would like to know what form of supervision there is over these men. I know that some of them are fly-by-night creatures. Discipline seems to be sadly lacking there, and I would like to see it tightened up.</p>

<p>I referred earlier on to the department being White-orientated. Shorn of all the verbiage we have read in the annual report, the department is supposed to be run on business lines. Well then, like any other business, it should seek business. But one gets the impression that the department waits for the business to come to it instead of seeking the business. Here I would like to refer to something which is a hardy annual with me, namely the telephones in the townships. I think it is a positive disgrace that a department the size of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications should allow these non-White townships to suffer as they do through a lack of telephone facilities.</p>

<p>I do not want to hear the old story about vandalism. We know that vandalism exists, even in the White areas, but surely it is not beyond the wit of the department to erect telephone booths near police stations &#x2014;mind you, they are few and far between &#x2014;or near a railway station, because the amount of crime that takes place which is never reported to the Police is shocking, and it is not reported because of the lack of telephones. When the inmates of those townships are burgled they are scared to go to the Police because they will only be <span class="col_2979-2980" refersTo="page_1505"/>hammered on their way there. I also want to suggest that when the department tries out self-service post offices, these could be used with magnificent effect in the non-White townships, particularly in the Indian townships. I am thinking for example of Chatsworth and other townships, and of course Wentworth for the Coloureds and Umlazi. If these self-service post offices are a success in the White areas, I venture to say that they will be ten times as successful in the non-White areas.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I cannot but object to the attack made by the hon. member for Umlazi on telephone operators doing night service. Most of us associated with rural areas and I personally, and I am sure a great many members on this side of the House, can testify to the most courteous treatment one receives from these people, and often under difficult circumstances. The hon. member, who is an ex-officer of the S.A. Police and who ought to know or ought to remember that night duty is a strain on anyone, ought to know too that these people are sometimes treated with some discourtesy on the part of the public. We should like to express our appreciation towards these people from this side of the House. The hon. member also complained about the so-called telephone crisis which has become a disgrace. The hon. member, who use to be a policeman, ought to know that, with the necessary connections for a telecommunication system, it is essential for such connections to be insulated. Unfortunately it is a fact that, water being what it is, the insulation is not always successful. One may quote the example of, among other things, a connection beneath a road. The vibration of the weight of the vehicles passing over the top causes cracks to develop in the connections. I think the hon. member could testify himself that he also causes some vibration when walking over a connection.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to convey the appreciation of the public of Harrismith to the department&#x2014;I am referring to intern 103, under &#x201C;News Services&#x201D;&#x2014;for the installation of an automatic exchange in the Harrismith area. We notice from the Estimates that an amount of R30 000 is going to be spent this year and an amount of R325 000 during ensuing years. We should like to give the department the assurance that this decision is appreciated and that we are looking forward to the day when it will be possible for this service to be introduced.</p>

<p>Tonight I want to express a few thoughts in connection with one of the divisions which I believe could with justification be called an unexploited source of wealth, i.e. the philatelic service of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. When one considers that the sales turnover increased by approximately 600% during the past three years and that the profit, over the same period, increased by more than 1 000%, one appreciates the value this service has. I believe that we should not measure the value of this department only by the financial benefits it entails, but that we should also give attention to some of the supplementary aspects in which the service rendered by this department is of inestimable value and which, to my mind, could be exploited to an increasing extent in future. In the first place, there is the educational value this service has. The way in which historic events are being effectively emphasized singled out through the issuing of commemorative envelopes, envelopes which aim to bring to the attention of the public both the design of the stamp and usually the event to which they refer is being noted with appreciation. The most important value these commemorative envelopes have is, to my mind, the little card which is enclosed. On the side of this little card one usually finds an illustration of the event or item and, on the reverse side, a full description of the event or item. I took three of these envelopes at random. I did not select them deliberately. This one deals with South West Africa and its geographical and paleontographic value, particularly with regard to engravings and sketches. On the one side of the card one finds a rock painting by some native tribes of earlier times while on the reverse side one finds a full description of the rock painting. I have another one here which was issued to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Sasol. A full discussion of the origin of Sasol is given. The third one I consider to be excellent. It deals with the well-known, but rare, Burgers pound. On the one side of the card one finds a reproduction of Gen. Burgers, and a full description of the Burgers pound on the other.</p>

<p>I want to advocate to the department that it should continue to issue these historic commemorative envelopes and that more attention should be given to the use of the enclosed card for a clear discussion or exposition of the area or the item. I believe this is a valuable service because it could encourage a relatively inexpensive hobby, a hobby which does not require much <span class="col_2981-2982" refersTo="page_1506"/>storage space, a hobby which the whole family could enjoy and which could keep the family together, a hobby which is particularly suitable for small groups and, to my mind, also to the three Opposition parties in this House, all of which are operating as small groups.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to ask the hon. the Minister to develop to the full the publicity value of our philately division. In the inflationary conditions in which we and the world are living today, effective use should be made of every opportunity. It was with gratitude that we took cognizance of four exhibitions abroad and the establishment of offices there for the sale of stamps and commemorative envelopes. In view of this interest, I think that attempts should be made to make the design of stamps more attractive for tourists. During the past few years use was often made of design on which animals or birds or flowers were depicted. This has an attraction for South Africans, but I believe, in view of the tourists potential, our sun, our sea, our open spaces, our mountains and our plains are the most valuable assets South Africa has. I believe that representations of these items could be adopted in an artistic way in the form of stamps which could serve as effective tourist publicity abroad.</p>

<p>One wonders whether the time has not arrived for us to make more effective use, on a business basis, of the possibilities presented by philately. This may sound far-reaching, but I think the possibility may be investigated of using the philately service and the design of our stamps in such a way that they may be used by various departments or even by various bodies on condition that the designs by the various departments are sponsored by the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. When one looks around for examples, one finds that the Christmas season, for example, in South Africa has to a large extent become a time for travelling. Could consideration not be given to choosing the design of the stamps used on Christmas cards&#x2014;I think it is a 3 cent stamp&#x2014;in such a way that it is a constant reminder to the motorist to drive carefully? An amount for this purpose could be appropriated by the Road Safety Council. I also believe that it is possible to bring to the attention of the public, by means of a stamp, certain consumer goods which are subjected to very strict inspection and selection. The idea is not to obtain cheap publicity for certain items or events.</p>

<p>What I have in mind, is that we could, in this way, utilize the financial value it has for the Department of Posts and Telecommunications. I have in mind here examples of advertising which are aimed at reminding the public of a certain item or event as much as possible. When, for example, the Department of Water Affairs launches a campaign to persuade the public to use water sparingly, I believe that a stamp, sponsored by the department, could be designed to remind the public of this campaign. I also believe that foodstuffs which are particularly beneficial to the human body and sponsored by the various control boards, could qualify to be included in such a series of stamps. It is a fact that when one is in distress, one devises any plan to escape from it. Therefore I believe such a department might mean a considerable source of revenue to the industry concerned. If it is practical for the department to undertake something of this nature, I want to ask that the funds derived in this manner be used to subsidize and finance smaller post offices in rural areas which are not economically justified. It is a fact that the Post Office in South Africa played an important role in the past and that it continues to bring people together in a certain area. If we do not devise plans to save these little post offices, I am afraid that we will in future have to issue commemorative envelopes for these smaller post offices as well, and this we want to avoid.

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bethlehem has raised the question of philately. As I understand the situation, definitive and commemorative stamps which are issued by the Republic of South Africa are items of interest and are held in high esteem by philatelists in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>I want to return to the question of telephones in the townships and want to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Umlazi in that regard. During the Post Office Budget debate last session I raised this matter with the hon. the Minister and quoted certain figures which revealed a serious position to me. I want to refer briefly to the reply which the hon. the Minister gave me. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. member has also referred to the provision of telephones in Bantu and Indian townships. Our planning is aimed <span class="col_2983-2984" refersTo="page_1507"/>at providing services as soon as possible. The hon. member can be assured that as our finances and our personnel allow it, we shall certainly provide those services.</block>

<p>I think the operative words are: &#x201C;Our planning is aimed at providing services as soon as possible&#x201D;. The handicap in this connection is, to my mind, more a question of personnel rather than a question of finance. Only this Government can be held responsible for the fact that the personnel is not forthcoming. For more than a decade this Government pegged the State expenditure on Bantu education and I believe that many people who could have been trained adequately in that period, have been held back due to the policy of the Nationalist Government. I say this because they have had 27 years to use the potential of non-White labour on the doorstep of South Africa. I should like to examine the present position. In a reply to a question earlier in this session, the hon. the Minister indicated that in the townships in and around Durban&#x2014;I do not believe the position there is much different from that in any other large city&#x2014;with a non-White population of roughly half a million, there were 59 call boxes at the end of 1974. In other words, it means that there is one call box for approximately every 10 000 people.</p>

<p>If one looks at the situation in Chatsworth which has the larges concentration of Indian people in the whole of Natal, one finds that according to information received in reply to a previous question, a new automatic exchange was established and put into operation in Chatsworth in June 1974. However, by the end of 1974 there had been 380 applications for residential telephones and 95 applications for business telephones while&#x2014;it is difficult to believe this&#x2014;the number of installations was three for residential purposes and four for business purposes. As far as Umlazi is concerned, with a population of 250 000 Africans the installations amounted to nil for residential purposes and one for business purposes. I believe that this makes it extremely difficult for professional men to carry out their work and for priests of various religious denominations to carry out their pastoral and spiritual duties among the denominations they are supposed to serve. I believe that we on this side of the House must go on highlighting this defect in the administration of the Post Office until something more positive and more practical is done about it.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the question of postal deliveries. We have been advised that there has been a reduction in postal deliveries from two to one in various areas of most of the cities. The reason given for this in a letter I received from the Postmaster in Durban is that &#x201C;it ensured a considerable saving of money, manpower and fuel to reduce these services&#x201D;. It may have resulted in a saving in fuel as far as the post office is concerned&#x2014;the hon. the Minister proudly announced in his Second Reading speech that the saving in fuel amounted to 20%&#x2014;but this does not apply to the citizens of the Republic because overall I believe the saving is much more apparent than it is real. Not only have the postal deliveries been reduced but the postal collections have also been reduced. We now find the situation that in some of the major suburban post offices the last postal collection is at 2.30 p.m., although in some instances it is at 3.30 p.m., i.e. at hour later. We find that the collections from post office boxes have been cut down too. The explanation given there is that the lack of letters does not necessitate more frequent collections. This I accept as valid, but as far as the limitation on the collection of letters at the main post offices in the suburban areas is concerned, I believe it is a great handicap not only to the general public but also to business houses that are decentralizing into the shopping areas in the suburban areas and conducting their businesses from their new premises. It simply means as the position is at present that there is no collection from the post offices in the suburbs after 10.30 a.m. on a Saturday until the first collection takes place at 6 a.m. on the following Monday. That means that letteers lie in a post office box for a period of 18 hours. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the early morning collection will ensure that those letters will be in the sole delivery that takes place on that Monday. Is it any wonder that businessmen claim that letters sent from one part of the city to another to street addresses take up to four to five days to be delivered. However, that is not the whole picture. The question of the clearing of post boxes is also a very unsatisfactory one. Many of the post boxes merely indicate: &#x201C;Cleared once daily&#x201D;. I have made representations to the Postmaster in Durban and my representations were received with courtesy, but I regret to say that they <span class="col_2985-2986" refersTo="page_1508"/>were unfruitful. In a letter to me I received this comment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As part of our fuel-saving campaign the clearance of all posting boxes in the urban area was reorganized in such a way that maximum savings could be effected without unduly inconveniencing the public.</block>

<p>I believe that the elimination of the time notification has caused a great deal of inconvenience to the public. The Postmaster feels differently, and he has a right to. He says that he has had few complaints. He also says that when a time was stated on the letter-box, he received a spate of queries. I believe, however, that the public has capitulated. They realize that if they want prompt delivery of their letters, they have to take them down to the main post office themselves, using petrol, creating traffic congestion and wasting time in order to ensure that the letter has a reasonable chance of being delivered promptly. I believe that this can be proved by the extent of the congestion which I have witnessed at the main post office in Durban. I have been there on a Sunday morning, on more than one occasion, and found the letter-boxes so jammed that it was difficult to insert any more letters. I believe that many of the people who would normally post at suburban post offices have to adopt this practice if they want prompt delivery. The offices established in the suburban areas are also faced with a problem. Wanting to operate their business efficiently and successfully, as they do, they are faced with normal street deliveries to their premises during mid-morning. If they want to deal with that correspondence and despatch replies the same day, what is the position? They are faced with the difficulty of a lunch-hour shortage of staff because the staff has to have lunch. They also find that they have to deliver their letters to suburban post offices before 2.30 p.m. in the afternoon to ensure that those letters are sorted and delivered the following day.

<p>The hon. member for Parktown also referred to co-operation. I can tell both sides that the question of cooperation with the municipalities does in fact take place on an orderly basis.

Furthermore, I want to point out to hon. members that as far as financing is concerned, there are certain misconceptions and this also applies to a great many other responsible bodies It is not only the Opposition which labours under this misconception. One even finds <span class="col_2987-2988" refersTo="page_1509"/>that this is the case with a responsible body such as Assocom. Last year Assocom come here to discuss this very matter, i.e. the basis of financing. They objected to the fact that we were taking too much from revenue. From the discussions the Postmaster-General had with the deputation of Assocom it became evident that they were under the impression that the 50% applied after depreciation. After it had been made abundantly clear to them that the 50% did not apply after depreciation, Assocom understood the position fully and left with a full understanding of the whole situation. With reference to this matter it may interest hon. members to know that our self-financing will amount to 19% after depreciation next year. Assocom has put it at 15%, but as I have said, they were under a misapprehension originally.</p>

<p>But is the 30% of this year realistic?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall furnish a comprehensive reply to that matter at a later stage. I now proceed to discuss the other aspects which have been raised here in connection with the incentive bonuses.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg once again referred to incentive bonuses. He objected to the statement which I had made, i.e. that it is difficult to measure productivity. One is unable to measure productivity in respect of every job. There are various jobs in respect of which productivity can quite easily be measured. However, there are other jobs in respect of which productivity cannot be measured so easily. For this reason one cannot apply the bonus system to all kinds of jobs. If one were to apply it to all jobs in respect of which it is difficult to apply, one would get the ironic situation that additional people may later be required to exercise control over this matter. This means that more money would be spent than what is actually saved on account of the bonus system. Then nothing would really have been achieved. It is for this reason that the bonus system has to be applied most judiciously. On account of these practical considerations the system is being curtailed.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Wynberg also referred to the services rendered to and by other departments. In this case the position is that the tariffs are agreed upon between us and the Treasury. We get full compensation for the cost of such services. This is based on the Post Office Readjustment Act which stipulates that we cannot make any profit out of any of these services. As the law reads, we may only recoup the cost in this regard. It is, therefore, not a question of making profits out of it,</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Durban Central referred to the increase in the postal traffic and the stimulation of certain profitable postal systems. As far as the first matter is concerned, I can only tell the hon. member what applies in general. As hon. members know, the Post Office is a public institution. We are not a business undertaking to such an extent that we are unable to cope with the necessary public services in a proper manner. In other words, we are compelled to undertake all public services falling under a postal service. It is quite acceptable that one may perhaps single out and concentrate on some of these services but, taken as a whole, we cannot neglect some of the services; we have to deal with all the services in a proper manner. It is a fact that postal traffic increases at a slower rate than the other services. This is not only the case in South Africa; it is a phenomenon throughout the world. The postal traffic increases at a slower rate as, for example, telecommunications traffic. This is attributable to developments in the telex and data services The plea which the hon. member made here in connection with those places in Natal&#x2014;Empangeni, Durban and others &#x2014;is a matter which is, however, receiving attention. There are problems in connection with aircraft, for example as to whether they would be able to land regularly at a certain place, what costs would be involved and whether it would be profitable, but I shall nevertheless ask the department to investigate the matter to see whether it has any substance and whether we could possibly make use of such flights, from, for example, Empangeni to Durban, and possibly to other places as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs asked that the construction of a new exchange and <span class="col_2989-2990" refersTo="page_1510"/>the development of the existing exchange in his area should be expedited. We should like to build all these exchanges which have to be built as soon as possible. Of course, quite a number of factors have to be taken into consideration. We have to synchronize certain elements, for example, the availability of the building which is required. First the equipment has to be manufactured and installed. One also has to be sure what cable work is required. Of course, this also has to be incorporated with the international network. There are so many factors which have to be kept in mind that one cannot simply press a button to commission an exchange. I want to assure the hon. member that the Post Office is moving as fast as it is humanly possible within the framework of its financial and labour resources.</p>

<p>The hon. member also pleaded for concessions to be made to old-age pensioners. That is a matter which is dear to my heart. It would give me the greatest of pleasure to be able to announce here tonight that we are going to grant a reduced tariff for old-age pensioners. This is something one would like to do. However, it is not possible for us to implement such a system because if we were to grant this concession to old-age pensioners, we would be unable to stop there. We would have to go further and include physically disabled persons, people suffering from other disabilities and later on perhaps also people suffering from social and other psychological problems. I do not know where this is going to end. It is simply an impossibility for the Post Office to implement such a complicated system. For that reason I am afraid I will have to content myself with the reply I gave hon. members on that side as well as on my side of the House. Hon. members on our side of the House are pleading for this all the time. It is really impossible for the Post Office to make this concession, because it is not practicable.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Umlazi referred to the night operators and wanted to know what sort of discipline we exercised in their regard. The fact is that postmasters and traffic officers from our regional offices carry out sporadic night inspections and they also make certain check calls, in this case from the control exchange. In this respect I think we are exercising all the control that is practical under these circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of self-service post offices in non-White townships. This is certainly an aspect which will receive our attention. We are pursuing this question on a national basis and, this being so, the Bantu townships will naturally receive consideration. I trust that we will be able to start one or two in those townships as well in the near future.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Bethlehem gave evidence here of his interest in philately and I am very grateful for this support one is receiving. The hon. member for Springs asked whether the album would be suitable for pupils. I presume that the album which will be available in the near future will be particularly suitable for pupils. I really appreciate the interest displayed by hon. members in this matter.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Berea also complained about the telephones in the non-Whites areas. We are doing what we can in that respect. From time to time, in reply to questions in this House, I furnish particulars as to what we are doing in this regard. As far as the question of collection of mail from posting boxes is concerned, the position is that in order to conserve fuel we did cut down on collections, as I have said already in reply to questions in this House. I refer here to posting boxes other than those at post offices themselves, in other words to boxes where relatively little mail is posted. This is done, of course, for economic reasons.</p>

<p>*With regard to the question of depreciation, which the hon. member for Durban Point referred to again, I can tell him that a formula exists which varies from plus/ minus 2&#x00BD;% to 30% in respect of the various items. The amount is then supplemented by 50% &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to come back for a few moments to a matter that I raised in the Second Reading debate this afternoon, and that is the question of the wages paid to people of colour in the Post Office. I argued <span class="col_2991-2992" refersTo="page_1511"/>this afternoon that the Post Office had made absolutely no progress in closing the wage gap between White earners and non-White earners. In fact, I thought I had produced figures to prove that this gap, far from being narrowed, had in fact increased. In reply to me the hon. the Minister gave some figures which I obviously accept, but I must say that I was not very impressed with them. I think the point to make in this regard is that the progress that is being made in narrowing the gap is really far below expectations and certainly far below what we were led to believe the Government was hoping to achieve.</p>

<p>But be that as it may, I want to come back to the question of the earnings of individual Black people in the Post Office. In <i>The Cape Times</i> yesterday the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications is reported as having said that a total of 3 992 Post Office workers, all Black, receive an annual income of less than R600 a year. Sir, I have no reason to disbelieve this, but if it is a fact that we are paying nearly 4 000 Black workers less than R50 a month, it seems to me to be a really deplorable state of affairs. Sir, R50 a month is not a living wage by any kind of standard. I tried to produce some figures this afternoon with regard to what is known as the poverty datum line, but the Chamber of Commerce in Johannesburg uses a better phrase; they talk about the minimum humane subsistence level. In all seriousness, Sir, I would suggest to the Minister that R50 a month cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as a minimum humane subsistence level. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure us that there is either something wrong with his figures, or that since these figures pertained something drastic and radical has been done to adjust the position, because I do not believe that this situation should be allowed to continue for one moment longer; it is a disgraceful state of affairs.</p>

<p>Secondly, I would like to support the plea made by the hon. member for Berea about telephones in Black and Brown areas. I want to give one or two figures that will complement what he has said. I take an area like Soweto, with very close on a million people living in it. This area has fewer than 800 private telephones and, believe it or not, fewer than 40 call-boxes. Sir, I worked this out to mean that there are 25 000 people for every one public telephone, and about 1 250 people for every private telephone. I believe the situation in the Indian township of Lenasia is almost as bad as it is in Soweto. I come closer to this House and find that in the Coloured township of Bonteheuwel, where there are 43 700 people living, there are exactly four public telephone booths. In the townships of Heideveld and Manenberg, in which there are 60 000 people living, there is not a single public telephone booth, and in Hanover Park there is not one. I think it is true for us to say, as the hon. member for Berea suggested, that this is symptomatic of the situation. Now we know the pressure there is on the Post Office to provide telephone services, but I do believe that we have a situation here which really merits far more consideration than it seems to have been given. If it is true, as we are so often told, that help is as near as the nearest telephone, then all I can say is that help is very far away from countless South Africans in this country.</p>

<p>*Sir, I just have one final matter I want to raise. [Interjections.] No, I do not want to thank anybody; I am complaining. I want to refer to the latest Johannesburg telephone directory.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is beautiful, but it was two months late, to start with. But that is nothing; we cannot help that. The fact is, however, that nearly 1 000 errors appear in this directory, and to me that seems quite unforgivable. I quote from the Transvaler which is not really known as a friend of the Progs, and I hope hon. members will accept that the facts I now want to quote are correct, because they come from, what we may call a irreproachable source. [Interjections.] I quote from <i>Die Transvaler</i> of last month (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are so many errors in the latest edition of the Johannesburg telephone directory and so many telephone numbers have been omitted that a private telephone directory of these erronous and omitted numbers might be distributed before long by a group of businessmen.</block>

<p><span class="col_2993-2994" refersTo="page_1512"/>I just want to quote one more paragraph (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Jan Kemp, who markets alarm systems, is one of the people who are saddled with the problem of an incorrect entry in the latest telephone directory. He was disillusioned to discover how many others had the same problem.</block>

<p>Then we find that a Post Office spokesman told the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> that there could possibly be nearly 1 000 of these errors. Sir, one need not have much imagination to realize what disruption errors of this kind can cause. I see the Post Office has undertaken&#x2014;and I think they have already done it&#x2014;to rectify these errors. What I should like to say to the hon. Minister is that I hope that the cost of these reprinted numbers will be laid at the door of the original printers, because to have so many errors of this kind seems to me to be an unheard of state of affairs. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to give us the assurance that it will not be the poor taxpayer who will have to pay for this.</p>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat tried once again to play a little politics, as usual, and in order to do so, he paid his visit to the Coloured and Bantu residential areas. We are so accustomed to this by now that at this stage no one can really take them seriously any more. In any event I leave his in the hands of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>We have heard many complaints about our telephone service in this debate. Right at the outset I want to admit that there are problems, but at the same time I want to say that we have a telephone service that is probably as good, if not better, than those in many other countries. My son telephones me from Walvis Bay. He puts in 20 cents and then he tells me everything he has to say. For 20 cents he tells his mother how he is. He is in Oshakati, in the heart of Ovamboland, but for 20 cents he speaks loudly and distinctly to his mother here in the Cape. If that is not an achievement, I wonder what is.</p>

<p>It is true that our telephone and telecommunication services constitute one of our most serious problems today. No one is trying to deny that, but I am prepared to say that our telephone and telecommunication services have fallen prey to the sustained South African growth, prosperity, progress and development. That is what lies behind this problem. The announcement of the new electronic switching system is something which I really want to welcome heartily, because it will provide us with the necessary benefits to enable us to combat our technical manpower problem in the near future. This announcement is in fact an important historical event and it ushers in a new era in the field of telephonic communication. Telecommunications remains one of our biggest problems and in a developing area like my constituency I have many good examples of this. It has a profound effect on everyone, from the industrialist and the businessman to the general public. I trust, therefore, that with the new electronic switching system we shall solve those problems rapidly.</p>

<p>When I analyse this matter, I really have the greatest sympathy with the Post Office in the battle for staff that it is waging at the moment. The disturbing shortage of technical and telephone operating staff is really cause for alarm. The present need for highly trained technicians creates an extremely difficult situation that is aggravated by the large number of resignations. To lose 500 trained technicians and telephone electricians and another 497 semi-trained staff in one year is really. &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>I say that this is a matter which brings home to us the serious nature of this problem. Then, too, there is also a shortage at the semi-technical level.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>What is your solution?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to the solution if the hon. member would only be quiet.</p>

<p>This is the situation in spite of everything that has been done to prevent it. I can only ask those hon. members whether they have come up with a solution yet, apart from constantly criticizing us. It is the situation in spite of the fact that we have also recruited staff both locally and overseas and in spite of the fact that we have done reasonably well in both campaigns. Our own training programme, including the training of women and non-Whites, has been successful. The Postmaster-General has also succeeded in dividing the work into smaller units so that less highly trained people may be used. Nevertheless there is <span class="col_2995-2996" refersTo="page_1513"/>a shortage. The crux of the matter is that we have a fast-growing system in which more work has to be done by fewer people. An impartial research study carried out in the past pointed to the fact that only 25% to 30% of the technicians trained by the Post Office intend to make the Post Office their career. In other words, between 70% and 75% of the people trained by the Post Office are lured away and swallowed up by the private sector. A very large amount, close to R10 million, is spent on training. It costs the Post Office about R10 000 to train one person. In spite of the effort to solve the problem, I believe that other means will have to be sought, and no time should be lost in doing so. I want to convey my thanks to the loyal people in the Post Office who do not allow themselves to be lured away elsewhere. I want to praise their loyalty and I want to thank them for their dedication, their motivation and for the responsibility they take upon themselves. It is these people who deserve our encouragement and should be praised.</p>

<p>The question now is what can be done. The problem we are facing is, firstly, to get new people and secondly, to retain the people we have. We must face the fact that we can often get the staff, but subsequently lose them. Why do they resign? I believe that the private sector swallows them up because they are paid more there and have to work shorter hours. I should have liked to have the opportunity to discuss the aspect of hours of employment only, but I shall leave that to my colleague who will speak after me. I believe that at this juncture we must concentrate on a really extensive recruiting campaign to acquire staff. We must encourage parents to have their children choose a career in the technical or electronic fields. Technical training must be considered in a more positive light and the idea must be propagated that people should rather follow a career in a technical institution than become a dropout at a university simply because it is the fashion amongst many people to attend university.</p>

<p>However, the most pressing problem is still to retain that staff once we have them. In the first place, more attractive benefits should be made available for workers, particularly the workers on the Witwatersrand. I believe that a special regional allowance should be paid to those who are prepared to work on the Witwatersrand or in other urban areas. I want to suggest that housing benefits, for example a housing subsidy or a rent subsidy, should be made available to them. I believe, too, that a person should be compensated for his years of service in the Post Office. For example, after a man has worked in a a technical field of this kind for five years he could be given a cash sum, and in this way he could be persuaded to remain where he is needed. The people who remain in the Post Office and who are not lured away, deserve to be rewarded because they comprise the Post Office&#x2019;s most important asset. They deserve that extra bonus or whatever we might want to call it. They are the people who deserve to be pampered by us. In conclusion I want to say that the firms who lure people away from the Post Office should also be harnessed so that they themselves may also contribute towards the training of these people. We must also get such factories to train these people themselves. They must train apprentices in relation to the number of artisans in their employment. I believe that the other people who sell this apparatus and who are unable to provide the necessary training themselves should be required to make a financial contribution so that we may have the money to train the extra people.</p>

<p>Before sitting down, I just want to avail myself of this opportunity to convey the sincere thanks of my constituency, too, to the hon. the Minister and his department.

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I welcome the opportunity of replying to what the hon. the Minister said in the first part of this debate. I want to begin by saying that I now understand certain things which I did not understand before. I remember now that the hon. the Minister used to be an information officer of the Nationalist Party. Therefore I understand why he has always furnished this House with erroneous information. Now I understand why his facts are so often incorrect.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The first of these recurring faults is that he said that the Franzsen Commission reported two years ago. We were debating the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s report on 23 March 1972. In col. 4050 of Hansard of 1972 the hon. member for Constantia referred to the recommendations of the Franzsen Commission. In other words, by the beginning of 1972 we were already debating it, so what becomes of his statement <span class="col_2997-2998" refersTo="page_1514"/>that the commission only reported two years ago? There we have one of the incorrect statements.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that only 19% of the capital budget was in fact revenue. Of course, that is totally incorrect. The contribution from revenue is R47 478 000. If one divides that into R213 million which is the total capital budget, one gets 22%. So there again we have an incorrect figure which he gave to this House officially as Minister. The very R47 million he referred to is 3% more than the figure he reported to the House. Now let us look at the depreciation. He said this varied from 14% to 30%. That is correct? Then one still has to add 50% for appreciation or escalation of costs. Depreciation amounts to R64 740 000. If one divides that into R213 million, one finds that the average is 30%. If one works on a depreciation of 1&#x00BD;% to a maximum of 30%, how can one get an average depreciation of 30%?</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, I shall deal with that hon. member later. I intend coming to him. As I have pointed out, there again we have one of these strange figures which the hon. the Minister has given. Before I come to the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, I want to refer to another matter. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is the policy of his party that any Black person who speaks good English should be reported to the Police for speaking good English. Is that an instruction to eavesdroppers in the Post Office? We have a case where a reporter of a newspaper, a mysterious &#x201C;kaffir&#x201D;, who spoke good English, was reported to have been reported to the Police by the telephone exchange. Firstly, how did the telephone exchange know he was a &#x201C;kaffir&#x201D; and, secondly, how did they know that he spoke such good English if they were not eavesdropping on his conversation? As a result of that, he was apparently taken to the police station and questioned for some two hours, but that is not the business of the hon. the Minister. What I am entitled to ask the hon. the Minister, however&#x2014;and I can understand the hon. member for Vryheid getting excited because it happened in his constituency&#x2014;is whether it is an instruction to, or whether it is regarded as the duty of telephonists, in the course of their duties, to report to the Police when they hear something that sounds like &#x201C;too good English&#x201D;. Mangikhuluma noMnumzana lapha Bazotshela amaphoisa ukutu nangu umlungu okhuuma isiZulu? Would I be reported to the Police? How could this White man be speaking Zulu? Surely that is all wrong? Report him to the Police and find out what a White man is doing speaking Zulu! [Interjections.] I am asking the hon. the Minister to tell us what the instructions are in this regard.</p>

<p>I now want to come to some of the other facts which this hon. Minister has kept silent about. The hon. the Minister has failed entirely to answer my allegation that in this budget we are now debating revenue does not, in fact, account for 50% of the capital expenditure but for 55%, while loan funds account for virtually 45%. The hon. the Minister has refused to answer that. He has evaded the issue. In his Budget speech he gave a figure of 50%. That figure is false. I claim that it is false and that the hon. the Minister has ignored that allegation. He is the Minister and he has a responsibility. Five per cent of R213 million is a lot of money out of the pocket of every person who operates a dial and gets a wrong number. The Minister cannot sit there silent and refuse to answer the charge. I charge him with the fact that where he claimed to have balanced a 50/50-capital budget, the Budget is, in fact, not a 50/50-budget. It is a 55/45 budget which overburdens the telecommunications user by charging him 5% more than even the Minister&#x2019;s formula&#x2014;and far more than we believe he should be charged. He has failed to answer our allegations of unimaginative recruitment. In regard to the present generation paying for the future, he claims that that has always been the case. That is not true. We today are paying interest on past loans and we are paying 50% of future capital. We are therefore paying for the past, the present and the future. We are paying three ways. We are paying interest on past loans, we are paying for present capital and we are paying for future capital. Again there is no answer. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, talking about depreciation, asked where I got 30% from. I got it by dividing a simple figure into another simple figure. If one adds 50% for &#x201C;waardevermeerdering&#x201D; one cannot arrive at a 30% average. The average of l&#x00BD;% and 30% comes to about 16%. Add 50% to 16% and one cannot arrive at <span class="col_2999-3000" refersTo="page_1515"/>an average of 30%. Who is bluffing whom? That hon. member had better do his arithmetic. He asked where we get the capital from. In this Budget it is announced that we did not take up a R20 million overseas loan and the Post Office only took up R20 million out of an amount of R58 million in internal loans. The capital is there, waiting to be used. That hon. member is supposed to know about the Railways. Does the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark not know that the Railways have paid interest on every cent of capital since 1910? He cannot understand the difference between a perpetual capital liability and a loan which you redeem. &#x201C;Redeeming&#x201D;, for that hon. member&#x2019;s information, means &#x201C;paying it back&#x201D;. The Railways do not pay back their capital, but they pay interest in perpetuity. We are talking about redeeming capital. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened attentively to the hon. member for Durban Point. He accused the hon. the Minister of having given this House wrong facts, but one envies the hon. member for Durban Point the measure of conviction with which he hurls wrong facts across the floor of this House to his heart&#x2019;s content.</p>

<p>I should like to come back to the hon. member for Durban Point in respect of two technical points he mentioned at the beginning of the Second Reading debate. He stood up in a fighting mood and said, in the first place, that the telephone system of the Witwatersrand in particular and of South Africa in general was in a chaotic state. That allegation was made without any motivation in that regard being given by him or any other hon. member on that side of the House. He made a second statement, viz. that the new system the Post Office wanted to put into service, was not an electronic system. This statement, too, was not motivated. He spoke glibly about two-motion systems and cross-bar systems and he referred to a third of this country and a sixth of that country. He said these things glibly without his having any notion whatsoever of what he was talking about. It was very clear that he knew as little about these matters as Tokkelos knew about a tartan track.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the House from where he got the information as to our telephone system and especially that of the Witwatersrand supposedly being so chaotic. He got that information from <i>The Star</i> of 8 March 1975, of course. But to expose their injudiciousness I just want to say that that report in <i>The Star</i> gave him two options. He had the option of following the advice of the quasi-experts from abroad who had claimed that our telephone system was in a chaotic state. He also had the option of following the advice of the South African experts, who know what conditions are in South Africa, as far as the climate and the weather are concerned, and then he would not have made such an irresponsible statement in this House.</p>

<p>I have been on the floor for a long time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point made that statement but I should like to point to a few things in order to prove that those people whose advice they follow do not have the necessary knowledge and ability. In the first place, the statement was made that if the quality of the work in the Post Office were to have been of the same standard as that being done at power systems, we would not have had this chaotic situation. This is an absolutely fatal statement to make. Are my hon. friends not aware of the fact that in a power system there is always a duplicate system? If the Post Office had had funds available to duplicate their cable systems, we, too, would not have had this situation. For this we need money, but the moment we ask for money and tariffs are increased slightly, hon. members on the opposite side of the House cry out that money is once again being asked for. They also cry out when we ask for more money for capital equipment. [Interjections.] An hon. member on that side of the House also made the statement that the Post Office should install a type of cable which could stand up to any weather conditions. Now I should like to draw a comparison by saying that it is not possible to have a Blue Train running from Koekenaap to Vredendal. Our Blue Train only runs from Johannesburg and the Rand to the Cape. If we want to have a Blue Train running from Koekenaap to Vredendal, we have to provide the capital for this. Therefore we do not believe that we should establish duplicate schemes throughout the country to prevent these so-called chaotic conditions. <span class="col_3001-3002" refersTo="page_1516"/>These so-called chaotic conditions do not occur under normal operating circumstances. The chaotic conditions to which they referred arose from a natural disaster which had struck South Africa. I do not want to deny for a single moment that there are no shortcomings in our technical world. We admit that there are shortcomings. The Post Office does not have superhuman beings working for it; just ordinary human beings.</p>

<p>The second point made by the hon. member was that this was not an electronic system. I think it was the hon. member for Wynberg who said &#x201C;electronics is a fascinating job&#x201D;. He asked why people left the service, as that was the position. When my hon. friend the member for Kempton Park referred to the fact that they left the service because they received more money elsewhere, the comment on that side of the House was, &#x201C;Pay them more&#x201D;. However, when tariffs were increased they were the first to make a fuss. I do not know how we are to reconcile these two things.</p>

<p>No, I do not have the time to reply to a question. The hon. member said it was not an electronic system. I wonder if I were to take the hon. member for Durban Point to an electronic system whether he would be able to recognize it as such. I do not think he will be able to.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are three systems. There is the ESK 10 000 and there are the CP24 and the CP44. The only difference between those three systems is that the CP44 system has internal programme control. The other two systems have wired logic. [Interjections.] In the military electronics world we say that an electronic military system should be made &#x201C;Coke-proof&#x201D;; in other words, the users destroy it with Coca-Cola. However, it seems to me that we shall have to say that a Post Office electronic system will have to be made U.P.-proof, because they know nothing about it; they only destroy it.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by referring briefly to the tariffs. Hon. members opposite alleged that tariffs had been increased to yield more money. However, if they had analysed the tariff position, they would have noticed that the unit cost remains 4 cents but that the time one receives for 4 cents has been reduced. This has two effects. The load on the dial system is decreased since one is now compelled to speak for a shorter period. If one makes a small calculation, one sees that the possibility of a reduced loading system is 25%. This means that the possibility of 25% more traffic being carried is built into these tariff increases. This is what is involved and not simply a matter of collecting more money.</p>

<p>I want to make the following representations to the hon. the Minister. These representations come from the Post Office Association of the Peninsula. They are the only Government body not working a five-day week. They ask whether the hon. the Minister will consider allowing them to work a five-day week as well. They do not want work fewer hours, but they want to compensate for this by working longer hours during those five days. If this is not possible they want to know whether the hon. the Minister will consider this being done on a scheduled basis; in other words, that the system remains open for six days, but that certain staff members will work only five days per week on a rotation basis. These are the representations made by this association.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I notice that there are 565 outstanding telephone applications in my constituency. I also notice that there are only 95 outstanding telephone applications in the whole of the Free State. I wonder whether it will not be possible for us to transfer some of those fine technicians from the Free State to Wonderboom so that we may make up the leeway.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one of the cheapest services offered by the Post Office is the rental of post office boxes. This is a very inexpensive service and also an essential service bearing in mind that not every township in some of our faster developing areas has a postal delivery service. There are many areas in my constituency which will probably not for many years have postal delivery services owing to their outlying nature as well as to the size of the properties. In such areas the proximity of a post office or post office box facilities is most important. While I appreciate <span class="col_3003-3004" refersTo="page_1517"/>that not every outlying suburb can enjoy postal delivery services, I cannot understand why post office boxes are in such short supply. Take for instance Rivonia and Woodmead. These are fast-growing communities that are long established. For many years now it has been extremely difficult to rent a post office box in these areas. All the surrounding areas with the exception of Bryanston, which is not convenient, are fully committed as far as post office boxes are concerned. Many people in this area are forced to share boxes as far as the collection of mail is concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Do they share dog boxes?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>No, post office boxes. As I have said, the rental of these boxes is very reasonable; it is only a pittance, and I am sure that aspirant box renters would be quite prepared to pay more if a more adequate supply of these boxes was made available. I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister would give some consideration to this matter to see what can be done.</p>

<p>The second matter I would like to raise, is in regard to the problems being experienced by some of the 4 000 residents living in the Lombardy East and Rembrandt Park suburbs of my constituency. These people live within the municipal area of Johannesburg. This area is, however, served from the North Rand exchange which is situated in the Kempton Park area. It is far to the east of Johannesburg. The results of this situation are twofold. Firstly, these people, most of whom work in Johannesburg, who shop there and use the facilities there, whose friends and acquaintances are nearly all in Johannesburg, make 90% of their telephone calls to people in the Johannesburg area. However, taking all this into account and because of the system that is applied, the names of these people are not listed in the Johannesburg telephone directory. They are listed in the Witwatersrand telephone directory. Therefore if one wants to contact somebody in Lombardy East and does not know his telephone number, one cannot find the name in the Johannesburg directory. One &#x2019;phones the department to ask them to find the number and one is told that that person&#x2019;s name is not in the book at all. Very few people even think of looking in the Witwatersrand directory. These people in Lombardy East are therefore people who are lost to the community. Not only are they lost, they also have to pay more to be lost. These people in this area are penalized tariffwise as nearly all their calls cross the exchange barrier. They are therefore charged for two units instead of the normal one. Consequently the telephone accounts of people living in this area are considerably higher than those living elsewhere. I realize that these problems do arise from time to time. After having investigated the matter, the hon. the Minister told me about the difficulties by way of correspondence. I would, however, like to ask him to have another look at this matter. Perhaps he may consider allowing residents in these two areas, in the circumstances, at least an additional free entry of their names in the directory in which they want their names to appear. It seems that they have to be in the Witwatersrand book, for which they have to pay, and the Minister has said that if they wish to be placed in another book, they have to pay an extra fee. Because of the circumstances, I would ask that these people be allowed a free entry in the Johannesburg directory, because that is the directory in which they wish to have their names. I would also be most grateful if the Minister would investigate the possibility of giving some relief in regard to the higher tariffs being paid by these people for what, after all, are just local calls.</p>

<p>I am not being silly, Sir; some of the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments were silly.</p>

<p>&#x2020;When the hon. member says that we are talking about climatic conditions in South Africa which differ from climatic conditions anywhere else in the world, it shows how stupid his argument is. The cable system which failed in the last heavy rains on the Witwatersrand, failed because of excessive dampness in the joints of the cables. This was not denied by the Post Office. I have certainly not seen any denial. The hon. the Minister says that they had to move men from the Free State to the Transvaal to help with this sort of work. <span class="col_3005-3006" refersTo="page_1518"/>I know that men were moved from all over the country, but climatic conditions such as were encountered there&#x2014;excessive moisture&#x2014;are surely encountered all over the world. We have had charges by immigrants who are now working here, who say that the cable system is decrepit. I have not seen that denied. Sir, we are told that we are going to invest R182 million, or something like that, this year on new services; we are told that the most sophisticated equipment is being fitted to a cable system which is archaic and out of date. What is the point of it? It is like taking a new motorcar engine, putting it into an old jalopy and still being saddled with trouble. The Minister has not told us what is being done about the problems with the cables. We have seen this article in <i>The Daily News</i> in which a certain person asked these questions and was given some answers by a local source or authority on the Witwatersrand, but not one of these answers really explained what was going to be done about the faulty cables. He talks about having fitted new cables; this we can understand. When a new line is being installed, then of course the latest quality cables are being used, but what is being done about the old cable which breaks down every time it rains or every time there is a change in the weather? This is a question which the hon. the Minister should please answer for us.</p>

<p>Before sitting down I must say that I was very disappointed in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reaction to my question about what was being done to burnish the image of our savings banks. The hon. the Minister expressed a solicitude here for the building societies, a solicitude which I do not think was really befitting. I wonder if the hon. the Minister will support the building societies when they ask for the same taxation concessions as those which have been given to the Post Office.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_posts_and_telecommunications">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I start with the hon. member for Parktown who again raised, <i>inter alia,</i> the question of telephones in Soweto. I should like to tell the hon. member what the present position is. Recently provision was made in the automation programme for the establishment of automatic exchanges with 1 000 lines each at Iketlo and Orlando: then provision was made for 600 lines at Kwa-Xuma and Tshianelo; for 400 lines at Naledi. It is expected that automation of the first-mentioned two exchanges will take place during 1980 and the other three during 1981. As far as the existing hand telephone service is concerned, there are 734 telephones in the area, and I may also mention that 533 additional services have already been authorized and will be provided gradually.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point swung into action with his usual drama, which is very close to the melodrama of his colleague, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, and made a calculation for us of how this depreciation in the depreciation formula really was a fact and that I had actually deceived people by those means, not so? I think this is the point he wanted to make. To my mind it is a blunder to compare the amount provided for depreciation, viz. R64 million, with the amount provided for capital, viz R213 million, and to say that the percentage we have calculated here, is incorrect and that that is deceit.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, I said it was unrealistic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You did not only say that it was unrealistic. This depreciation is not calculated on the capital investment we have to make for the coming year. It is calculated on the capital assets one has. That is why I now have to furnish the hon. member with information, now and for the future, information which will be recorded in Hansard and to which he will be able to refer in future debates, so that he may not make the same blunder in future. The depreciation takes place according to the following percentages, and I am now going to mention various items. In respect of buildings and housing, it is 2,5%; on motor vehicles it is 17,5%; on office and data processing and mail handling machines, it is 10%; on telephone subscriber services it is 5%; on exchange cable systems it is 3%. In this way the series continues and each asset we have has been given a different percentage, including those we are now going to purchase with the R213 million being voted in this Budget. Now, if depreciation is calculated according to these percentages, it amounts to R43 million. Now the 50% is added, which adds another R21 million, in respect of the following&#x2014;I want to read this just for the sake of the record so that we may have it in writing: A surcharge of 50% is added to the total amount as calculated above, as provision for the replacement of assets at the higher costs which will apply when they <span class="col_3007-3008" refersTo="page_1519"/>have to be replaced, and for the possible earlier replacement of assets as a result of technological development. This accounts for the amount of R21 million, i.e. the half one adds to it, and this gives one this amount of R64 million in respect of the assets one has.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question? Could the Minister please tell us to what value those different percentages mentioned by him apply? In other words, on how many million is it 10%, and how many 24-%?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is information I am unable to furnish at this moment, but what is of importance is this. Take buildings and housing, for example. We can get that figure for you. The department can give it to you in a day or two. Now, what is the amount? Say it is R30 million for buildings, or whatever the amount may be. The 2&#x00BD;% applies to that amount. But what counts is the percentage in respect of those amounts which can be asked for in this House at any time. Surely, hon. members may put questions throughout the session, for example: What is the value of the telephone switching equipment; what are the foreign services; what is the telegraph subscribers equipment, in respect of which it is 7%? This is what it means, viz. 7% in respect of that type of item which one has. This makes up this amount of R43 million to which is added this amount of R21 million, or 50%, giving you this total of R64 million. This is the basis on which this system is applied.</p>

<p>I shall have to make haste so as to reply to matters raised by other hon. members as well. The hon. member for Wonderboom pleaded for an extension of the five-day working week. This is a matter which deserves our sympathy. I may point out that we have already granted permission to certain officials to be free on Saturdays. This is already being done on a reasonably large scale. However, everybody cannot be free. At the moment we are making a country-wide survey in this regard for the very purpose of ascertaining whether the essential services we render on Saturdays cannot be reorganized so that we may release even more officials from duty on Saturdays. However, I doubt whether we shall ever be able to release all officials from duty on Saturdays, because there are important and essential services that have to be rendered to the public.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Sandton raised the question of the shortage of private boxes at certain post offices. We shall look into the possibility of providing additional boxes at the offices he mentioned and shall write to him in due course. I shall also look into the question mentioned by him in connection with Lombardy East subscribers to establish whether anything can be done about it.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Parktown again raised the question of wages for Blacks. It is Government policy to narrow the gap. That this has not taken place as rapidly and as dramatically as we should all like it to take place, is something we have to accept. However, it is very difficult to narrow the traditional, historical gap to any marked extent within a short period, but I want nevertheless to give the assurance that it is the policy of the Government to narrow it. With every salary adjustment, as in the case of the last adjustment, we see to it that we move in that direction purposely. I want to give the assurance to this House and to everyone concerned in this matter that the Government will continue with the process of narrowing the gap.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on these benches wish to oppose the motion for leave to introduce this measure. Although we and this House are at a disadvantage because we do not know the full text of this measure, nevertheless the notice of motion given by the hon. the Minister makes it quite clear to us that it would not be in the interests of this House to pass this particular Bill. In fact, looking at the wording of the notice of motion, it appears that this Bill is nothing other than a further deprivation of the already limited rights of the Coloured people, that it is a negation of the very essence of the parliamentary or representative system of government...</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker. This notice of motion which seeks to give the hon. the Minister authority to exercise and perform or cause to be exercised and performed the functions and the duties and the powers of the Coloured Representative Council boils down to the negation of the undertakings given by this Government to the Coloured people. Indeed, these words herald in the collapse of the Coloured Representative Council as a representative institution as opposed to an agency to be taken over by the Government in terms of this notice of motion.</p>

<p>What disturbs us even further is the timing of this notice. The timing of this notice which was given on the day the Coloured people went to the polls, to our minds reflects a cynicism towards the electoral system, towards the Coloured people, which can only create greater animosity and mistrust. For these reasons we believe that this House should not agree to give the hon. the Minister permission to introduce this Bill. The wording of this notice of motion indicates a deprivation of Coloured rights. At the moment the Coloured Representative Council has certain powers that it can exercise under its own jurisdiction. In terms of the wording of this notice of motion, the hon. the Minister will take over and perform all these powers, and not only the legislative powers but the executive powers and indeed the advisory powers which are at present entrusted to the Coloured Representative Council.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>We will deal with the certain circumstances in due course. I am dealing now with this notice of motion as it has been presented to us. As I say, this is a negation of the undertaking given <span class="col_3011-3012" refersTo="page_1521"/>to the Coloured people that the powers of the Coloured Representative Council will be extended. That is the essence of what the hon. the Prime Minister told this House at the beginning of this session. He told us that there would be an extension of the powers of the Coloured Representative Council and yet the terms of this notice of motion make it quite clear that there is going to be a contraction of those powers.</p>

<p>The third point is that it negates the very essence of the representative system of government. The short title of this Bill is the Coloured Persons Representative Council Amendment Bill, and yet the very words used by the hon. the Minister indicate that that council is no longer going to be representative of the Coloured people. Indeed, an individual is going to take over the powers, and in terms of those powers that council will cease to be Coloured and it will cease to be representative. Instead there will be sole power in the hands of a single White Minister acting on the authority of this House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs interjected that it does refer to certain circumstances. It is quite true that those circumstances are the only aspect of this Bill that is not defined. All the other aspects are clearly defined. One therefore wants to argue about what these certain circumstances might be. Does the hon. the Minister believe that the circumstances might be that the Coloured Representative Council itself will decide not to function, not to exercise its powers, and that in the vacuum thus created the hon. the Minister should assume those powers? If this is so, then I want to say that the Government is anticipating the collapse of the Coloured Representative Council. What other reason could there be for the words &#x201C;in certain circumstances&#x201D;? I put this to the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs: Can he conceive of any circumstances other than those to which I have referred?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the fact remains that the hon. the Minister is conceding to all intents and purposes that the life of the Coloured Representative Council as an effective representative body of the Coloured people is coming to an end, and that a single White person is now going to be the arbiter and the authority in regard to the fate of the Coloured people. I want to tell hon. members opposite that they should not be surprised that in terms of this notice of motion the hon. the Minister is anticipating the end of road of parallel development for the Coloured people. This will be the end of the road of the Coloured Representative Council. [Interjections.] This notice of motion states that a White Minister will take over the powers, the functions and the authority of the Coloured Representative Council. The ultimate cynicism is the fact that this notice of motion was given on the day on which the Coloured people were electing that council. They were not told in advance that the Government was going to seek these powers. What cynicism! What cynicism to tell the Coloured people that they should conduct an election but behind their back to concoct legislation to take away their powers and to replace those powers with a single White man as the authority over the 2&#x00BD; million Coloured people in South Africa. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I realize that hon. members opposite are upset because they have to admit that this notice of motion reflects the end of the road as far as the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy for the Coloured people is concerned. It reflects the rejection of the Coloured Representative Council as a council representative of the Coloured people. The tragedy is that hon. members on the other side have become so enmeshed in the products of their own race ideology that they can no longer understand the desires of the people and especially of the Coloured people. What happened yesterday? The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s seeking leave to introduce this measure cannot be divorced from the election which took place yesterday. Hon. members opposite do not realize when the Coloured man is being hurt. They do not realize when he is being humiliated. They do not realize when he is yearning for recognition as an individual citizen. Therefore, when their council collapses, when the grand edifice of apartheid comes to the end of the road after 27 years, instead of giving notice to this House of the intention to disband that council and to give Coloured people full rights, this Parliament is being asked to give a single Minister supreme rights over the Coloured people of South Africa. This is the height of cynicism and I believe that if this motion is agreed to and this Bill is passed, it is going to fan the flames of hatred and <span class="col_3013-3014" refersTo="page_1522"/>enmity and mistrust between the racial communities in South Africa. For these reasons we have no hesitation whatsoever in rejecting the motion for leave to introduce this Bill.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is quite obvious that this Bill means the end of the road as far as the Coloured Representative Council is concerned. We on this side of the House have stated repeatedly that if the Government is determined to stand by the unitary system, it has only one alternative, and that alternative is to give the Coloureds representation in this House. Sir, time and again we have pointed out that the powers that they have already taken to introduce and to pass the Budget in the Coloured Representative Council and the powers that they have taken to overrule decisions of the Coloured Representative Council make it perfectly clear that they do not believe that this council will ever mean anything at all. As far as we in the official Opposition are concerned, we believe it is high time that the cards were put on the table. This Government does not mean that the Coloured Representative Council should ever succeed; it is never going to mean anything at all. It is in the position of having to say what the Government tells it to say or it will cease to exist. As far as we are concerned, we believe that this motion should be supported. Let us have the cards on the table. Let the whole world know that as far as this Government is concerned, this Coloured Representative Council is just a rubber-stamp; that it means nothing at all. Therefore, Sir, we will support the motion for leave to introduce this Bill. There is a clause in it which provides that in certain circumstances the Minister may act. We will examine those circumstances when the Bill comes before us, but as far as we on this side of the House are concerned, let us have the moment of truth and let the world realize that this council means nothing whatever at all. It is merely a symbol; it is merely an instrument the Government can use or overrule or do with what it likes once this Bill is on the Statue Book. Therefore, Sir, we are going to vote for this motion for leave to introduce the Bill. We want this Bill before the House; we want it introduced; we want it debated. We want the public and the world to know what the attitude of the Government is towards the Cape Coloured people. We warned last year, we warned in the No-confidence debate this year, and we have warned again and again as to the attitude which is arising, and I think it is high time that this whole issue was debated in this House. We believe that leave to introduce this Bill should therefore not be refused.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the information was given originally that leave would be sought to introduce this Bill, we immediately realized the significance of it. We have already publicly expressed our concern over the fact that this particular piece of legislation is introduced almost contemporaneously with the holding of the elections for the Coloured Representative Council. Sir it is quite remarkable that this should happen at the same time, and it is also quite remarkable that we should be debating this very matter at this time when in fact the results of this election are still coming in. Sir, this is something which certainly demonstrates a degree of cynicism in politics which I think has seldom been equalled. What is important to note at this stage is not only this cynicism, but the fact that the Coloured people over the years have been promised a greater part in the determination of their own affairs. Even if there are some who do not wish to use the Coloured Representative Council as an instrument to achieve this, the timing of this piece of legislation can only do harm to any endeavour to try to bring about a consensus with the Coloured people in South Africa. We believe, Sir, that under prevailing conditions it is not enough to say that if the unitary system continues there should be Coloured representation in Parliament. Sir, there is a system prevailing at the present moment and we believe that in terms of that system there is no adequate substitute for Coloured representation in Parliament. We would appeal to everyone who has goodwill to set about negotiating to bring this about at the earliest opportunity. Sir, with respect, I have some difficulty with the view expressed by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He wants the Bill to be introduced either in order to oppose it or to support it. It is not enough for the official Opposition to say that it is either going to oppose it or support it. I think the Opposition should say today whether it is in favour of it, or whether it is not in favour of it. The official Opposition is again seeking to sit on two chairs at the same time, and they are going to end up sitting on the floor. Sir, one issue is very clear and that is <span class="col_3015-3016" refersTo="page_1523"/>that the legislation which the Minister seeks leave to introduce is designed to give the Minister the power to exercise the duties and functions of the CRC. The simple question that has to be answered is whether in fact that power should be given to anyone, whether anyone should exercise that power, and it is on that issue that the official Opposition is unwilling or unable to give an answer. That is why I say that it seeks to sit on two chairs at the same time. This failure on the part of the official Opposition to make up its mind is perhaps the best example of an endeavour to try to satisfy both sides. We have no difficulty about this. We think that to introduce this measure at this time is a piece of cynicism. We think that leave to introduce should be opposed and we believe that not to oppose this motion is to break faith with the Coloured people in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that this party&#x2019;s standpoint as regards the Coloured population is clear to everyone in this House, but I just want to restate it very clearly. Looking at this notice of motion against the background of the speeches concerning the Coloured population made by the hon. the Prime Minister in this House and against the background of the speeches concerning the future of the Coloured population made by various members on that side of the House, one has no alternative but to oppose this motion, because the Prime Minister expressly stated that for the Coloured population the road that lay ahead was one of a greater degree of consultation, a greater say, greater participation and increased responsibility. One would have been able to accept in all reasonableness that the hon. the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations would give notice during this very session of a motion that would spell out the circumstances in which this House would not withdraw powers from the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council, because as the constitution of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council reads at present, this House has full powers in any event, because the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council cannot take any decision in conflict with the wishes of this House. One therefore had reason to expect that notice would be given of a motion stating that there were certain circumstances in which this House would not allow any interference in the affairs of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council. This would have been a logical consequence of the speeches we have heard from members on that side of the House and also from the hon. the Prime Minister in recent times. That is why I cannot understand the official Opposition adopting this standpoint in this situation and saying they are prepared to accept the motion, because surely it is clear that they too have been exposed to the promises made to the effect that there would be greater decentralization of powers as regards the Coloured population, that they would be given more rights, that they would have executive powers and so on. This motion gives notice that in stated circumstances precisely the opposite will occur, because in stated circumstances these powers will be taken away from them. In all honesty, I must say that it is not clear to me how one can have a Constitution for the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council in which it is clearly spelt out in one section that that House does not, in any event, have the power to take decisions in conflict with the will of Parliament, and that in addition we can still have a motion here spelling out even more clearly that there may be circumstances in which the Minister may act as the sole representative of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council or take over its functions in those stated circumstances.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Sea Point and the hon. member for Yeoville. It really looks suspicious to me that this motion was introduced neither a day before the election, because then, in my opinion, it would undoubtedly have had an influence on the results of the election, nor a day after the election, because then the Government could be accused of having done it in view of the election results. The fact is that this motion was introduced for discussion on the <span class="col_3017-3018" refersTo="page_1524"/>very day on which the election took place. I honestly think that any reasonable person would have no alternative but to come to the conclusion that this was an act of political cynicism. Furthermore one is unable to escape the conclusion, merely on the basis of the wording of the motion, and quite apart from the specified circumstances in which powers may be withdrawn, that this is an implicit incorporation of a safety valve in the expectation that the Government&#x2019;s own Coloured policy is not going to succeed. No other opinion on the matter is possible. It seems to me that to a certain extent this is a motion of no confidence, a motion motivated by uncertainty and a lack of clarity with regard to the Government&#x2019;s policy for the Coloured population&#x2014;not at the lower levels of contact, not as regards the economic upliftment of the Coloureds, but in regard to the institution which the Government regards as a symbol of the emancipation of the Coloured population. If it is the symbol of emancipation, one asks oneself how that emancipation can take place when a motion is being discussed here in which this very possibility of emancipation is denied in certain circumstances. Consequently we have no alternative but to oppose this motion at this stage.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the question has been posed why we support the introduction of this measure. Supporting the introduction of the measure does not by any stretch of the imagination mean supporting the contents of the measure. This Bill before us is, as my hon. leader has pointed out, the final act on the part of this Government in its admission to South Africa and to the Coloured people that the end of the road has been reached in so far as the present Government policy towards Coloured people is concerned. That is the reason for introducing this Bill. It is an emergency measure which the hon. the Minister wishes to have discussed in this House. We of the official Opposition will welcome a discussion of the necessity for this measure. After all, Sir, you will stop me if I attempted to debate the merits of what might or might not be in the Bill, which unfortunately has apparently been published in the Press but has not been supplied to hon. members of this House yet. The Bill is known apparently to the Press but not to hon. members of this House. You would stop me, Sir, if I attempted to debate the merits. We on this side of the House seek an opportunity to discuss with hon. members opposite the merits of this measure, because I believe that this is a time of reckoning for South Africa in regard to the future line we are going to take in our relationships between White and non-White, and particularly between Whites and Coloureds. This measure will give us that opportunity. I hope the hon. the Leader of the House will give it a high priority on the Order Paper so that we can discuss the matter because of its great importance, not only to the Coloured people but also to South Africa and to South Africa&#x2019;s position in Africa and in the world. And so, Sir, it is quite clear why we welcome this and why we shall support the introduction of this Bill.</p>

We have been telling the Government this for years, long before the hon. member for Yeoville raised his voice in this House. My hon. Leader has year after year said that this policy would fail as far as the Coloured people were concerned. When we support the First Reading of this Bill, we do so not because we support the principles of this Bill and what it intends to achieve, but because it presents us with the opportunity of having the Government expose, as it must in motivating this measure, its own acceptance of the failure of its policies.</p>

We have heard statements which have been continually made by the Government as to how they are going to allow every national group in South Africa to exercise their own rights and to have sovereignty within South Africa.

<block name="quote">We believe that all men have the right and the duty to participate as equal members of the society in their own Government. We do not accept that any individual or group has any right to govern any other group of sane adults without their consent.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you might think that that comes directly from the manifesto of the Reform Party, but that in fact came from the hon. member for Pretoria Central. The promise of the Government to the peoples of South Africa, the undertaking of the Nationalist Government to the world and to the United Nations, was that every group in South Africa would be allowed and entitled to govern themselves without interference and to conduct their own affairs. Here, Mr. Speaker, we have a situation where, far from moving in that direction and far from building this new future for the different groups in South Africa, the Government is dismantling or, let me say, intending to demolish the structure which they have up to now pretended to the outside world they were creating. As far as we are concerned we want to make it absolutely clear right at the outset that we are not prepared to adopt a &#x201C;ja, maar&#x201D; attitude in regard to a matter as fundamental and substantial as this. Let us make it clear to all the groups in South Africa and let us make it clear to the Government that we are totally opposed to an action of that sort. Interference with the rights of other people has reached the limit and we cannot associate ourselves with any further demolishing of the rights of other groups in South Africa.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this Bill to improve the CRC. The purpose of this Bill is for the hon. the Minister to take over the powers and functions of the CRC. That is how I read the simple language in which the motion for leave to introduce, is couched. I cannot see how the hon. member for Green Point can possibly read into that motion any intention on the part of the hon. the Minister to extend the powers of the CRC or to improve the way in which it functions. The hon. member for Green Point made mention of an emergency situation, but I do not know what emergency he is talking about. There is no mention of emergency &#x2026;</p>

<p>Of course I do not. On the contrary. Like my hon. Leader I refuse to give this Government permission to introduce such an atrocious measure. They are going back on all the promises which they made to the Coloured people when they took away their representation in this House and set up this substitute body, the Coloured Persons Representative Council. I do not want to be any part of any machinations to reduce further what meagre powers the Coloured people have in South Africa. This is the first step to do that very thing. We want to register our protext at the very first opportunity. If the argument is used that we ought to have an opportunity to debate the Bill, we should never oppose it in any circumstances, i.e. leave to introduce a Bill into Parliament. Isn&#x2019;t that correct? There is the logic of it [Interjections]. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration says that it is right. The rules of this House permit the Opposition to oppose leave to introduce and that right has been used time and again, even by the official Opposition when it had thought of it itself. That is the real reason why they are not voting this afternoon. [Interjections.] That is the real reason. They simply did not think of it first. I have long ago in dealing with the official Opposition, the United Party, ceased to look for complicated reasons for what they do. They are always simplistic to the extreme. The answer is purely and simply that they were here caught off guard; they did not think of it themselves. It goes against the grain, it is loss of face for them to support a motion of this importance, the motion which was introduced by my hon. leader this afternoon. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point says that he wants to debate this motion, because then it can expose the Bill. We do not want the Bill, we do not want to expose the Bill and we do not want to debate the Bill. I want to say that the duty of the official Opposition is, not to expose in Parliament, but to oppose in Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in terms of Standing Order No. 112 the hon. the Minister who is in charge of this Bill is not allowed to reply to the debate. Consequently I just want to say a few words. This is not the first time in the history of this Parliament that a protest of this nature has been heard. Probably one would not wish to do anything to deprive hon. members of their right to have their protest heard. The question which occurs to me, however, is this: Are hon. members so certain that this legislation will have to be applied? I have heard no argument to indicate that this legislation is superfluous. I have heard only protests against the legislation. I have heard from hon. members of the Progressive Party, and from their new appendage, that they take the severest exception to the acquisition of these powers by the Minister. In other words, the hon. members proceed from the standpoint that circumstances may arise under which the hon. the Minister will have to use these powers. Otherwise they would have argued that this legislation is superfluous. However, I have heard no arguments to the effect that this legislation is superfluous. During the past year the Budget of this particular Council was R133 million. I do not know what will be available for the next year. If circumstances were to arise which made it impossible to administer R133 million in the interests of the Coloured population of the country&#x2014; and the Minister can only explain the situation by furnishing us with the reasons during <span class="col_3023-3024" refersTo="page_1527"/>the Second Reading&#x2014;who has to administer the money then, if the objection of the hon. members is accepted.</p>

<p>My argument is that we should afford the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs an opportunity of furnishing us with the reasons why, under given circumstances, he has to administer more than R100 million himself.

<p>The hon. Minister may furnish reasons, but the hon. members do not want to afford him the opportunity of furnishing these reasons. The hon. member refuses to enable the Minister concerned to furnish this Parliament with his reasons. This is the kind of free speech which hon. members of that party advocate. I suggest that they reply to two questions. <span class="col_3025-3026" refersTo="page_1528"/>In the first place they must tell us how they want to enable the Minister, under given circumstances, to apply and implement his Budget. In the second place they must furnish us with the reasons as to why they do not want to give the hon. the Minister a hearing. All that is now being done here is that a step is being taken to enable this House to listen to the Minister. He cannot at this stage furnish us with the reasons. For that reason it seems to me that what we have here is once more the normal little protest which we usually have from people who, owing to their behaviour, will always remain a small faction of a faction in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Houghton made certain statements which cannot pass unchallenged. She accused this side of the House of being simplistic in its reasoning. The problem is that the parties behind us and to our left follow a method of tortuous reasoning, not straight reasoning. They are so accustomed to tortuous routes and tactics that they cannot appreciate straight reasoning.</p>

<p>The Bill which the hon. the Minister proposes to amend was amended in 1972 and that amending legislation contained a provision whereby the Minister was enabled to appropriate moneys. It granted him widespread powers, which we opposed.</p>

<p>Yes, the power is already there. The hon. member for Sea Point has no objection to those powers, but if he will consult Hansard of 23 May 1972, he will find in col. 7821 that the First Reading of that measure was introduced without opposition from the hon. member for Houghton, without any objection whatsoever. The hon. member for Houghton was prepared to give that Draconian power, the power of the Minister to appropriate money, without any opposition at its First Reading.

<p>&#x2026; we do so for two reasons. We want to debate it because, as my leader has said, it exposes the total failure of Government policy. What it is doing&#x2014;this point has not yet been made&#x2014; is to leave a vacuum. If the Minister is to take power to carry out the powers of the Coloured Representative Council, it means that there is a vacuum in the political structure affecting the Coloured people, a vacuum which has to be filled by the Minister operating in this Parliament. We as that Parliament must debate that vacuum. We in this Parliament must suggest what is to be put in place of that vacuum which the hon. the Minister says he wants to fill by taking certain powers. We believe it should be filled in another way and we are prepared to debate this and to thrash it out once and for all to let South Africa have the facts. However, the noisy group behind us and the Progressive Party apparently do not want to debate this. The Progressive Party was prepared to give the Minister full control of all finance for the Coloureds. They did not object to that Bill at the time. They have a committee to formulate their policies but they have not formulated their policy yet. In other words, they do not have a policy yet; they are still busy formulating it. Nevertheless, they oppose the introduction of this measure and this implies that they know what is in the Bill. We do not yet know what is in the measure; we only know that it indicates a vacuum. We want to be able to put to South Africa what we propose should fill that vacuum in relation to the political future of the Coloured people. I hope that, in view of the attitude adopted by the bits and pieces in this House, they will admit that they are not now going to speak in the debate which will follow. [Interjections.] They have no <span class="col_3027-3028" refersTo="page_1529"/>right to speak in that debate. By opposing the creation of an opportunity to debate this issue, they have abrogated their right to participate in that debate. Nevertheless, they will want to speak in that debate; that is typical of their attitude. Their attitude is: &#x201C;We can oppose it because, in any case, we know we shall not be able to stop it but we shall still be able to speak.&#x201D; We are more honest. We say: &#x201C;Let it be introduced; then we shall discuss it with the Bill in front of us.&#x201D; They, not having seen the Bill, say that they are opposed to its being introduced but nevertheless they are going to want to talk on it. I believe they have sacrificed their right to take part in that debate. We intend to put our case on the measure itself when we have the Bill before us, its contents and its proposals. There is nothing tortuous about that. The only tortuous thinking comes from people who seek in every decision and in every political action some form of intrigue or backdoor objectives. There is no such thing in the United Party. Our attitude is straightforward and clear.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the hon. member who has just sat down that, rather than debating a vacuum, we should debate the reality of what is happening today. I think it is a tragedy in a way that not longer than two weeks ago we had the Prime Minister telling the country that the dilemma which faced him and the Nationalist Party with regard to the Coloureds had finally been solved and that he now had a way of giving to different peoples equal sovereign rights within the same country. We see the solution of this dilemma in the motion the hon. the Minister is putting to this House today. The way in which the hon. the Prime Minister has decided to solve this dilemma very simply is to ask leave to introduce into this House a Bill the long title of which provides that under certain circumstances the Minister must exercise all the rights of the Coloured people. What I find distressing is that the hon. the Minister of Defence gets up and advances an argument as to why this motion should be agreed to. There is an amount of R133 million on last year&#x2019;s Budget and if the Coloured Representative Council should fail to appropriate this money then there would be nobody to appropriate it. If that is the reality he is afraid of, if he is afraid that the will of the Coloured people is so strong that they are prepared to deny money to their own teachers, their own pensioners and so forth because of their abhorrence of the policies which are being forced upon them by this &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; Government, then I think this Government has the responsibility to go and talk to the Coloured people, to sit down with the Coloured people and talk to them and to work out something that is acceptable. [Interjections.] Do not come here with a Bill of this nature or with the intention of introducing a Bill of this nature into this House. At one moment the hon. the Prime Minister says they have solved the dilemma and then they come to light with this type of Bill and say that they are going to enforce its provisions and decide what is going to happen. The election is not yet even over and the results are not even there and that side of the House has not even had the courtesy of going along and talking with the leaders of these people. There is another point. As far as I am aware, a number of powers for the appropriation of this money already exist. If, after consultation, it was found necessary simply from the point of view of the sheer mechanics of getting money from a certain source to people who need that money to do so, it would surely be possible to come back to this House and pass some legislation with retrospective effect to meet this position. There is no doubt that the very fact that this motion is before us today is the most cynical and completely devastating evidence of the <i>mala fides</i> of this Government in respect of the Coloured people of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when the hon. the Minister replied to the debate in the Committee Stage of this Bill, he gave us to understand that as far as the financing of capital requirements is concerned, nothing can be done to take further income from other sources, because there is legislation which prohibits it. I cannot agree with the hon. the Minister. He referred to the Post Office Readjustment Act. I take it that that law was passed by this Parliament when the Post Office became an autonomous department for the first time, and that this was part of the agreement, but I do not know whether that agreement was the kind of agreement which is known today as a &#x201C;package deal&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I doubt it very much. I believe that this was merely a preliminary arrangement made between other Government departments and the Post Office as to who would pay for the various services rendered by the Post Office and how much would be contributed. I do not think that when this law was made there was any intention on the part of this House, or even on the part of the Minister, that the amounts that were to be debited against the various Government departments were to remain constant and static for ever after. I believe that the time has arrived, now that the Post Office has been an autonomous Government department for quite a number of years, to re-examine this matter. I would have expected to hear from the hon. the Minister that that was one of the matters he would be prepared to go into, but what do we find? We find that the hon. the Minister says that there is this Act which regulates the amounts payable by the various Government departments that is that; he is not prepared to do anything about it.</p>

<p>I find this a curious attitude, because it is the same sort of attitude we find when we ask the Minister whether he would go into the question of training facilities for non-Whites. You will remember, Sir, that in his speech he said that the limiting factor in regard to training facilities was the availability of such training facilities and the availability of instructors. Now the hon. the Minister, in reply to the Committee Stage, said that in fact there were these limiting factors and that we just had to accept it. I do not think that is good enough. I think the hon. the Minister should go into the question whether he can arrange for additional facilities and he should go into the question whether he can in fact find instructors. If he cannot find instructors, then I believe it is the duty of the Minister to train instructors. Surely, instructors can be trained just as other technicians can be trained. But to say that he cannot do anything in regard to the training of non-Whites, anything better than we are doing now because he has limited facilities for training and does not have the instructors, is rather adopting a dog in the manger attitude. I would like to see the Minister shaking himself out of his lethargy and doing something about it. I do believe now is time to do this. The time has arrived, and I think the hon. the Minister should get down to the job of training these people.</p>

<p>*The hon. the Minister also said that he was not prepared to make concessions to pensioners in regard to telephone rentals and also told us why he could not do it. He said, amongst other things, that if he did it for old-age pensioners, he would most probably have to do it for those who are physically disabled as well, and for a whole lot of other people who would also be able to demand these concessions. But I have a suggestion to make to the hon. the Minister. I should say that a very easy way to solve this matter would be to take the age limit as the factor. Why can the hon. the Minister not investigate it on the basis &#x2026; Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult for me to speak while there are hon. members standing up and speaking in the aisle.</p>

<p>&#x2026; such people may in fact receive telephone services at a reduced tariff, less than the prevailing tariff. Sir, this is a very important matter. It is a matter for which we on this side of the House have been pleading for many years. I think one must remember that there are many old people of 70 and over who live alone, completely alone, and that the telephone is their only connection with the people outside. These are people who cannot manage easily or who find it difficult. I really think it is a matter which the hon. the Minister may very well investigate. If he then says 70 is too young, he could make it 72 or 73. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us that he is prepared to investigate the matter. I hope he will not say that it is impossible to do anything about it. I should like to receive the answer of the hon. the Minister in this connection at the end of this debate.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of cables. Cables are actually the life-blood of the telephone and telecommunications system. Unless there are proper cables we shall never have a proper telephone and telecommunication service. Even if we have all the instruments and all the apparatus of the most modern kind at the transmitting exchanges, it will still not be possible to supply that service to the ordinary telephone subscriber unless there are proper cables. Now the hon. Minister tells us that cables are a source of great difficulty. He says cables will be installed gradually. But that is not good enough, Sir. Gradual installation will get us nowhere. I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us: &#x201C;I have a plan in connection with cables. I am going to replace these tables that are worn out this year. Next year I am going to replace those cables&#x201D;. At the same time I should like the hon. the Minister to have yet a further plan in connection with cables. To be specific, I should like to see that when there are new extensions, these are not dealt with on the priority basis. That is the basis on which the hon. Minister told us he proceeded. Instead, the hon. the Minister should organize his department in such a way that when new developments take place and a new residential area is set up, those people can immediately be supplied with a telephone service. The cables must not only be laid as the residential area concerned comes into consideration for such a service on the strength of its position on the priority list. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister is going to compile a list of priorities. If he has compiled such a list of priorities, I hope he will table a copy of it so that we can see which new townships appear on that priority list and so that we can also see to what extent those priorities are being carried into effect. I should say that there is only one way of dealing with cables, and that is by replacing those cables that do not function efficiently enough with cables which do function efficiently, and by laying new cables at all new developments immediately.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Finally, Mr. Speaker, there is the question of postal deliveries. This is a matter the hon. the Minister also dealt with during the Committee Stage. The hon. the Minister said that he did not believe that there were any great delays in postal deliveries, although in most places there was only one collection and one delivery per day. He also mentioned that when post offices were far removed from the General Post Office, there were delays in collection because the mail had to be collected and taken to the General Post Office for sorting and further dispatch. I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to two pieces of mail which I posted recently. I think he will be shocked to hear what I have to say about this. These two letters were posted by me quite recently, during this session. The first letter was posted on 4 March 1975. It was posted by me at the General Post Office in Parliament Street, Cape Town. It was addressed to a post office box in Paarl, about 36 miles away. Enclosed in this letter was a cheque which was urgently required by someone in Paarl. Eventually, when this letter and cheque had not arrived in Paarl by 12 March, eight days later, I made arrangements to stop payment of the cheque. I went to a great deal of trouble. I could hardly get away from the House to do so, but I had to run down to the bank to stop payment of this cheque. I then issued a further cheque and posted it in a second envelope. In order to make quite certain that the letter would get there, I posted it in an official envelope. Do you know what happened? On the day after I had posted this letter the first letter arrived in Paarl. It arrived in Paarl at 13 March&#x2014; eight days later. By that time I had already written to the bank to stop payment. I then had to contact them again to tell them to ignore the stopping of payment so that this first cheque could be paid out. When the second cheque was posted in Cape Town <span class="col_3033-3034" refersTo="page_1532"/>on 12 March I told them: &#x201C;Please return it to me because I want to keep a record of it&#x201D;. The cheque arrived in Paarl this morning, 20 March. It took eight days to get to Paarl. The first letter was posted on 4 March and arrived in Paarl on 13 March; the second letter was posted on 12 March and it arrived in Paarl on 20 March. Paarl is a mere 36 miles or 58 kilometres from Cape Town. If we had had a runner with a forked stick and I had the use of that runner, I would have got very much better service than I had from the Post Office during this month of March.</p>

<p>This is wrong. These things should not happen and the hon. the Minister should see that they do not happen. Both of these letters were posted at the General Post Office in Cape Town and both were addressed to a box in Paarl, a post office box at Paarl post office. One cannot understand how that sort of thing can happen. I know that it is a very short distance and I know that there is other mail which goes to other parts of the country and which perhaps takes a little longer. This, however, is a very good example of how badly things are being managed by the hon. the Minister at the present moment. I believe that the hon. the Minister must go into this question. He cannot say: &#x201C;Because the postal part of my department does not pay, I am not going to do anything about it&#x201D;. Because the postal part of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department does not pay, he must find ways and means of making it pay. The only way he can get it to pay is to let it run efficiently. He can only let it run efficiently if he pays attention to it. I say that the hon. the Minister has not been paying proper attention to the postal part of his department. I urge him to do everything in his power and to spend more of his time on the postal side of his department and to put it in an efficient working order.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it amazes me that in his criticism of this Budget, the hon. member for Wynberg can take two letters out of millions and millions and try to use them to prove that the postal service is inefficient. What about the millions of letters that reach their destination within a day? When one handles a mass of post like this, then surely it can happen that from time to time one out of a hundred thousand or one out of a thousand may be delayed along the way.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>How one can make such a statement and criticize the postal administration and the delivery of post, is too much for any normal person to understand. In the course of this debate, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, and the hon. members on the other side of the House, have criticized much and said little. They have advanced a great deal of criticism, but how many solutions did they in fact suggest here?</p>

<p>When the phenomenal announcement was made that we were going to have a change-over to a new era of modern electronic switching&#x2014;something which will result in the very things which the Opposition is pleading for, namely saving of money, saving of time and saving of labour&#x2014;the entire undertone of their argument was not one of great enthusiasm, but one which amounted, basically, to: &#x201C;It is too late.&#x201D; That is the kind of criticism that has been expressed.</p>

<p>Why, in this process, does the Opposition not refer to the exceptional achievements, the positive and real progress made by the Post Office in recent years and in this year to which the Budget applies? The phenomenal progress that has been made since this department acquired a greater degree of autonomy seven or eight years ago in 1968 is reflected in this exceptional report which is, in fact, brilliant testimony to the strong and positive growth and achievements in all facets of the department, which serves all population groups.</p>

<p>If one goes further and looks at the postal administration and its achievements, one sees that it is a stable and positive organization. Here we do not get the paralyzing postal strikes that have been experienced in England and France in recent years. Nor do we have here the chronically inefficient postal system of Italy, where tons of letters have had to be sent to the pulp mills, nor do we have an uncontrollable, chaotic telephone backlog like the backlog of two million telephones in Japan and the backlog of more than a million telephones in France, which costs that country more than R3 000 million every year in lost business. In spite of the announcement of higher tariffs, there is still a real increase in the demand for telephones in South Africa. Compare this situation with that of Hamburg, the commercial capital of <span class="col_3035-3036" refersTo="page_1533"/>Germany. What does one find there? In that highly developed industrial area there was in fact a 65% drop in applications for telephones when telephone tariffs were increased. That is surely sufficient proof of the strong and sound infrastructure of the postal administration here and of South Africa&#x2019;s phenomenal growth in the economic and industrial spheres. That is why we can be proud of the service and performance of the Post Office and the fearless way in which the hon. the Minister, the Postmaster-General and his officials face problems and solve them or attempt to solve them. The hon. member for Wynberg once again brought up the issue of additional sources and then they came back once again to the argument that has been raised here repeatedly, namely the 8% increase in tariffs.</p>

<p>I did not talk about tariffs.</p>

<speech by="#louw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>The consumer now has to pay R38 million more. What they are opposed to, then, is the necessity for the consumer to pay so many million rand more, an amount that is now going to be applied towards running expenses and capital expenses. However, we have seen that there has been a 24% rise in maintenance costs in the course of a single year. We know that there have been salary adjustments and that there was a narrowing of the wage gap, something which the Opposition favours. Is one not, then, to make provision for this inflationary increase in costs? What do bodies like Escom, or local authorities that provide water and other services, do? After all, they too have to borrow capital and recover the interest on those loans and the redemption of capital from the consumer. In the nature of the case one can surely not take it amiss of the department if it, too, recovers its capital expenses by means of a higher service tariff. When one complains about a higher service tariff&#x2014;when, for example, one states that four cents is too much for a postage stamp, or that five cents is too much for a telephone call unit&#x2014;then one&#x2019;s complaints really border on the ridiculous. That we do have problems, cannot be denied. We know that we have a backlog of 98 000 telephones. During this debate the Opposition revelled in the fact that this backlog had increased by 1 200. As against that, however, we provided 123 000 telephones and that is a record. That represents an increase of 11000 telephones. If this increase in the number of telephones is set against the backlog of 1 200, there is a gain of about 10 000 telephones over this year. In this country the number of telephone subscribers per hundred members of the population is one of the highest in the world. I know that it is difficult to draw comparisons by way of figures. It is difficult because we have various race groups in this country and because the use of telephones among the Bantu and other coloured groups is substantially less than among the Whites. However, if one takes the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians alone, we have an average of almost 30 telephones per 100 inhabitants in South Africa. In my opinion that is an exceptional achievement as against the 10,8 per 100 of France, the 17,6 per 100 of West Germany and the 19,4 per 100 of England. In spite of the problems we have with our long distances and the maintenance expenses over those long distances, we are providing the people of South Africa with an exceptional service in this regard. We concede that everyone will want to strive to reduce that backlog of 98 000. Bottlenecks often occur, too, because there are growth points whose rate of growth has been higher than that planned for, or because that growth was accompanied by a paralyzing shortage of labour. I want to make the statement today that there is probably not a single Government department in South Africa which has done more about the recruitment and training of staff and labour than this very Department of Posts and Telecommunications. We need only consider the 630 technically trained immigrants recruited overseas, the close to 3 000 persons undergoing technical training at the colleges of the department, the 145 students studying with bursaries from the department, the R20 000 made available for the establishment of a chair in telecommunications at the University of Pretoria and the imaginative training courses offered throughout the country for Bantu, Brown people, Indians and Whites. We could also consider the internal restructuring that has taken place this year with a view to the optimum utilization of staff, from the top management down to the official at the lowest level. As far as training is concerned, one must be practical and logical and realize that owing to circumstances, we are standing with our backs to the walk One reason for this is the fact that throughout <span class="col_3037-3038" refersTo="page_1534"/>the Western world there has been a drop in the number of people undergoing technical training, just as there has been a 500% drop in the number of students qualifying in the natural sciences and physics. In the second place, one must bear in mind that many of the people we train&#x2014;we cannot get away from this&#x2014;unfortunately have to be relinquished to the trade. We shall always be saddled with this. I believe that this department is capable of going ahead with the training of Coloureds, Indians and Bantu on an exceptionally large scale, as is already the case at present, to train them for employment in their own areas to see to their own needs as well as the needs of those White areas where their employment will not be accompanied by friction and Whites being pushed out of their jobs. I also believe that we in the Cape Province have a Coloured labour potential which, if the problem of the instructors can be bridged, can be utilized to the maximum extent. I think that we should consider combining the theoretical training at Kensington and the practical training depot at Bellville, with a view to the establishment of a giant training college where Coloureds may be trained for employment in White areas on a large scale, with the provisos I have mentioned. Furthermore, we know that in the coming era of electronic switching, there may be a saving of up to 75% in this field. I believe that this is the method we should adopt in order to try to conserve labour.</p>

<p>If we dwell for a moment on the telephone shortage, we realize that 98 000 represents less than 5% of the total number of telephones in South Africa. This is only minimal if the dynamic industrial growth, the residential growth and the growing demand for telephones among the non-Whites is taken into account. The figure of 98 000 is also misleading because half of the people are short-term applicants. Half of these are people who have only been waiting for a connection for a month or a few months. Even if we were able to meet all practical needs, we would still find that in a flourishing country like South Africa, with its growing population there would at all times be at least about 50 000 people who would have to wait&#x2014;whether for a week, a month, two or three months&#x2014;for the installation of a service. In this regard I believe that if the backlog is reasonable, no one will be able to reproach the Post Office with having neglected its duty, because in the process it has also had to give attention to the transfer or repair of half a million telephones in the course of the year as well as the repair of telephones owing to natural disasters. It also occurs that whereas orders for essential materials such as cables and tarred poles are placed years in advance, those materials are not delivered on time because, for example, the Departments of Defence and Transport also require similar equipment.</p>

<p>This brings me to the question of planning, and more specifically, the question of cables, to which the hon. member for Wynberg also referred. I should just like to say at this stage that the department plans its services in an exceptional manner. The position is quite the opposite of what the hon. member for Wynberg tried to maintain during the Second Reading debate. This department has full-time urban and rural planning and development teams. These are the people who are continually liaising with local authorities, with town planners and with the Departments of Statistics,&#x2019; Planning and the Environment and Community Development, in order to keep pace with township development and the demand for telephones. These teams carry out local inspections every day and plan block by block in order to determine the thickness of the cable required and the overall size of the exchange. These are departmental people who serve on public committees in order to keep pace with the development in each, specific area.</p>

<p>In this regard I should like to take as an example a constituency which, I believe, is going to show the most growth of all constituencies in the Cape Province over the next five years, perhaps even of any constituency in South Africa. I should like to test the planning of the department against the needs of that constituency. For these reasons I take the constituency of Durbanville, not because it is my constituency, but because it is the constituency in which 1 500 dwelling units are to be built in the year ahead. This constituency already has more than 40 residential areas, while more than 20 residential areas are still at the planning stage. This constituency comprises the fast growing Durbanville, the growing section of the Bellville municipality and constituency, the largest growing section of the Parow constituency, the largest growing section of the Goodwood constituency and a large growing section of the Milnerton constituency. When I was elected, I immediately <span class="col_3039-3040" refersTo="page_1535"/>made a survey of the telephone requirements at existing houses and also for proclaimed areas that has not yet been developed. I immediately ferreted out the necessary information and sent a comprehensive letter to the Minister in which I said: &#x201C;All hell is loose here because as far as telephones are concerned, I am going to have a hard time of it.&#x201D; Do you know what happened then? I received a letter in reply in which I was informed that there was a plan for each area, which was about to be carried out. The department was even aware of the 20 planned residential areas for which streets had not even been laid yet and where there were still only port jacksons. I had wanted to bring this to the department&#x2019;s attention, but they had already made provision, in their planning of cables, for the necessary service to these areas. As a result of this, a new Durbanville exchange is to be opened this year with 2 200 additional lines and 2 600 additional lines will be made available to the new exchange serving Bellville North this year. Also as a result of this there is no shortage of telephones in the Parow area. In fact, in the entire constituency of Parow there is a waiting list of only 50, and in Bothasig there is no longer any waiting list at all. This is an indication of the department&#x2019;s advanced planning and how they keep abreast of the development that is taking place.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into account, I think that we can say here today that this department is a positive department with its finger on the pulse of planning and the provision of services, a department capable of facing all the inevitable problems that will crop up in this year of service, too, and of solving them to South Africa&#x2019;s advantage.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to see, when a Government member speaks, how two values can be attached to the same figure. The hon. member for Durbanville spoke of the 98 000 applications on the waiting list for telephones and said that that was minimal, that it was a drop in the ocean, that it did not count. However, when other members speak of the just over 100 000 new telephones which are being supplied,&#x2014;only a few thousand more&#x2014;then that is a wonderful achievement, then it is one of the most wonderful things that has ever happened. [Interjections.] They say, &#x201C;Look! We have supplied 123 000 new telephones in one year&#x201D;. If one says the figure slowly, 123 000, then it is the world, but if one says the figure 98 000 quickly, then it is minimal, it is nothing. These are the double standards we get from their side. The hon. member also spoke of a postal tariff of 4 cents. He does not think, however, of the amount of R530 million made up of those 4 and 5 cents and which is taken out of the pockets of the users. He only speaks of the single amount of 4 cents and not of the of R530 million.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister failed or refused yet again to reply to a number of questions and allegations. I raised five specific points to which the hon. the Minister did not reply. I cannot believe that he did it by accident; I can only think that he did not reply to them deliberately. I should like to make the points again. I alleged that more than 50%, 55% to be specific, of the capital expenditure came from current revenue. In his speech the hon. Minister gave the figure of 50%. That extra 5% represents a big sum of money. From the Second Reading debate, throughout the Committee Stage up to this, stage, the hon. the Minister has not replied to this. The figures are clear. There is R47 million from revenue funds and R64 million in respect of depreciation. This comes to an amount of R112 million out of a total amount of R213 million. The amount from loan funds comes to only R94 million. The hon. the Minister refuses to reply to this. I want to allege once more that he goes further than the Franzsen formula of 50/50, to which we are opposed even on that basis. We are even more opposed to the fact that he now takes more than 50%.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. the Minister has silently ignored that criticism just as the has ignored the criticism that where approximately 7% more telephones have been supplied and 15% more traffic, he has taken 66% more profit out of telecommunications during the past financial year. In other words, the profit is out of all proportion to the additional services and the additional traffic which the system carries. I want to give him best on one point. I was a trifle unfair, which I accept, but I would have thought that the hon. the Minister would have been quick enough to pick it up and come back at me when I spoke of 30% depreciation.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from><span class="col_3041-3042" refersTo="page_1536"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, Mr. Speaker, it was 30% of the Budget; it is not 30% on the total capital. I would have thought that the hon. the Minister would have picked that up. However, he did not pick it up. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark sniffed something but he did not realize what the actual position was either. However, I give them that point. Let&#x2019;s make them happy on that point! But, Mr. Speaker, I do not give any points to the Government for its failure to give an effective answer to our argument that today&#x2019;s user of the telephone is required to carry the burden for past interest plus future capital requirements. He is paying interest on past loans and he is contributing 55% to the capital requirements of the future. The Minister says: &#x201C;This principle is recommended by Franzsen; I accept it and that is the end of the story&#x201D;. Sir, we do not believe that it is the end of the story. We believe that it should be the beginning of a period of re-thinking which should take place, particularly in view of the escalating tariffs.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister completely ignored the case that I raised here of the Bantu reporter who was reported in the Press to have been reported to the Police by a telephone exchange because he spoke surprisingly good English. I think we are entitled to an answer from the Minister in this regard. Sir, there are other minor matters on which he has not given us any answer, but I do not intend to spend further time on them. What I want to do, as I said I would in the Second Reading debate, is to make a few suggestions for the future as an alternative to the traditional attitude of the department that where a service is labour-intensive and therefore unprofitable, the only answer is either to increase the tariffs or to cut down the service. That is the standard answer, &#x201C;Raise the tariffs or reduce the service&#x201D;, whereas we believe that the answer lies in finding a way of streamlining the service or handling it in a different way which will make it less unprofitable or even profitable. Let us look at a few possible suggestions. I do not know if they are practical; I do not know if they are technically realistic, but I would like to know whether they have been looked at, because we have not had a single suggestion from that side of the House as to how to improve the service.</p>

<p>Sir, most of the mail in the cities is business mail&#x2014;accounts, letters and business correspondence. Instead of the present posting system under which you have air mail on the one hand and surface mail on the other as the division, you could have posting boxes with an automatic coding stamp, so that when you push your letter through the machine it will be coded automatically for Central Durban&#x2014;to use Durban as an example&#x2014;or Durban North, or Malvern or Bellair, or whatever the case may be. The basic sorting, which is a major job, would then be done automatically. The stamping of the letter with the magnetic code for the sorting machine would then be done automatically as you post a letter. You could then give the person who thus sorts his own mail for the Post Office a discount on postage; you could make the postage 3 cents instead of 4 cents, so there would be an incentive to the user to do this job. This burden would then be taken off the shoulders of the Post Office. That letter could then automatically go into a sorting machine, ready for delivery. [Interjection.] I put forward this suggestion as a positive idea. Sir, look at the many businesses which have automatic stamping machines. Why cannot those stamping machines be fitted to give the imprint for your automatic sorter? When you stamp your letter with your automatic stamp, you could at the same time put on your magnetized code reference, and that letter could then be sorted automatically. Sir, at present every letter that is posted has to be hand-coded by a girl before it is put into the new machines that we are going to get. If the businessman, who in any case addresses the letter and who in any case has to put it through the stamping machine, had the incentive of a saving of &#x00BD; cent in postage to do that job, you would be saving the Post Office this labour-intensive work.</p>

<p>Let us take the question of mail posted in bulk. Here again there could be an incentive. You could say to your poster of bulk mail that if he hands that mail in, sorted into street order ready for delivery, he will get &#x00BD; cent off his postage. At election time, for instance, you address your mail from cards which are in street order. If you provide the incentive, the man who is doing the work anyway and who is addressing those letters will, if he is going to save himself money, hand them in, in street order, ready to go straight to the delivery section without any manual handling at all. If you were to differentiate between junk mail and commercial mail, and you charged higher fees in respect of junk mail, I believe <span class="col_3043-3044" refersTo="page_1537"/>that would also save a lot. It should be punitive on junk mail, in fact, in view of all this nonsense you get pumped at you.</p>

<p>Sir, I have not time to mention many others, but I want to mention one. I believe the classification between surface and air mail is a wrong classification. The classification should be between local and away mail. Your 4 cent postage should be for local mail and the 5 cent postage for away mail and then this should all go by air mail. At present it involves double handling. You have to sort first into surface and then air, and then one lot goes by surface mail from Durban to Cape Town while another lot goes from Durban to Cape Town by air. If all the away mail were automatically air mail and the local mail was the equivalent of surface mail, I believe it would save handling, it would be more logical and it would give a faster service. Take an express letter from Durban to Cape Town. If it is sent express mail, it can take seven days from Durban to Cape Town. Most people think that if you send it express it will go air mail, but it does not. Express mail only goes express to the train and then all the way down to Cape Town by train, three or four days by train, and then express to the recipient. All express mail should automatically be air mail. So you could streamline and reduce handling all along the line.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to suggest that something should be done about some of the telephone accounts. I had a case yesterday where the widow of an ex-member of this House received four telephone accounts in three months, and three of those accounts debited her with exactly 141 units in each month. She says that even though she may be a fairly regular person, she does not believe that she can have exactly 141 units three months in succession and get four accounts for a three-month period, the extra month being thrown in for good luck. Sir, I have tried to give some positive suggestions and to point out the facts on which the Minister has failed to answer. I hope he will now do so.</p>

<p>Apparently this is the last opportunity I shall have to participate in the Post Office Budget debate. Regularly, for the past 13 or 14 years, I have had the privilege of participating in debates under this Vote. Before the Post Office became independent, the Post Office fell under the Main Budget as an ordinary Vote. At the time, the SABC also fell under this Vote and debates on the SABC and television usually took up most of the available time, and in fact, dominated the debate. Later, in 1970, the SABC and television were transferred to the Department of National Education, and as a result the debate has since focussed on Posts and Telecommunications as such. It was a very wise step on the part of the hon. the Prime Minister to transfer them to the Department of National Education.</p>

<p>Sir, since it acquired financial autonomy, the Post Office, with its various subdivisions, has progressed by leaps and bounds. Circumstances have been difficult. Capital and funds have been limited, but nevertheless the progress made has been exceptionally good and systematic. Planning has been exceptionally sound at all times, and in contrast to the criticism levelled by the Opposition, there is still regular advance planning, as the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget speech indicated.</p>

<p>Since I came here, the Opposition has had the following chief spokesmen on postal affairs: In the first place there was Captain Henwood of Pietermaritzburg District. Then we had Mr. Etienne Malan of Orange Grove, whose speeches always concentrated on the SABC and television. Then the hon. member for Durban Point acted as chief spokesman. The hon. member is very heavily loaded. He is our political opponent, but he is the good friend of many of us. He has broad shoulders, and I read in one of the newspapers the other day that the hon. member is the shadow Minister of almost everything. He is shadow Minister of Railways, of Defence and now of Posts as well. The hon. member prepares himself very well, considering the time he has at his disposal, but sometimes his arguments are not so cogent. Then he is very theatrical. His arguments become noisy, and at such times he makes one think of the old clergyman who jotted down notes in the margin of his sermon. Where his argument was not very convincing, he wrote: &#x201C;This argument weak; here one must shout ..</p>

<p><span class="col_3045-3046" refersTo="page_1538"/>We on the National Party side have had the following chief spokesmen through the years: In the first place there was the late Mr. Gideon Knobel of Bethlehem. Subsequently we had Dr. Connie Mulder, the present Minister of Information and of the interior. We also had Mr. Jan Rail, who did not stand for re-election. Now we have my friend, Mr. Jan van Zyl. These persons have always made a very thorough study and conducted the debate at a very high level.</p>

<p>I should like to convey my thanks and appreciation to the officials in general. I should also like to convey my thanks and appreciation to the Postmasters-General who have occupied that post during this period. There was Mr. Botes, who is still alive, the late Mr. Strauss and now Mr. Louis Rive. All were and are outstanding persons of the highest integrity, people whose inspired approach to their task was backed by confidence and drive. One experienced great goodwill and friendliness in one&#x2019;s dealings with them. That does not apply to them only, but to all the officials as well.</p>

<p>Sir, I have represented constituencies in the east of Pretoria which were situated in growth points in that area. Initially, from 1961 to 1966, I represented Pretoria East. That constituency grew to such an extent that at the time of the 1966 delimitation it was divided into two constituencies, viz. Waterkloof and Koedoespoort. Subsequently I represented Koedoespoort, which is also situated in a growth point. That was from 1966 to 1974. If the Post Office experienced its growth pains anywhere, then it was in those very parts of Pretoria. But the goodwill was there. When telephones were requested, exchanges were built or expanded and post offices were built. I want to address a special word of thanks to the Post Office officials in Pretoria who provided telephones at the various polling stations and offices with great speed and thoroughness. This applies to the officials here in Cape Town, too. One had only to drop a note in the post addressed to the Regional Director, to find that when one came to one&#x2019;s flat, the telephone was installed. That is very highly appreciated. Here in the Parliamentary Building we have various facilities, <i>inter alia</i> a post office. In the course of time we have had various postmasters who have been friendly and helpful people. They has been a very good advertisement for the Post Office. Here in the exchange we have had young ladies, in the course of time and there are still some of them on the exchange. They are friendly, helpful, hardworking and charming young ladies. We convey our thanks to them, too.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to a dedicated staff. It is as if a new spirit arose among the officials after the Post Office became autonomous. It is a spirit of dedication, sacrifice and loyalty towards the hon. the Minister and the Management. One need only remember that the offer to work two additional hours a week to compensate for the shortage of staff came voluntarily from the ranks of the Post Office employees. As a result of this, business could continue despite the major shortages in the various sections. I just want to refer with deep gratitude, although this has already been done, to the sacrifices made by officials at the time of the recent floods on the Rand. The technicians of the Post Office worked at a terrific pace day and night to repair the damage to telephone lines so that everything could function normally again. Teams from elsewhere agreed to go to the Rand to assist there. All the available technicians were working so much as 36-hour shifts in order to repair the telephone connections damaged by the rain. Up to 4 600 telephone lines per day were repaired. The damage caused in general by storms costs the Post Office a great deal of money every year. In the first place, it is costly to replace damaged material. In the second place it costs even more because the technicians who work on this and are pinned down to the repair service, are prevented from installing telephones at new places. The complaints made are often misplaced in the light of what I have said here.</p>

<p>Every year the hon. the Minister has rightly made mention in his speech of the harmonious co-operation between the Minister, the Management and the staff as well as the staff associations. I have always been a regular reader of the various official organs or mouthpieces of the various associations. I refer now to the White staff associations. The loyalty of those people to the hon. the Minister, to the Management, to the Post Office as such and to our Republic, is apparent from the introductory articles, the ordinary articles and the letters. This is very greatly appreciated. I could quote a number of extracts arresting to that loyalty, conveyed by carious leading figures in the associations acting as mouthpieces. Today I just want to quote one typical example. <span class="col_3047-3048" refersTo="page_1539"/>At the congress of the South African Postal Association which took place in Johannesburg last year, the president, Mr. Lotter, addressed a word of warning to the members of association to think hard before resigning from the service of the Post Office. Reference to his speech is made in the Association&#x2019;s organ, the <i>Postal Journal</i> of September 1974. The president, Mr. Lotter, believes, and I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the need to create can be more than partially satisfied in the execution of a person&#x2019;s daily tasks. When this is done with enthusiasm and zeal, it gives one pleasure and contentment that cannot be satisfied by other emotions. If we all have a sound and dedicated attitude to our daily task, we cannot but protect our employer&#x2019;s interests and have a just claim to the progress of this great organization.</block>

<p>He also went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us take pride in giving the Post</block>

<p>Office a good image.</p>

<p>Those are fine and inspiring words, expressing stimulating ideas.</p>

<p>I see that my time is almost up and I just want to conclude by conveying my personal thanks to the Minister. I want to wish him and the whole Management, too, all of the best and express the hope that he will get a positive reaction from the Opposition in the future, not the kind of reaction we have had in these discussions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to begin by referring to the hon. member for Gezina, who has just spoken. Today he made his last contribution as member of this House. As an old friend and as the Minister responsible for this portfolio, in regard to which he frequently made a contribution, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity at the outset of my speech to convey a few words of sincere appreciation to him for the many years of competent and good service which he has rendered as parliamentarian. Over the years we have come to know him as a person who made a thorough study of his various subjects. Therefore, when the hon. member for Gezina rose in this House to make a contribution, we could listen to it. His speeches testified to proper knowledge and background study. In that respect we shall always remember him as a thorough person. He treated this House with respect, and he did not rise here and regale us with absurdities. At all times he respected the dignity of this House by making substantial contributions here. We shall remember him for what he did for us. He was really an old stalwart, and participated in a wide range of subjects. A while ago mention was made of how the hon. member for Durban Point, in the present situation of the Opposition, is the shadow Minister of a great many portfolios. In his time the hon. member for Gezina has taken an intense interest in various departments and portfolios. When I was still associated with the Department of Coloured Affairs, and with other departments, he was also one of the zealous contributors. Therefore I want to tell him that we will miss him in this House. His contributions were valuable, and we will remember those contributions as being among the good contributions that <span class="col_3049-3050" refersTo="page_1540"/>have been made in this House. Since he is now being called upon by the Government to serve his country in another context, in the extremely important sphere of the promotion of sound ethnic relations, I should like to wish him and his friendly wife everything of the best. As we know them, we are convinced that they will, in that capacity as well, be a great asset and also a great credit to the country. I hope that it will go well with them.</p>

<p>I now want to return to the debate which has been conducted for the past few days, and in the first place express my appreciation for the positive contributions which were made by my side of the House. These contributions were very valuable &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, a few positive contributions were also made by the other side of the House, and I shall refer subsequently to a few suggestions which came from that side. In the main, the positive contributions were made by this side of the House, and for that I want to express my special appreciation. From the opposite side of the House we had a variety of contributions. We had contributions which also contained sound suggestions, but in general those contributions were characterized by a number of negative and petty matters which varied from letters that had allegedly been opened, while nobody knew anything about them, to the Bantu reporter a matter which was raised here and to which I shall refer in a moment. These matters could certainly be dealt with by the department, and one does not really expect this in a debate of this nature. However I shall presently refer to that matter in detail.</p>

<p>I begin with the first speaker on the Opposition side of this House, the hon. member for Wynberg. I do not know whether the hon. member for Wynberg is the shadow Deputy Minister, but the United Party will probably be able to iron out the matter of what the hon. member&#x2019;s portfolio is in due course.

<p>As any person stands on two legs, I also stand on two legs. The one leg is Labour and the other is Posts. In this way I make my way through the world, and feel happy. The hon. member for Wynberg referred once again to the question of the payment for services rendered to other Government departments. I do not consider it necessary to refer again to the Post Office Re-adjustment Act, for one should really see this matter in the spirit of the intention behind that legislation. This reciprocal rendering of service between the Post Office and other Government departments is in fact intrinsic to our entire State philosophy and Public Administration, in so far that we consider the Post Office to be part of the State as a whole. As such it is not our task to try to make a profit from any Government department. We render services to them as they do to us, and these are calculated as accurately as our system allows. In the main, however, we do not seek, and it is not our object, to make profits from any of the Government departments, for, after all, who are the people who have to benefit from those Government departments? It is only the public as a whole, even if it is in another context. Therefore, of what avail is it to cut a piece off on the one side and fasten it to the other side? Surely the State is one big family, and just as hon. members do not want their children to make profits from one another, so we dare not allow Government departments to do so.</p>

<p>The basis of the underlying arrangement is that the services are rendered at cost; at least they are not being rendered as a favour or as a gift. I just want to say that it is not a cost-plus payment. It is in fact being calculated on a cost basis. I am thinking for example of the contributions which we have to make in regard to television. It has in fact been <span class="col_3051-3052" refersTo="page_1541"/>carefully calculated what it would cost the Post Office to make the channels available for television. That decision was taken on the basis of the costs involved.</p>

<p>The hon. member pleaded once again for concessions to old-age pensioners. He proposed that we should, if need be, set an age determination of 70 years. This is probably the most unpopular matter I have to deal with in my portfolio. It is certainly not popular to tell the aged that we cannot help them. In fact it is, from a popularity point of view, far better to allow a reduction here and there, but unfortunately the same considerations which I stated yesterday apply in this case as well. If we set an age determination of 70 or 71, we still have to apply that determination throughout to all other contiguous cases. The implementation of this matter still remains a problem to us. There is probably no doubt that the computer will be able to separate out the 70-year-olds for us, but we shall have to allow this to be applied throughout to all contiguous cases. I am sorry, but with the best will in the world, the Post Office cannot do this. If a concession has to be made to these people, I really think that the hon. member ought to advance his plea under the main Budget, when we are dealing with social pensions. He ought then to advance his plea to the Minister of Finance, so that that Minister can make a payment to the Post Office enabling it to accommodate this large group, however that group may be defined. The Post Office, being a business organization, is not geared to doing this, apart from the fact that we find it so difficult to implement the matter. However, I leave it to the hon. member; if this matter has to be taken further, I want to suggest that he makes this plea to my colleague, the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of the replacement of cables. I can give the hon. member the assurance that the replacement and the laying of cables is indeed being done completely according to plan. The hon. member for Durbanville also referred to this. It is being done according to plan, but now it has to be done according to priorities. We have priorities in respect of the construction of post office buildings, the laying of cables and the building of exchanges. Without a pattern of priorities no major administration, such as ours, can function properly. For that reason one must, with a view to one&#x2019;s finances and one&#x2019;s available manpower, maintain that pattern of priorities. However, I want to give the assurance that cables are not being laid unsystematically; it is in fact being done according to a planned system. Since the hon. member is the deputy shadow Minister, I assume that he will, as time goes by, liaise to a greater extent with the department and hold talks with its officials, thus enabling himself to become conversant with that very plan of action which is being carried out by the department.</p>

<p>The question of postal deliveries was also raised. It is true that the postal division of any department of posts throughout the world is operated at a loss. Therefore this is not only the case in our country. It is common cause that nowhere in the world is a postal delivery service profitable. Nevertheless, we must continue to render this service. In this regard I want to point out that there has in fact been a decrease in the number of deliveries per day. I saw statistics recently which indicated that in London and in other cities of the world this service had been curtailed to one delivery a day. Even in such a progressive country as the United States this service has also been curtailed. There is nothing unusual about those services being curtailed in those countries.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg referred here to two letters which he had received. Those two letters had apparently been posted a long time ago. In this regard I want to say the following: This Parliament is available for the discussion of any matter, but in complimenting the hon. member for Gezina a moment ago on his having at all times taken into consideration the dignity of this House and always having made his contributions at that level, I really thought that one should also take that into consideration in regard to the subjects which have to be raised here. These are all matters which could be dealt with departmentally. If a letter was posted and arrived at its destination in 10 days&#x2019; time, it is not a matter which one need raise in the Parliament of one&#x2019;s country. Do we not have sufficient respect for this place and the dignity and importance of this institution to refrain from discussing the question of a letter which was ten or 14 days late in the Parliament of our country? All the departmental channels are open. It is therefore not a question of hon. members not having access to my department or to me. All these channels are open to hon. members <span class="col_3053-3054" refersTo="page_1542"/>and anyone else in South Africa to bring these matters to our attention properly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point referred to a number of matters.</p>

<p>&#x2020;He referred to the Bantu reporter who was reported to the Police because he spoke excellent English. First of all, I have no knowledge of this incident but it is not departmental policy nor is it our custom to react in such a way. If the report is true, then it must, of course, be seen as an extreme exception of which neither I nor my department approves. This is certainly a case that can be investigated. In this case too I must say that I doubt whether this is the correct place to raise a matter of this nature. However, if the Opposition has nothing else to attack the Government on, then it might need to raise points of this nature.</p>

<p>You have not bothered to investigate it.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member also made a number of suggestions which we were very pleased to receive. I shall welcome it if more hon. members on the Opposition side will in the future take advantage of the opportunity to make suggestions. The hon. member spoke about the coding of letters and the incentive in this regard. This is something which might become possible in future when we have the addressographs and other machines that will be able to handle this matter. In connection with the question of an incentive for the sender for bulk posting and for addressing and sorting the mail in advance, I can only draw attention to the fact that we have, of course, given a 5% reduction in postage for this service. Whether something more can be done, is a matter that can be considered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But not for sorting.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As far as bulk posting is concerned, the hon. member also made a plea for a greater incentive. As far as concessions are concerned, I should point out perhaps that senders do get a <span class="col_3055-3056" refersTo="page_1543"/>concession for pre-sorting mail. In respect of 10 000 or more, the concession is 20%, and if the number is less than 10 000 the concession is 10%. I think that is quite a considerable concession. One can always consider the question of increasing it, but what I have said shows we are moving in that direction.</p>

<p>The other suggestion which the hon. member made was in connection with the differentiation in tariffs between surface mail and air mail. The question of sending all away-mail by air and levying a common tariff for such mail has been under study for quite a while. I would like to give the hon. member the assurance that we are going into this matter. Perhaps in the next Budget debate we will be able to make a statement in this regard. I may add that the &#x201C;all up&#x201D;, as it is known in Post Office jargon, is something which might be feasible in the future. It is a matter that we will go into.</p>

<p>*Sir, the question of financing was raised here. In fact, the Opposition went out of its way in this debate to criticize our system of Post Office financing. At times they came to light with fallacious arguments. Hon. members referred to the recommendations of the Franzsen Committee, and the hon. member for Wynberg said that the Franzsen Committe had already commenced its investigations 15 years ago. I think that for the sake of the record it would perhaps be a good thing if I were just to point out that the Franzsen Committee was appointed on 2 December 1971 by me as Minister. Serving on it was Dr. Franzsen, as chairman. Mr. Browne, the Secretary for Finance, the Postmaster-General and Mr. Campbell Pitt, whom I appointed as representative of the private sector. They then made recommendations on the basis of financing for the Post Office, precisely because the Post Office was having such a struggle to find capital to implement its major telecommunications programme. It was felt that we really did not have sufficient space in which to realize ourselves. The committee submitted its report on 6 March 1972. Subsequently I submitted it to the Cabinet and the Cabinet accepted the Franzsen report in its entirety. When I introduced the Budget here on 22 March 1972, I announced the recommendations of the Franzsen Committee for the first time here in the House of Assembly and embodied them in that Budget, as they have since then been embodied in every subsequent Budget. I really hope that this statement of the facts will put an end to this 15-year-story. As regards the retention of this rational and brand new formula of the Franzsen Committee, it is perhaps a good thing just to refer in this context to the opinion of a person who is not really regarded as being a friend of the Government at all times, or is not always full of praise for the Government, on the significance of the recommendations of the Franzsen Committee. I am mentioning this particularly in view of the United Party&#x2019;s plea during this session that we should now throw this overboard and that I should not become hidebound by these brand new recommendations of three years ago. Therefore it is perhaps interesting to listen to what a spokesman of the <i>Financial Mail,</i> a publication which is not generous in its praise of the National Party Government, has to say in this edition of 27 March 1972, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Post Office Budget: Stability ahead. Considering it got the worst of both worlds, the Post Office did pretty well to emerge from 1971-&#x2019;72 with a deficit of R29,5 million. That the shortfall was not higher was probably because the latest revenue figures show a rising tendency. Having pulled through this crisis, implemention of the Franzsen Committee&#x2019;s proposals should see the Post Office heading for more stable fortunes in the year to come.</block>

<p>That is how the <i>Financial Mail</i> saw the matter three years ago. In this respect I think that they adopted a sound view, for the formula which was then devised, and its application, to which I am going to refer in a moment with reference to the complaint of the hon. member for Durban Point, is proving extremely successful&#x2014;so much so that the Post Office has no reason to deviate from this course it has adopted. This formula certainly meets the principal requirements of financing. Therefore there is absolutely no reason to deviate from it.</p>

<p>But I come now to the complaint made by the hon. member for Durban Point, namely that the financing from revenue would amount to 55% for the coming year, and that I had omitted to furnish proper data. For that reason I should now like to give you the facts. In view of the elucidation of the Franzsen Committee as well as its formula for depreciation, which hon. members can also of course find in <span class="col_3057-3058" refersTo="page_1544"/>this same Hansard of 1972,&#x2014;the position was stated very clearly there&#x2014;I want to set out for the hon. member what the position for the present is. If we deduct the deficit with which we began the financial year, i.e. the financial year which is now coming to an end, namely R6,52 million, from the operating surplus of the coming year, namely R47 478, it gives us a surplus for application for capital purposes of R40,726 million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But why does it have to be deducted?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely this was a loss which we suffered. Surely we do not have the money now. Where else should it come from? We are budgeting for a deficit, of R13 million for the coming year, up to the end of the financial year, and this amount we are able to borrow from outside sources. We have the facilities for borrowing this, as you know, Sir. We did this three years ago, and we could also borrow this R13 million overseas. If we borrow this R13 million overseas we would have to pay a high interest rate on it. Instead of borrowing it overseas, we are now using the floating money which is after all in the Post Office every day. This amount, which we could have borrowed from outside sources, is not our money, but the public&#x2019;s money, money paid by the public for postal orders, or for any other service which they are going to receive tomorrow or the day after. This is not therefore the Post Office&#x2019;s money. But now we are using that money for this short period. However, it remains loan money, borrowed money. If we include this floating money which is <i>in transito,</i> the effect is that as far as loans are concerned, we are going to ask the Treasury for R40 million. We hope the Savings Bank will be able to contribute R30 million. The other loans will amount to R24.5 million, and the floating money, R13 million. All these amounts will total R 107,5 million. On internal funds the surplus will amount to R40,726 million. The depreciation amounts to R64,743 million. The latter two amounts collectively total R 105,469 million&#x2014;let us say R 105,5 million. What all this amounts to is that as far as loans are concerned, that R107,5 million is the equivalent of 50,47%. From internal funds the amount of R105,5 million is the equivalent of 49,53%. This is the percentage ratio on which we are working.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Why is the amount of R6,7 million being deducted twice? Surely that gives R13 million.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not being deducted twice. At the beginning of the financial year we had a deficit of approximately R6,5 million and the financial year closed with a deficit of approximately R6,5 million. Twice R6,5 million is R13 million. That is what it amounts to.</p>

<p>During the course of this debate quite a number of references were also made to telephones. It is a pity the Opposition used this debate to draw attention to the backlog in this regard. There should, if we had maintained our perspective, also have been a fair evaluation of the 123 000 telephones which had been installed. As the hon. member for Durban North made very clear, the backlog in proportion to the number of telephones which we have at present is such that we actually find ourselves in a more favourable position today than during the past six years.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The first clause of this Bill has as its aim the rectification of the designation of the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations in the Group Areas Act.</p>

<p><span class="col_3059-3060" refersTo="page_1545"/>In the second clause a restriction against alienation or hypothecation in the title deed conditions of properties situate in a group area is removed in order to eliminate certain anomalies. Section 27(l)(d) of the Group Areas Act provides that from the date on which an area is declared a group area for a certain race, any provision in the title deed of any immovable property situate in that area prohibiting or restricting the acquisition of such property by persons who are members of the group for which that area has been established, falls away. In the Province of Natal it was customary to include in title deeds conditions forbidding alienation and hypothecation of the property to members of a certain race. A case from Isipingo, which is a group area for Indians, can be mentioned as an illustration. The title deeds of the properties in this area contain a condition that provides that the properties may not be alienated or hypothecated to a person of Asiatic descent. The Chief Registrar of Title Deeds is of the opinion that the said provision in the Group Areas Act does not remove a restriction on alienation and hypothecation and therefore the amendment is proposed in order to eliminate any doubt that may exist.</p>

<p>The third clause provides for an increase in the number of members of the Committee mentioned in section 29 of the Group Areas Act, which investigates the desirability of establishing local governments for Coloureds and Indians. The present section 29(2)(a) is designed for the circumstances that existed before the Coloured Person&#x2019;s Representative Council was instituted. Since the said Council came into being it has been policy to consult the Council and its Executive more and more and to involve them in all matters in which they have jurisdiction or are interested, in so far as the Coloured community is concerned. Section 17(6)(a) of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council Act, 1964, delegates, <i>inter alia,</i> the furtherance of local government matters, specifically to the Council and its Executive. It is therefore necessary that the Executive concerned should also have direct representation on the Committee by appointing two of their members to it. Further it is regarded as desirable that the local Coloured communities should also be represented in the committee through their Management Committees. In metropolitan areas such as the Cape Peninsula where various management Committees function under various local authorities (for example the Municipality of Cape Town and the Divisional Council) it may be necessary to nominate more than one representative. For this purpose two representatives are envisaged. Previous investigations in the field of local self-government and especially the report of the Botha Committee have indicated that the inception of an independent local management body contains certain legal implications which will have to be thoroughly scrutinized and which may result in certain adaptations. It is therefore essential that a legal adviser should serve on this committee to go into this particular aspect and where necessary to help with the formulation of suitable legal amendments.</p>

<p>One of the underlying problems in the realization of self-government in Coloured areas which requires a thorough study, is the financial aspect. The matter is complicated by nature because of the intertwining of the interests of Coloured and White areas, and new formulae of granting aid will have to be found. For this purpose it is advisable that an expert in the field of municipal finances should be appointed to the committee. In exceptional cases the need may arise to nominate another additional member. Together with the three members referred to in section 29(2)(a) the total arrived is ten.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the first two clauses of the Bill have been explained by the hon. the Minister. There is no point I wish to raise in regard to those two clauses. I have however, certain comments to make on clause 3. As the hon. the Minister has indicated, the power to control local authorities was vested in the Coloured Representative Council as long ago as 1964. It has taken some 11 years for meaningful steps to be taken by the Government so that the CRC could have representation on this investigatory committee.</p>

<p>According to laws we have at the present time, there are three stages in dealing with the establishment of a Coloured or Indian local authority. Firstly there is the establishment of the consultative committee which merely has the function of being at the receiving end of consultation with the local authority in the area in which it exists.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is provision for a management committee which, although it has more powers, is still subservient to the <span class="col_3061-3062" refersTo="page_1546"/>existing local authority. The third or next intermediate stage consists of the activities of this committee as expounded in section 29(2)(a) of the Act. I want to say at once that I welcome the explanation the hon. the Minister has given about the more precise composition of this committee. We have had this legislation, for a number of year, in which it is merely provided that there should be not more than five members. The only way the hon. the Minister was bound in making the appointments was that one member should represent the province and one should represent the local authority concerned. It has taken a long time for this committee to be re-established, as I have said. I would have liked to have seen the hon. the Minister enshrine in the Bill itself, and in the Act as a consequence, how the committee should be constituted. He has explained to us his intentions on the constitution of the committee. He has mentioned representation of local authorities, representation of the CRC and representation of a knowledgeable municipal official. I now see the hon. Leader of the House looking at me.</p>

<p>I am listening to you.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I now want him to listen to this. Quite some time ago the hon. Leader of the House made a prophecy as to when all Coloured group areas would be under the control of Coloured councils. He was a long way off. The time has lapsed. There are very few areas that are under properly established Coloured local authorities. One therefore welcomes this step 11 years after the powers were granted to see that some active investigation is carried out. I want to ask the hon. Minister whether he would not charge a committee to investigate another matter in this regard. There have been a number of committees appointed, one for the Cape Province and one for the province of Natal. They have been appointed to carry out investigations that a committee under section 29(2)(a) should do, i.e. to investigate the feasibility of the establishment of a local authority for Coloured or Indian persons. I believe that one of the major problems they come up against&#x2014;and the hon. the Minister has referred to this&#x2014;is the financial aspect of the matter. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister should not now realize that the time has come for this committee to investigate in principle and indepth the necessity for the introduction of some form of umbrella organization to deal with adjacent local authorities which in themselves are looking after the affairs of different racial groups. In other words, has the time not come for the hon. the Minister to investigate the feasibility and practicability of establishing metropolitan authorities using this committee as an overall committee for that purpose. After all, the hon. the Minister does not need me to tell him that a soley residential local authority can never be a viable local authority. Its rates income and other factors would be such that it could never function. If there are to be large areas which are solely residential areas, they must in some way be incorporated in the benefits of the adjacent industrial and business areas which they themselves serve and in which they are involved. I believe that is a matter the hon. the Minister could well refer to this committee for investigation. This is a matter needing urgent attention. One has the tendency to call these bodies local authorities and management committees when, in effect, they cannot properly discharge the duties or exercise the powers of a local authority or a management committee because of their non-viability. I need only refer the hon. the Minister to two reports of two investigations which were held in the Cape Province not so long ago. I refer to the investigations of the Rossouw Commission and the Slater Commission. I do believe that it would help considerably in the development of the proper type of community life for our people if the committee which is provided for by section 29(2)(a) of the principal Act, and which is enlarged by clause 3 of this Bill, could investigate this wider aspect of the matter and could take positive action to implement the undertakings given by the hon. Leader of the House some 12 years ago, or at least to make some contribution to the fulfilment of the hopes expressed by him at that stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to convey my thanks to hon. members for their support of this Bill. There is no difference of opinion about the need for the enlargement of the investigation committee. I think we are all agreed on that score. We also agree that this is a step in the right direction in the sense that we are involving the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Representative Council and the local Coloured community, too, in the investigation committee which, is to investigate the establishment of a local management. The fact of the matter is, of course, that this part of the work is done by the hon. the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations. It is his prerogative to appoint this committee and, after receiving the report of the committee, to take the necessary steps in pursuance of the report he has received. I am sure that the points raised by the hon. member for Green Point will in fact be given due consideration by such committee. The establishment of a local management without additional financial resources will certainly not get that local management off the ground. It is my opinion that in most Coloured towns the existing buildings are too few to provide the local management with adequate funds, on the basis of a fair valuation and a fair tax. The industrial area usually falls within the area of jurisdiction of the White city council. In my opinion there is not the slightest doubt that due consideration will have to be given to the financial aspect. That is why, in addition to the representatives of the CRC and the representative of the local Coloureds as well as the other representatives, someone with financial knowledge who will be able to advise the committee will have to be appointed to the committee. Part of the committee&#x2019;s report to the Minister will probably contain recommendations in regard to this cardinal aspect of the establishment of local Coloured or Indian self-government bodies.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>With this short Amendment Bill two small amendments are being envisaged to the National Institute for Metallurgy Act, 1965 (Act No. 90 of 1965). The first relates to the alteration of the Afrikaans designation of the Institute, and also entails that the title of the Act has to be amended. The second amendment seeks to authorize the institute to grant undergraduate bursaries to prospective university students.</p>

<p>As the Act reads at present, the Institute is called in Afrikaans the &#x201C;Nasionale Metallurgiese Instituut&#x201D;, while the English designation is the National Institute for Metallurgy. The English designation has given rise to the Institute being referred to in general as NIM. In Afrikaans as well, the Institute, for the sake of convenience is referred to in common parlance as &#x201C;NIM&#x201D;, and I am certain that hon. members on both sides of the House are already acquainted with this abbreviation or acronym. The designation &#x201C;Nasionale Institute <span class="col_3065-3066" refersTo="page_1548"/>vir Metallurgic&#x201D; will be better adapted to the English designation, and this amendment is also being considered necessary for the sake of uniformity. I have ascertained that from a philological point of view there is no objection to the designation &#x201C;Nasionale Institute vir Metallurgie&#x201D;, which gives the abbreviation &#x201C;NIM&#x201D; in Afrikaans as well.</p>

<p>The change of name, as is being proposed, will necessitate the short and long titles of the Act having to be amended to refer to the &#x201C;Nasionale Instituut vir Metallurgie&#x201D; instead of the &#x201C;Nasionale Metallurgiese Instituut&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The other amendment, which is in fact the most important one, arises out of the serious shortage of manpower in the metallurgical industry. I have frequently discussed this shortage and the detrimental effect it is having on the mining industry in this country, both in as well as outside this House, and therefore I probably need not elaborate on this again today. In a recent debate a number of the hon. members of the Opposition also referred to this aspect. NIM should like to be of assistance in this regard by granting undergraduate bursaries in order to attract young men and encourage them to take up metallurgy as a career. Unfortunately, however, it is a fact that the present provisions of the Act only allow the granting of post-graduate busaries.</p>

<p>The control board of the Institute has consequently recommended that this undesirable position be rectified by way of a statutory amendment. This recommendation is most strongly supported, and clause 3 of the Bill rectifies this matter. As will be seen, the existing requirement concerning research bursaries and grants-in-aid, i.e. that the Minister of Mines shall approve grants in consultation with the Minister of Finance, is also being made applicable to the anticipated undergraduate bursaries. I may mention that for the 1974-&#x2019;75 financial year an amount of R90 000 is being placed at the disposal of NIM for bursary grants, and that the Institute envisages granting undergraduate bursaries annually to no fewer than five students. Bursary holders are required to work for NIM for one year for each year of the duration of the bursary. The additional manpower which will be made available to the metallurgical industry in this way, an industry which is so absolutely essential and vital to South Africa, is only a drop in the ocean, but at least it does help, and I have every confidence that sufficient interest will gradually be aroused in this important sphere of employment, which is of such great importance to our mining industry.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we only have two points of comment in regard to this proposed statutory amendment. In the first place, of course, we welcome the amendment which is being inserted in the principal Act by clause 2. On a previous occasion&#x2014;the discussion of a private motion on the promotion of metallurgy and geology in South Africa&#x2014; we paid tribute to the work which, is being done by this institute. It is an excellent institute with an international reputation, and I am in full agreement with the motives given to us by the hon. the Minister for bringing the Afrikaans designation into line with the present English designation, the sobriquet, I could almost call it, of NIM.</p>

<p>I should like to put a question to the hon. the Minister in regard to subsection (2) of the proposed new section 2. This subsection provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(2) The head office of the institute shall be situated at Johannesburg, but may, with the consent of the Minister, be moved to any other place in the Republic.</block>

<p>We know of course that the present institution in Johannesburg is far too small for its purpose. We also know that there are tremendous expansions in progress in this regard. I should like to ascertain from the hon. the Minister whether these expansions are in fact associated with this envisaged move to Randburg, and not with another further move to another place We should appreciate it if the hon. the Minister could enlighten us in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>As far as clause 3 is concerned, we support the intention of the hon. the Minister to render assistance and to effect improvements in regard to research bursaries, grants-in-aid, etc. During a recent debate, however, I pointed out to the hon. the Minister that the kind of assistance which is being rendered at present, is extremely limited owing to the lack of research facilities at the universities. The work which NIM is doing depends partially on the assistance and the co-operation which can be obtained from the universities. Unless the universities are able to offer the metallurgical students, research workers, etc., the <span class="col_3067-3068" refersTo="page_1549"/>necessary facilities, it is of no use whatever appropriating money unless the postgraduate students and research workers do in fact have the opportunity of doing more advanced work, which can only be done in the laboratories of the universities. That co-operation between the institute and the universities is of the utmost importance. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to use his influence so that where financial assistance is being rendered to universities, provision will also in fact be made for the necessary money for the expansion of the metallurgical facilities at the university concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have no objection to this legislation, and shall support the Second Reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, knowing that metallurgy is in fact one of the main pillars of the South African economy and always has been, it is rather surprising, when one makes an assessment of what the investment has been in research and educational facilities as far as metallurgy is concerned in South Africa, to see to what extent it has been inadequate up to now. Sir, mining and metallurgy&#x2014;mining in the first place to bring the ores to the surface, and metallurgy to beneficiate the ores and to extract the metals concerned&#x2014;have been the basis of our primary industry in the years during which South Africa has been a developing industrial country, and the production of goods and articles from metal is the mainstay today of our secondary and tertiary industries. For that reason I would like to associate myself with the remark made by the previous speaker that very much more in the way of funds should be made available not only to the universities at which metallurgy is studied, but also to those organizations where metallurgical research and development take place. I believe that having regard to the future industrial demands of South Africa, the funds that are being made available at the moment will have to be increased considerably, not just by a small percentage in order to make it adequate for the needs of the country. Sir, if you look at the metallurgical industry in South Africa, you will find that probably something like 90% to 95% of the positions which should be filled by metallurigcal engineers are filled by people who are not fully qualified metallurgists or metallurigical engineers. This is a most unfortunate situation. Much of the research that is taking place in the metallurgical field is not being carried out by mettallurgists as such, but by people with other disciplines who are operating in that particular field. This is unfortunate because the job can obviously best be done both in the research field and in the industrial field by qualified metallurgists, the people who have the correct basic training. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make just one further point. In the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply to a question which appeared on the Order Paper on Tuesday, 18 March this year, an indication was given that no money had been made available by the Government for post-graduate bursaries or for grants-in-aid for research to students other than White students in the years 1972, 1973 and 1974. The point I want to make is a very simple one, Sir. If the homelands are to be given a viable economic foundation, if there is to be any permanent viability in terms of industrial activities in the homelands involving mining and metallurgy, then the Government should make an early start in training people who can enter those industries and provide guidance and leadership and management. I believe that it is most unfortunate that in this day and age, when we need rapid development of these industries in the homelands, there are still no trained Blacks in South Africa who can enter that field. I am not referring just to the mining and metallurgical industry in the primary sense. I am referring to the metallurgical industry in terms of the manufacture of motor-cars and the manufacture of refrigerators and to the hundred and one other primary, secondary and tertiary industries which the Government will have to develop in the homelands if those homelands are to have any viability at all. If we are sincere in saying that we wish to do something economically for the Coloureds and Indians in South Africa, then we must also make facilities available for them to be able to study in the industrial field and to be able to enter the industries of South Africa where higher incomes leading to higher standards of living will be available to them. Therefore, Sir, I believe that in terms of the legislation now before the House, it is correct that we should make an appeal to the Government that in future it should provide undergraduate bursaries, post-graduate bursaries, and grants-in-aid for research, to White, Black, Coloured and Indian at our universities, where these facilities are available, <span class="col_3069-3070" refersTo="page_1550"/>and in the research institutes of South Africa. Only in that way can we show sincerely that we wish the other races of South Africa to participate on a fair and just basis also in the industrial life of South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I want to convey my thanks to the Opposition parties for their support of this Bill, and assure them that it is very highly appreciated. I want to reply briefly to the questions which were put to me. To the hon. member for Von Brandis I want to say that this expansion is associated only with the moving of the head office from Johannesburg to Randburg, and nothing else. Then, in regard to the appeal which he made to me in regard to the co-operation which must exist between the National Institute for Metallurgy and the universities, and that we should help them to obtain more funds because this is so important, I want to tell the hon. member that I am so much in agreement with him that there is no matter in regard to which I have approached the Treasury so many times for greater assistance than in regard to this matter of the National Institute for Metallurgy, as well as for increased financial assistance to the universities. I can give him that assurance. I have on various occasions paid personal visits to the University of the Witwatersrand and to NIM. It is very interesting to go there. I wish more members would make use of the opportunity to go and see what is happening there so that we could in this way achieve a better insight into one of our most important enterprises in this country, and in this way, too, encourage our children to take a greater interest in it. I can give the hon. member the assurance that as a result&#x2014;I say this humbly&#x2014;of my personal mediation and interest in this matter, with the assistance of Dr. Robinson, and others such as Dr. Roux, there was last year a reasonably considerable increase in the number of students at Wits, for example, and also at other universities where they are able to study metallurgy. This is very gratifying. Matters look very promising for 1975. I can give the hon. member the assurance that the co-operation between NIM, the universities and myself in this regard is of the utmost cordiality. Lastly I want to tell the hon. member that in respect of this matter we have done more than the hon. member asked me to do, which is that I have, for a considerable time, been engaged in negotiating with the departments concerned not only to expand to the existing facilities for metallurgy at the existing universities and to appropriating additional funds, but also to see whether the time is not ripe for the establishment of metallurgical departments at other universities as well. These negotiations have reached an advanced stage, and we are now working out the financial aspects of this, in co-operation with the bodies concerned.</p>

<p>I want to avail myself of this opportunity &#x2014;and I hope that cognisance will be taken of this&#x2014;to say something about bursaries. The number of bursaries which have now been made available by NIM under the existing Act, i.e. for post-graduate students, are 26 in 1972, to the amount of R47 000; 30 in 1973, to the amount of R60 000; and 34 in 1974, to the amount of R97 000. This was prior to the amendment which we effected here this afternoon, in terms of which we will also be able to make bursaries available to undergraduate students. But the point I want to make is that under the old Act, under the A scheme, i.e. for hand-picked students, who are required to work for three years, 19 bursaries have been granted at an average of R5 216 per annum. This is a very considerable bursary, and one is not always able to understand why our young people do not come forward and take an interest in this matter. Under the B scheme, in terms of which there is no obligation to work for the institute, but where a special research task is given to each bursary holder, the results of which he may utilize for his thesis, 15 bursaries have been granted at an average of R2 490 per annum per bursary. These are therefore very considerable bursaries which have been granted for this purpose. In aggregate, therefore, 34 bursaries have been granted at an average of R4 014 per annum. And then, lastly, in regard to this matter&#x2014; it is now being contemplated, after this Act has been amended, to grant, as far as these undergraduate bursaries are concerned, five bursaries for the first five years at R1 000 each, i.e. R5 000; in the second year ten bursaries at R1 000; in the third year five bursaries at R1 000 each; in the fourth year 20 bursaries at R1000 each; and subsequently 20 bursaries at R1000 each. The undergraduate bursaries entail an obligation to work for three years, i.e., after the bursary holders have obtained their degrees.</p>

<p><span class="col_3071-3072" refersTo="page_1551"/>With reference to the question asked by the hon. member for Bryanston about non-Whites, just the following: I have stated in reply to a question by the hon. member for Yeoville that no bursaries have been granted to non-Whites, but I want to avail myself of this opportunity to furnish additional facts in this regard because it emphasizes a very important facet. Prior to the passing of this legislation NIM was not in a position to grant undergraduate bursaries. There were only two applications from Blacks, but both applications were in fact for undergraduate bursaries, which we were not in a position to grant. NIM has therefore in reality received no applications from non-Whites for post-graduate bursaries. There were two applications from Indians for bursaries for post-graduate study in engineering; but those applications had to be referred to other bodies because NIM has nothing to do with civil engineering.</p>

<p>The object of the amendment which is now being proposed is that it will also be possible to grant undergraduate bursaries. I readily agree with the hon. member that there are some of the Bantu homelands that have considerable mineral deposits which will have to be exploited as rapidly as possible, and for that purpose we shall need trained people. If applications for bursaries for undergraduate study are received, it is quite possible that such applications could be considered, for a non-White student may study in that direction at the University of the Witwatersrand. However, an aspect which will be of great importance in this regard is that it is of no avail granting such a bursary if that person, after having completed his studies, cannot be placed in a suitable post. This is an aspect to which we shall devote careful attention. I want to give the assurance that if such an application were received and the applicant con&#x2019;d be placed in a post in the homelands or elsewhere in South Africa, where his services could be usefully applied, the granting of such bursaries to such persons will be considered with great sympathy. I hope that I have, with this, replied to the hon. members&#x2019; questions.</p>

<p>I am pleased the hon. member for Carletonville has asked that question, because it is an important one. The position is that NIM has a mobile unit which travels throughout the country and at schools, etc., informs the children of the possibilities in this regard. This is also publicized over the radio and in the Press in the normal manner, in the same way as other bursaries are also advertised. As it happens in general there are many bursaries available in South Africa which are publicized in this normal manner, but in which the necessary interest is not displayed. Everything is being done to publicize the bursaries as widely as possible. I think that after my explanation this afternoon members of the House of Assembly will also help to publicize these bursaries and perhaps this will contribute to there being greater interest in future.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have already said that if NIM were to receive such an application from a student, it would be considered sympathetically, for the necessary facilities to receive instruction in that direction already exist at our universities. Therefore there is no problem in that regard. Where the problem really lies, as I have already said, is that one has to ensure that one can offer that person a good post in the homelands, otherwise one has to place him in a position which is unsatisfactory and unfair. NIM has discussed this matter with me at length. They are sympathetic and I am sympathetic and the country needs these people. The homelands also need these people, but we cannot rush in precipitately. We must act realistically in this respect. To date we have received no applications from any non-White which could be considered. If we were to receive <span class="col_3073-3074" refersTo="page_1552"/>one, we would be able to take this action in respect of it. The hon. member has asked me now whether, if such an application were to be made, we would allow such a person to work in the laboratory of an industry in the private sector. I do not have the final say in that regard. If we look at this matter realistically, as I told the hon. member we would do if we received applications, then it would depend on whether that industry has an opening or on whether that industry is able to offer the necessary facilities, and whether the laboratory has an opening for such a person, etc. This is in fact the kind of matter to which NIM would have to give urgent attention, if it were to receive such an application. I shall tell them that this is how they should deal with the matter and that they should prove to me that such a person is not going to be led into a blind alley, so that he can subsequently turn around and say that we had deceived him. You know what will follow from that: Only that which causes bad relations. If they can convince me that it will be possible for such a person to be employed in such a laboratory and that he can be accommodated, then we shall consider this matter very sympathetically. However, there must be no doubt about one thing, namely that this country needs these people for the homelands and for other circumstances. We do not want to discourage this, we want to encourage it.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The objects of the Gold Mines Assistance Act, which was placed on the Statute Book in 1968, have for the most part been achieved, but it has nevertheless become necessary to effect a few minor changes in the Act, in order to rectify troublesome deficiencies which have come to light. It is a well-known fact that this short, but important, measure was approved with the full support of the opposite side of the House at that time, and we can be very proud today of what has been achieved by this legislation, for not only have quite a number of our gold mines, which had been eking out a bare existence on account of the fixed gold price, been saved from certain disaster because of the timeous assistance they received from this Government, but these same mines are responsible for a considerable percentage of our gold production today and are at present, together with the other wealthier gold mines, lending tremendous impetus to our economy.</p>

<p>In order to present hon. members with the present picture in regard to the question of State assistance for the mines in question, I may mention that while, in respect of the financial year 1971-&#x2019;72, there were more than 20 mines to which a total amount of more than R16 million was paid in terms of the assistance scheme, we only budgeted for an amount of R2,228 million in respect of the 1974-&#x2019;75 financial year in the expectation that only about four mines may ask for further assistance despite the higher sold price. Three of the anticipated four mines submitted claims for a total of R1,2 million in State assistance during the 1974-&#x2019;75 financial year. There has therefore been a considerable decrease in applications for State assistance.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances it might sound strange that we want to amend the Act now that the objects of the Act have been achieved to such a great extent, and the question may well be asked whether the Act should not be repealed now. In this connection, however, I want to say that <span class="col_3075-3076" refersTo="page_1553"/>thorough consideration has been given to this matter, but in view of the world situation in general and the uncertain international monetary position, it is not deemed advisable to repeal the Act at this stage.</p>

<p>It is my considered opinion that, as an alternative, it would be a more sensible approach to declassify as assisted mines those gold mines which are classified as assisted mines under the Act, but in respect of which no further State assistance can any longer be justified because of relevant factors such as the higher gold price, the nature and extent of the ore reserves of the relevant mine, and so on. Herein, Mr. Speaker, lies the first problem because in terms of section 2(5) of the Act, which provides for the declassification of a mine as an assisted gold mine, the relevant mine may only be so declassified if the Government Mining Engineer reports that in his opinion the quantity of gold and/or uranium won or likely to be won from such assisted gold mine is or will be insufficient to warrant such mine continuing to be classified as an assisted gold mine.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This narrow provision means in effect that those mines which have phased themselves out of State assistance and which are no longer in need of such assistance, cannot, as the law now stands, be declassified as assisted mines. This could naturally also open the door to some of the classified mines following mining practices which would result in marginal profits or working losses, thereby enabling them to claim further State assistance. Another consideration is that it would be rather questionable procedure to grant further State assistance to any mine which has, for all practical purposes, exhausted all ore that could be payable, and then expect of the taxpayer to foot the bill merely to enable such a mine to extract sub-marginal ore.</p>

<p>What we are therefore now doing in clause 1 of the Bill, is to widen the scope of section 2(5) of the Act so that any previously assisted mine could be declassified as an assisted mine if, after having considered all the relevant factors, it is clear that the classification of that mine as an assisted mine was no longer warranted. As hon. members will note from the proposed amendment, we will in this be acting with the usual circumspection in that the Government Mining Engineer will be required to report fully on any particular mine, whereafter the Minister of Mines will only be able to act in consultation with the Minister of Finance and with due regard to any recommendation by the Minning Leases Board which, as is generally known, is a highly responsible statutory body appointed under the Mining Rights Act, 1967.</p>

<p>In dealing briefly with clause 2 of the Bill, I wish to point out that although, with the present fluidity in international conditions, it cannot be said how many&#x2014; if any&#x2014;of the previously assisted mines will retain the status of classified mines, it is conceivable that any mine which does retain this classification may, with the present high price of gold on the free market &#x2014;which makes it possible to exploit lower-grade ore on an economic basis&#x2014;wish to embark on a major expansion programme. Such a programme could require large capital expenditure and it may result in the mine receiving financial assistance from the State. Some time ago my department faced the possibility of such an application and although the Act in question was neither designed nor intended for State assistance in the case of large expansion programmes by assisted mines, the Government could legally speaking be moving on thin ice if, under the gold mines assistance scheme, it were to disallow deductions for capital expenditure incurred in connection with such an expansion scheme.</p>

<p>In this connection, paragraph (i) of the proviso to subsection (2) (a) of section 6 of the Act merely stipulates that, in determining the mining profit of an assisted gold mine, no deduction shall be made in respect of expenditure incurred on a project which, in the opinion of the Government Mining Engineer, will not benefit the production of gold or uranium. It goes without saying that in the case of a large expansion programme initiated by any assisted mine, it would hardly be possible to say that the project would not benefit the production of gold or uranium. We are therefore making use of this opportunity to make an addition to paragraph (i) of the proviso referred to, in terms of which deductions by an assisted mine would only be permissible in respect of capital expended on developing any new or additional mining area or for any extension to the existing mine workings if the project had been approved by the Government Mining Engineer. I think that is very fair indeed and I have the support of the responsible bodies in this regard.</p>

<p><span class="col_3077-3078" refersTo="page_1554"/>*As I have indicated, the few statutory amendments we want to effect here, have a dual purpose, i.e. to exclude from the relevant assistance scheme such classified mines in respect of which no further State assistance could be warranted on logical grounds, and to prevent, in statutory terms any mine or mines which retain the classification of an assisted mine in the interim from acting in such a manner and submitting such claims or claiming such deductions which are in conflict with the objects of this legislation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker again I am glad to assure the hon. the Minister that we find the amendment which he proposes, to be reasonable. It is one which was decided upon in consultation with the mining industry for it is known to be generally acceptable to the Chamber of Mines.</p>

<p>I believe that it is commonly agreed that the advances made in the gold mining industry of South Africa have changed the entire picture. The Gold Mines Assistance Act of 1968 was passed at a time when the cost of milling and extracting gold from the ore was rising at a rate which was entirely inconsistent with the fixed price of the product. The time clearly came when it was necessary, with a view to the future, to give some assistance to those mines which had substantial ore bodies or substantial reserves of gold but which were unable in the economic circumstances of the time to operate the mines as payable propositions. That foresight has paid off and South Africa has benefited a great deal by the assistance given to those mines in their hour of need. One would be inclined to assume from the dramatic change in the price of gold that the Gold Mines Assistance Act would hardly be needed, if at all, in the present situation. We are, however, persuaded by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reasoning that instead of merely repealing the Gold Mines Assistance Act it would be more orderly to make some provision for the de-escalation of the kind of assistance that is given and to keep the Act in operation in case there might be some later change in the present situation. We have no quarrel with the provisions of section 2(5) as amended by this Bill. I would, however, ask the hon. the Minister if he will explain why it was also thought necessary to remove the onus from the Government Mining Engineer who was in a position to recommend to the Minister or, in fact, to require of him that he should not act unless a recommendation had been made. To put it more succinctly, the Minister was not entitled to move in terms of the original legislation unless the Government Mining Engineer made a recommendation to him. The Minister may now act <i>suo monu, he</i> may take it upon himself to consult the Government Mining Engineer but he need not necessarily take his advice. I think I have understood this correctly and I would like the hon. the Minister to explain why it is that, in the amendment to subsection (5) the onus has been shifted from the Government Mining Engineer to the Minister.</p>

<p>We agree with the new criteria which have been set. In fact, it is only reasonable that in considering whether or not a mine is entitled to assistance, regard should be had not only to the quantity of gold or uranium which it is able to produce but also to the quantities and grades of the ores being mined and their relation to the quantity of gold produced.</p>

<p>As regards clause 2 of the Bill, again we find nothing unreasonable about this and we shall therefore be happy to support the Second Reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we in these benches will also support this Bill. In the light of what has been said by the hon. member for Von Brandis I shall be brief.</p>

<p>I think it is important to remember that in effect we really have two gold-mining industries in South Africa at this point in time: We have a marginal one, which is marginal even at the present price of gold, and then we have the other half of the industry which is making very substantial profits because of the much richer grade ore. I hope that the hon. the Minister will in connection with this legislation give us a certain assurance which we would certainly appreciate. The assistance already given has proved to be in the interests of the country and has benefited the country because, whilst the rising price of gold over the past two to three years has kept mines in production, these mines might otherwise have ceased to operate. The whole tenor of this legislation, to which we have no objection whatsoever, is to give powers to the Government Mining Engineer and to the Minister in certain circumstances to take mines out of the category of mines which are classified as requiring assistance. In <span class="col_3079-3080" refersTo="page_1555"/>these circumstances, where we have a volatile price of gold over which we have no control, I would like the hon. the Minister to give us the assurance that he himself and that the Government Mining Engineer will also bear in mind that that situation can change very rapidly and that, consequently, the Government will look at this matter from the same point of view as it has done in the past, where reasonable, and on the basis of available evidence. If the price of gold was for instance to drop by 40 dollars, a number of the present gold-mines in this country would be in very serious financial trouble. What is more, such circumstances may prevail either for a comparatively short period of time or for a slightly longer period of time. That is why we are asking the hon. the Minister to give the assurance that this Government will indeed look at the situation from the same point of view as it has done in the past because of the importance of gold to this country. Naturally the gold-mining industry will have no objection to mines which can stand on their own feet ceasing to be assisted, but the obverse side of the coin is naturally that we hope that, while it is not set out in this particular Bill, the Minister will continue to assist those mines when, as a result of the volatile gold price, temporary assistance may be required.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to convey gratitude and appreciation to hon. members of the Opposition parties for their support of this Bill. It is once again proof of the fact that, as far as the technical matters are concerned which are really in the interests of the country, we usually enjoy the full support of this House. I think this is a splendid gesture and I appreciate it every much indeed.</p>

<p>I should like to inform the House that the assistance which this Government has rendered to marginal mines through the years, amounted to R60 634 million during the period 1968-&#x2019;75 During this period 717 732.3 kilogram of gold to the value of R992 142 million was produced. During this same period the mines concerned paid an amount of approximately R16 million to the State in mining tax. It is perhaps a good thing on this occasion that this House and the country take note of this fact. If ever there was a sound investment, an investment backed by confidence&#x2014;at that stage it did not amount to a business transaction; the gold price was very low&#x2014;it was this one. At that time the Government, with the support of everyone, said that it would assist these gold mines. An amount of R60 million was paid out in respect of this assistance. During the period 1968-&#x2019;75 the mines produced gold to the value of R992,142 million. To my mind this is an excellent achievement. In this connection an amount of R16 million has accrued to the State in respect of tax alone.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to two questions which have been put to me. If I interpret the question which the hon. member for Von Brandis has put to me correctly, the position, according to my interpretation of the provisions of clause 5, remains the same. This is in any case the intention. The position must remain unchanged, i.e. that the Minister of Mines will not take any action without his being in possession of a report submitted by the Government Mining Engineer. The proposed new subsection (5) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and having regard to any recommendations of the Mining Leases Board made after considering the report by the Government Mining Engineer in regard to &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then it goes further. Whatever the intention may be in a case of this nature, I can give the hon. member for Von Brandis the assurance that no action will be taken by the Minister of Mines&#x2014;this is the practice as I found it in the department and, as I understand, this has been the practice since the establishment of the Department of Mines&#x2014;without referring the matter to the Government Mining Engineer or without such a matter being thoroughly investigated. This procedure will be applied in future as well. I can give the hon. member for Von Brandis this assurance.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Johannesburg North asked me to give him the assurance that against the background of the volatile price of gold which could change very rapidly&#x2014;it could happen overnight&#x2014;where reasonable, the Government would continue to assist the marginal mines. Mr. Speaker, I wish to give the hon. member and this House the absolute assurance that it is the intention of the Government to proceed along those lines. That is the reason why I mentioned the figures that I did mention at the beginning of my reply to this debate. I wanted to indicate how profitable <span class="col_3081-3082" refersTo="page_1556"/>it was and how wise that step was. After that experience why should we act in any other way in the future? Therefore I can give the hon. member the absolute assurance that the Government will continue to act along these lines.</p>

<p>*I can also tell the hon. member that I am personally very sensitive about this matter. Last year, even before the commencement of the short session, I was approached by my department and the Government Mining Engineer and asked to introduce this amending Bill. However, at that stage I was afraid that the introduction of such an amending Bill might possibly have the effect of creating uncertainty in the gold mining industry, and that is why I refused to introduce this amending Bill at that stage. I said that we should continue as we had done in the past and even if this were to entail a slight loss&#x2014;at that stage it seemed as if the amount would be insignificant&#x2014;it would be better to incur this risk rather than create uncertainty. It was only after a reasonable amount of stability had developed in this matter and after I have had the opportunity of discussing the matter with the mines concerned and became convinced that it would not have such an effect, that I felt myself at liberty to submit this Bill to this House today. The Bill was introduced late, and the reason for it was that I wanted to hold certain consultations before introducing the Bill here.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in connection with clause 1, which relates to section 2(5) of the Gold Mines Assistance Act, the hon. the Minister has given us the assurance that he does not intend any departure from the old method of consultation with the Government Mining Engineer before he takes the action contemplated in this clause. Sir, in order that the Minister&#x2019;s assurance should be a valid one, it is also necessary that the Minister should agree that his powers under this clause have been changed, and I am not satisfied that the Minister has accepted that. If one looks at the original Act, one finds that if the Government Mining Engineer reports, the Minister may then notify the currently operating mine that the mine will with effect from a certain date cease to be classified. In other words, he may act if the Government Mining Engineer reports. He cannot act unless the Government Mining Engineer reports. In terms of the amendment, the Minister may now act, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, after considering a report; he may then immediately notify the company after considering a report that from a certain date it will cease to be classified. In other words, he is no longer prohibited from acting unless he has a report to that effect from the Government Mining Engineer. On his own initiative, after consulting the Government Mining Engineer and accepting or rejecting his advice, he may notify the company of his own decision. Sir, there is a shift of emphasis; there is a shift of authority from the Government Mining Engineer, who under the old Act was in a position to notify the Minister or not and thereby inhibit the Minister from acting or not; whereas now the Minister may on his own intiative seek the advice of the Government Mining Engineer and then proceed to notify the mine. Sir, I accept that the hon. the Minister has no intention whatsoever&#x2014;he has given that assurance&#x2014; of taking the initiative himself in declaring a certain mine to be disqualified for assistance and that he will certainly take into account the advice of the Government Mining Engineer, who is the person best qualified to judge the situation. But I do feel that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance would be more happily accepted if he were also to admit that there is in fact a shift of emphasis in this amendment to the Act. Apart from that, we have no objection to clause 1.</p>

<p>May I say that this is the first word I have heard since the preparation of this Bill that there is a possibility that these words could be interpreted in such a way that there was a change from the original wording to what it is now. Therefore I can again give the hon. member the assurance that there was no intention on the part of the Government or on the part of the Department of Mines, or on the part of the Government Mining Engineer or of myself, that the wording should now mean that the Minister <span class="col_3083-3084" refersTo="page_1557"/>can act without reference to the Mining Engineer. It would be absolutely foolish for a Minister to try to act in such a technical situation without a report from the Mining Engineer at his disposal. I should like to agree with the hon. member, but I find myself in the position where I cannot agree with him because the original wording says that the Minister may if the Government Mining Engineer reports, etc., do certain things, and it now reads that the Minister may do certain things after considering a report by the Government Mining Engineer. This to my way of thinking&#x2014;and that was certainly also the intention of the department&#x2014;creates exactly the same position as before, namely that the Minister cannot act unless there is a report by the Government Mining Engineer. The reason why there seems to be this little bit of misunderstanding between the hon. member and myself is that the beginning of the sentence in the original Act is not printed here in the draft Bill. That is why the hon. member does not interpret these words as I understand them.</p>

<p>*Therefore I want to give the hon. member the absolute assurance that this is the position, but I shall go further and take the matter up with the law advisers, after we have piloted this Bill through. If there is in fact a difference, the intention being that there should be no difference whatsoever, I shall effect an amendment in the Other Place to the satisfaction of the hon. member. There is in point of fact no difference of opinion between us, except that I do not think it necessary, while the hon. member does think it necessary, but if the law advisers agree with him, I shall effect the amendment in the Other Place.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill seeks to amend section 46 of the Co-operative Societies Act. This amendment has been necessitated by a difference in the English and Afrikaans versions of the section, a difference which has now come to light.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, this section entitles members of co-operatives to examine and inspect the books of account of their co-operatives. Since co-operatives, as business undertakings, must sometimes prevent confidential matters being made public by members, the Act recognizes the principle that a co-operative may, at a general meeting of members, impose restrictions on the power of members to inspect the books of account. According to the English version, which is the signed version and is therefore decisive, these restrictions apply erroneously to the periods within which the books of account may be inspected by members.</p>

<p>It is therefore being proposed that the section be amended so that a co-operative may, without any doubt, impose reasonable restrictions on the powers of members to inspect books of account.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister tried to create the impression that this amendment Bill is of a very minor nature, and that no fundamental changes are in fact being made. However, I think the hon. gentleman was being over-hasty in the way in which he tried to explain this Bill to this House. A fundamental change is in fact being effected in section 46 of the Co-operative Societies Act, 1939. We understand the background against which and the reasons for which subsection (3) of section 46 has to be altered. It is also quite correct that when the Act was originally passed, it was most certainly the intention that the members of a co-operative society were able to decide at a general meeting that there should be certain reasonable restrictions when it came to the inspection of the books of the co-operative <span class="col_3085-3086" refersTo="page_1558"/>society. If this legislation is piloted through without any amendment, I must point out to the hon. the Minister that it will then be almost impossible for a member of a co-operative, if he so prefers, to inspect the books from time to time.</p>

<p>If one were to read the Co-operative Societies Act and interpret it correctly, one would realize that it constitutes exceptional advantages to the farming population, but at the same time a tremendous number of obligations are imposed on a farmer when he becomes a member of a co-operative. He accepts certain responsibilities for the sound management and administration of the co-operative of which he is a member. That responsibility rests not only on the directors, but also on the ordinary members of the co-operative. I believe that it is true in the case of many farmers to say that they are intensely interested in the co-operative in which they are members.</p>

<p>The farmers in South Africa today are no longer the farmers of bygone days, who had to rely on other persons to tell them what a balance sheet or the operating liabilities or the operating costs of a co-operative meant. Our farmers have made considerable progress in the interim, and consequently I would not find it at all strange if a farmer were to display the necessary interest in his co-operative which markets his produce, is of great service to him and even helps him to obtain his means of production. If the Bill is passed as it reads at present, it will become more difficult for a person to inspect the books in terms of the proposed section 46(3).</p>

<p>The hon. Minister knows that there was a recent court case. I am not prepared to mention names, but we know that certain officials refused to allow farmers to inspect the books of a co-operative. As a result of that refusal application was made to the court to the effect that the farmers should in fact be entitled to inspect the accounts and books of the co-operative.</p>

<p>That is quite correct; it was only one farmer. However, I want to advance another argument Some of the strongest co-operatives in South Africa have existed for many years, and I think that they have always allowed a farmer, within reasonable limits, to investigate the management of the organization, the control of the organization, the soundness of the organization, and so on. The strongest co-operatives exist, and since the Act came into operation in 1939 it has never been necessary to come to this House and to ask for such steps to be taken as those set out in paragraph (b).</p>

<p>Yes, the restrictions which will now come into operation. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that we are prepared to support him in the Second Reading. We do not want to oppose this because we think that principles of democracy are involved in this Bill. What it amounts to is that the co-operative may, through its members, adopt a resolution which is a reasonable one. They may adopt a resolution to impose reasonable restrictions as far as the inspection of the books of account are concerned. However, if the Bill is passed without the addition of a proviso of some kind, the farmers who are members of a co-operative&#x2014;and particularly because of the proxy system&#x2014;may convene and impose restrictions which could make it almost impossible for a person&#x2014;while this principle is contained in paragraph (a) and a person has this right &#x2014;to inspect those books. I wish to point out the following words to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">impose &#x2026; reasonable restrictions relating to the nature of the books that may be inspected, or relating to those books in any other respect.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister mentioned that they would not like to make confidential information public, information which could prejudice such a co-operative and, directly and indirectly, the members themselves. That is correct; one would hot like to make public the information which rivals and opponents would use to influence the marketing of a farmer&#x2019;s produce.</p>

<p>On the other hand there exists today the situation of the Wool Commission. The entire world knows what the position on the wool market is. The entire world knows how many bales of wool the Wool Commission must purchase; the entire world knows what the position in Australia and New Zealand is. It is not always to the detriment of a certain farmer if certain information leaks out and becomes public. <span class="col_3087-3088" refersTo="page_1559"/>However, there are certain things which are necessary. For example no one wants a member of a co-operative to be able to discover what the financial position of A or B is, when the latter are members of that co-operative. It has nothing to do with the other members. The point of departure of any person who wants to inspect the books of a co-operative is usually to find out how that co-operative is being controlled and administered He is not interested in information which is of a confidential nature, and which affects members of the co-operative themselves. But he should in fact be able to judge whether the institution is being soundly managed, since he has certain obligations under the provisions of the Co-operative Societies Act. Even if a member has resigned from a co-operative and that co-operative finds itself in financial difficulties, he is still responsible for the debts of the co-operative which were incurred before he resigned. Does the hon. gentleman know that this is a provision of the Co-operative Societies Act? If a person has any suspicion that his co-operative&#x2019;s affairs are not being managed on a sound basis, he is obliged to ascertain what the position is, and he can help the management and the directors to take steps to ensure that that institution is again placed on a sound footing. There are many examples of co-operatives which for a long time experienced financial and marketing difficulties. At one stage the hon. the Minister himself was the chairman of a co-operative which passed through a very difficult time. That co-operative has made a strong recovery. Suppose that hon. gentleman was not prepared to take his fellow-members into his confidence and tell them that steps should be taken to straighten out the affairs of that co-operative again. But this could be done because the farmers were at liberty, in terms of section 46, to ascertain precisely what the situation in their institutions was.</p>

<p>In what way does this amendment impose restrictions in regard to this matter?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased the hon. gentleman asked that question. I want to tell him what we want to propose in the Committee Stage, so that the hon. gentleman may know about it. There should be a proviso at the end of paragraph (d). That proviso should read more or less as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that no restriction is imposed in respect of books of first entry, all ledgers including nominal, debit and credit ledgers, and all books, documents and other papers which are regarded as being books of first entry.</block>

<p>If this proviso is not there, it becomes fundamentally impossible to discover what the position in a co-operative is. What then is the intention of paragraph (a), which grants the right to carry out an inspection to ascertain what the actual situation is? I do not think this proviso will throw open the doors, thus enabling people to discover all kinds of secrets. It will afford that person who is honest and sincere in regard to his own institution the opportunity of ascertaining on an honest basis how that organization is being controlled and managed.</p>

<p>However, we support the Second Reading of this Bill because as I have said it was most certainly the intention of the legislature in 1939 that reasonable restrictions could in fact be imposed by the members themselves. It was certainly not their intention that members could go so far as to virtually close the doors to any form of inspection. This amendment, which we wish to propose during the Committee Stage, is also in accordance with what was said last year in the court case by a chartered accountant. They understand what is meant by the definition of a books of accounts of a co-operative. For that reason I feel that our amendment will be in accordance with common practice. People will then understand what it means to inspect the books of account of a company or a co-operative.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as was clearly apparent from the Second Reading speech made by the hon. the Minister, a technical problem arose in regard to the text of the Act. The result has been that the books of every co-operative in South Africa are open to inspection by any member of a co-operative who wishes to see them. This technical problem arose as a result of a court judgment. It is therefore imperative that this problem be rectified, for it could cause individual members of co-operatives acute embarrassment. It is also very important to note the position of co-operatives as they have developed during the past 36 years&#x2014;since <span class="col_3089-3090" refersTo="page_1560"/>the principal Act was passed. There are cases of co-operatives which have as many as 10 000 and 15 000 members. I even know of co-operatives which have up to 16 000 members. In other words, every farmer and every person practising agriculture in a region in which a certain cooperative is established is virtually a member of that co-operative. Even part-time farmers are members of that co-operative. In other words, we can adopt the standpoint that everyone in a rural region who participates in any way in the co-operative movement, is a member of a specific co-operative. The position is that every member may now insist on inspecting the books of the co-operative, which, as the hon. member for Newton Park said, could create acute embarrassment. However, the hon. member then went on to raise arguments which to my mind sounded contradictory. He agreed that it could create embarrassment for a co-operative if its books were open to all and sundry, but at the same time he said that the amendment of this clause would to a certain extent cause the books of the co-operative to be closed again.</p>

<p>In other words, as far as the hon. member is concerned the books of the cooperative are not yet open enough. The hon. member therefore wants to cause the co-operatives even further embarrassment than we have recently been experiencing.</p>

<p>Subsections 3(a) and (b) are also contradictory. We should rectify this as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>If the proposed paragraph, (b) had formed part of section 46(3) of the principal Act, very few co-operatives would have made use of it because the individual members normally take very little interest in the books of a co-operative and because they not only have every confidence in their directors, but they themselves appoint an auditor every&#x2019; year at the members&#x2019; meeting. The directors do not appoint an auditor; he is appointed by the members. Once the members have appointed the auditor, he still has to be approved by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. Section 43 of the principal Act also determines what reports the auditor should furnish at the annual meeting of the members. Section 43(14) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The auditor shall make a report to the members of the society or company on the accounts examined by him and on the statements mentioned in section <i>forty-five &#x2026;</i></block>

<p>And then the section specifies the statements which shall be mentioned in the report. The report must state whether the auditor has received all the information and a comprehensive explanation. In addition it has to be stated in the report, and I quote paragraph (d)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether, in his opinion, the statements mentioned in section <i>forty-five</i> and referred to in the report are properly drawn up so as to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the society or company according to the information at his disposal and explanations given to him and as shown by the books of the society or company;</block>

<p>Paragraph (e) provides that the report should also state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether the regulations of the society or company have been observed;</block>

<p>In other words, the auditor even examines the statutes of the co-operatives. This is the guarantee of the members of the co-operative. In other words, the members are in any case, apart from this provision, able to inspect the books through the agency of the auditor appointed by them. Perhaps I should also mention that the members themselves, and not the directors, determine the fee which shall be paid to the auditor. In other words, the auditor&#x2019;s association with the members is very strong because the members have the power to determine his fee. In view of the provisions of this section it is certainly not necessary to open the books of a co-operative to á greater extent than is the case at present in terms of the provisions of this section. I believe that this provision was introduced in 1939 because in 1939&#x2014;this is a very old Act&#x2014;we had the position that there were a considerable number of unlimited co-operatives. This is my personal opinion. The liability of the member of a co-operative was therefore unlimited. I think that, as a' result, it was made doubly certain that this right would be granted to a member, for a member of the co-operative knows that if things go wrong in his co-operative, his entire farming practice could be involved in the process. Today, however, there are very few co-operatives <span class="col_3091-3092" refersTo="page_1561"/>of this type left in South Africa. The liability of the members of co-operatives is limited today, as in the case of a public company. In terms of the Companies Act only the directors of a co-operative have that right; I do not think that ordinary shareholders have the right to pry into the books of a company. Because these people are business-orientated, and geared to business practice, they will certainly not allow any Tom, Dick or Harry to pry into their books. I also think that our co-operatives today are sufficiently modernized in the business world to be able to act in a completely sophisticated manner. Consequently our members are completely satisfied with the position.</p>

<p>As I have said, the Co-operative Societies Act is an old Act, and it is probably necessary to reconsider it. I want to allege that these particular provisions are obsolete, and that we should reconsider them. We shall have to see whether it is in fact necessary to grant members of co-operative societies this kind of right, since co-operatives have now developed to such an extent that the section which I quoted creates proper and sufficient guarantees for its members. I think that we shall have to take another look at the principle of affording members this kind say.</p>

<p>If the Cooperative Societies Act is reconsidered, and additional provisions could be introduced in all the relevant sections in regard to the rights of auditors, I do not see why precisely such a provision should again be included in the new Act if the old Act has been redrafted. In other words, the principles contained here could be replaced by other measures. This provision is very unpractical. It could create problems in practice. Mention has <i>inter alia</i> been made of &#x201C;reasonable restrictions&#x201D;. What are &#x201C;reasonable restrictions&#x201D;? That is an open question; it is a relative concept. In other words, one could encounter adversity and problems all over again, which could possibly cause the co-operative movement great embarrassment</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bethal has just said that, as far as he is concerned, he will be completely satisfied if the right which members of co-operative societies have to go through the books, were to be taken away. I think I am interpreting him correctly in saying that. He alleges that co-operatives have made so much progress that if there is an auditor who checks the books of the co-operative properly and reports on them, it is no longer necessary for members of the co-operative society to have the right of inspecting the books. I think that I have understood him correctly. I am very sorry to hear that from the hon. member because the co-operative movement is a much larger one than the hon. member for Bethal thinks.</p>

<p>Co-operatives do not only deal with the type of product which the hon. member for Bethal markets, but with many other matters in the life of our community. In the case of our country, the life of a co-operative is actually part of the life of our country and of our people. Therefore we must be very careful if we are going to tamper with them, especially if we want to do so in the way which the hon. member for Bethal suggests. He suggests that we take away the right of a member to inspect the books in which he has an interest. That right has existed for many years. This Co-operative Societies Act was passed at a time when the Companies Act already existed. As far as I can remember, that Companies Act never granted the shareholder of a company the right to inspect the books. From the beginning and in spite of the fact that a shareholder did not have the right in terms of the Companies Act to inspect the books, this right was granted to members of co-operatives and I think for a very good reason. One of the duties of co-operatives in our national economy today, is to market. Today there are many sorts of one channel marketing schemes. Co-operatives are the instruments which allow these schemes to succeed. Suppose there is a co-operative which is the one channel marketing agent for more than one product. Suppose as well that those products are complete diverse in nature. Suppose that one is dried fruit and the other skins. There is a big difference between the marketing of dried <span class="col_3093-3094" refersTo="page_1562"/>fruit and the marketing of skins. The only point of similarity between the two is that both are dry&#x2014;the skins are dry and the fruit are dry. I just hope that this debate is not dry as well! The fact is that when there is more than one interest involved in the marketing of a product, the members must be able to inspect the books. If the members are not able to inspect the books, how do they know whether one of the products which is marketed is being marketed at a loss and the other product at a profit?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. G. WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>A little later. How are they to know whether the one product is not feeding on the other? I have gone through the books of many co-operatives and I have also gone through the balance sheets, financial statements, etc., of co-operatives. I am also a member of a considerable number of co-operatives. I must say that the audited accounts of the co-operatives of which I am a member, give no indication of which of the products which I do not supply myself, is actually being sold at a profit and which products are being sold at a loss. When I look at those statements, I do not know whether my product is selling so profitably that it is bearing all the costs of the co-operative. It is very important that I should know this. Consequently I ask my co-operative to let me inspect those books. I want to know what is happening to the skins and the dried fruit. I want to know exactly how much money is being spent in respect of dried fruit and in respect of skins. I want to look at all those books, and it is only after I have examined those books that I shall know whether my dried fruit are really showing a profit or a loss. Then I am in the posit: on to go to the annual general meeting and to say to the meeting that I am dissatisfied, because my product, dried fruit, is selling at a tremendous profit, while the skins are selling at a loss, and that I am getting a lot less for my product than I should get, because the full cost of the co-operation has to be borne by my product. Why should I bear the loss on the skins? It is very unfair. Where only one product is being sold or processed, or where all the members of the co-operative produce the same product, I can see that it is unnecessary because then statements will show everything which the members would like to know. I think, for example, of milk. No member will make any objection to the accounts of a milk cooperative, because it is the only product which the co-operative sells, and the members can see everything they want to know in the annual statement. It is when more than one product is being sold by a cooperative that the difficulty arises. I think, Sir, that it will be a big mistake to introduce this restriction into the Act, because we say that the annual general meeting may decide about the nature of the books which may be inspected. Let us suppose that at the annual general meeting there are representatives of the skin producers and of the dried fruit producers, but that the skin producers number 2 000 and the dried fruit producers only 100. It will be extremely difficult for the dried fruit producers to prevent the meeting, which is packed full of skin producers, from deciding that they are no longer going to allow the books of original entry and the different ledgers, etc., which the dried fruit producers would like to see, to be inspected by them. That is unfair. Sir, I know that the hon. member for Bethal is the chairman of a very good cooperative and I know that matters are handled very well there, but what would happen at an annual general meeting, if he and other members who produce the same product, were in the minority? In the first place, he would not be elected chairman. In the second place, he would never get an opportunity to inspect the books, because the producers of other products, who are in the majority, would not want him to see what poor business was being done in connection with the other products. That is the crux of the matter. We are going to provide here that the annual general meeting may decide. There are many co-operatives who process or market or process and market a variety of products. In those circumstances, there are many interests which are not the same. Not only are there interests which are not the same, but perhaps a much larger number of members who have a lesser interest in the operating results of the co-operative than members who have a real interest in these. There might be a small group of men&#x2014;perhaps 20 or 30&#x2014; who supply a product to the co-operative on which the co-operative makes a tremendously big profit. What chance does that handful of people have to inspect the books? Sir, do you know what they will have to do? They will have to go the Minister. The Minister does not know what he is letting himself in for with this amendment. Now <span class="col_3095-3096" refersTo="page_1563"/>they will have to go to the Minister and tell him they want an investigation. How many investigations can there be? In every case of a co-operative producing and marketing a variety of products, they will ask for an investigation. Will the Minister be able to refuse it? No, he will not be able to refuse. Then there will be a great waste of time and labour and hours and hours will be spent quite unnecessarily on ensuring that justice is being done to these people. And yet it is so easy to remedy the matter here. I can see that there is a difference between the English and the Afrikaans versions of this Act. However, I say that if we improve it, let us improve it in such a way that it will at least be a reasonable improvement. When I see what the hon. member for Newton Park wants to move in the Committee Stage, then I must say that it is extremely fair. We shall be giving the annual general meeting the right to decide whether the inspection of the books will be restricted or not. We shall also be giving them the right to say that this sort of book may be inspected in these circumstances and that sort of book in those circumstances, but we shall be telling them that they may not say at the annual general meeting that books of original entry, the ledger and the nominal ledger, and all original documents which serve as books of original entry &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not say contracts as well, but I say that if there is no other method of using a book of original entry to record an amount in the ledger, except by a document, then that document must be there. And perhaps there might be other records as well which can serve as a book of original entry. Then the member must have the opportunity to see that book. This is not unreasonable and it satisfies everybody. Then those people who are in the minority, cannot complain to the Minister and ask him to institute an inspection because they cannot get anywhere in regard to what is happening at their cooperative, although it might seem to them, for instance, that the skins division of their co-operative is completely bankrupt or that the dried fruit division in which they are interested, is in a very profitable position as a result of which they want certain adjustments to be made in the control of this co-operative or in the running of this co-operative&#x2014;for example, that levies be imposed on the skins, or something like that, so that those skins are not sold at a loss to the co-operative. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I do not want to become technical about this piece of legislation. I know that the hon. the Minister would like to have this legislation on the Statute Book, but I do not think that the Minister understands the implications of what we have been saying here now. He probably understands now, but he probably did not understand when he introduced the Second Reading of this Bill. I believe it is a very simple matter. Everybody will be satisfied. We are quite prepared to come to the assistance of co-operatives. We believe they they are entitled to assistance and we should like to assist them as far as we can. However, we believe that we have to be fair, and we cannot be fair unless we have some sort of restriction on the restrictive practice which the annual general meeting of a co-operative society can bring about by means of an ordinary resolution. I believe that the suggestion which we make is a sound one, viz. to add a proviso to paragraph (b) to the effect that no restrictions shall be imposed in respect of books of original entry or ledgers, including nominal and debit and credit ledgers, and all books, documents or other records which are regarded as books of original entry. I cannot believe that any co-operative society is going to feel in the least bit affronted if we pass the legislation with this proviso added. Then at least they will have the opportunity of taking this decision and they know before taking the decision that they can bring about restrictions save and except these specific restrictions which we say they cannot bring about.</p>

<p>Coming back to the question raised by the hon. member for Bethal, I do not believe that there is any member of a co-operative society who wants to do what the hon. member for Bethal says such a member may do, viz. scratch around in the books in order to try to find some information about his fellow members. I do not believe that there is any member of a co-operative society who would like to do that. If there is a <span class="col_3097-3098" refersTo="page_1564"/>member who would want to do that, then I believe it can be made difficult enough for that member without specific legislation in that regard. I say that the legislation with the amendment which we intend moving in the Committee Stage is going to make matters very much easier for co-operative societies and I believe that they will welcome it. I do not think that there can be any justification for any hon. member on the other side of the House to say that we do not want to support the legislation. We are quite prepared to support it. We believe it is reasonable legislation and we support it subject to only this proviso. I think this is a reasonable proviso, as I have said before, and I believe it should be part and parcel of this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#badenhorst">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Wynberg made a statement in his speech which, to my mind, amounts to an indirect charge against the board of directors of a co-operative. He asked in what way a member of a co-operative could ascertain whether one division of a co-operative was not feeding on another division. I do not know how the hon. member&#x2019;s co-operative operates, but I want to refer him to ours, the co-operative which was involved in the court case, viz. the Klein Karoo-landboukoöperasie at Oudtshoorn. Before every annual general meeting the financial statements, which give a full account of the business done by each division in the previous year, are open to inspection. In addition to that, there is the certificate of the auditor, and every auditor who is worth his salt will report to the members if there is a division which shows a loss. Then he will recommend that attention be given to such a division. This is what is done at our co-operative. I remember that during our latest annual general meeting, mention was made of a division which was not profitable and attention was then given to that division</p>

<p>With the best will in the world I cannot agree with the hon. member for Newton Park who alleged that this change was an essential one. This change does not affect the essence of the Act. Nor does it affect the court judgment, of which the hon. member made mention, in any way. We must agree on this, because I believe that we should not like to prejudice our co-operatives and see law reports every day in which our co-operatives are involved. However, at the moment we are dealing with a situation which is totally uncertain. Everyone will agree that it is very clear that the English and the Afrikaans versions of the Act concerned are in conflict. The Afrikaans version indicates that restrictions may be imposed as to which books may be inspected. The English version, on the other hand, indicates that restrictions may be imposed in respect of the times at which the books may be inspected. When this case was before the Cape Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Steyn pronounced judgment in favour of the applicant, because the English version was the signed and the valid one. You will agree with me that it is nonsensical to make this Act refer to hours. There have always been fixed office hours. I do not believe that people had different office hours in 1936-&#x2019;39 from those which we have today and they certainly did not work longer hours than we work today. The intention of the legislators of that time was therefore, that it should refer to account books. Now, the judge said in his judgment that the legal provision concerned could give rise to problems in practice.</p>

<p>That is precisely what I want to advocate, because in <span class="col_3099-3100" refersTo="page_1565"/>this amendment, the principle of democracy is built in and completely safeguarded. What are we dealing with here? Here it is said that the annual general meeting may decide. What does the annual general meeting consist of? It consists of the legal members of that co-operative. The hon. member for Newton Park has an objection to the proxy system. I know that there is an objection, but if a member of a cooperative does not want to take the trouble to attend the annual general meeting and if he wants to sign his vote away and not come and exercise it there, surely he does not take an active interest in his cooperative. It is members themselves who are able to determine what restrictions there will be on the account books. In other words, this is purely a recognition of the right of members. After all, measures have that right in the election of the directors. Who elects the directors? The same members who elect the directors will now have the right to impose restrictions on the account books. These are the same members who appoint the auditor during the annual general meeting of the co-operative. In other words, we want to take away the right of the members of the co-operative so that they cannot decide what restrictions will be imposed on the account books.</p>

In the same way, we shall not be able to walk into a co-operative and say that we want to see all the books.

<p>There is also business which is done in the interests of all the members. The directors of a cooperative are farmers themselves, after all, and the business which is done, is also in their interests. Will they do business which will have repercussions for them and which will be to their own detriment? In other words, I want to advocate that certain business of the co-operative should be protected and the members of the co-operative must be able to decide about this at an annual general meeting. Any co-operative or society has confidential information. If a member were to obtain the full right to page through all books, documents and invoices, surely confidential information would be out on the streets before long. I believe members have a right to protection. There has to be a proviso and that is what we find built into this Bill. However, I believe that this matter can be solved very easily. The hon. member for Wynberg referred to skins. I do not know what sort of skins they have in Wynberg.</p>

<p>We have many skins in Oudtshoorn, and there have been oblique references to those skins. I know there are members who feel that more could be obtained abroad for those skins, but I have confidence in the board of directors of that co-operative and I trust that they will obtain the best price for their members in order to see that their members make the greatest possible profit. I do not think we should fight here this afternoon about co-operatives and boards of directors. We must have confidence in them and we must accept that the members and the board of directors will give their co-operation on both sides so that our cooperatives may operate as they did in the past, i.e. in the interests of their members and in the interests of our farmers. I think we all have the highest praise for our cooperatives and for what they have already done for agriculture in general. Therefore, I support this Bill wholeheartedly and I believe that as it stands at the moment, we will not have problems in the future if boards of directors do what is expected of them and the members also make their contributions.</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to steer this debate on a slightly different course. I should like to deal specifically with the question of distinguishing, firstly, between shareholders in a company and members of a co-operative, because I believe the same principles cannot apply to both. What is important is that we do not want a situation in terms of which anyone <span class="col_3101-3102" refersTo="page_1566"/>can scratch around in the books in order to find information which is not of benefit to him but which he can use in order to embarrass other people. I think the hon. the Minister should have another look at section 45 because in terms of section 45 the accounts of the company are to be in a form to be prescribed by him. I think that what has been prescribed in terms of co-operative societies is somewhat out of date in relation to modern developments in accounting. I think the hon. the Minister will know what has now been prescribed for companies as such. To my mind, part of the remedy lies, perhaps, in making more accounting information available to the members of a co-operative society. I also believe that if there is to be a restriction on what should or should not be made available, the hon. the Minister could, if he wanted to go further than that, prescribe by regulation what cannot be withheld from members. That would, in fact, solve the problem in relevant circumstances. I for one believe that whereas members of a co-operative society are entitled to information which relate to their participation in that co-operative society, they are not entitled to go beyond this and embark on a kind of hunting operation and poke their noses into the affairs of other people.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville said that cooperatives differed from companies. If one looks at the Companies Act, one finds that shareholders have no right to go through the books. They only have the right to see the annual statements, the reports and interim reports of the directors. Therefore I think one has to see whether there is a difference between a member of a co-operative and the shareholder of a company. I want to agree with the hon. member for Newton Park. A member of a co-operative possibly has more responsibility towards his co-operative than a shareholder has towards his company, because he is voluntarily a member of that co-operative and because he is sometimes obliged, for example, in terms of the one-channel system, to sell through that co-operative. Therefore I want to agree with the hon. member for Newton Park that a member of a co-operative possibly has that obligation.</p>
