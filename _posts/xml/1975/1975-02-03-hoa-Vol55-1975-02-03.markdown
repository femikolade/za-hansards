<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, while sincerely commending the objectives of achieving détente in Southern Africa, has no confidence in the Government, <i>inter alia,</i> because of the Government&#x2019;s failure to appreciate adequately that in the interests of mutual understanding, peace and security in the region it is necessary, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></block>

</ol>

<p>Before speaking directly to the motion, I want to congratulate the hon. the Prime Minister on the reshuffle in his Cabinet which I see has strengthened it because he has brought into it yet another defector from this side of the House. What the hon. gentleman would do without new blood from this side from time to time to raise the efficiency of his Cabinet is something <span class="col_17-18" refersTo="page_0024"/>which is too appalling even to contemplate.</p>

<p>I should also like to address a few words to the hon. the Minister of Finance, the former Leader of the House, whom I had hoped would be here this afternoon and who I understand will make his last speech in this House &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately he will not be here today.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman will not be here. Nevertheless, in his absence, since this will probably be the last occasion on which I shall have the opportunity of speaking while he is still a member of this House, I want to say that I understand that he is a favoured aspirant for higher honours and that he will be making his final speech in this House here in a day or two. He and I have been members of this House for very nearly 27 years and during that period I have found that unlike most people who have an obsession with gold and with money, he is a very friendly person indeed. I have always found him to be a very polite person, a very charming person and one who has earned many friends on both sides of the House and no enemies. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we want to wish him luck in any office to which he may be elected and to say that we feel that he has great talent which can be put to singular use in the interests of the country.</p>

<p>I want to return now to the hon. the Prime Minister and I want to start by commending him once again this afternoon. I want to commend him for certain enlightened and constructive actions he has taken which have contributed to an easing in the strained relations in Southern Africa and have created a more hopeful international climate for the solution of some of the difficulties which have threatened peace and progress in this region of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Last year in a speech in the Other Place, the hon. the Prime Minister emphasized that the choice before Southern Africa was essentially a choice between the creation of a new era of peaceful co-operation and goodwill or continual confrontation the eventual consequence of which he said, and I quote, &#x201C;were too ghastly to contemplate&#x201D;. I agree with the hon. gentleman that that is the fundamental choice, that that is the grim alternative. I think too that that is the essence of the message which we on this side of the House have tried to convey to the House and to the country ever since the breakdown of Portuguese authority in Angola and in Mozambique. We have gone further. It has been our consistent theme for many years that South Africa has the means, the opportunity and the inducement to become the great catalyst in the emergence of this important region of the world, Southern Africa, and, in so doing, I believe that we could play the role destined for us in Africa. We have pointed out, too, Mr. Speaker, that some of the very problems that have seemed to the Government to be major obstacles to the fruitful development of our domestic and external policies, in fact can be converted into major assets and without insuperable difficulty either. For instance, Sir, in the Censure debate last August, I pointed particularly to the possibilities and advantages of an early breakthrough in respect of the political, economic and social status of the Coloured people; I also made mention of the possibilities of a speedy solution of the perennial conflict over South West Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, whilst I want to give the hon. the Prime Minister credit for whatever progress he has achieved, I think it is obvious that he has gone neither as far nor as fast as we would have liked &#x2026;</p>

<from><span class="col_19-20" refersTo="page_0025"/>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I will explain to the hon. the Prime Minister very shortly in what role I see myself and I believe that he will agree with me. Sir, I quite understand that the Government and the Prime Minister would like to take all the credit for any progress that has been made in achieving the relaxation of any tensions, and I want to say that I do not begrudge them that at all because I feel that any progress they have made has been made through following, however hesitantly and inadequately, the policies which we on this side of the House had advocated for some time in various debates. The hon. the Prime Minister has asked in what role I see myself. The role in which I see myself and the Opposition in our relationship with the Government reminds me of the relationship between a pathfinder squadron and a bomber squadron. The pathfinder squadron identifies the target and lays a flare path to serve as a clear guide to the ultimate destination of the bomber squadron. When the flares are almost extinguished, the heavy bombers of the Government arrive, often too late to identify the objective accurately, and as a result drop their explosives in the general direction of the target, sometimes without achieving what it set out to do.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He is the bomber.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>After all, Sir, he is the bomber. Mr. Speaker, yesterday that target might have been restrictions on White investments in Black areas; today it may be restrictions on attendance at the Nico Malan theatre; tomorrow it may be the role that the urban Bantu has to play in the future industrial development of South Africa; but, Sir, there is no doubt whatever that we have identified the targets; we have placed the flare path; we have done what we could to enable the Government to reach its mark. I accept, Sir, that this Government, ponderous as it is, weighed down by dogmas as it is, needs a pathfinder squadron and a flare path. I think it needs them particularly at this point of time in our history because there are at least two respects in which Government policy is so inadequate as to warrant fully this motion of no confidence, even if there were no other reasons for it, which there are. The first is that this Government in its approach to the new situation in Southern Africa has, I believe, failed to grasp the essential nature of the problem, or to envisage the full range of opportunities that lie before South Africa in the present circumstances.</p>

<p>The second reason, Sir, is that these opportunities cannot be grasped and exploited unless the Government recognizes the urgent need to eliminate the weaknesses in its own domestic policies and to make fundamental changes in the political philosophy which causes them. Those are the two fatal impediments to the emergence of a Greater South Africa at the present time. Sir, I believe, as I have always believed, that South Africa has a major role to play in Africa and a major role to play in the world. It has great human and natural resources and I believe that it cannot evade those roles because they are inherent in the situation as it is developing at the present time. If we do not succeed in Africa, then we will not succeed in protecting South Africa. Conversely, if we do not succeed in South Africa, we will not succeed in Southern Africa. I think it amounts to this, that if we do not succeed in Southern Africa and cannot save South Africa, then we face what the Prime Minister has called a future that is &#x201C;too ghastly to contemplate&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir. I have on various occasions in this House drawn attention to what I believe is one of the fundamental elements that lies at the heart of the matter and that is the question of our own population explosion here in South Africa. We believe that it is going to double in the next 25 years to 50 million people, and that means quadrupling our domestic economy in that same period. Sir, this is a mammoth economic task, but it must be achieved, because if we fall far short of it, our people will join the ranks of the hungry nations of the world. Unless we succeed we cannot help our neighbours either, and if our neighbours do not become prosperous nations, there is no real security for us in our sub-continent. Sir, I have pointed out before that in order to reach the high levels of production needed to serve and supply our own 50 million people, we shall need something like 5 million people in the highly skilled professions and trades. Even if our White population can by then fill as many as 2 million of these jobs, it means <span class="col_21-22" refersTo="page_0026"/>that there will still be 3 million to be drawn for those highly skilled professions and trades from our own Black and Brown people. It means also that we are going to have to put at least 10 million more people into fully productive employment at other levels, and these are going to be drawn, in essence, from our Black and Brown populations. Sir, that is the size of the task that must be accomplished within the lifespan of most of the members of this House. I wonder, Sir, whether hon. members have considered what an economic change of this magnitude must have on the social structure of this country, and I wonder if they realize what effect these social changes will in turn have on the political structure of this country. I do not believe that these changes, which I regard as inevitable, can be accommodated within Government policies, and I shall show why later on. For the present I just want to draw attention to the kind of country we are becoming and our corresponding responsibilities and opportunities on this subcontinent.</p>

<p>I think South Africa already has the potential to play a constructive part in bringing peace and stability to what I call Capricorn Africa. By &#x201C;Capricorn Africa&#x201D; I mean an area roughly a thousand miles north and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, a community of countries north and south of the Tropic of Capricorn which runs roughly through South West Africa, through Botswana, through the Northern Transvaal, Mozambique and Madagascar. I believe that this is a responsibility which we have to accomplish. What has happened in recent months and in recent years has made it clear that within Capricorn Africa we are going to be forced to share a mutual prosperity and a joint security and an indivisible peace. We are going to be so tied up with each other that one will not have peace without the others having it too, one will not have security without the others having it and one will not have prosperity without the others having it. If we do not achieve those things, then as the Prime Minister says, there is a dire alternative for South Africa. These are problems, Sir, which cannot be solved by individual countries acting in isolation. Some of them may even be matters which are in serious dispute between the various countries concerned but they could be settled by cooperative action and regional alliances covering that sort of thing. Let me illustrate by giving instances of what I mean.</p>

<p>Last year I spoke in this House on new sources and methods of subversive warfare and of the particular dangers they present to South Africa. I believe our basic vulnerability remains where I said it was then. It remains in the hearts and the minds of an alienated people, people whose aspirations are frustrated, people whose loyalties are rejected. Fortunately the immediate threat from outside has been diminished by a degree of detente within our region. At the same time I pointed out that Mozambique was an area of sensitivity. Previous development of inter-regional benefits, of labour relations, port and railway facilities, tourism, investments, the Cabora Bassa hydro-electric plan would, I thought, have a stabilizing effect on the relations between Mozambique and South Africa. This, Sir, apparently has been the case. I want to say that we thoroughly approve what has been done by this Government and others in that regard. But I mention this merely as an illustration of what should be worked upon in a more deliberate and more constructive manner throughout what I call Capricorn Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, we have consistently presented this case on a broader basis and we have drawn attention to many other points of mutual advantages and opportunities for reciprocal aid. I believe that this sort of arrangement holds the key to our future peace and our progress in this part of Africa. I want to look at a few examples so that hon. members can get an idea of what I mean. There is a particular aspect of our inter-relationship within Capricorn Africa that is assuming ever greater importance in our economic progress but which already has critical political implications. That is the question of the migration of labour. Hon. members know that for historic and for other reasons the economic developments on our sub-continent have been uneven, and that has led to the permanence of periodic migration of hundreds of thousands of work seekers from their tribal homes to the industrial areas. The most important example is the mining industry, but of course there are others as well. Last year I think there were 475 000 foreign migrant labourers working in South Africa of whom the mines employed 303 000. The others must have been employed in other industries. Naturally these figures do not include workers from the South African homelands. Now, we cannot at present exclude this labour. It would do us untold economic harm and it would do our neighbour States <span class="col_23-24" refersTo="page_0027"/>untold economic harm. But for various reasons, I believe unconnected with labour conditions in the mining industry, migrant labour has acquired a stigma throughout South Africa and throughout the world of which the social and political' repercussions may disrupt political relationships both within South Africa and within Southern Africa.</p>

<p>I believe that the time has come for an inter-governmental convention whereby the essential conditions of service of the migrant worker can be guaranteed and the status of this form of employment raised to a level that will ensure universal respect. When I talk about the migrant worker in Africa I am talking not only about the Black migrant worker; I am talking also about the security of the White migrant technician and the White migrant investor as well. Since last year, by a remarkable reversal of the Government&#x2019;s former policy of disallowing private White investment in the homelands, it now appears that such private White investment is to be encouraged. We saw that that would come. I predict that the time will also come when the Government will admit the impossibility of consolidating the homelands by the purchase of land and the exchange of land. I believe that before long it will be drawing jurisdictional and territorial boundaries which will result in White farms and White villages being included in Black-governed areas. That means that there will be White minorities in Black homelands, and this whole position will become relevant in South Africa as well.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister shakes his head. Let us look at what is going to happen in South West Africa then. If that territory proceeds through self-determination to independence as an integral geographical unit, which is quite likely to be the case since the Government continues to reject the federal solution offered by this side of the House, what is going to be the position of the White minority in South West Africa? It is going to be essential that they continue to play their part for the progress and stability of South West Africa. What is going to be the sort of question the Whites are going to be asking there? They will want assurances about their personal status, about their private property rights and about their investments and their future in the country. They will want to know what to do with their children, whether to train them to take up technical and other posts in that territory. All these things are necessary if an independent South West Africa is to continue as a viable and stable country with close reciprocal trade and other relationships with South Africa.</p>

<p>Let us look a little further afield. Let us look at the countries to the north of us. A number of them are already being governed by Black majority Governments. It seems that Angola and Mozambique are going to join that number before long. There is tremendous pressure on Rhodesia for the same sort of thing to happen. I do not want to make any predictions there; that is a matter for Rhodesia to solve itself, but I do want to point to one conclusion that I think concerns the whole of Capricorn Africa. That conclusion is that we are all of us destined to seek a peaceful future together. We are inevitably going to live and work in each other&#x2019;s countries. We are going to have to provide each other with skills on the one side and labour on the other and we are going to have to develop by our combined effort those resources which are essential to our common welfare. I believe that this is a basic reality of co-existence on this continent. Now, as this is a necessity, if we could get a Capricorn convention guaranteeing the basic rights of Black migrant workers in White-governed areas and of White migrants in Black-governed areas, we would surely have established a firm foundation of confidence in a vital area of our future relationships. If, moreover, this concept could be further extended by treaty or by general acceptance to guarantee the social and economic security of all Whites who are in an overall minority throughout the area, surely that would smooth the path toward further constitutional adjustments either in South Africa. South West Africa or the countries to the north of us. I have spoken of a treaty, of general acceptance guaranteed by permanent reciprocal advantage. It may be that such an agreement should be formalized in a convention of human rights particularly designed to meet the special needs of Capricorn Africa, because, after all, there are a number of minority groups whose rights and whose security could be guaranteed by a convention of that kind. I have an open mind about the sort of agreement, but I have no doubt that the time has come for positive action in this important but vulnerable area of our relations in Southern Africa. That is one example, but let me give hon. members another example.</p>

<p><span class="col_25-26" refersTo="page_0028"/>Let us look at the position in respect of transport. Some 30 years ago an imaginative initiative was taken to create an African Transport Organization. South Africa played a leading part in it and Mr. Marshall Clark who was then, I think, the General Manager of the Railways, was its first chairman. Its purpose was to plan and to develop a co-ordinated transport system that would solve the problems of the landlocked countries, that would stimulate commerce and create a network of interdependence throughout the region. If that great project had come to fruition under this Government we would perhaps not have seen the building of the Tan-Zam Railway under Chinese communist auspices. We might have seen interdependence through trade and the elimination of many of the threats and hostilities from which we are today seeking detente. We know that transport services in Southern Africa are hopelessly inadequate for the task of developing the economies and of stimulating and consolidating the interdependence of Southern Africa. Our own railway and port system can barely deal with the base load it has to carry for South Africa and at peak times they have to resort to the most desperate expendients. I think it deserves all credit for what it does, but we are in a very dangerous situation indeed. What is going to happen if Rhodesia is suddenly denied access to all the east coast ports? Can we meet that demand? What is going to happen if there is a breakdown between Zambia and Botswana or between the copperbelt and Angola? Thirty years ago it was seen clearly that the progress and stability of all the countries of Southern Africa was indivisible and that their mutual prosperity must be stimulated by a carefully planned and co-ordinated transport system. What has happened since then? Is it not time that this Government did something to recover the years the locust has been eating?</p>

<p>I come to a third example, viz. defence. Once there is permanent detente, if such can be achieved, surely there are far better things for our troops to be doing than policing the thousands of miles of border between these various States in Southern Africa. Surely we could effect great economies by mutual agreements. Surely there is a difference between the sort of defence forces we need in respect of border areas and attack or hostilities from outside. Surely there are greater deterrent advantages which could be achieved if we could work together. There are other fields such as economic, educational and technical in which South Africa could take an initiative in assisting our African neighbours. The advantages would be reciprocal, because we are in this position that even if South Africa becomes internally self-sufficient it could never have lasting peace and prosperity if it is inhabiting a hungry sub-continent. The point I want to make is that if like the encroaching desert the hopeless poverty of the Third World creeps across the Capricorn region, South Africa will not be immune from the consequences. At a recent strategy for development conference in Johannesburg particular attention was paid to the problems of the underdeveloped countries of Africa. It was clear that many of them were in urgent need of assistance, but it was also clear that they would not accept assistance unless it avoided all taint of colonialism or neo-colonialism, unless it was designed to assist them to develop their own skills and resources and unless it was fully attuned to their own local abilities and problems. And who, Sir, is better qualified to have care to those things and yet assist in the area of Southern Africa than South Africa? In view of this, should thought not be given to the establishment of a regional industrial development agency, something that could select areas of best economic advantage for the production of commodities, something that can give attention to resolving some of the problems of multiple customs frontiers and the ironing out some of the problems in existing customs unions, a body that could give attention to the planning of the use of scarce resources such as oil and help plan complementary patterns of growth. Just think of the advantage of such an organization operating at the present time in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>One of the biggest fields of opportunity lies in the question of energy. The shortage of oil has complicated matters for all African countries. We have supplies of coal and uranium. The shortage of oil is going to stimulate the rival demand, on the part of power stations and the petro-chemical industry, for the use of the coal which we have available. The economic extractability of uranium is dependent on the future life of the gold mines as we know it. If we take a regional view of the energy position in Southern Africa, we find that there are vast resources of hydro-electric energy. It is estimated already that hydroelectric energy can be produced in the <span class="col_27-28" refersTo="page_0029"/>Zambesi, Kunene, the Shire, the Rovuma, the Rufigi and the Congo Rivers amounting to 40 000 MW, more than three times the installed electrical capacity in South Africa at present. We have great rivers to the north of us, rivers which are great sources of energy, and we have the dry areas in the south which need that energy and that power for their development and for achieving maximum growth and prosperity in the areas concerned. It seems, however, that when we look in retrospect one day, we may feel that Cabora Bassa was just pointing the way. I have furnished a few examples. Surely what we have to work out is a new concept of strategic planning that is going to include all the resources that can be used to further common interests.</p>

<p>We South Africans are indigenous people in Africa. We are forever in and of Africa: that is a legitimate claim. However, I am afraid that is one that will never be fully acknowledged by others unless we play this sort of part in our own region, a part which I believe to be both our opportunity and our obligation. I know what the defence from the Government side will be: I shall be told that I am preaching to the converted; that they have already actively promoted technical co-operation and regional consultation within this strategic area. I shall be referred to soil conservation agreements and to arrangements in respect of tourism, locust and malaria control, and to veterinary assistance. Well, this is true. I am aware also of important links established at both the inter-government level and by private enterprise. But these are nothing like adequate in present circumstances and they are nothing like adequate as a foundation for the future. Time is running out and this Government is sitting there doing virtually nothing about the situation. What I have in mind is a grand strategic design for peace and prosperity, a regional policy far wider in scope and more imaginative in concept than the somewhat formalistic and haphazard activities in which this Government has been engaged. We must develop what we have and it must be made a permanent base of peace and progress in this part of the world. As I have said, the Government&#x2019;s policies have been inadequate and lacking in vision and that is why we have no confidence in them. The Government has failed to realize what the possibilities are and they show no sign of appreciating it even this afternoon. The people of Southern Africa desire peace and security. That has been demonstrated in the manner in which all parties and all sections of the community have endorsed the first visible signs that the hon. the Prime Minister has seen these wider horizons. We, too, were very glad about that and we commend everything that he has done, but we do not believe that he or his Government has grasped the essential nature of the problem or envisaged the full range of the opportunities and responsibilities which lie before us. Look how long this Government has been in power! What progress have we seen in that direction in the 26 or 27 years it has been in power? Hostilities have begun. South African lives are involved. Now the Government is belatedly asking for an overdraft, an extension of time in which to put things right. But the time is expiring, however, and the Government will soon have to start redeeming its promissory note. Because of that it must lay the wider foundations for peace in Capricorn Africa. It also has to recognize that it is not going to succeed unless it eliminates the fundamental weaknesses in its own policies.</p>

<p>The first of these is a matter which has both domestic and international repercussions, namely the position in South West Africa. I have suggested that a rapid and honourable settlement be achieved based on the wishes of all the inhabitants after effective consultation. In the motion of censure which I introduced in this House in August last year, I dealt in some detail with the somewhat unhappy state of our relations with the United Nations Organization in so far as South West Africa was concerned. I am not referring to the irresponsible actions of the General Assembly; I am referring to the views which have been expressed and the votes which were cast by the responsible Western powers in the Security Council. My forecast that things might deteriorate has unfortunately proved to have been well founded. I do not propose to traverse that ground again, but I do want to deal with the question of South West Africa in the regional context, because it is quite clear that further progress towards a relaxation of tension is going to depend very greatly indeed on our ability to achieve a satisfactory solution in South West Africa. Unless rapid advances are made in South West Africa the sort of relaxation of tensions which is taking place may prove to be illusory in Southern Africa. I believe that the attitudes of the countries in Southern Africa towards South <span class="col_29-30" refersTo="page_0030"/>West Africa have a double potential which we must appreciate to the full. The first is that it is going to be difficult to reach any stable solution in South West Africa if that solution is not also accepted by other countries in the region. Conversely, their support and our goodwill can make an important contribution to the achievement of a stable solution. Therefore, the future of South West Africa is inseparably bound up with the pattern of interdependence and co-operation that is essential to the peace in this sub-continent. I believe it is going to evolve as an essential portion of Capricorn Africa, that it will achieve its proper place within it, and that its future security will be guaranteed by it. As I have said before, at the moment it is a diplomatic liability but I believe it can be converted into a major diplomatic asset. It has been suggested that the solution must be found within South West Africa itself. Of course, that is quite right; history has shown that you will never get a lasting solution when such a solution has been forced on people. It will have to be something the people themselves choose. If that is so, all options should be open to them whether they want a unitary State, a federal State or separate development. That does not mean for one moment that South Africa has no further obligations in the matter. Surely, it is not realistic to suggest, as some Nationalist spokesmen and some members of the United Nations seem to be suggesting, that South Africa and the United Nations should now become disinterested spectators of the process towards self-determination and independence. To put it at its very lowest, the Government cannot abandon its responsibility to ensure that there are adequate consultative bodies in South West Africa and a full and fair opportunity to examine those options. I endorse the suggestion that the people of South West Africa must decide, but let us look at the hard facts: South West Africa is an underpopulated country, it covers a vast area, its population is scattered and consists of people with different degrees of political development. Those tendencies are being, shall I say, accentuated because of the implementation of the Odendaal Report and the activities of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The hard fact is that it is utterly unrealistic to feel that those people must be left on their own to find their way back and to find a solution for themselves. This comes at a time when the policies of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development are being carried out there in full, when there is a Minister in the Cabinet who comes from South West Africa and leads the Nationalist Party there and who has collective responsibility with the Government, when proclamation R.17 of 1972 still inhibits free political expression in the interest of internal order, and when in countless other ways the policies and administration of the Territory are still subject to direction from Pretoria.</p>

<p>In all these circumstances I think the first and most depressing phenomenon is the unwillingness or inability of the hon. the Prime Minister to give a clear lead as to what the policy of the Government and his party is in that respect. Surely he realizes that rapid and decisive political progress is an essential cornerstone of that policy of detente for which he has received so much anticipatory approval. Surely the hon. the Prime Minister realizes that a solution in South West Africa cannot merely be a fortuitous consequence but is in fact an essential pre-condition of the restoration of goodwill and co-operation in Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister has been very reticent but his Ministers have not been so reticent about what their policy is in respect of South West Africa. Their interpretations are so much at variance that it would seem to me they compel the Prime Minister to intervene in the interests of clarity alone. The hon. the Minister of Community Development stands by the principle &#x201C;dat die Blanke nie sy soewereiniteit sal deel nie &#x2026; die Nasionale Party-hoofbestuur het gesê dat die Nasionale Party sal sy standpunt stel en dit is sy standpunt&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The leader of the Executive Council in South West Africa states on the other hand that the Legislative Assembly will represent the views of all the White voters in the Territory. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs declared unequivocally at Warmbad that &#x201C;Suidwes-Afrika sal &#x2019;n Blanke-land wees&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration in the White Paper accompanying his Bill for the Promotion of Self-government of the Native Peoples of South West Africa said that future constitutional development would be &#x201C;net soos in Suid-<span class="col_31-32" refersTo="page_0031"/>Afrika&#x201D;. Well, where are we? Then you have the Commissioner-General of Owambo. He proposed a White State with a federal system for the non-Whites. Then we had the hon. the Minister of Agriculture on 1 April. The questions and answers were carefully preserved for posterity on tape.</p>

<block name="quote">Question: It (the Waldheim Report) also states&#x2014;the Prime Minister also said so&#x2014;that the inhabitants of this area will decide for themselves. Is that correct?</block>

<block name="quote">Answer: Of course, on 24 April.</block>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, in such confusion I think there is a real responsibility on the hon. the Prime Minister to give us an idea of what exactly the situation is. I want to say that what he said so far is utterly inadequate. I cannot accept it and I cannot condone his inactivity because rapid progress in South West Africa is an indispensable precondition to real and lasting détente in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>There is just one more matter in respect of South West Africa that I must raise, and that is the participation of the United Party in South West Africa and the contribution it wishes to make by putting forward a constructive solution on federal lines. The hon. the Prime Minister has himself declared that federation is one of the possibilities. I believe it is possibly the most satisfactory possibility. The Government gave the United Nations the formal assurance on 30 April that all political parties would have full and free participation in the process that would lead to self-determination and independence. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed in Geneva that the South African Government acknowledges and accepts, subject to the requirements of public security, the need for freedom of speech, freedom of political activity, including the holding of public meetings in the process that would lead to self-determination. Now, what has happened? First it seems that the hon. the Prime Minister has abdicated his responsibilities in this regard to certain members of the Executive Committee in South West Africa. Secondly, the leader of the Nationalist Party in South West Africa declared that the White opposition parties should make their proposals to members of the Executive Council or to him personally. Thirdly, there was the summary rejection of the request by the former leader of the United Party in South West Africa that in these circumstances the Nationalist Party must be prepared to present the alternatives to the other population groups. Fourthly, there was the warning by the leader of the Nationalist Party that non-White leaders should not allow the White opposition to ride on their back in achieving their own political objectives.</p>

<p>Now, what is the situation? I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister quite clearly that as far as we are concerned we do not believe that the leader of the Nationalist Party in South West Africa or the members of the Executive Committee are fit and proper persons to negotiate the federal concept with the other population groups in South West Africa. The United Party in South West Africa may be a minority party; it may not have representation in the Legislative Assembly, but it has 30% of the votes, which means support from a population group greater than that of some of the homelands and there is no doubt that the federal idea is gaining support. Sir, I do not quite know what is amusing hon. members opposite, perhaps I could be let into the joke. I want to put to the hon. the Prime Minister this afternoon what I feel is a perfectly logical and <span class="col_33-34" refersTo="page_0032"/>reasonable demand, consistent with the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s own undertaking, and that is that these scandalous attempts to exclude the White Opposition from participation in shaping the future of South West Africa should now cease. I believe the Opposition has a right to play its proper part in the political process that is going to lead to self-determination and eventual independence. I can give the corresponding assurance, which I believe would hardly be seriously questioned, not even by the leader of the Nationalist Party in South West Africa, that the United Party there will make a contribution fully consistent with the importance and urgency of the situation. I therefore ask the hon. the Prime Minister to give me an assurance in the course of this debate that the rights of the Opposition will be recognized in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have stated the case for a more purposeful and constructive regional policy that could create a solid bastion of peace and progress in Capricorn Africa. I have spoken of the need to deal more urgently and realistically with the situation in South West Africa and to envisage that territory as a positive element within the broad regional structure.</p>

<p>I come now, Sir, to the third and vitally important requirement for the achievement of détente in Southern Africa, and that is the strengthening of the position of South Africa itself by resolving its human relations within South Africa as it stands. I want to say that unless the Government does this, it is never going to be able to negotiate on behalf of a people truly united to that end to break down the wall of prejudice and hostility which separates us from people who should be our friends. In these regards the most fundamental requirement, I think, is real and visible evidence that the Government is moving to eradicate institutionalized inequality in South Africa itself. We know that the hon. the Prime Minister has taken some important new initiatives abroad. He has done so by virtue of an extension of credit granted him, and by the acceptance of his personal undertakings and the undertakings of his ambassadors abroad that it is his Government&#x2019;s unconditional attitude that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It does not approve of discrimination based purely on race or colour. Discrimination because of the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin cannot be defended, and we shall do all in our power to move away from discrimination on a racial basis. It cannot, however, be done overnight.</block>

<p>This, Sir, is a promissory note that must be redeemed. The United States Ambassador said subsequently (U.S. Information Newsletter 6.11.&#x2019;74) that the triple veto against South Africa&#x2019;s expulsion had not been cast in exchange for specific promises, but he went on to add this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe action must now reflect the rhetoric emitted by the South African Government. The question of expulsion will certainly arise at some time again in the future, and I imagine that the degree to which South Africa has made meaningful changes will determine the stances that various countries will take.</block>

<p>And of course Sir, an implied condition of detente in Southern Africa is exactly the implementation of this undertaking. I do not believe that specific conditions for the removal of discrimination were laid down or were accepted but I think it is perfectly clear that the expectations of other Governments in this region are the same as they are in New York. It is perfectly clear that that applies also to Black and Brown people wherever they live and work. They are no longer going to be satisfied by the protestations of theorists that race discrimination will be made to disappear through the realization of separate territorial nationhoods.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister has recently taken initiatives which I also commend. He has called meetings of Black leaders, Coloured leaders and Indian leaders. A large number of proposals have been put forward by them and I expect that Parliament will find time to discuss those in detail. But speaking generally I would say that the majority of those proposals were not unreasonable and that their acceptance would have been consistent with the Government&#x2019;s own determination to do away with discrimination on the basis of skin colour and to move away from discrimination on the grounds of race. Now. Sir, with a few exceptions, what happened? The hon. the Prime Minister undertook to have the proposals of the Black leaders considered, discussed or investigated. What has been the reaction of the Black leaders?</p>

<p>&#x201C;We have very little news to take home&#x201D;, said Dr. Phatudi, the Chief Minister of Lebowa, after the meeting. &#x201C;We expected <span class="col_35-36" refersTo="page_0033"/>a bit more meat on those dry bones&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Chief Gatsha Buthelezi said, amongst other things, that it was time &#x201C;to deliver the goods&#x201D; if disaster was to be avoided in South Africa. Prof. Ntsanwisi, the Chief Minister of Gazankulu, said that minor changes were insufficient, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A meaningful settlement in Southern Africa would require changes in South Africa itself, otherwise Mr. Vorster will be settling other peoples&#x2019; problems and leaving his own unsolved.</block>

<p>In the case of the meetings with the Coloured and Indian leaders it would seem that a few more specific concessions were made and the reaction was correspondingly better. But the hon the Prime Minister must be under no illusions. Symbolic gestures, however welcome, will not meet the real needs of these people. The opening of the Nico Malan Theatre to all races, welcome as it is, and much as I welcome it, is a case in point. In this regard I want to quote the words, not of a Black man or of a Brown man, but of a good Nationalist supporter of the hon. the Prime Minister, the Cape M.E.C. Mr. Frans Conradie, who is reported to have said, after referring to what he described as &#x201C;the pathological resistance&#x201D; to amenities for Coloureds, even when they were planned on a strict apartheid basis&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It can be put even more strongly. In the light of this new attitude which the Nico Malan decision has made possible, resistance to such separate facilities becomes a blatant absurdity, a charge against us, and it puts a question mark behind our good intentions, in spite of the Nico Malan sop to the conscience.</block>

<p>I want to take it a little further, Sir. There was a letter published in <i>The Argus</i> last week which describes a state of affairs far better than I can ever do. I am only going to read the first and last paragraphs. It is the story of a Black man and his wife who went on a motoring tour along the east coast of the Cape. It is striking evidence of the sort of treatment that is still accorded to educated South Africans of colour. This is what he wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My wife and I recently returned from a most distressing tour of the eastern coast. The reason for the humiliation and frustration we suffered from Mossel Bay to Knysna was the hurtful unfairness of the authorities responsible for providing facilities for Coloured people on a motoring tour.</block>

<p>He then refers to the number of notices forbidding the use of various facilities by them, for example braaivleis facilities, lavatories, hotels, bathing places, various resorts, etc., and continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When will we Black citizens of South Africa be treated as humans? I personally as a Black feel that if the policy of separate development were fairly applied by providing truly equal opportunities for both Black and White, this could really be a land of good hope.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what was the meaning of the statement of the hon. ambassador at the United Nations when this sort of thing is still happening in South Africa at the present time? I want to ask hon. members opposite a question. I want to ask them whether they have ever directed their minds to how the better paid urban Black man can spend his take-home money after he has provided for food and clothing, for amusement and things of that kind. On what does he spend his money? Hon. members opposite are always minimizing the effects of discrimination in South Africa. That Black man cannot buy a better home than his neighbour. He cannot buy a home at all. He cannot invest in industry and commerce as he wishes in areas reasonably under his purview. He cannot spend money on a decent holiday in South Africa if he wants reasonably civilized conditions. If he is rich he has to go overseas in order to enjoy a holiday with civilized amenities. He cannot enjoy the best education at school, cultural activities or even entertainment. He is offered leasehold when in South Africa only freehold can supply for him the basic elements of a capitalist society. He gets no advantage out of the appreciation in value of his home. He cannot bequeath it to his child or his wife and he has no security. In fact, what this Government is doing is this: It is forbidding him, as it forbids us, to contemplate or embrace the tenets of Communism while denying him the alternative advantage of a capitalist state. I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that if meaningful change is to mean anything it must mean getting down to the basic re-orientation of the urban Black man. The Government must <span class="col_37-38" refersTo="page_0034"/>take the lead not only in ending discrimination in the work place but in aiming to create an environment in which all people will live out their lives free from fear of humiliation because of the colour of their skin.</p>

<p>There are other fields too in which action is urgently needed. Hon. members know my views. I have said before there is nothing which symbolizes more pointedly to the Black and the Brown man at home and abroad the attitude of the White man in South Africa to his Black and Brown fellow citizens than those provisions of the Immorality Act dealing with sex across the colour line. And, Mr. Speaker, nothing is more difficult to defend to Black and Brown diplomats and would-be friends c South Africa than just that bit of legislation. Today even the Nationalist Press refuses to defend it. Is it not time it was removed from the Statute Book and ceased to exercise such a disruptive influence on the race relations of our region?</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There are other matters too. There is job reservation, there is home ownership, there is the question of educational facilities, which are the very basis of communication between civilized human beings and which are so blatantly discriminatory and so indefensible that they inevitably disrupt the climate for détente in the whole of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, 1975 is among other things Womens&#x2019; Year. If the Government is concerned about meaningful change, then I would suggest that it considers as a priority the humble and helpless state of the Black woman in South Africa. It would perhaps do more real good than a thousand new committees if it were to help these women better to fulfil the peaceful and civilizing role in family life that should be the priceless contribution of the wife and mother. They can only do it if they are guaranteed certain things. The first is the right to undisturbed family life. The second is the right of a family to own a home. The third is the right of that woman to own or to occupy that home even if widowed, divorced or single. The fourth is adequate education and welfare facilities for her children so that they may be kept off the streets and the family&#x2019;s ambitions for them given a better chance of success. The fifth is adequate educational facilities for herself and the right to job opportunity and advancement, and equal pay for equal work and responsibility. These are five very simple things, the sort of things which are taken for granted in all civilized states outside of the communist countries. But they are of paramount importance to the people whom they affect and their denial is having a most damaging effect on race relations in South Africa. We know this from the consultations which we have been holding with people from different walks of life at all levels. It is because these consultations have made us so acutely conscious of the gaps in understanding the unresolved problems of these people that we have pleaded so earnestly for the establishment of a Council of State, even if it is purely an advisory body, on which all races would be represented. If ever there was a time when the Government needed to be fully informed of the currents of opinion flowing in the ranks of our Black and Brown people it is now. Without détente at home we shall never achieve détente in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has rejected our federal solution.</p>

<p>Is it still your policy?</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It is still my policy and I do not know why the hon. the Prime Minister doubts it. Unlike him I do not change from day to day. I always get suspicious when the hon. the Prime Minister asks me if something is still my policy because that is always the prelude to his taking it over himself. That is what he has been doing with one policy statement after another in the last 25 years. The hon. the Prime Minister has rejected our federal solution involving the sharing of power and responsibility. The majority of the homeland leaders, in their turn and at their own summit meeting, have rejected the ultimate objective of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy, namely independence for the homelands. It would therefore seem that he is on a dead-end road as far as that is concerned. The hon. gentleman has consulted with certain Coloured leaders, but the laudatory remarks for his policy which that consultation earned him must be small consolation when he reflects that those with whom he consulted on the last occasion represent a minority of the elected representatives in the Coloured Representative Council and that the overwhelming <span class="col_39-40" refersTo="page_0035"/>majority of elected representatives totally reject his policy. How impossible is the position going to become when the Coloured Representative Council becomes a completely elected body, which it is going to become fairly soon? How impossible is his position going to be after the next election even when it is not yet fully elected? I see the apprehension on the face of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs. I do not blame him. Even his nominees are not going to have a majority to those who are favouring the Government after the next election. The question I want to ask is whether it is not time that the hon. the Prime Minister start tailoring his policies towards that day when he has a fully elected council which is now not so far away? What is he promising now?&#x2014;Committees for inter-Cabinet consultation with the Coloureds and the Indians. This is a step in the right direction, but when is the hon. the Prime Minister going to grasp the nettle of the political representation of the Coloured and Indian people? He knows and I know that you cannot have two or three sovereign Parliaments within one State. What is his answer going to be? Others on this side will deal with these issues.</p>

<p>There is only one further essential point to which I want to make brief but emphatic reference to complete my argument. It is implicit in all I have said that what has to be achieved can only be achieved on the basis of a South Africa which is economically strong. All we stand for, all we hope for is going to be lost unless we can stop the wasting away of our economic strength through inflation. The country&#x2019;s wealth, its vitality, will wither away unless we can take effective measures to check the disastrous fall in the value of what we earn, save and invest. We wait, the entire country waits, for any positive sign that the Government can furnish a remedy. It seems that we are waiting in vain. All that I have said, concerning the strengthening of our internal position can, I think, be summed up in a single sentence. The strongest weapon we can forge in our own defence, the greatest contribution we can make to détente, is a contented population at home, proof against both the blandishments and threats of the terrorists on our borders and the agitators in our midst. In that this Government has singularly failed to be successful.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is not easy to find the right words to describe the motion before the House. It is certainly most amazing, indeed astounding that the leader of a party which is, as it were, tottering on its last legs&#x2014;I do not have to elaborate on that &#x2014;could have the audacity to propose a motion of no confidence in a Government which is literally riding on the crest of the wave. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was obviously in a dilemma when he had to decide about this motion. Unfortunately I cannot congratulate him on the way in which he tried to extricate himself and his party. Instead of giving full and unconditional credit where credit is due, the motion on the Order Paper does not contain a single word of appreciation for the Government, not even for the Prime Minister. The hon. leader did commend him in a sentence or two, but he spoilt it afterwards by, for instance, using the expression &#x201C;a few miserable signs of success&#x201D;. That is how the motion was published on the Order Paper and how it appeared in the world Press. There was not a single word of appreciation in the motion for what the Prime Minister and the Government have achieved. Imagine, merely a few words of praise for what has already been achieved. Not a single word about the Government&#x2019;s handling of events in Mozambique or about the Prime Minister&#x2019;s role in the developments in Rhodesia. It is unnecessary for me to have to remind the House about the progress that has been made during the last few months, especially since the now historic speech by my leader in the Other Place. Every South African is aware of it and most South Africans, regardless of their political affiliations, appreciate the efforts of the Prime Minister, of the Government and of those in South Africa and outside South Africa who are assisting us. Even the English-language Press in South Africa does not hesitate to acknowledge the important role which the South African Prime Minister has played and which he is continuing to play. Perhaps it is unfair to expect the hon. gentlemen to be influenced by the English-language Press in South Africa. Why then do they not take a look at the overseas Press, including newspapers which have, in the past, been exceedingly critical, if not biased and openly hostile towards the Government of South Africa and its policies? Many of those newspapers do not hesitate to give South Africa all the credit which we deserve.</p>

<p><span class="col_41-42" refersTo="page_0036"/>I will indicate that both the motion and the speech of the leader are not only amazing, but also far-fetched, ill-considered and completely unjustified. The first section dealing with Africa can indeed be described as a chapter of errors.</p>

<p>*It is very clear that the motion as we have it before us is the combined effort of a group of persons who have no idea whatsoever of some of the matters which are mentioned in the motion, of persons who have no idea of what is happening all around them in Southern Africa, and of persons who, willy-nilly, wanted certain subjects incorporated in the motion because it suited their purpose to have them there. As usual the motion we have before us is a very long one, and it covers a very wide field. Two of the three subparagraphs in the motion affect me as Minister of Foreign Affairs, viz. the subparagraph dealing with the South African Government&#x2019;s African policy and the subparagraph dealing with the South West African question. As hon. members heard, four other subjects have been dragged in, viz. human rights, including the rights of minorities and a possible convention in that connection, the elimination of discrimination, race relations and inflation&#x2014;to which reference is also made in the motion. I cannot help feeling that these four additional subjects have, as it were, been dragged in by the hair. They were dragged in in order to be there in case the other ammunition of the United Party runs out or if it should appear in the course of the debate&#x2014;which will soon happen&#x2014;that the Opposition&#x2019;s powder was damp in respect of the Government&#x2019;s African policy and in respect of South West Africa.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I do not intend to deal with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s arguments about discrimination, race relations and inflation &#x2026;</p>

These words could be interpreted to mean or to imply that the South African Government holds itself accountable to the United Nations in matters of domestic concern, in matters of domestic jurisdiction. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition may deny it, but that impression might be created. I wish to state here very clearly that this is not the case. Nothing could be further from the truth. The remarks of our permanent representative in the Security Council on 24 October 1974, which I presume the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had in mind, were merely an explanation of the policy of the South African Government and, I may add, a very clear and correct explanation of our policy.</p>

<p>In this connection the Leader of the Opposition levelled a reproach in respect of the rights of minorities. <i>Inter alia,</i> he wants us to find a solution by means of a convention on human rights. I want to point out that the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development is in fact directed at preventing the domination of one population group by another. This is also the most practical form of protecting human rights. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wishes to deal with the matter on a regional basis, it could amount to, or degenerate into, interference in one another&#x2019;s domestic affairs, and this is definitely one of the greatest evils of international life. I think the hon. the Leader will agree that this opens the door to interference in one another&#x2019;s domestic affairs.</p>

<p>That the motion was not well-considered appears further from the sections on defence and strategic planning. The most encouraging development in Southern Africa lies in the willingness of leaders now sincerely to seek, instead of sterile confrontation, the solution to certain fundamental problems which placed obstacles in the way of co-operation in the past and which still do so today. However, enough has already been said about this. Let us be realistic now. After all, first things come first. Defence and strategic planning fall into the most sensitive sphere of inter-State cooperation. One has to adopt a long course of co-operation in a region before one can <span class="col_43-44" refersTo="page_0037"/>venture into this sphere. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants us to stifle the present healthy development at its birth, he must now insist on agreements in this extremely sensitive sphere. I can give him the assurance that it is not our intention to come forward with such untimely matters at a time when such serious attempts are being made to avoid conflict, but that we must first eliminate those problems which block further development.</p>

<p>As a general principle in this sphere I want to remind hon. members of the willingness of our Prime Minister to conclude non-aggression pacts with all freedom-loving, non-communist States in Africa. I have made that offer repeatedly at the UN, and it still stands today. At the right time the first step in this direction will be taken. When the time is ripe we will in fact hold talks with others in the military sphere. In any case, all the States in Southern Africa know that we are not a threat to anyone, because we do not interfere in their affairs. Sufficient proof of this has been given in practice. Because our neighbouring States have nothing to fear from us in the military sphere they know that they do not have to spend large amounts of money on defence. In this regard I want to reiterate, by way of summary, that we in Southern Africa should concentrate first on the elimination of problems which are conducive to confrontation. We simply must persevere in this, because the alternatives, in the words of the hon. the Prime Minister which were also quoted by the hon. the Leader, are &#x201C;too ghastly to contemplate&#x201D;. Fortunately other leaders in Southern Africa are in agreement with us in this regard, and, practically-speaking, this is the strongest motive behind the détente attempts which are in progress.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as South West Africa is concerned, the Government is being accused in this motion of failing to appreciate that it is necessary to achieve a rapid and honourable settlement of the issue after effective consultation with the inhabitants. But these words sound strange, for this is in fact the policy of the Government, which has already been stated repeatedly and unequivocally. &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; that there is only one solution to the problem of South West Africa, viz.&#x2014;and I am quoting what the hon. the Prime Minister said in his famous speech last October in the Other Place&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;&#x2026; that the peoples of South West Africa be allowed to decide their own future without being hampered or disturbed&#x201D;</block>

<p>Hon. members will be aware that the National Party of South West Africa has taken the initiative in this connection. They took the initiative by resolving last year that positive steps should be taken to encourage and to hold discussions between the various population groups in the territory in order, eventually, to achieve a final agreement on the constitutional future of the territory. Virtually all the population groups reacted favourably to this initiative. To get the exchange of ideas into full swing now, it is necessary for the various population groups to designate their spokesmen for these discussions. At the time when the initiative was announced, the Government of Owambo reacted positively. Before they sent representatives to the talks they wanted to ensure that no one had any doubts whatsoever as to whether or not those representatives represented the Ovambo people. The Ovambo Government repeatedly made it clear that, <i>inter alia,</i> an election was being held to eliminate all doubts as to who the recognized leaders of that people were. The election took place. A high percentage of votes was polled, in spite of attempts to boycott the election. And now, in the words of the Chief Minister of Ovambo, the Ovambos are able to send true representatives to the proposed talks among the various population groups. Other population groups are also engaged in this task, and we wish them success.</p>

<p>But what does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition expect now? He expects us to interfere in the designation of the representatives of the White population. Why? It is because he does not like the representatives who have already been designated in a democratic manner. But surely he should not pick a quarrel with us on that score. He should quarrel with the White population groups of South West Africa who elected those people. The leaders have to be designated. They have already been designated in the case of the Whites, the Ovambos, and others.</p>

<p>We have been devoting attention to the South West African issue for many years. <span class="col_45-46" refersTo="page_0038"/>Everyone who has the true interests of the inhabitants at heart, knows that there are no instant solutions to this difficult issue. Only a well-considered solution which is acceptable to all the population groups has any chance of success. It is a pity the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not indicate precisely what his solution to the matter was. Nor is it for the Government of South Africa to say that a solution to this problem should be found rapidly. However much we would like to find a solution, it is not for us to determine the pace. The sooner the solution is found, the better for all concerned. But in the last resort it is the inhabitants themselves who have to decide at what pace they wish to move towards a final solution, just as it is they and no one else, who have to ensure what the nature of that solution is. Surely to try to create the impression now, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is doing, that we are leaving the inhabitants of the Territory to their fate, to struggle along and muddle through as they please, is totally misleading. We are in constant contact with those people: we are in contact with all the groups. We have permanent representatives there. We are proceeding with the development of the Territory in every possible sphere, including the political sphere. Nevertheless, Sir, I want to repeat that on the basis of new developments in South West Africa, it is the view of this Government that the population of the Territory could reach the stage where it would be prepared to exercise its right of self-determination considerably sooner than the ten years which were envisaged during the contacts with Dr. Waldheim a few years ago. As far as we are concerned, we would of course be ready and eager to render assistance in order to achieve a rapid solution; and what could be more honourable than a solution worked out and accepted by the people who are involved and whose future is determined by it? This much as far as South West Africa is concerned.</p>

<p>As far as South Africa&#x2019;s relations with its neighbouring states are concerned, the Government has, in all the important spheres mentioned in the motion, fulfilled its duty completely and achieved a great deal, as I shall indicate. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition accused the Government of having failed to promote regional initiative by not concluding agreements&#x2014;and I have to assume that he means regional agreements between States &#x2014;and in this connection he referred in the first place to migrant labour. I think it is a pity he made the statement that a stigma attaches to our mine labour. I am certain that South Africa&#x2019;s enemies will seize upon this statement of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and will use it against South Africa. In the same breath I want to put this question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Has he, as Leader of the Opposition, ever done anything to improve the lot of those mineworkers on the Witwatersrand and elsewhere? We, the Government, have in fact done so.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then I am sorry. But, Mr. Speaker, let us ask ourselves this question: Where does our labour come from? Which neighbouring states&#x2019; citizens have in the past come to work in the Republic? The vast majority have come from Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Mozambique and Malawi, and now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is accusing us of not having concluded agreements with those territories. If the accusation was well-grounded, he would have had a very strong case, but what is the true state of affairs? In the case of all the states he mentioned, except one, formal agreements with South Africa are already in existence; I have them here. The only exception is Swaziland, with whom negotiations are in progress, and with whom I hope an agreement will also be concluded in the near future. Take Lesotho. In respect of Lesotho, permanent arrangements concerning the employment of Lesotho citizens coming to the Republic as well as related matters have been in existence since 1963. On 24 August 1973 a formal agreement was signed between our two Governments; I have it here. Apparently the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has not seen it yet. The same applies to Botswana, with which a similar agreement was concluded in December 1973. A like agreement with Malawi, and this ought to interest the hon. member there because it is his field&#x2014;has been in existence since 1967, while a pact with Mozambique, which is still in operation today, was concluded many years ago. We are being accused of not concluding agreements with out neighbouring states on a regional basis. [Interjections.] If you read the motion on the Order Paper you will see it. [Interjections.] <span class="col_47-48" refersTo="page_0039"/>These agreements were no secret. They were announced in public and were published. Is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not aware of them?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>That is not what I was referring to.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Apparently his objection is that these agreements were not concluded on a regional basis. [Interjections.] Surely it is stated thus in the motion. Now is it realistic to expect that South Africa should conclude agreements in regard to labour in Southern Africa on a regional basis, as is being proposed in this motion? In the case of the so-called BSL countries, joint talks were in fact held at one stage, but surely it is quite logical that separate agreements had to be concluded with the States concerned, for the circumstances are different for each neighbouring state, and each state must, after all, look after its own interests. Every agreement which is concluded serves a particular purpose, viz. to arrange certain matters as agreed with that country in question, for the interests of the people in all the neighbouring states do not always correspond. Anyone who has dealt in practice with foreign labour will appreciate that one simply cannot have a fixed pattern with all or conclude a joint agreement with an entire group, as is being advocated by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. As far as migrant labour is concerned, therefore, the argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition falls quite flat.</p>

<p>When we come to transportation and communication between South Africa and our neighbouring states, the accusation is even more antiquated. If one had been listening to the Leader of the Opposition speaking on transportation and communications, one could have thought that South Africa had been totally isolated in that sphere for the past 20 years, and that is not the case at all. In the case of Mozambique an agreement which has been brought up to date from time to time has been in existence since the previous century. The result is that as far as transportation is concerned there is almost daily contact at operational level between South Africa and Mozambique. It is true that new circumstances have recently caused a measure of disruption in respect of railway transportation to and from, and harbour facilities in Lourenço Marques, but we trust that this is of a temporary nature. We on our part are encouraging importers and exporters and shipping lines to make full use of the railway and harbour facilities there. In addition we are trying to eliminate any snags in our joint handling of the operating problems, and the Government hopes that the problems will be ironed out rapidly and that Mozambique will soon be able to handle its normal traffic again. We would definitely welcome this. It is in our interests, and also in their interests, in view of the economic inter-dependence of all of us in Southern Africa. As far as our other neighbouring states are concerned, there is in fact a joint agreement in respect of railway and road transportation. Therefore a joint regional agreement does in fact exist. Apparently the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was not aware of this either. This agreement is incorporated in the Customs Union Agreement which was signed on 11 December 1969 and which superseded the original agreement of 1910. I am referring in particular to articles 15 and 16, which deal specifically with rail and road traffic. In other words, here the matter was in fact dealt with on a regional basis. Further discussions are in progress with Botswana and Lesotho in regard to the possibility of separate road transportation agreements, while the possibility of a rail link between Swaziland and Richards Bay is also being mooted. I assume that it is generally known that a new rail link between the Republic of South Africa and Rhodesia via Beit Bridge was recently constructed. Mr. Sneaker, it is perhaps less generally known that the Republic also has rail links with Zambia and Zaire. As far as air traffic is concerned, the position is also quite satisfactory, for there are regular air services to all adjoining neighbouring states, as well as to Malawi and Angola. Why the Government is being attacked in the case of transportation and communication, and why the image is being created that we are totally isolated in this sphere, is therefore something I quite fail to understand.</p>

<p>The same applies to the accusations in respect of mutual economic and technical aid with a view to the establishment of an economic community for Southern Africa. Far from failure on the part of the Government we have made further progress in this sphere than any other region in the world. If one were to read the customs agreement with our neighbouring Black states one would realize that it creates a <span class="col_49-50" refersTo="page_0040"/>closer economic community than for example the European Economic Community, the so-called E.E.C. in Western Europe. And this customs union is not static. One need only read the preamble to the agreement to realize that its object is in fact to create the most favourable climate possible for development. I want to quote it to the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The Governments concerned recognize that the Customs Agreement concluded on 29 June 1910, as amended from time to time, requires modification to provide for the continuance of the customs union arrangements in the changed circumstances on a basis designed to ensure the continued economic development of the customs union area as a whole, and to ensure in particular that these arrangements encourage the development of the less advanced members of the customs union and the diversification of their economies, and afford to all parties equitable benefits arising from trade among themselves and with other countries.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Perhaps I could also refer here to the monetary agreement between South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland which was concluded last year. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has advocated the establishment of an economic community. As far as this is concerned the Government has already gone as far as is possible under the present circumstances. Of course we also envisage closer co-operation, in the economic sphere, on a regional basis and over a wider field. It is not impossible that an economic community could be established in Southern Africa at a later stage, in which other states as well, which are not at present members of the toll union, could be included. It is even possible that an economic bloc of States with common interests could be formed, States which are interdependent in the economic sphere. Considerable progress has already been made in laying the foundations of such a bloc or community, and we are continually engaged in furthering the building of this bloc. However, one cannot act too rapidly; one cannot proceed precipitately; one should not try to run before one has learnt to walk. There are, for example, obvious reasons why it has not up to now been practicable for us to take pains to include other adjoining neighbouring states in the customs union. Two of them were, until recently, still under the control of a European power. However, what could and had to be done was done without fail, and is constantly being done. After the BSL countries attained their independence the old agreement was superseded by a new one which, as I have indicated, was adapted to the new circumstances. <i>Inter alia,</i> it entailed that the three neighbouring states were assured of a considerable and permanent source of State Revenue which means a very great deal to them.</p>

<p>In addition there is co-operation and assistance on a considerable scale outside the framework of the customs union, both on a bilateral and on a regional basis. One thinks of South African participation, on the part of the private sector as well, in the development of the mineral resources of Botswana. One thinks of the creation of the growth point in Malawi through our participation in the Lilongwe project, and of the construction of the Nacala railway line linking Malawi with the sea, etc. One good example of co-operation on a regional basis is Sartoc, an organization of which the most States in Southern Africa, including Mauritius, are members and which seeks to promote tourism on a regional basis. I may mention in passing that Sartoc held its last meeting in the Republic in 1974. As far as economic cooperation is concerned, therefore, a great deal has already been achieved, and these achievements may not by any means be belittled.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s record in respect of co-operation in the technical-scientific sphere is, if anything, even more impressive than in the economic sphere, for here important regional co-operation is taking place over a considerably wider field. I am thinking in particular of the organization known as Sarccus, in which we cooperate with seven other States in Southern Africa. The object of this organization may interest hon. members, and I just want to quote it briefly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;To promote closer technical co-operation among territories comprising the Southern African region in all matters relating to the control and prevention of soil erosion and the conservation, protection, improvement and rational utilization of the soil, the vegetation and the sources and resources of water supply in the territories concerned &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p><span class="col_51-52" refersTo="page_0041"/>It is therefore a tremendously wide field. In the words of the most recent director of this organization, Prof. Danie Joubert of the University of Pretoria&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;From the outset Sarccus endeavours to concern itself primarily with matters of policy rather than the finer details of problems which crop up.&#x201D;</block>

<p>For this reason the meetings of this important organization are usually attended by those who formulate policy in their respective countries, so that ideas may also be exchanged at the very highest level and decisions may be implemented without delay.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to tire this House with details of technical and economic co-operation. Hon. members who are interested in this would do well to glance at the annual reports of our Department of Agricultural Technical Services. It is very active in Africa. Hon. members would do well to glance at the regular publications of the Africa Institute, and numerous other organizations; they would do well to take the trouble to glance at the trade figures of the Republic of South Africa with Africa. During 1973 our total trade with Africa amounted to R532.7 million. This figure increased to R695 million in 1974, an increase therefore of approximately R162 million, or 30%. This is important if one appreciates that there are States included in this whose political relations with South Africa were less friendly. Surely such an achievement would never have been possible if the Government had been so grossly negligent of its duty in respect of Africa as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has tried to imply.</p>

<p>So I can continue to demolish the arguments of the hon. the Leader one by one, whether or not he finds it pleasant now to listen to this. Let us examine the following accusation. According to him the Government has failed in its duty in respect of cooperation in regard to the use of the energy resources of the region. We have done nothing to warrant the accusation that we have neglected our duty on that score. The hon. Leader did in fact refer indirectly to Cabora Bassa and the Kunene project. Was the hon. the Leader not aware of the formal agreements in this regard which were signed as long ago as 1964 and 1969? The generation and distribution of power requires major capital investment, a fact which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition apparently does not appreciate. Therefore the utilization of the power has to be considerable enough to economically justify its generation and distribution. There is a vast difference in the degree of industrial development between South Africa and most other countries in Southern Africa. This necessitates a particular pattern of co-operation. What this amounts to in practice is that we&#x2014;i.e. the Republic &#x2014;have to buy power from our neighbours. We have to do this particularly at the outset when their own requirements are not yet extensive enough, and this is precisely what will happen in the case of the Kunene and Cabora Bassa schemes. These two schemes have an enormous potential, and for that reason we turned our attention to them first. That was why they were priorities with us. In the meantime we have not been sleeping, for we are, together with other neighbouring states, investigating other schemes. Talks have already commenced with Lesotho in regard to the so-called Malibamatso scheme, previously called the Ox Bow scheme. Talks have also been held with Swaziland in regard to the generation of thermal power by the Government of Swaziland.</p>

<p>I want to dwell for a moment on Cabora Bassa. What influenced the Government in interesting itself in that major scheme? Was it a shortage of power? Was it fear that we would not have sufficient power in future? No, by no means. We acted in that regard in a spirit of co-operation, because we wanted to promote regional development, which the hon. the leader has advocated, for Cabora Bassa is not merely a power generating project. It will in fact be able to provide various neighbouring states as well as our country with power, i.e. the provision of power on a regional basis. However, there is far more than this at stake. The planning covers a far wider sphere. In this way, for example, it creates the potential for irrigation and development of the extensive Zambezi valley between Cabora Bassa and the Indian Ocean, as well as development in neighbouring states to whom power will be supplied. South Africa&#x2019;s undertaking to buy a large percentage of the power initially was a decisive factor in this project for it made the project economically possible. The result is that tens of thousands of people in Mozambique and other neighbouring states of ours will enjoy the benefits of this and will be able to deal with the threat of starvation, to which the hon. the Leader of the <span class="col_53-54" refersTo="page_0042"/>Opposition referred. The same applies to the Kunene scheme, which, just like the Cabora Bassa scheme, has reached an advanced stage. The statement or the insinuation that not enough has been done, is extremely unfair. If we take into consideration the nominal requirements of the other States and the enormous capital expenditure which will be required, it would be totally unpractical to tackle further schemes on a regional basis now, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition advocated1. It was not very clear to me whether the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was thinking of co-operation in respect of nuclear energy; I could not follow very clearly what the hon. the leader said on that score, but I just want to point out that anything like that would be totally unpractical at this stage for reasons which I need not elaborate on.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had thanked or congratulated the Prime Minister and the Government on what we have already achieved in the interests of the whole of South Africa, instead of moving and advocating a motion of no confidence, it would have redounded to his credit. If he had done so he would have displayed true statesmanship and he would have improved his entire image and the image of his tottering party in South Africa, as well as in the outside world. If he had done so, he would have promoted South Africa&#x2019;s case in Africa and in the outside world, and he would perhaps have made a contribution to détente, however humble that contribution may have been. Why did the hon. leader not rather propose that everyone in this House, on both sides of the House, should participate in a discussion of how we could promote detente, or that we conduct a discussion on how we could enlarge our co-operation with Africa without hurling totally undeserved reproaches at the Government and without moving a motion of no confidence in this Government? After all, such a motion is not obligatory.</p>

<p>Instead of acting positively the hon. the Leader of the Opposition sought to make petty political gain and he allowed a golden parliamentary opportunity to promote the interests of South Africa and Southern Africa to slip. However, I do not want to castigate the hon. the Leader of the Opposition any further. [Interjections.] The hon. the Leader of the Opposition may be surprised, but I even want to thank him. I think it is generally known that it is my policy and the policy of my department to maintain a low profile throughout. We do not seek publicity because it is usually not in the national interests. In particular we do not want publicity when we are breaking new ground. We are seeking results, and we are achieving results, thanks in particular to the statesmanship and the leadership of our Prime Minister, who is gaining ever more status and respect for himself and for South Africa in the free world. I want to thank the hon. the Leader of the Opposition because he gave me a good excuse to enlighten this House and others in regard to our extensive activities, something which I normally do not like doing. However, the attempt by the hon. the leader to justify a motion of no confidence in the Government failed completely. All he succeeded in doing was to afford a golden opportunity to let the spotlight fall afresh on the great achievements of the National Party Government, an opportunity to intensify the realization once again that there is only one Government to which South Africa&#x2019;s destiny could be entrusted in these times of crisis.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I must say that I am a bit surprised at the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs for being so offended because there were not, in the motion at least, words of praise for the wonderful Government this afternoon. I shall give a word of praise later, but does the hon. the Minister expect us to applaud the Government? No, we have not come here to do that. The hon. the Minister must <span class="col_55-56" refersTo="page_0043"/>concede that many of the difficulties in which South Africa finds itself today are in fact attributable to the policy of the Government. Now that the Government is correcting what it has bungled, we are pleased that it is happening, but he must not expect from us that we must come here to applaud.</p>

<p>I shall come to the South West Africa issue later. The hon. the Minister attacked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for having raised the question of consensus and the official Opposition&#x2019;s participation therein in South West Africa. I am surprised by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s point of view. In 1948, when the United Party was in power in South West Africa, the National Party had only one elected representative in the Legislative Assembly of South West, but when Dr. Malan went to South West in October 1948 to establish a new constitution for South West he called the United Party and the National Party together on an equal basis so that there could be consensus amongst the Whites before he came to this Parliament to give a new constitution to South West. Let me say to the hon. the Minister and to the hon. the Prime Minister that we are not going to moan if the official Opposition is excluded from talks in South West Africa, but then the Government must not come and complain later if we accuse it of having played party politics with the interests of South West rather than having looked for a common solution.</p>

<p>Before I come to matters which were touched on by the hon. the Minister and which I want to raise in the field of foreign relations myself, let me just say a few words about the background against which we are entering this session. We are aware of the fact that far-reaching changes lie ahead for all of us in South Africa. This will inevitably bring about that there will be people in South Africa who will lead the way and others who follow dragging their feet. There will also be a whole lot of people whose thinking will be such that they will simply stay behind protesting. As a result of this all political parties in South Africa are going to experience their quota of problems; the one perhaps to a somewhat larger extent than the other. This we must expect. Our attitude is, however, that different parties sticking out their tongues at one another will not help anybody. The hon. the Minister spoke here of a &#x201C;tottering&#x201D; United Party. Outside there is talk of the irrelevancy of the Party.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, this talk about the so-called irrelevancy of the official Opposition is nonsense. In our system of government no party which occupies the position of the official Opposition is irrelevant. Apart from this the United Party is based on fundamental ideals and objectives in respect of its internal policies which are more relevant to South Africa today than any other policies in the country. Let me just mention a few of the fundamental objectives of this party. They are, firstly, the removal of all discrimination based on the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin. Without this it is fruitless to hope for a state of peaceful co-existence between our different peoples in South Africa. In other words, colour apartheid must be buried. The colour curtain in South Africa must come down. This must be done swiftly.</p>

<p>Secondly, fundamental to our outlook is social, economic and cultural freedom. Every individual in this country must have the right to seek his own social, cultural and economic place in society unburdened by Government restrictions on the ground of race ideology. This of course implies that any cultural group and any private sector of the population should have the right to organize themselves for social, economic and cultural purposes as exclusively or inclusively as they prefer.</p>

<p>The third fundamental ideal of the United Party is that of political co-operation between our different peoples on the basis of co-existence and of no domination of one over any other. Because we realize that the only successful way in which in a multinational country such as ours different peoples can work successfully together without the one dominating the other politically is a federal one, our philosophy is federalism and we therefore seek a federal arrangement for the peoples of South Africa.</p>

<p>These have been the main objectives of this side of the House for years. We do not have the slightest doubt that if South Africa wishes to survive as a country and if the White man wishes to have a secure future in South Africa the country will have to turn in the direction of these ideals. Whether in the long run the public will give the United Party the credit it deserves by putting it into power or not or whether other parties will eventually implement these objectives, because they have no alternative, because they have no choice, is immaterial at this stage. What cannot be disputed is that the party promoting the <span class="col_57-58" refersTo="page_0044"/>fundamental ideas that we advocate can in no circumstances be or become politically irrelevant.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the focus has lately fallen sharply on South Africa&#x2019;s international relations and in particular on the Government&#x2019;s efforts to end confrontation and achieve détente in South Africa. There can be no doubt as to where we stand in all this. The record shows that we have consistently promoted a productive foreign policy, a foreign policy based on a number of principles of which I want to mention just a few. The first is emphasis on our African personality and the forging of the closest links of friendship and co-operation, economically, culturally and security-wise, especially with our immediate neighbours in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>The second is full membership of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and support for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an ideal guide for all civilized countries. Included here is of course also membership of all international organizations which are relevant to South Africa&#x2019;s interests. Thirdly, a speedy solution to the issue of South West Africa by the application of the principle of self-determination to the territory and its peoples without undue delay and in a manner consistent with the generally accepted meaning of the term, and, finally, Sir, the widest degree of personal diplomacy in the field of foreign relations by the head of our Government. Sir, in every country of the world the Prime Minister or the President at the head of the Government is the central and most authoritative representative of his country. We need only look at the active and leading part which the Prime Ministers and Presidents of other countries play in the field of their country&#x2019;s international relations to realize how far we have been lagging behind in this respect. It speaks 100% for itself that in so far as the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government promote the objectives which we have advocated for so long and which we regard as essential to the well-being of South Africa, he can count on the effective support of the Opposition. It would be illogical for a party to oppose steps which follow its own objectives. Sir, the question that we have to face is whether the Government have advanced far enough for us to express the kind of feeling of confidence that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs wanted us to express here this afternoon. Let us look at the picture. The Prime Minister has embarked on a measure of personal diplomacy and the whole country has welcomed it. Everyone has welcomed it, including the Leader of the Opposition in statements made by him. But, Sir, the precise scope of his recent activities is not known because they were clothed in secrecy. One had hoped that the hon. the Minister would enlighten us somewhat here today. We cannot therefore at this stage assess the Prime Minister&#x2019;s role as accurately as we would have liked to do. But I hope it will soon be possible for the hon. the Prime Minister to give us a full account of what he and President Kaunda and President Seretse Khama and Mr. Samora Machel and other African leaders have done to reach a state of communication and a meaningful measure of relaxation in Southern Africa. Undoubtedly, a most encouraging beginning has been made, and we are quite happy to acknowledge that, but, it should not be forgotten that 28 years have now elapsed since a South African Prime Minister has appeared on behalf of his country at the United Nations or at any international conference, and from the good beginning that has now been made in personal diplomacy at the highest level within Southern Africa, South Africa needs the Prime Minister to broaden the front of initiative to the international terrain as a whole. Looking further at the Government&#x2019;s new policies, the Government have begun to place greater emphasis on our African personality, but we have not yet advanced beyond diplomatic relations with only one Black African State, namely Malawi. So far no formal links have been established with our most immediate Black neighbours, and we regard this as essential.</p>

<p>As far as our membership of the United Nations is concerned, we are faced with the danger of a complete breakdown. This was not even mentioned by the Minister of Foreign Affairs here this afternoon. True, the United Nations has acted illegally in denying to South Africa the participatory rights which flow from its recognized membership. All of us condemn it and, fortunately, the major Western nations have likewise deplored and condemned it, and it has lowered the standing of the United Nations in the eyes of many in the world. The Government has reacted by stating that it is reconsidering our formal membership of that organization. Mr. Speaker, we share the concern of the Government, but our attitude is a very straightforward one: we regard our membership of the United <span class="col_59-60" refersTo="page_0045"/>Nations, our presence in the United Nations, as a national right which should not be abandoned.</p>

<p>The United Nations does not belong to anybody. It does not belong to any particular group of States where we are a guest of the others. No, South Africa has as much right to be there as any other country in the world. The Government has consistently defended South Africa&#x2019;s right to be in South West Africa. It has even gone so far as to go to the International Court to participate in the proceedings in the International Court to safeguard South Africa&#x2019;s right in South West Africa. We expect the Government to put up the same sort of defence in respect of our right of membership of the UN. Not to do so would be highly inconsistent on the part of the Government. Let me add that as far as the organization itself is concerned, nobody denies its faults or the abuse of power which took place during the last session, particularly in respect of South Africa and Israel. But the simple fact is this, that despite all the weaknesses of the UN there is no alternative to the UN. If it were to disappear, the world would have to form another one, and it is unlikely that it would be much better than the present one. If the organization were to split up into two or three different organizations confronting each other, it would mean that the world&#x2019;s problems would merely be aggravated; nothing would be solved. So we on this side believe that we should not abandon our membership of the UN, but that we should insist on our rights, our right of membership, and that we should continue with the other Western countries to seek a workable relation with the UN and with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>*Then the subject of South West Africa has also been broached. We can also look at that. The Government has come so far as to accept the principle&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014; of self-determination and independence for the area and its people. That was a sound step, but the Government has not succeeded at all in creating the confidence in our minds that the Government itself knows what it means by the concept &#x201C;self-determination and independence&#x201D;, and the result is damaging uncertainty inside and outside South West Africa. The Government furthermore creates the impression that it would like to wash its hands of the matter, and would like to leave it to the different population groups of South West Africa to find one another and to seek a solution for the future amongst themselves which will be acceptable to all. Sir, in principle that is good and right. We all know that in the near future the people of South West Africa will have to decide about their own future in one or another way, not just about their political future in international context, but also about their internal form of government, and that is not going to be easy. But a form of government in South West Africa must be found which is more or less acceptable to all the population groups. Now, we are altogether in favour of talks taking place, contact, consultation and dialogue, views being exchanged. It is essential and should have taken place long ago. But there is no time for failures nor is there any time for disputes dragging on between the different population groups. It must be clear to everyone that the pressure on South Africa, actions against South Africa, are going to increase tremendously and dangerously this year. Sir, if it so happens&#x2014;and I think all of us hope that it will happen&#x2014;that the Rhodesian issue is solved satisfactorily in some way or other, then we must expect that subsequent to that, although we should like to see success as far as the solution of the Rhodesian issue is concerned, the full attention, hostile and otherwise, will be focused on South West Africa and on South Africa&#x2019;s position in South West Africa and the constitutional future of the territory. Therefore the Government cannot in our opinion leave the political developments in South West Africa to the guidance of two executive members of the Legislative Assembly, however good and sincere those two members might be. Sir, in the Republic we have the position that the Government has consistently refused to hold a national convention of all the population groups with a view to finding a solution to the problems of the Republic. It has been proposed so many times: Bring the Black leaders and the Brown leaders and the White leaders and the Indian leaders together at a conference and then look for a solution to the relations problems of South Africa. What has the attitude of the Government always been towards this? The Government has said that it is an impossible task; one will never achieve success in this way. I think the Government still is of that opinion. We all know, however, that South West is even more multi-national <span class="col_61-62" refersTo="page_0046"/>than the Republic of South Africa is. How do hon. members think that all the different population groups there will reach consensus if they are to discuss abstract concepts around a conference table? The two White parties there have not even reached consensus as yet; how shall we reach it with the others&#x2014;I put the emphasis on this &#x2014;if abstract concepts are to be discussed? Therefore we say that it is correct that the people of South West must not be prescribed to from the Republic. The course of the South West issue is, however, of extreme importance to all of us. It affects the question of war or peace for the Republic of South Africa. It is one of the issues around which our whole future in Africa and in the world revolves and therefore all of us&#x2014;whether we are South West Africans or not&#x2014;have the greatest interest in any solution of this issue. Consequently our attitude is that the Government itself must take the lead. The Government must get away from the abstract and take positive steps to create a model which can serve as a basis and from which one can work. We believe that in the Southern sector of the territory a multi-national government involving all the population groups in the south must be established immediately. In order to prevent any domination of the one by the other, this may be done on a federal basis. The same must happen in the northern sector which is a completely Black area. In other words, a representative central government must, immediately in our opinion, be established in the southern and in the northern sectors. Powers of government must then be transferred to them and the two bodies of authority can then come together to decide whether they want to proceed together or separately. In this way the way can be prepared for a referendum under both South African and international control to take a final decision on the future of the territory.</p>

<p>Later in this session we shall seek an opportunity to have an extensive debate on the South West Africa issue and we hope that the Government will take part in it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs must concede that if we look at the scene of our foreign relations in its entirety, including the South West Africa issue it is in fact clear to everyone that there are bright spots. We are glad about these bright spots, and we are prepared to give credit for them to whoever deserve credit for them. We realize also that there are great opportunities. Now it is up to the Government, however, to create the confidence that it will actively set about correcting all the issues that are wrong. With all its declarations about the removal of colour discrimination, the Government has created tremendous expectations internally, among White and non-White, as well as abroad. The declaration of the Government at the end of last year, voiced by our ambassador at the UN before the Security Council, was clear and straightforward and came at the right time. I refer to the parts as they appear in the official text and I should like to quote only the following from the words of Advocate Pik Botha on behalf of the Government&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do have discriminatory practices and we do have discriminatory laws &#x2026; But I want to state here today very clearly and categorically: My Government does not condone discrimination purely on the grounds of race or colour.</block>

<p>Please note: &#x201C;Race or colour&#x201D;.</p>

<block name="quote">Discrimination based solely on the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin cannot be defended. And we shall do everything in our power &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is important, because here is a promise and undertaking on the part of South Africa that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; we shall do everything in our power to move away from discrimination based on race or colour.</block>

<p>It was a great declaration and I want to repeat that it came at the right time. But the implications are far-reaching and it will be good if hon. members realize this. It affects discriminatory laws and discriminatory practices. We hope that in this long session which lies ahead the Government will take active steps to remove both discriminatory laws and discriminatory practices. In this way it will eliminate large areas of dispute in South African politics. I think the most sensible thing which the Government can do is to nominate a Select Committee of Parliament consisting of members from all the parties to go through our legislation with help from outside, if necessary, and to make recommendations about discriminatory laws and discriminatory practices which must disappear. We as a party have made this offer before and we do it again now. We realize that for <span class="col_63-64" refersTo="page_0047"/>many members on the other side this will be a difficult and painful operation, but as it is with all operations, the quicker it is done the better. Our advice to the Government is rather to act quickly and to get this behind them. We hope that it will act quickly. Those who want to stay behind, must simply stay behind because South Africa&#x2019;s interests are greater and more important than the obsolete programmes of political parties. Fortunately there are signs that the winds of change outside are beginning to blow in the right direction. I notice that a number of apartheid signs have recently been removed at the General Post Office in Cape Town. We all took note of the decision concerning the Nico Malan theatre with great interest. Now I only hope, and I should like to say it here, that no internal apartheid arrangements within the theatre complex will be introduced, and especially not on the level of toilets, because this will make two evils where there was one.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Years ago a prominent Black American said: &#x201C;The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the colour line, the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia, Africa, America and the islands of the sea.&#x201D; We know that this is absolutely true. The major human problem of the 20th century is the problem of the colour line. At international gatherings such as the United Nations and the OAU, more emotion, more hostility and more blind irrational action engendered by the problem of the colour line than by anything else. We believe that if we want to achieve a breakthrough to Black Africa and to the rest of the world, we will first have to achieve a human breakthrough to Black and Brown South Africa, otherwise I am afraid détente will remain a word without any relevancy for South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works_and_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS AND OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the two Opposition speakers who preceded me devoted so much time to saying why they are satisfied with what the Government has done to us that they of necessity devoted less time to the things with which they are dissatisfied. I am not rising to venture into the province of my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Nor do I wish to cover the ground which will no doubt be covered by the hon. the Prime Minister when he enters the debate. However. South West Africa has, to my regret, been drawn into this debate. I say &#x201C;to my regret&#x201D;, although I realize that hon. members on the opposite side have an interest in South West Africa. No one will deny that, since South Africa does indeed have an interest in South West Africa. I also realize that this House, the Parliament of South Africa, has a very real interest in South West Africa. In addition to that I realize that the South West African issue is a difficult one, a delicate one which will have to be handled with circumspection. But what do we have now? Since 1967 the hon. the Prime Minister has adopted the standpoint that the people of South West Africa must themselves decide on their future. We found that when the people of South West Africa took the lastest positive steps in this regard&#x2014;and these are not the first steps&#x2014; the Opposition leaders&#x2014;and I am referring to the Leader of the official Opposition and the Leader of the Progressive Party&#x2014; fell over each other to say that they were the first to propose this, that they agreed that this was the right thing to do, i.e. that the people of South West Africa themselves should decide. In my opinion this standpoint is unassailable since the Government, the Parliament of South Africa, is giving to the people of South West Africa, which is a dependent territory, the opportunity to decide for themselves by mutual deliberation. I do not know how any reasonable body in the world can adopt a standpoint against that. Nor did the Opposition do so, i.e. both Opposition parties supported that standpoint, and as a South West African, someone speaking on behalf of people who have everything they possess in South West Africa and not merely a political interest or constitutional interest in it, I was very pleased to see this. These are the people on whose behalf I am pleading. But no sooner was South West Africa, with the approval of both opposition parties, entrusted with deciding for itself on this delicate matter, than we found that it was being inundated with advice on how it was to go about deciding on this matter. In fact, we have this illogical approach: You are good enough, you are equal to the task of deciding amongst yourselves what you want for your future, but you are evidently not equal to the task of deciding amongst yourselves how you will set to work, and we should now like to tell you how you should do so.</p>

<p>We had an attempt here today and we have had attempts outside this House. We <span class="col_65-66" refersTo="page_0048"/>had an attempt here today by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to tell South West Africa how it should set to work. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout even went a little further and also indicated how that dialogue should proceed. Either we in this Parliament of South Africa trust South West Africa to deal with this matter itself, or we do not trust it. This side of the House, I know, is confident that South West Africa can deal with this matter itself. Now that I have said this, I should like to quote certain words from a farewell speech delivered by ex-Senator Niehaus at the congress of his party, the words of a man who has for many years served that party and its school of thought in a very responsible capacity. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is so much at stake, our whole future in fact, that I hope that all political parties and their spokesmen will rise above petty politics and act as true patriots. If they do not do so, they deserve to be damned by their contemporaries as well as their descendants.</block>

<p>These were the words of ex-Senator Niehaus.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the remarks which were made here in respect of South West Africa. Firstly, I want to refer to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said. He reminded us that a solution in South West Africa must also be acceptable to the other nations in Southern Africa. Why did he say this? How can a solution for South West Africa be achieved in a valid way, a way that will be recognized? A solution in South West Africa, if it can be found, must, in the first place, be recognized by the Parliament of South Africa. It must, in the first place, be laid down by this Parliament by means of legislation. Whatever that solution is going to be&#x2014;whether it is independence, self-determination or some other form to be agreed upon, and whether there will be some or other link with the Republic of South Africa&#x2014;South West Africa is not going to proclaim a unilateral declaration of independence. In other words, South West Africa will have to approach the Government of South Africa and state its proposals. The Government and the Parliament of South Africa will then have to decide on it. If unanimity or a reasonable degree of unanimity can be found among the people of South West, is the Parliament of South Africa then going to ask the other countries whether they are satisfied with it, whether they would like Parliament to amend it? I think it is important that South West Africa should know this at this stage since the hon. the Leader of the Opposition suggested that the other African states and other states in the world also had to be satisfied. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is shaking his head now. I do not know whether or not I am hard of hearing, for then I would have to start shaking my head.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went on to quote an alleged statement of mine that the White man would not share his sovereignty. I do not know from what source the hon. the Leader of the Opposition quoted me&#x2014;he did not mention the source&#x2014;hut I am not interested in it either. I want to tell him that I was not quoted correctly and in context. What happened was that the leader of his party in South West Africa, the new leader, Mr. O&#x2019;Lynn, made a statement which amounts to the fact that the standpoint adopted by the National Party in South West Africa, i.e. that the White man will not share his sovereignty, has now been shelved. I referred to this at a meeting in Tsumeb, and I presume that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition quoted from what I said there. I can tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that I have that speech on tape. I asked what right O&#x2019;Lynn had to say that it had been shelved. The National Party said that it would also state its policy as other population groups would be able to state their standpoints when discussions were held. The National Party has not abandoned its standpoint. Discussions will be held and an attempt will then be made to reach unanimity. I said that the National Party maintained that all options were open. In other words, if all options are open, this standpoint is open as well. What right does O&#x2019;Lynn have to say that it is not open? This is the standpoint I adopted at Tsumeb. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition quoted from what I said there, but he has brought a totally wrong impression home to this House because, so I believe, the story was not relayed to him correctly. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is shaking his head again. He complained that the political parties could not participate in solving the South West African issue. Who on earth said in South West Africa that political parties could not participate in this attempt? I should again like to quote ex-Senator Niehaus, who <span class="col_67-68" refersTo="page_0049"/>served his party very loyally. The day after representatives from my side and representatives from his side had held discussions and agreed that we had reached an understanding, he said the following at his party&#x2019;s congress, when he took leave of them (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the difficult times ahead the United Party also has an important role to play. Admittedly it is not the governing party with whom the initiative and authority will originate in the discussions and the negotiations with the various national groups&#x2026;</block>

<p>He accepted, because it is reasonable and logical, that the will of the White majority group would be the will which would be stated at that consultation as emanating from the Whites. Surely one cannot dispute this. That is why ex-Senator Niehaus adopted this reasonable and fair standpoint. Whether the new leader of the United Party in South West Africa will abide by the fine understanding which has been achieved, i.e. that we will gradually hold more discussions with one another, I do not know. Time will tell. If I understood the hon. the Leader of the Opposition correctly, he intimated to the United Party that they would not be able to participate.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>He wrote to Messrs. Mudge and Van Zyl in Windhoek. I saw the letter. The hon. the leader maintains that the United Party was told that it could not participate. My reply at the time was that we could not prevent the United Party in South West from holding discussions with non-White groups; we do not have that power. I said, however, that it would be very unwise to state the standpoint of the Whites towards the non-Whites on behalf of a minority group. This can only confuse them. Why are they concerned that their federal policy will not be put to the non-Whites or not be discussed? According to the standpoint that all doors are open, the federal policy is, as far as we are concerned, on the table, provided someone wants it there. If the Whites do not want it there and they intimate as much through their representative body&#x2014; and the United Party played a role in its composition&#x2014;and if not one of the non-White groups asks that the federal policy be discussed, why should it be there? What business has it there? Then they also ask that they, as a political party, should participate in the discussions. Let us see what the situation would be if they did in fact participate. Give the United Party participation and the HNP would also want to participate since they also put forward candidates and polled a few votes. What is the position among the non-Whites? Take the case of the Hereros. There are people among the Hereros who say that they represent all their people. We know that there are various groups among the Hereros. They are not all of one mind. We know that those minority groups exist. Members of these minority groups say that because members from other groups are represented there they also want to be represented there. So you have it among the Ovambos; so you have it among the Damaras; so you have it among the Namas; so you have it among the Rehoboth Basters and so you have it among the Coloureds. Would the Opposition have us make a farce and an object of ridicule of this sincere attempt to achieve unanimity in South West Africa? One would reasonably expect&#x2014;and this is how we put it to the people&#x2014;that when people are designated to speak on behalf of those people, in a way which will satisfy those people, whether it is determined unanimously or by means of a majority or in any other way, then one must hold discussions with that group since they are speaking on behalf of those people. Why should one sit there and argue with people who cannot say that they are speaking on behalf of those people? This is precisely what the position of the United Party in South West Africa is. They cannot tell us that they are speaking on behalf of the Whites.</p>

<p>What is the position in regard to participation by political parties? Political parties can participate. Three political parties participated in establishing a body which speaks on behalf of the Whites. When non-White political parties participate, we hold discussions with them. We tell them that if they want to participate, if they want to make a contribution, they must do so through their own people. It must not take place in any other way. In other words, they must play their role in the place where their representatives are designated. That is where their role as a political party must be played. That is where they will play it. If a political party such as Swapo does not <span class="col_69-70" refersTo="page_0050"/>want to play that role when its people are designated, we can definitely not be blamed for it. In other words, there is no prohibition whatsoever on participation by political parties.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point went so far as to say that everyone that might possibly be a power factor, i.e. political parties, must be taken into consideration. Who has to determine this? Who is going to determine which political party is a power factor and which political party is not a power factor? Every single political party in South West Africa claims that it is a power factor. I want to tell the hon. member for Sea Point that I appreciate the fact that he went to South West Africa to acquire some first-hand knowledge there. I take it that the people of South West Africa gave him a friendly reception for they are friendly people. However, I should also like to tell him this: He still knows very little about the people of South West Africa. When I speak about the people of South West Africa, I mean all its people. Today I should like to put this question to the hon. member: The Damaras constitute the third largest population group in South West Africa. What language do they speak? Would he be able to tell me? [Interjections.] The hon. member has indicated to me that he cannot tell me what language they speak and, as we all know, language is important to any man. That is why I am telling the hon. member that he still does not know enough about the people of South West Africa. With that, I think, I have dealt with the points relating to South West Africa which were raised in the speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Bezuidenhout came along and, as the old saying goes, the moment he opened his mouth, he put his foot in it. He referred to the occasion when Dr. Malan came to South West Africa in 1948 and summoned everyone for a consensus. The hon. member overlooked two facts. That consensus was concerned with Whites only, and Dr. Malan consequently summoned the two White groups for a consensus, as we now want to summon the Whites and the non-Whites for a consensus. The second thing the hon. member overlooked is that what it was concerned with was representation of the Whites in this Parliament without any of the parties having to relinquish their policies, and if one wanted to achieve consensus between the National Party and the United Party in South West, it would mean that one party would have to relinquish its policy otherwise one would not be able to achieve consensus. Dr. Malan did not ask the United Party of South West Africa to relinquish its policy and he did not ask the National Party to relinquish its policy.</p>

<p>What happened was that both accepted amendments to procedures, but neither relinquished its policy. A few months later a hard election was fought, in which policy was pitted against policy. This is where the hon. member failed to grasp the whole situation, which he wanted to compare here. It was not a comparable situation at all. Mr. Speaker, let me emphasize this again: It is this type of blunder in respect of South West Africa which does not do South West Africa any good. We are dealing in South West Africa with peoples that have not yet progressed very far on the road of constitutional development and political understanding, and when these statements are made they can only create confusion in their minds; it can only make the position more difficult for people in South West who are sincerely trying to find a solution there which will also be of value to South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that we did not know what we had in mind for South West Africa. If he has not seen the statement which was issued on 23 September by my Chief Executive, and the resolution which was subsequently adopted by the Legislative Assembly, it is not my fault; I am not going to quote the entire statement here, but I should like to quote the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The standpoint of the National Party of South West Africa on what it regards as the best method of ensuring peaceful co-existence among people with different languages, traditions, cultural backgrounds and even views of life, is well known. Nevertheless, it is the intention of the party to approach the proposed consultations in a spirit of goodwill, in which standpoints will be weighed up and misconceptions will be eliminated with a view to finding a solution which will ensure the greatest possible degree of support from the various population groups of South West Africa.</block>

<p><span class="col_71-72" refersTo="page_0051"/>Must I tell the hon. member today what that final pattern will look like? If I did so I would surely be making this statement appear ridiculous. I am only being honest when I say that I do not know what the final pattern will look like. There is no one in South West Africa and no one in the world, for that matter, who knows what the final pattern will look like. What I do know is that it will not be possible to force peoples into it. South West Africa does not have the power to force peoples into it. What I do know is that every people in South West Africa will have the opportunity to say &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;No&#x201D;; we cannot force them into it. We would then have to find alternatives for them and alternatives for the community. After all, there cannot be compulsion. Surely we do not want the same happening in South West Africa as happened in other States in Africa. I think responsible non-White leaders in South West have said repeatedly that they do not want the same to happen in South West as has happened elsewhere in Africa where there was bloodshed and its aftermath. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout associated himself with the motion which states that we should speed up our actions. Sir, I can give this House the assurance that there is going to be no dragging of feet on the part of the Whites. We want an answer and we want it as soon as possible. We want to know where we stand, and as soon as possible. We are dealing here with peoples whom we cannot simply force, whom we cannot simply take by the scruff of the neck and insist that they take a decision tomorrow. We are dealing here with peoples among whom there is a great deal of dissension as to who will speak on their behalf. We shall have to accept that they are going to iron out those problems of theirs in their own time and in their own way. But what I do find encouraging is that, to my knowledge, each individual population group in South West Africa intimated that it is prepared to participate in the discussions. I think this is very important. But I tell you, Mr. Speaker, that to do what is being expected of us now, to draw up a timetable, is to look for trouble. There are some peoples in South West Africa that have reached the stage where they can take part in discussions and discussions are in fact being held with them, but there are others in respect of whom we do not know at what point of time we will reach the stage of being able to hold discussions with representatives who will represent them properly. It is true that there are only two on the part of the Whites, but how many should there be? Three, four or six? What is the difference?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said there were only two who were White, and he even said they might be very good. How many should there be? The fact is that the hon. member has failed to grasp this as well. There has always been what we accept as the sovereign authority over South West Africa, i.e. South Africa, and this Parliament is still, in the final analysis, the body that will have to take decisions. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout even goes so far that he now wants to establish two governments in South West, one for the south and one for the north, and now those two governments must be at loggerheads. The hon. member, who knows South West Africa, ought to know as well as I that one cannot very easily constitute a government in the south consisting of Namas, Hereros and Damaras, and that one cannot very easily constitute a government in the north consisting of Kavangos and Ovambos. The hon. member know this as well as I. In other words, one has to conduct negotiations over a period of many years in order to establish those two governments, and when one has conducted those lengthy negotiations in order to establish those two governments which he wants, one has to set in motion the next stage of negotiations, to achieve unanimity between those two governments. [Interjections.] I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has lost touch with South West Africa. A few days&#x2019; holiday in South West Africa is not enough to appreciate what is happening there. If I were to ask the hon. member for Bezuidenhout today how many languages are spoken in South West Africa, I wonder whether he would be able to tell me. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the House will forgive me if I do not follow the hon. the Minister who has just sat down and who is the leader of the Nationalist Party in South West Africa because he has dealt with a number of local problems in respect of this matter and with a number of matters relating to the participation of <span class="col_73-74" refersTo="page_0052"/>the Nationalist Party and of the United Party in South West Africa. I shall leave those matters to be dealt with by my hon. leader when he replies to this debate, since he has knowledge of the affairs of which the hon. the Minister spoke. However, I must say one thing for the hon. the Minister: He did not seem to be caught up with the euphoria which has somewhat affected everyone else.</p>

<p>The euphoria is present amongst the Nationalist Party members, or should I say amongst some of the Nationalist Party members, in relation to the commendable efforts by the hon. the Prime Minister to achieve détente in Southern Africa. I thought it remarkable that the first speaker we have heard from that side of the House, the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, was more euphoric than I have ever known him. He has been the Minister of Foreign Affairs for goodness knows how long &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>He surely must have advised the hon. the Prime Minister in those 12 years to achieve some form of détente and here, for the first time in 12 years, he has managed to persuade the hon. the Prime Minister to do something about it and he has done it. The euphoria of the hon. gentleman is such that when he was asked by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, when he was speaking, whether the statement by Mr. Pik Botha at the United Nations that discrimination based on colour alone would be removed was a declaration of intention, he chose not to answer him. What he went on to say was that the most practical basis for the protection of &#x201C;menseregte&#x201D;, human rights, human dignity, was the policy of separate development. I want to say to the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs that if he wishes really to know why he meets with difficulty when he wishes to achieve détente and after that entente with the Black nations to the north of us and, in fact, with anyone else, he should look in the mirror at the Government&#x2019;s policies which he is supposed to represent because that is what causes this difficulty. I shall try to demonstrate why it is that the Government has to do certain things in order to achieve the entente which will follow the détente that we hope will be achieved.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman accused the hon. the Leader of the Opposition of not clapping his hands and praising the hon. the Prime Minister. He said: Do we not all ask ourselves how we can all encourage detente instead of introducing a motion of no confidence? That is precisely what my hon. leader has done. He has commended the efforts towards détente just as everybody in South Africa does. But if you wish to further détente, if you wish to have entente, then you have to examine the process. [Interjections.] The hon. gentlemen are laughing, but my understanding of détente is that it is the end of strained relations. My understanding of entente is something which is obviously related to it, and that is a friendly agreement or relationship between States.</p>

<p>You do not have a friendly relationship or an agreement between States until obviously you have ended the strained relationship. I think this is precisely the problem this Government has, because if we can achieve détente, then the achievement of entente, of agreement, of a working solution, is going to depend entirely on the internal policies of this Government in respect of those very matters of human rights, in respect of those very matters of the individual&#x2019;s liberty and especially and obviously those of the Black man. What has not been mentioned by anyone is the utter breakdown, since this House last met, in the Government&#x2019;s internal policy. They have, in effect, come to a cul-de-sac, to a dead-end in respect of their policies. I do not have to go any further. I do not have to look at the meetings which we have had with the Black people, the Coloured people or the Indian people. One has only to look at what happened last week and immediately before that as well. What happened? Before our meeting took place the Black leaders themselves had a conference at which they were all present. In respect of independence as a concept for homelands, the corner-stone of the Government&#x2019;s policy, they dealt with the matter at length. They said there were various factors. They did not question the right of any homeland to seek independence, but made a statement in order to show their thinking on a matter which they considered to be a <span class="col_75-76" refersTo="page_0053"/>very serious one for all Blacks. They said: &#x201C;No other Black leader, with the exception of Chief Kaiser Matanzima, has any intention at this point in time to seek independence for any other territory.&#x201D; This was the statement made by them at their own meeting before they met us. They then went on to say in their statement: &#x201C;The concept of federation was discussed in detail, as was the case at the Umtata conference, because the Black leaders feel that at this point in time when South Africa is at the cross-roads the concept of federation needs serious attention as one of the possible alternatives which is worth looking at.&#x201D; After that the hon. the Prime Minister had a series of meetings with various members of the other communities. What was the result of the communiqué which was issued after the meeting with the Black leaders? The result was that the Prime Minister was prepared to grant leasehold to urban Blacks. Not freehold, but leasehold, indicating that he does not accept the permanency of these people.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>What is the situation that we do then in fact have? The Blacks do not want independence for the homelands and the hon. the Prime Minister has admitted that he cannot force them to. He has also said that if they do not opt for independence things will stay as they are. How much can you achieve in the way of détente or entente or anything else in Africa if in fact things are going to stay as they are and are not going to change? This is my first point. Related to this is the question of the urban Blacks and at the time the hon. the Prime Minister was asked about this. If the situation as regards the urban Blacks is to remain the same and if these people are never to be regarded as being permanent residents&#x2014;I shall come back to this point&#x2014;there is no policy. How much further can you go from there? How can you promise to fulfil your side of any deal or any improvement when you negotiate with Black States?</p>

<p>Then he met the Coloureds and the Indians. What was the result of that? There is now going to be a Cabinet association between the cabinets of the various representative councils and the Cabinet of this Government. They will deal with matters on an administrative basis, but they will have no say whatever in the body that controls that cabinet. They are to have no say whatever in any other body which controls the cabinet and makes the decisions. Where do we go from here? The hon. the Prime Minister does not even envisage that there will be any other body in which they will have a say and where these matters can be discussed. It would seem that the Coloured people and the Indians will for ever have no say in the sovereign body which controls their destinies. They will just have a cabinet committee in which they will be advised of matters such as foreign affairs, defence and other matters which they do not deal with, but in respect of which they have the greatest interest. If one is going to take the position of the urban Bantu as a yardstick I think one has to look seriously at what has happened up to now. It does not matter what your policy is or what you say you believe in. It does not matter what words are used here. I accept the sincerity of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development in dealing with the problem of the urban Blacks, but the fact of the matter is that the Blacks are here in our urban areas on a permanent basis and they will remain here for ever. If you do not accept that, they will nevertheless still be here, but they will remain here on a basis which carries with it all the ingredients of an explosion and of turmoil, which will be sparked off by the very internal combustion which this process inevitably produces. If there is to be no change in this attitude, one is asking for trouble. So why not change the whole basis upon which they are present? Security is the keystone of stability. How often have we not heard this from hon. gentlemen on that side? Security, as far as they are concerned, of home ownership, family life, opportunities for educational and economic advancement and the opportunity to acquire wealth and capital, are the cornerstones of Western democracy and of peace and order. Anton Rupert says this very authoritatively. Everyone says it. It is a fact of life that those people are there permanently. However, if one has a situation, as my hon. leader has said, where one has urban Blacks&#x2014;and I am not speaking about rural Blacks now; I am speaking about urban Blacks&#x2014;who are the have-nots who have no opportunities and who can have no opportunities to develop wealth and to develop a position in that society, one has a classic situation which invites unrest and Communism.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>We believe that they should have the right to own and operate a business or an industrial undertaking in any area within the purview of their residence which is zoned, in fact, for that purpose. If one does not provide these facilities for them, one is living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. We are not only creating a dangerous situation for ourselves; we are creating an impossible situation when it comes to dealing with the rest of the world simply because we will not face the fact that those people are, in fact, permanent residents in our land. My hon. leader dealt with this question of the accumulation of wealth very eloquently and I do not propose to deal with the matter any further. However, I think one must appreciate that the days of wealth in the form of cattle have gone, and that if one does not provide this opportunity, one is putting oneself out of court. The responsibility for all this does not solely rest on this Government. It also rests on our shoulders. It is our duty not to come here and clap hands and say how marvellous the hon. the Prime Minister has been in achieving something we have been urging him to do all these years, but to come along here and tell this House and this country where, in fact, that movement towards détente and entente can be accelerated. The urban Blacks are one of the keys to our whole economic prosperity. The hon. Prime Minister knows that, and if one plans on the long term&#x2014;and we cannot plan any further on the short term &#x2014;one has to plan on the basis of granting their legitimate aspirations, and granting these on a permanent footing, not on the basis of the homeland leaders meeting the Prime Minister from time to time, but on the basis of their being inextricably a part of the country that we live in with a destiny common to ours. What I want to know is, when did the hon. Prime Minister last meet a representative group of urban Blacks? I do not know that he has. I do think, however, that the hon. the Prime Minister should broaden his consultations within, because I think that he will find that there are aspects, in respect of the urban Blacks, which he might not have contemplated. I think he would realize the urgency of the situation if he did talk to these people. Let me say this &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2020;The fact of the matter is that the hon. gentleman has gone a long way; he has leant over backwards in order to try to accommodate the Coloured community and the Indian community. I indicated, but unfortunately the hon. gentleman was not here, that the basis which he suggested is no basis on which one can deal with this unless he can tell us whether they are going to have a say in the Parliament or the body that controls that Cabinet and which in fact determines their destiny, the body which in fact makes the decisions in respect of foreign affairs and defence, the body of which they are a part, as he acknowledges. What I cannot understand for the life of me is why the hon. the Prime Minister, who is a practical, pragmatic man, cannot also recognize the existence, the permanency, of the urban Blacks. The politics that swept the hon. gentleman into this House when he came to this House for the first time, have gone. The politics where you pretend that the White man has a future and an existence in isolation from the Blacks belong to an era which has disappeared and can never come back again. Any approach based on that is calculated not just to undermine and destroy the White man&#x2019;s future, but is calculated to deny everyone in this country the rightful place which we can have together if we have the sort of country which my hon. leader outlined, a country which will be strong as a united South Africa.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the statement that was made on the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy. But let us look at the joint communiqué which was issued after the last conference we had with the Black leaders. It was a joint statement and on such occasions nothing is published and everything is confidential except for what is agreed should be published. What they said about the urban Black people is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Their needs include the right to home ownership, industrial and trading rights, advanced educational and training institutions and a fair measure of political representation in the area in which they live and work.</block>

<p>This agrees with our policy. The question of influx control was dealt with. Then, however, the following was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It being agreed that federation is a practical method of satisfying the aspirations of all the population groups within a single economically indivisible country, constructive discussion took place on the United Party&#x2019;s proposal for the transition towards and realization of a federal constitution.

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister thinks it is foolish, but it is precisely on that basis that he is now negotiating with South West Africa; South West Africa will be treated as an integral whole and the different groups that exist there are to be recognized. This is precisely what federation is. I do not know why he is so frightened of it. I think the hon. the Prime Minister will be the first to concede that you cannot today resolve South Africa&#x2019;s problems on the basis of the South Africa Act of 1910 and all it implied and as it was repeated in the Republican Constitution Act. This is not relevant any more to the modern needs of South Africa and to the fantastic changes that are taking place, and the hon. the Prime Minister knows that. If one is going to have a unitary constitution, one cannot deal with the problems we have and at the same time maintain and safeguard the rights of the minority groups in South Africa, and the hon. the Prime Minister knows that too.</p>

We do not have time to start consolidating big areas in order to achieve some ideological end. The genius of this scheme in the present context is &#x2026;</p>

<from><span class="col_81-82" refersTo="page_0056"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The genius of this scheme is that it can take every institution which this Government has built up over the years, i.e. the homelands and their constitutions, the Coloured Representative Council, the embryo Indian Representative Council and, indeed, almost all the machinery that is now in existence, and it can use that machinery on a new basis with a new outlook. What is more, this scheme can work and it will work because it has got to work and because &#x2026; [Interjections.] It has got to work for the very reason that if South Africa is to be saved and if that hon. gentleman wishes to achieve what he hopes to achieve in the attainment of détente, he will have to look at this very carefully. I shall tell you why I say that. It is only within the framework of a federation such as we propose that you will in fact be able to achieve the intention, mentioned at the United Nations, to remove discrimination based only on colour of the skin. Within that federal constitution you can give to everybody and especially to the urban Blacks the right to deal with those matters that concern them and at the same time you have a basis on which you can share not just that power with them but also the responsibility and power in respect of the whole of the country. There is no other way in which you can accommodate the urban Blacks. This is what gives this policy a meaning in the modern context. This is why the hon. the Prime Minister is going to have to look at the position. When he starts dealing with the matter on the basis that the Blacks are not to be regarded as a permanent fixture in the urban areas, that the urban Blacks are not to be regarded as a permanent part of South Africa, he is obliged to discriminate against them, he is obliged to withhold from them the &#x201C;menseregte&#x201D; which were mentioned by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is inevitable; it follows as night follows day. If your very presence is not regarded as being a factor, then it is obvious. What is more, it provides a secure basis founded upon the realities of South Africa and not upon what someone would like to have or someone would like to create. What we have now we can take and use and make work. Furthermore, it provides that consultation which can produce a consensus which no other scheme can provide.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the key sentence in the speech the hon. member for Durban North wanted to make, was &#x201C;that there is an utter break-down in the Government&#x2019;s internal policies&#x201D;. This he said, Sir, after his hon. Leader had said that we would not be able to make progress in South Africa or in Southern Africa if we did not succeed in our domestic policy, and this in the light of evidence from every side that we are in fact making progress in Africa. If, therefore, his hon. Leader&#x2019;s premise is correct, namely that in order to make progress in our national relations, in order to make progress in Southern Africa, it is necessary to have a favourable internal situation, then does not the evidence of the progress we are in fact making in international relations and in Southern Africa constitute emphatic proof that at the moment we have a favourable internal situation in South Africa itself as well? Let us take a look at a few of the matters raised by the hon. member as proof of how poorly our domestic policy and the National Party&#x2019;s policy in South Africa are supposedly faring. Concerning trading rights he said that we are depriving the Blacks of this right; that we are discriminating against them radically in this sphere, and that we are therefore heading for greater discrimination and for disorder and chaos; but when he quotes discussions between the leaders of the Black peoples and the hon. the Prime Minister, then he omits to quote in full; to investigate the whole picture and to present the information to this House in full. What was the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s reply when representations were made to him concerning business rights for Black people in the urban areas? His reply, according to a statement I have before me, was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Prime Minister said that the points raised by the homeland leaders were all valid. He was sympathetic to these problems and said that these matters would all be evaluated and laws and regulations affecting this situation would be reconsidered.</block>

<p>It was stated in the Press that this was the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attitude, and to come here and pretend that our policy in this regard has failed, while the hope is held out that there will be improvements, that there will be a review, and while there has even been positive evidence coming from the homeland leaders concerning this investigation and the fruits it might bear, is, surely, to fail to present this House with the correct and the full picture.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about the question of acceptance or non-acceptance of independence, and he quoted from the statement by the homeland leaders but quickly skimmed over the following words in that statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No other Black leader has any intention at this point of time to seek independence for any other territory.</block>

<p>Why not? It is only logical, and if the hon. member had done any research he too would have ascertained the reason for this: It is because at this stage, the point at issue for any responsible homeland leader must surely be the question of what the implications of independence would be and the question of the precise basis on which independence is to be gained, and because they first want to make a full investigation before giving the matter their final consideration. The question before the homeland leaders at this stage is not necessarily: &#x201C;Do you want independence, yes or no?&#x201D;. Discussion of independence with the homeland leaders is taking place and, Sir, the homeland leaders take part in this discussion. <span class="col_85-86" refersTo="page_0058"/>Discussion of independence is taking place between the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the elected governments of the Black peoples of South Africa, and they are playing a positive part in this discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a further matter raised by the hon. member is the issue of proprietory rights. He referred disparagingly to the investigation into leasehold that is to be instituted. But surely, Sir, the issue of proprietary rights in the White areas is bound up with many complicated questions. It is bound up with the issue of the right of the proprietary rights of Whites in the homelands. It is bound op with the issue of the proprietary rights of Whites in the Transkei, in the KwaZulu territory and in all the other territories. After all, there is another side to this matter. There is another side to all aspects relating to the homelands. What, do you think, would be the result if we were to throw open proprietary rights at any place within the borders of the present Republic of South Africa? Where, do you think, would the Whites go and buy? Do you think that anything would be left of the homelands, or would we have further economic enslavement by the financially powerful in South Africa?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, colonialization by money. No Sir, in this regard, too, the hon. member omitted to give us the whole picture, to mention or even to take cognizance of those aspects of the policy of the National Party which are positive and safeguard that which belongs to the Black nations. In his pronouncements on the unhappy lot of the urban Bantu, as he calls them, the hon. member omitted to take note of the steps that have been and are being taken by this Government to make these people&#x2019;s stay here a good and happy one. He omitted to make mention of the pleas and the steps taken by the National Party to ensure improved working conditions for them, to ensure an improved income for them. He omitted to make mention of the fund that has been established and that is administered by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, to provide them with better sporting and other facilities. He omitted to take note of what we are doing in respect of their education, their schools and universities, in respect of that which separate development gives the Black peoples of South Africa. No, once again we had the old picture of the National Party as a tyrant and a suppressor, which only takes and gives nothing in return. Then the hon. member comes along and states that the solution is federalism&#x2014;federalism in which the Whites are to play what role? We have now been waiting three years for a reply. Will it be a federalism in which full justice will be done to each Black nation in accordance with its numerical strength and in which it will share its say on the basis of numerical proportions in South Africa, or will it be a federalism in which it will have to be satisfied with a little and leave the power in the hands of the Whites? It will certainly not choose the latter. The hon. member asks what we will do if they do not want to accept independence. But what would the United Party do if they were to come to power? Preserve us from that, but if it were to happen and they were to offer these Black nations federation, and the Black leaders stated that they were dissatisfied with what they were offered by way of federation; that they would accept federation but on their own terms, what then? Would they, too, then, maintain the <i>status quo?</i> And if they were to come to power&#x2014;he talks about business rights, and he talks about migratory labour as his hon. Leader did&#x2014;would they throw open doors and say: Anyone who wants to may come to the business metropolis; simply let 30 000 or 40 000 or 100 000 people stream to that area in the course of a year; they are welcome? How would he control the slum conditions that would develop? No, Sir, when they have to provide the answers, they are silent, because they know that they themselves would be obliged to continue with these measures such as influx control and limitations on who may do business where and many other measures as well. Just as differentiation is a corner-stone of the policy of the National Party, that party and even the Progressives who base themselves on a foundation of multi-racialism are unable to get away from differentiation. Differentiation is built into their policy of federation, as they want it to be: differentiation in the sense of a greater representation of the Whites irrespective of his smaller numbers; differentiation as the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party said, when he eventually conceded that he would throw open the Sea Point swimming <span class="col_87-88" refersTo="page_0059"/>bath to everyone, that at least he would not throw open the schools to everyone; differentiation as reflected in their policy, in their Senate plan and their qualified franchise. In the final analysis there is consensus as regards this one point even though the other side does not want to recognize this, viz. that the White man has a right to protect his identity and that he does this by way of differentiation. What, however, is the tactic they employ in order to cast suspicion on the National Party&#x2019;s handling of this matter? Their tactic is to conceal and deny the fact that there is a distinction to be drawn between differentiation and discrimination. They simply refer haphazardly to the discriminatory measures we have, the same discriminatory measures which they and their children protect, the same discriminatory measures which they would continue with if they were to come into power. Let us briefly consider discrimination and differentiation.</p>

<p>Is it differentiation that the Government is now applying in the Nico Malan?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_klerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that shortly. Underlying the National Party&#x2019;s approach to discrimination, if I am to summarize the policy briefly, there is, firstly, the premise that a distinction must be drawn between discrimination and differentiation. Certain measures will always be maintained under this party and, I say, under the United Party as well, in order to ensure the identity of each people. It is surely also that party&#x2019;s policy as they have stated it, that each group is entitled to its identity and they will effect this by way of differentiation. Underlying the National Party&#x2019;s point of view in this regard is the conviction that it is the right of a people to maintain its own identity, that it is the right of a people to separate itself from other peoples, in the process of maintaining its identity, as often as it may consider it to be necessary. At the same time, however, it is also the conviction of this side that it recognizes the human dignity of all people. On occasion the hon. the Prime Minister expressed it in these terms (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Who am I as a creature of God to raise myself above any other creature created by God?</block>

<p>Because we recognize the human dignity of all people, the National Party wants to eliminate discrimination. That is why our ambassador at UN was able without hesitation to make the statement which he did and which was quoted by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. As far as the elimination of discrimination, viewed as a negative concept as against differentiation, is concerned, the National Party is just as adamant as any other person and just as adamant as any other party that it has declared itself in favour of its elimination. The hon. the Prime Minister expressly said this when he said that it was the destiny of the National Party to eliminate any discrimination that may exist. The third foundation stone of our policy as regards discrimination is that the National Party has committed itself and remains committed to its elimination, but in an orderly manner, viz. in such a way as not to disrupt law and order. This, then, is the standpoint of the National Party: It is against discrimination; it is against humiliation and insulting of people, against disregard of human dignity, but it stands for the maintaining of identity; it stands for law and order and for the prevention and elimination of friction. That is why it is in favour of differentiation. Hon. members opposite must recognize the necessity to draw a distinction between these two concepts. If we want to conduct a meaningful debate on this, we must not have smokescreens being raised by hon. members of the Opposition, as if all discrimination in South Africa can be laid at the door of this Government and as if all discrimination, seen as a whole, whether it be differentiation or discrimination, would disappear like mist in the sun if they were to come to power. If we are to conduct a meaningful debate on this matter, they must make certain admissions and stop doing certain things. If they do not stop doing those things and if they do not make the admissions, they may be a stumbling block on the road to the elimination of discrimination. They may then be a source of friction which would itself promote internal tension. What, then, are these acceptances and admissions I ask of the hon. members of the Opposition? In the first instance, they must accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the National Party when it states that it commits itself to the elimination of discrimination. At the same time, they must stop giving out that all steps taken so far are the fruits of their work and the pleas they have made. What the National Party <span class="col_89-90" refersTo="page_0060"/>has done, what it does and what it will do in this regard, it does because it wants to do it and because it believes that it is right and because it believes that it has been called upon to do it in terms of its Christian National character and not because it believes that the federalists of the United Party are actually possessed of the truth. As long as they persist in this attitude, they hamper the Government in the execution of its task. There should be no doubt on this score. The National Party is committed to the elimination of discrimination because that is its policy and because it believes that it should be so.</p>

<p>The second thing they must stop doing is criticizing each step taken by the Government, such as the development in respect of sporting matters, and saying that this is well and good but that a great deal remains to be done. The National Party and not the United Party is governing the country. Without detracting from their right to state their policy as an alternative&#x2014;that is their full right and they must do it, too&#x2014;if they want to make a meaningful contribution to the elimination of discrimination and to the improvement of the lot of the so-called urban Bantu, they must accept that steps in this regard will be taken within the framework of the National Party&#x2019;s policy. This will be done within the framework of the policy of maintaining our identity, of not sharing the say over our own people, of maintaining law and order and of elimination of areas of friction. The test, where criticism of the National Party&#x2019;s policy and attitude to discrimination are concerned, is not what their policy is. The test is whether we are doing it fairly and justly according to our policy. Within this framework of our policy we already have a good record and all the signs are there that we are developing the policy in a way which, on the one hand, will give every people the assurance that it has a future and that it will be allowed to take its rightful place in South Africa, that it has full opportunity to develop, and on the other hand also gives the assurance that what is troublesome, offensive, unnecessary and injurious to human dignity will be done away with. If we debate on this, let us debate the question whether a measure constitutes discrimination or whether it constitutes differentiation instead of just sowing further confusion and creating further expectations, because this, too, is often done. Where practically possible, and where it is in the interests of law and order, it must be accepted that the maintenance of our identity will be ensured, that in such cases, separate facilities and facilities for the various population groups may be provided and will be provided. At the same time it must be accepted that where it is desirable in practice, and where law and order and the identity of a people are not threatened, the National Party does not flinch from making facilities available to more than one people or group. I know that the members of the Opposition would prefer not to acknowledge this, but let us remind them again that their policy, their statement and those things that they stand for also imply the maintaining of differential measures. A third thing the hon. Opposition should stop doing if they want to make a contribution with regard to discrimination, is making a political football of the subject &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; in the sense that they want to use it to sow discord</p>

<p>That is different to what he said today. Those words he uttered, are fighting talk. I see, too, that he repeated those words here today. He comes along today and shakes his head and says that he still thinks so. He still thinks so after everything the hon. the Prime Minister has achieved in Southern Africa, after the acting leader of the Federal Party of the Coloureds has said: &#x201C;There are major breakthroughs. I am excited, I am satisfied, I am happy about the progress we are making. Something positive is being achieved.&#x201D; The hon. member still thinks so. Then he says that he is not making discrimination a political football, while as he sits there he knows that his Party also wants to differentiate. No, if they want to make a meaningful contribution they must stop calling our <i>bona fides</i> into question, casting suspicion on us, and they must at least have the courage to tell the Black and the Brown people of South ern Africa: We do not agree with the National Party, but we know that they are genuine. As long as they call our genuineness into question, we do not debate with them, we fight them.</p>

<p>In the fourth instance, the Opposition must accept that there is a relation between the acceptance of separate development in broad outline and the elimination of measures which may be irritating. If alleged discrimination is used&#x2014;as certain hon. members on that side want to use it &#x2014;as an arena or as a springboard from which to exert pressure on the Government, for political power in South Africa to be shared and for the Government to give up its policy of the sovereignty of each people over itself, they may be a stumbling block along the road to the abolition of certain discriminatory measures. Surely hon. members must see that in relation as separate development becomes established, as it becomes more than the policy of a party, as it changes the face of South Africa and as the sovereignty of each people over itself is secured and ensured thereby, certain measures which had previously been necessary for the protection of the identity of a national group will become superfluous. To sum up, if the Opposition wants to co-operate in a positive way to eliminate discrimination, they must accept our <i>bona fides</i> and acknowledge that separate development is not based on discrimination, they must acknowledge that differentiation is essential for the maintaining of law and order and the safeguarding of the identity of each people and reconcile themselves to the immediate existing validity&#x2014;even though it is not permanent from their point of view&#x2014; of separate development as the decisive policy that is going to determine what will happen.</p>

<p>The hon. Opposition can make a contribution, with the necessary pre-condition that they do not agree, by arguing, when discussing these matters, within the framework of multi-nationalism, and breaking away, for this purpose, from the framework of multi-racialism, that framework which they advocate. If the hon. members do not do this, the National Party will nevertheless continue as in the past to ensure the identity and self-determination of peoples with dedication and zeal. The National Party will continue to maintain law and order, without which freedom is useless, and it will continue to prevent friction, the precursor of unrest and disorder. At the same time the National Party will continue to eliminate discrimination and to extend and safeguard the human dignity of each person or group. There is no contradiction between the maintaining of identity and differentiation on the one hand and the elimination of discrimination on the other. The elimination of discrimination can take place simultaneously with these other things in a positive and virile fashion. We shall continue to safeguard what is ours in South Africa in a fair and Christian way and we shall continue to assist others towards full development and towards the acquiring of freedom, opportunity and prospects. The Opposition can play a role in this process, or it can continue to forfeit support among the voters as it has done in recent months. The Opposition can continue to deprive South Africa of the privilege of having an effective Opposition and it can continue along its downward path, or it can listen to the hon. members on this side of the House.

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that one takes part in the first debate of a session, because it gives one an opportunity to fire the first shots of the new season. The hon. member for Vereeniging attacked us on this side of <span class="col_93-94" refersTo="page_0062"/>the House in a very pious manner because we had accused the Nationalist Party of basing its policy on discrimination. We can remember only too well the Nationalist Party of former times. The hon. member praised the hon. the Deputy Minister because he was doing so much for the urban Bantu but we remember quite well that a member of the Cabinet under Nationalist Party government had said that we should not make matters in the cities too comfortable for the Bantu, because otherwise they would be staying there too long and would not want to return to the homelands. As far as sport is concerned, I just want to put the following question to the Nationalist Party: What would Minister Muller not give to have another chance of allowing Basil D&#x2019;Oliveira to come to South Africa with the M.C.C. team for which he had been selected? What would South Africa not give to have that chance again? What trouble did we not experience in this country on account of the actions of that Minister? Now people are splitting hairs about discrimination and differentiation, but these are merely so many words. Allow me to tell the hon. member on the other side that the Nationalist Party is based on such discrimination That party grew up with it. Words were even exchanged in the newspapers between the members of that party, for example, the hon. members for Pretoria Central and Waterberg, as to whether or not the party was discriminating. I say that the hon. member has no right to accuse us of attacking the Nationalist Party for something which is not true. It is a fact that the Nationalist Party is based on the concept of discrimination, and he cannot get away from that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;To come back to the real problems that are facing South Africa, there is a threshold which in the words of the Prime Minister and of other Ministers, the Nationalist Party can never cross, namely to share wealth and power with Black South Africa. In this country we are moving towards the stage where Black people&#x2014;I use the word collectively to include the Indians and Coloureds&#x2014;are demanding more and more of White South Africa. One of the things they are demanding is a share in what is done to them by the Government of South Africa. We can say what we like, we can listen to all the nice words, the pious hopes and dreams of the Nationalist Party, but there is one threshold they will not cross and that is to share wealth and power with the Black man in this country. The hon. member for Durban North dealt with the position of the urban Blacks who are a permanent factor in the equation that makes up South Africa. There is not a person in this House today who can say to me that the urban Blacks are not a permanent part of our population and a factor that must be taken into account politically. Whatever arrangements may possibly be made to include them in the aegis of the political leaders of the Black homelands, they will remain in the urban areas in White South Africa and they will be a factor with which we will have to reckon for all time. What does the Nationalist Party have to offer to Black South Africa and especially to the urban Blacks, the Indians and Coloureds? My hon. leader has already said that by the end of this century 3 million of the 5 million people who are in leadership positions in the economy of South Africa will be Black.</p>

<p>That represents a very real problem. While the Nationalist Party pauses before this threshold which they cannot cross, history waits and while it waits the destiny of the White man in South Africa is going to remain unfulfilled because of the inability of that party to take the step that is necessary in the present time in which we live. History waits and our destiny is going to be unfulfilled. It is unfulfilled for one reason: Africa is looking for leadership; this continent of Africa which has undergone such tremendous changes&#x2014;in the old days, the &#x201C;good old days&#x201D;, the map was red from Cape to <span class="col_95-96" refersTo="page_0063"/>Cairo&#x2014;is today a coat of many colours. Today this is a coat of many colours and it is waiting for leadership. There is no such thing in nature as a vacuum. If we who are the actual leaders of Africa do not step into the space that has been left by the withdrawal of the metropolitan powers, we know very well who will be waiting in the wings to do so. Even today she is reaching out that iron claw to smite into the vitals of Africa. We know that the Communist Party is waiting to supply the leadership which because of the inability of the Government to meet the needs of South Africa today, we are unable to supply. I want to say that there is an alternative to White power in Africa. White power is gone. The alternative is what this country, South Africa, can supply, led as it is by ourselves in association with the Black people here in South Africa where we White people, because we are here are breaking new ground. We are giving a new vision, a new dimension to life in Africa. We are doing this but the full consequences of it can never be met until that Nationalist Party crosses the threshold that I have mentioned. It has to move out into Africa. That threshold has to be crossed at home. We have to have solidity among our own people. We have to have their solid support, their whole attention. We must have everything that they can give not only to South Africa but to Africa as a whole.</p>

<p>I have not been decrying the role of the White man. That is one thing I have not been doing. I have been laying the sins of the Government at the Government&#x2019;s door. It has become fashionable today, as I say, to decry the role of the White man. It is said that we are living too high off the hog, that we own too much, that we do not give a sufficiently fair share to other people. I think that it is time we took a closer look at ourselves in a historical perspective. We must know that the gap between White and Black is a historic thing and cannot be eliminated simply by waving a wand It is not something which can disappear overnight. I think it is vitally important that we should say and that people should realize that there are many people who tend to attack the White man for being selfish. They should realize that what is happening is a process of upliftment and change in which Black South Africa is involved and from which Black South Africa draws every single day more and more advantage. I say that this process is something which has profound implications for Black South Africa as well as for White South Africa. It is a process that is fuelled by our knowledge, by our capital and by our ability to organize. It is also run on the ability of the Black man to supply the labour that turns the wheels. Together Black South Africa and White South African can change the history of Africa. I think that we are the only people who can stem the tide which is threatening to engulf Africa at this time. We hear all about freedom. Freedom is a catchword. It has been well said that when people asked for bread they were give a vote. I think that the expression &#x201C;freedom&#x201D; in Africa is something which requires a new definition. We have heard of the Atlantic Charter. Some years ago when certain freedoms such as the freedom of speech, of religion, of assembly and so forth were enunciated, I believe that they were freedoms enunciated by a group of White nations to suit their own particular situation. In modern terms this is probably what we could call a White chauvinist approach. We need something new in Africa. We need a new definition of freedom. Freedom in Africa has got to mean a lot more than it does now. It has to mean freedom from fear, from want, from corruption and from instability. I think that we should realize that democracy, which is something which we desire for all people, without stability is the biggest farce and the worst system of government that anyone has ever thought up. This has been proved in country after country. We only have to look at South America. Some of those South American Republics have been free, independent Republics for 150 years and yet have not had a continuous ten year period of stable government, stable democratic government, without military takeover, <i>coups d&#x2019;état</i> or revolution.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that Africa today faces this situation. The population curve is rising and, commensurate with the rise of population, the curve of expectation has got to fall simply because they have not <span class="col_97-98" refersTo="page_0064"/>got enough production to meet the rising expectations of a rising population, and I believe that it is when those curves cross that you get revolution, and revolution in itself has not achieved real freedom in any of the countries of Africa where we have seen it. I think it is important to realize that we here in South Africa have got stability because the White man is here &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Sneaker, hon, members on that side are quick to seize for themselves the credit, but there is a great deal that has happened in South Africa in the very teeth of every single thing they have ever preached and thought about and attempted to practise over the many years that they have been in power. As I said before, you have seen the flood of Black people into the towns, people who are voting with their feet, people who have gone against every wish of the hon. the Minister who sits over there and who has done his level best to keep them in the homelands. They have flooded into the towns in spite of everything that this Nationalist Party has tried to achieve. They have gone to the towns because only there can they expect to share in the modern thing and the new thing that is happening, in the wealth that is being generated. Mr. Speaker, let us face one thing: Wealth pays for education; it pays for health services; it pays for progress, it pays for everything that change means to Black Africa, and I believe that we in this country are one of the very few countries in Africa, if not the only country in Africa, who can face the challenge of that rising population, with rising expectations, who have to be catered for.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I come back to the point as to whether this Nationalist Party can fulfil the destiny that we have got. I go so far as to say that it cannot fulfil the destiny that the White man has in this continent of Africa because they are incapable of crossing the threshold which says that they can share wealth and power with Black South Africa in this country of ours.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the policy of the United Party is designed to bring about a sharing of power in South Africa with the Black people. The sharing of wealth is something which is happening today in spite of everything that the Nationalist Party might have thought it was going to do in the past to prevent it. What is happening today is the sharing of wealth by people participating in the growing expansion of the industrial scene in South Africa, where Black people are moving up in the ranks of every single trade union and of every single organization which brings wealth because of employment. That is sharing of wealth. I do not mean people coming here and swiping the living of other people; I mean a change whereby people take part in a change-over of wealth by reason of their participation in the economy of the country. Mr. Speaker, the internal peace which that brings, the consciousness that these people have that they are participating in a real, meaningful change, is what gives us hope and what gives Africa hope and makes us the country that we are a country that holds out hope to our neighbours and makes us the rallying point, a bastion, upon which our neighbours can look, because they know that we have got the ability and the basic attitude of White to Black which can lead us to help our neighbouring countries, not for selfish reasons but because we are interested in them. But I want to say that we must start off from this point of view that Black South Africa is the only ally that White South Africa has in the world. We have no other allies. We have no other real friends in the world except the Black people who live in this country.</p>

<p>Do you really believe that?</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>The only real friends we have in the world are the Black people who live in this country. Other people will help us because it suits them. They will help us because we are in a strategic position. They will help us because we are in a position to help them to defend their own interests somewhere else in the world. But the Black population of this country has more to gain by our being here and continuing to operate than anyone else in the world. Only we can bring them the sort of benefits that can come from real change. I know, Sir, and you know that there was a time a couple of years ago when the word &#x201C;change&#x201D; was a swear-word. It is not a swear-word any <span class="col_99-100" refersTo="page_0065"/>more. Change is happening. It is happening even under the Nationalist Party. Things are changing in South Africa. One wonders how many of the old corner-stones of the Nationalist Party have been swept away because of the rapid rush towards change that is taking place. It is only in the attitude of that party that no change is apparent. It is a sort of antediluvian rock-painting of a party, sitting there without change, implanted in the rock, immemorial. [Interjections.] I want to say, with all the sincerity in the world, that what perturbs me is that this party is founded on the nationalism of Afrikanerdom and it has come to a dead end. The Nationalist Party has come to a dead end where it cannot progress out of the coils of the past. [Interjections.] If hon. members think that is a joke, I would invite them to tell us what they propose to do in South Africa, when every single element of the policy which the Nationalist Party has expounded over the years has been rejected. The hon. member for Durban North dealt with it. The hon. members say that at this point of time the Black leaders have refused to accept independence. When will they accept independence? What does the party offer them to make them accept independence? What do they propose for the Black people living in the urban areas? Now you have the Coloured community and the Indian community being offered something which every person knows is merely a stopgap. It can never be anything else. I say this concerns me, and I am not an Afrikaner. I have discussed this with my Afrikaner friends and asked them what I should do to become an Afrikaner, and they said it was impossible; a person cannot become an Afrikaner. The whole essence of the struggle of Afrikanerdom has brought them into a laager, shut away by this Nationalist Party from occurrences in the world. [Interjections.] Sir, hon. members must have a good look at themselves, because I want to say that there is a part which White South Africans can play in the world which is of absolutely vital significance in the struggle going on in the world for the minds of the third world. Sir, this is not a struggle which will be fought with arms and weapons; it is a struggle which will be fought with ideas and even ideologies. That is how the struggle will be fought, and we are the people who are experienced in leadership in Africa. We have had the experience of leading people out of the backwardness, the squalor and the degradation of Africa.</p>

<p>We have had the experience of leading them out into a new scene altogether into a new sunlit scene. We should be the people who should be setting the tone and giving the lead. That is what our position should be. We should not be the &#x201C;muishond van die wêreld&#x201D;; we should be the people who should be listened to with respect, because we know. We are of Africa and we know the problem. However, the problem is that the Nationalist Party can never, without a basic change of heart right inside the party itself, fulfil the destiny that the White man has or should have in the world situation which we face. Let us face one thing: Africa is an open field; it is today a power, a vacuum and it is our destiny to step into that vacuum&#x2014;not as White people, not as colonialists, not as paternalists, but as people who are used to and who know how to work together with Black people and to lead them, to inspire them and to work together to create something real, positive and constructive. I say, till the Nationalist Party changes its heart we shall never cross that threshold, we shall never attain the destiny which we ought to have in the continent of Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, almost 27 years ago I was elected to this House for the first time. So for almost 27 years I have had the privilege to serve in this House. That is a long time in the working life of any person. This being the last day I shall be granted to act in this capacity in this House, I should like to avail myself of the opportunity to say good-bye, I should like to avail myself of the opportunity to give thanks where thanks are due, and I should like to avail myself of the opportunity for the last time to make a few observations on the financial-economic conditions prevailing in the world and in South Africa as I see them.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I am to retire from active politics at the very time when the economic and financial conditions all over the world are fraught with problems and challenges such as have seldom been experienced in times of peace. Each one of us who has made a study of what goes on in the world today will find that a gradual deterioration of economic conditions has taken place in the last two years, and not only a gradual deterioration of economic conditions, but also an increasing pessimism about the future of the world has taken root. I should like to deal with that presently, but before doing so, I should like to express a few words of thanks. In the first place I should like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, as well as all the Speakers who preceded you and with whom I have been able to co-operate. I am pleased to be able to remind myself of the fact that during the full period of my membership of this House it has never been necessary for any Speaker to apply disciplinary measures against me. I am especially pleased about the privilege I have had to become personally better acquainted with you, as I have had the opportunity to co-operate with you in my capacity as Leader of the House. In the second place I should like to express my thanks towards the Secretary and the Secretaries of this House for their kind assistance, more particularly in the time I have been Leader of this House. In the third place, I should like to express my thanks towards my own staff. I think that this is a suitable occasion to say how grateful I feel towards the Secretaries of my departments. I refer to the Secretary for Finance, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Secretary for Internal Revenue, the Secretary for Customs and Excise, and the heads of financial institutions in all the various branches of those departments. I should like to address a special word of thanks to Mr. Browne, the Secretary for Finance, who, in the eight years for which I have been Minister of Finance, has been by my side, who has been my prop and stay and who has accompanied me over the years on most of the journeys I have undertaken abroad. I should also like to avail myself of the opportunity to express my thanks towards people in foreign countries, towards the very many people I have seen over the years in connection with financial and economic issues, and towards the great number of friends I have made in all parts of the world, friends who have not only broadened my outlook, but who have also given me new insight and have helped me to understand something more of the international problems of the world.</p>

<p>To come back to this House, I should like to turn to the Opposition first of all. In the course of time the Opposition has changed completely. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Griqualand East are the only remaining members of the 1948 group. I should like to express my thanks towards the Opposition for the fact that, although we have had many differences of opinion in the course of those years and have had many hard fights, there has never been any feeling of malice. I now leave this chamber with the feeling and with the assurance that I harbour no ill-feeling against any of you. I should also like to express my thanks towards the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;we who have walked this road together for almost 27 years&#x2014;for the friendly words which he expressed about me yesterday. I should like to give him the assurance that I sincerely appreciate them. I should like to express my thanks towards those hon. members on this side of the House with whom I have served for so many years. In the course of time they <span class="col_103-104" refersTo="page_0067"/>have changed so that the hon. the Minister of Defence, the hon. member for Turffontein, and I are the only three who remain of the 1948 group. In this connection I thank hon. members on this side of the House for the trust they placed in me by nominating me for the highest office in this country. I also thank the members of the Cabinet with whom I have served. It is not easy for a Minister of Finance because he must often say &#x201C;no&#x201D; as well as limit the splended plans of other people. Consequently it is not easy for a Minister of Finance to retain the friendship of his colleagues. I am retiring from the Cabinet now, but I do so with the feeling and in the knowledge that I have retained the friendship and respect of my colleagues in the Cabinet. In conclusion I come to the hon. the Prime Minister. I have taken the opportunity on various occasions to express my deeply felt thanks towards the hon. the Prime Minister and consequently I do not so want to do so again now. I should only like to say that it has been a privilege for me as Minister of Finance to have served under him for eight years. I should like to express the hope and the earnest desire that the peace efforts which he is now making inside and outside South Africa to ensure greater peace and co-operation in our country and neighbouring countries will be richly blessed.</p>

<p>I return now to the question of finance and the economy, which I should like to deal with here. I said that I am now retiring from public life in my present capacity at a time when dark clouds are hanging over the whole world in the field of economy and finance, clouds which are so dark that there are some people who say that the world is heading for a catastrophe and that we must prepare ourselves as nations and as individuals for that catastrophe, and that only a catastrophe, a world disaster, will mark the onset of recovery in this field. Let us now consider a few aspects of the present world position with respect to finance and the economy. There are a few pointers which determine where the world stands and where it is going.</p>

<p>In the first place I should like to refer to the question of balance of payments. Throughout the world today there are few countries that are not struggling with the problem of balance of payments, which means that most countries are sending more money out of the country than is coming in. That also means that those countries have to incur ever-increasing debts. Few countries in the world are in such a favourable position today that they are able to pay their foreign debts. This is one of the greatest problems with which a country can ever be confronted, viz. when it has an unfavourable balance of payments and does not have the money to pay its trading partner from whom it imports. These balance of payment problems which are being experienced throughout the world today, are caused by many factors. In the first place they have been caused by the tremendous shock which humanity experienced when the price of crude oil was quadrupled at the end of 1973. I do not believe that we in this country and many people elsewhere in the world were able to realize what a shock that deed was to humanity and its economy. Only today are we slowly beginning to realize what this will mean for us. It was a deep shock which resulted in nations being robbed of oil and their production being adversely affected. This means in particular that many more nations are in the position that they are no longer able to pay for the oil which they import. If we consider that the oil exporting nations are today in the position where they will have approximately 65 milliard dollars in surpluses every year, and that with one year&#x2019;s surplus they are virtually able to buy all the shares on the German stock exchange, we realize the magnitude of this problem. If we think of the smaller and undeveloped countries which are now hard-hit as far as their production is concerned, and do not have the money to pay for their oil, and when we look at larger countries that are in the same position, we realize that an economic disaster, such as has seldom occurred in times of peace, has befallen the world. When attempts are made today to reduce the consumption of oil, to find more and more surrogates for oil and to find new oil resources, one realizes that it will only be in four or five years&#x2019; time that these attempts will produce results. What will happen in the four or five years till then, however, we cannot foresee. Within the framework of the Monetary Fund attempts are being made today to establish all sorts of facilities for giving credit to countries that have balance of payments problems as a result of the oil price. Even those facilities will only be partially effective. Not all countries will derive the same benefit from <span class="col_105-106" refersTo="page_0068"/>them. It remains a fact, however, that the advantages which will arise from these facilities create a debt with which these nations will be burdened. Therefore this does not offer a solution to the problem. Many countries which are burdened by an oil shortage today are not even capable of paying the interest on that debt. I think that at present we still have no realization whatsoever of the real meaning of the oil debt which rests on the shoulders of humanity.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is a danger, viz. the danger of diminishing production. When production drops, a country is faced with the danger that there will also be a lowering of the standard of living of its people. Therefore it is the aim of every State and every Government permanently to encourage the production of goods and services in its country. We are now experiencing a period of diminishing production. Think for example of what the production of two powerful countries, the United States and Germany, was during the past year. In the United States the volume of production slumped in the past year by 2,2%, and at the end of the year it slumped even further. In a powerful state such as West Germany the volume of production of goods and services rose in 1974 by only half per cent. From these figures can be seen where we stand in respect of production in the world as a whole.</p>

<p>A third problem with which the world has to contend today is the problem of inflation. We speak and hear of inflation every day. For years and years, throughout the world, this disease which afflicts all of mankind, even the communist countries, has been raging. However, no one has succeeded in finding an answer to this problem. We find that a reaction to inflation on the part of most countries and people is now beginning to set in. This gives rise to the psychological problem of despondency, as if a disaster is really awaiting mankind. It is because of the untamableness of this inflation that people are going to meet the future with despondency. What is happening now, is that States are beginning to apply measures, not only to stop inflation, but also to stimulate their economies, and with that attempt they are encouraging further inflation.</p>

<p>I now come to a fourth phenomenon. That is the phenomenon of increasing unemployment. It is something to ponder when an unemployment rate of almost 8% is prevailing in the powerful America. That means a much greater percentage of unemployed persons among the non-Whites, viz. the Negroes. That means an ever-increasing percentage of unemployment among the young Negroes. Today nations are beginning to take fright at the effect of unemployment on the young people, at the effect of riots and even revolution among the unemployed in various countries.</p>

<p>We now have the strange phenomenon of conflict in policy-making so that, in the midst of inflation, nations are once again stimulating their economies, and nations are coming to the conclusion that inflation is, in fact, an evil, but that recession is a greater evil and that they do not want a higher inflation rate, and still less a higher unemployment rate. This is the contradiction we find in the world today. On the one hand inflation is being combated, but to the extent to which inflation is being combated, the possibility of a recession increases. On the other hand a recession is being combated and to the extent to what that attempt is successful, the fires of inflation are being fed. The economic leaders of the world are really finding themselves at the cross-roads today, viz. the dual struggle which has to be waged against inflation on the one hand a recession on the other. They do not know what the answer is, nor what the methods should be.</p>

<p>I ask myself the question: What of South Africa? Where do we stand in this constellation of economic facts? Naturally this has to affect us. We are not isolated from the world; we are part of the world economy. We are dependent on foreign countries for the acquisition of capital and for the price of that capital. We are an exporting country and a country which imports on large scale and although our economy is small, we are one of the 15 most important countries as far as foreign trade is concerned. Conditions will not leave us untouched. However, we find that our circumstances are somewhat different from those in other countries. Let us now take those four aspects again and compare the position of South Africa with that of the world.</p>

<p>Firstly, as far as balance of payments problems are concerned, we are fortunate in that we are one of the few countries in the world&#x2014;with the exception of the oil producing and exporting countries&#x2014;that have no acute balance of payments problems. In recent times there were weeks <span class="col_107-108" refersTo="page_0069"/>when our reserves dropped rapidly for certain reasons, but if we look back over a period of weeks and months, we see a slowly rising line which indicates that there has been an addition to our reserves. If we had revalued the gold content of our reserves in terms of the actual free gold price, we would have had high foreign reserves today. Our balance of payments is, however, reasonably healthy. To what can we attribute our reasonably healthy balance of payments? In the first place it is attributable to the fact that we are not dependent on oil to the same extent as other countries. While other countries are dependent on oil for the acquisition of energy to an extent of 50%, 60% or even as much as 80%, South Africa is just over 20% dependent on oil for the generation of energy. In the second place, we are in a fortunate position because we have our gold which earns foreign exchange for us. Now we must not think that we, because we have gold, are a fortunate nation. On the ore hand we are indeed fortunate, but on the other we can also say that it is unfortunate that we did not, for the past 10 to 15 years, receive for gold the price that it was worth, while the prices of all other commodities rose. For 15 to 20 years we have been deprived of the privilege of receiving a truly realistic price for our gold. Now we have it, because gold has come into its own. I believe that in spite of the efforts of those who wanted to oppose the role of gold, and in spite of the fact that there will continue to be fluctuations, gold will play an increasingly important role in our own financial life and an increasingly important role in the international world.</p>

<p>But it is not only gold alone. If one looks at the tremendous volume of imports of our country and the high cost of the imports over the past few years, one finds that we are able to afford this because South Africa had a high volume of exports, exports of all sorts of commodities&#x2014; raw materials, food, and so on. South Africa is developing soundly in other fields as well and is becoming an exporting country, which will strengthen its balance of payments. That is all I want to say as far as the balance of payments position is concerned.</p>

<p>In the second place we come to the question of growth. If we compare favourably to other countries with respect to our balance of payments, we do so all the more with respect to the question of growth. I have mentioned that America had a minus growth of 2,2% last year and Germany a plus growth of half per cent. Over against that South Africa had a growth of 7%. I think that it is an achievement for us to have maintained an average of 5% real growth per year over the past 25 years, and that in the past year our growth was one of the highest among comparable nations, viz. 7%. Even if there is a slowing down in our growth this year, it will be a healthy slowing down which will bring with it a consolidation and prepare us for further growth in the times which lie ahead. I do not have the time to go into this, but I believe firmly that from next year onwards South Africa will grow as never before, and experience an unprecedented period of prosperity. I ask only that our people make use of the opportunity which they now have, so as to prepare themselves for the period of growth awaiting our country in future.</p>

<p>As far as the question of inflation is concerned, I concede that we also have inflation. One could even say that our inflation is high. There are a few countries in the world that have a lower inflation rate, but the most comparable countries have an inflation rate which is far higher than ours. Our inflation rate is high, but the level of prices, the basis on which everything is reckoned, is lower in South Africa than in most other countries. Those of you who have recently had the privilege of visiting foreign countries would have found that the level of prices in general was far higher in foreign countries than it is here in South Africa. We have had inflation and we still have it, but we have one thing which other countries do not have, and that is that we have growth together with inflation. It is a terrible thing to have inflation and no growth. It is something to be grateful for if a country, although it has inflation, also has a high growth rate. In our case it is a growth rate of 7%.</p>

<p>In the fourth place I referred to the question of unemployment. I told you of the dangers of unemployment, such as riots and revolutions which could go hand in hand with it, and which are feared by people in other parts of the world. South Africa has no unemployment. South Africa has, on the contrary, a shortage of workers as far as skilled workers are concerned. Even among the unskilled workers there is really no unemployment in our <span class="col_109-110" refersTo="page_0070"/>country. There is a scarcity of unskilled workers on our farms and in our mines. Consequently there is no unemployment. When we think of the numerous undertakings initiated by the State and State Corporations, such as the construction of railways, telecommunications, the harbours which are being built, the mines which are being established, television, the large Sasol works which the Government is proceeding with again, and numerous other works, then we see that we have plans before us and undertakings which we want to proceed with for which we will require all our manpower in South Africa.</p>

<p>In this way we are not only creating employment opportunities, but we would simply be stimulating the economy and the industries which are dependent on those projects even further. This will bring money into circulation, which will create even greater prosperity in South Africa. This is the situation in which we find ourselves. We are grateful that we do not find ourselves in the position of those countries in which the Governments have almost given up hope and the entrepreneurs have almost become despondent or in which the trade unions have sometimes become powerful organizations and are acting irresponsibly towards the interests of others. We are grateful that we do not find ourselves in that position.</p>

<p>We in South Africa should be grateful that we can enter the future with confidence. Our position is so different from that of many other people that even if a catastrophe were to occur in the world, even if the disaster for which many people are preparing themselves were to occur&#x2014; and I do not believe that such a disaster will occur&#x2014;South Africa would be one of the few developed countries in the world that would be able to survive it. We will be able to survive it because we have the basic goods and because we have the fundamental commodities on which a nation can live.</p>

<p>Even if the greatest economic disaster were to befall the world, we would be able to survive. We have things which the world needs and here I am referring to our minerals and metals, to our gold, sugar, coal and our food for a starving world. There is no other country in the world that is made up in the same way our country is, and because this is so, I believe in the future of my nation. I know that other countries in the world are beginning to realize this. People who were always concerned about the internal problems of South Africa, now realize that they themselves have internal problems as well. What country does not have internal problems? People who were always concerned about the external problems of South Africa, now realize that they themselves have external problems as well, for what country does not have external problems. In the present dispensation people are beginning to see South Africa as a country which can govern in Southern Africa and can unite the peoples in and around South Africa and can lead them all to great prosperity.</p>

<p>In that spirit I want to conclude by saying to you: I remain an optimist, a realistic optimist who reckons with the realities of our time, a realistic optimist because I believe that we will grow in the economic financial field and will become great in this country, and that we will become a leader in Africa and in large parts of the world. All that is necessary is that we will have to preserve our confidence in the future. We must have faith and not give up hope. Confidence in itself is not enough however &#x2014;we shall also have to work. If we remain confident and if we all keep working. I believe that the future will be a golden future for all the peoples of our country, South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although this time yesterday afternoon the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke at some length and bade our official farewells, as did other hon. members of this House, to the hon. the Minister of Finance upon his retirement from this House, I do not think, bearing in mind that this is the last occasion. I believe, on which the hon. gentleman will have addressed us in his present capacity and in this Place, that I can allow the occasion to pass this afternoon without a word or two in that regard. The hon. gentleman leaves us very shortly to, as it were, go into retreat prior to taking on the highest office that this country can offer one. I think it is appropriate that I say something very briefly on this occasion. I have always admired the hon. the Minister because he has had the rare capacity of being able to combine the finesse and the ability to argue in that rare atmosphere of high finance and economics with the ability to mix it in the rough and tumble of political debate with the best of us. That is a very rare and useful combination indeed and is one of the <span class="col_111-112" refersTo="page_0071"/>many attributes which, I think, has earned for the hon. gentleman the high distinction which he enjoys in the opinion of all in this House and outside.</p>

<p>One has listened to him for eight years, I think he said, during which he has held his present office, and I do not think that there is anybody who has not always listened to speeches of the most acute interest from the hon. gentleman, expressing thoughts of great originality which, together with his other attributes, have earned him the standing which he enjoys not only here but throughout the civilized world. Sir, the name &#x201C;Mr. Gold&#x201D;, which I believe is used in some quarters, is appropriate not only because he represents the country which produces that commodity but because what he offers so often has the quality of that commodity as well. So much, Sir, of the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s past and the respect we have for him, built up over a period of time. He has delivered himself this afternoon of his usual erudite speech, and were I to be put up to deal with it on its merits I would feel compelled to use that phrase which I heard once used by the late Piet van der Byl when, resplendent in his highly starched linen, he said, &#x201C;I am only a simple farmer&#x201D;.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I should like to add this simple reflection of how I see the situation and how I have summed up the point of view of the hon. gentleman over the years. I put it no doubt quite differently, but as I see it,. Sir, one of our problems today is the inconsistency which at present exists between the requisite monetary discipline which we need to put our affairs in order and the pressures of modern democracy on the basis of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, and until the powers of the world&#x2014;and that includes us&#x2014;can solve that problem and thereafter restore the discipline of gold. I am afraid all the paper money in the world, the credits of the world, will not see our position put right. But now, Sir, the hon. gentleman will shortly move elsewhere into a far more rarefied atmosphere than we are accustomed to here, and because I believe that he has enjoyed being with us from time to time, I venture to suggest that in his new place, should he feel that he would like to enjoy once again just a taste of what he enjoyed here, I am quite sure that there are those present who would be only too happy to respond to an invitation which he might like to extend to some of us to visit him in that other place to which he is going. Suffice it to say, Sir, that he goes from this place with our deep respect and our deep affection and I wish him the greatest of good luck in his new office.</p>

<p>I come back now&#x2014;one might say, going from the sublime to the ridiculous&#x2014;to a no-confidence debate.</p>

<p>Are you going to talk about his successor?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to say a word or two about the speech of the hon. member for Vereeniging, who is not here unfortunately. I do not want it to be thought that I am referring to his speech as ridiculous; that was not my intention. I would like to say a word or two about his speech before I continue with what I have to say. Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman sought to distinguish between differentiation and discrimination in so far as Government policy is concerned.</p>

<p>He spoke at some length on the fact that the Nationalist Party, whilst it stood for the phasing out and the removal of discrimination on the grounds of race or colour, nevertheless stood for differentiation between the various racial groups in South Africa. You know, Sir, I had some difficulty, whilst I was listening to him, in distinguishing between discrimination and differentiation and so I had to resort to the dictionaries. I found that one of the appropriate definitions of differentiation was &#x201C;to distinguish between&#x201D;, whilst the definition of discrimination is also &#x201C;to distinguish between&#x201D;. It is only in the modern idiom, Sir, if you look at the dictionaries, that you find that discrimination has taken on an adverse connotation because it has been used to discriminate against people. But, Sir, this play on words gets us absolutely nowhere at all. You know, Sir, we once had the word apartheid, which became unpopular and so we changed it to separate development. But the policy, whether under the one label or the other, did not alter. So you find that the word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; has become unpopular and has been changed to differentiation whilst in fact the policy that is applied is the same. So you are solving nothing at all. It is like the favourite communist technique where when a policy becomes unpopular, they change the label but not the policy. That has precisely been the trouble in the past&#x2014;I emphasize that&#x2014;with the Nationalist Government. It does not matter whether it uses <span class="col_113-114" refersTo="page_0072"/>the word &#x201C;discriminate&#x201D; or the word &#x201C;differentiation&#x201D;. It depends on what it does in terms of that differentiation or that discrimination, i.e. whether it does things which are hurtful to people or whether it does not. It is not the term you use; it is the policy you apply as the result of that.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman has said other things in this regard. He said, with emphasis, that the Nationalist Party was against discrimination. This, Sir, is a most welcome development, and he pleaded with us to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government in this regard, to accept the sincerity of the spokesmen for the Government in this regard when they say that they are against discrimination and that the value differentiation only in those fields where there is a constructive connotation to be given to it. But, Mr. Speaker, let us go back in time a little. This did not start yesterday. It started in 1948. The Nationalist Government during a period of 10 years or more after 1948 introduced hurtful discriminatory measures into fields where no discrimination at that time existed. That is what they did. It was petty apartheid upon which emphasis was laid in those years. While that was done, does it surprise anybody that discrimination has taken on in South Africa a particularly unpleasant connotation and that the Nationalist Government has been labelled with that unpleasant connotation? Now the hon. gentleman says &#x201C;hy is teen diskriminasie en hy is teen vernedering en belediging van mense en teen miskenning van menswaardigheid, maar staan die handhawing van identiteit voor. Hy staan goeie orde en die voorkoming en uitskakeling van wrywing voor, en daarom is hy ten gunste van differensiasie&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, there is no lack of common ground between myself and this side of the House, and the hon. gentleman in so far as the preservation of identity is concerned. That is why we adopt a federal policy based upon identifiable communities, because we believe in the maintenance of identity. That is the cardinal difference between the federal policy of the Progressive Party and our own, because they dispense with the maintenance of the identity of communities. Now, Sir, he says he stands for good order, So do we on this side of the House. He says too that he stands for &#x201C;die uitskakeling van wrywing&#x201D;, the removal of friction. So do we, Sir, and that is why we adopt the federal policy. But that is no basis upon which to justify the actions of the Nationalist Party in the sphere of discrimination over the last 20 years.</p>

<p>And finally, Sir, in reference to the utterances of the Black leaders and their rejection at this point of time of any idea of asking for independence, he said, &#x201C;daar sal nog bespreking wees&#x201D;. He said that there would still be discussions and that one must therefore not give too much attention to the statement of the Black leaders rejecting independence at the present time, with one or two exceptions. But, Mr. Speaker, we know that those discussions have taken place. They are referred to specifically in the summit Press release by the Black leaders themselves. They say that they have considered in depth and at length the question of independence and they know precisely the basis upon which it is to be offered by the hon. the Prime Minister. He has made it clear over and over again&#x2014; he made it clear yesterday&#x2014;that is to be strictly on the basis of the 1936 legislation and on the basis of the Government&#x2019;s existing consolidation plans. That is the only basis upon which the Prime Minister is prepared to discuss independence, and it is on that very basis that it has been rejected, after consideration and after discussions with the hon. the Prime Minister. Now, Sir, how can one then any longer hold out hope in the direction of acceptance of independence by the Black leaders with, as I have said, two exceptions? Mr. Speaker, one has only to state that proposition to realize that it is untenable.</p>

<p>But, Sir, we are involved in a no-confidence debate, and the point has arisen on a number of occasions as to why we were not highly congratulatory of the Government and the Prime Minister for actions and statements, principally statements, which have been made recently in regard to South Africa&#x2019;s affairs. The euphoria which has been referred to by other speakers from this side of the House should I believe be examined in the light of what the Government has said it will do and what it has done, because a no-confidence debate is the place for the clash of philosophy against philosophy and policy against policy. What we should do is to examine what has taken place, to see where the credit lies, because there is a general desire to give credit for what has been done. I believe that this is the right place to examine what has, been done and to see whether it is the philosophy and the policy of separate development which deserves that credit and that euphoria, or whether that credit lies <span class="col_115-116" refersTo="page_0073"/>with a policy and a philosophy elsewhere. I believe the answer will be in the latter respect.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, first of all there was the United Nations speech by our ambassador there, rejecting discrimination. It was a very welcome statement but, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, it was largely directed to a future course of conduct rather than to what has been done in the past. Then, domestically, there have been announcements in regard to the Nico Malan Theatre, travelling on luxury trains and matters of that kind. What has been the policy of the United Party since 1961? It is laid down in the much-maligned &#x201C;sixpenny handbook&#x201D; that used to be so derided in this House that it has been policy of this side of the House over the last 13 years, to my knowledge&#x2014;I only came here in 1961&#x2014;to review all discriminatory legislation in order to see if we could not do away with that which was hurtful and which impinged upon the dignity of individuals. That was put forward and requested by this side of the House in 1961. We are told today that this is the standpoint of the Government and how welcome that is, but when it comes to where the credit lies for that point of view, I believe that one should be a little more discerning. There is the South African detente that is largely in the field of foreign affairs. It arises largely out of the intelligent and sensible negotiation by the Government&#x2014; I give them credit for that&#x2014;in respect of the needs of South Africa, the needs of Zambia and the needs of Rhodesia. I believe that in the field of foreign affairs credit can legitimately be said to lie with the Government.</p>

<p>But let us come to the negotiations with the Black leaders. What were the points that were raised? There was a request&#x2014; not only from those Black leaders who refuse independence, but also from those Black leaders who accept independence&#x2014; that those urban Bantu of the second or third generation who did not actively associate themselves with the homelands should be accepted as permanent in White South Africa. At this meeting with the Black leaders I think it is fair to say that both on the credit and the debit side, the honour and the glory if it is there, or the reverse if it is there, rest not only with the Prime Minister, but also with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and his two deputies because they were all involved in these negotiations and in what transpired. But what came out? As a result of the request for permanence and civic rights it was said that leasehold would be examined for the urban Bantu in the urban areas, that trading rights would be reconsidered and that a committee would be set up to minimize the hardships of influx control. There would also be a reconsideration with the Minister of Labour of trade unions in urban areas for the Black people. The position of professional men in the urban areas would be revised and civic rights would be looked at in the sense of greater powers for the urban Bantu councils. As regards leasehold in the urban areas, it would be very interesting to see what evolves from that. Freehold was asked for but this was declined. Leasehold is to be looked into. They have leasehold at the present time because a monthly tenancy is a leasehold. If this is to be looked into, it can only be looked into on the basis of long leases. Anyone who has experience of the principle of long leases in the older British colonies, especially in cities like Durban and Pietermaritzburg, will know that today the leasehold, the long lease, of those areas is treated akin to freehold tenure. That holds interesting developments for us and in that regard I wish to ask in respect of whose philosophy is credit to be given, that of separate development or that of others in this House?</p>

<p>What is the present position in regard to trading rights? It is in effect one man one trading licence, and this applies only in respect of the day-to-day needs of the people. What is asked for and what is to be investigated is trading rights to cover the whole gamut of trade in the urban areas. The minimizing of the hardship of influx control is something we have debated over and over again as along as I have been here. Trade unions were dealt with by us last year to great effect, and particularly by the Leader of the Opposition. The position of professional men in the urban Bantu areas and greater local government rights for their local authorities are matters in respect of which one can ask in terms of whose philosophy is the credit due in view of the predicted changes&#x2014;that of the hon. gentlemen opposite or ourselves? I believe the answer is clearly ourselves.</p>

<p>Let us go to the Coloureds. Here the responsibility is shared between the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs. We are to have an investigation of Cabinet responsibility for the Coloured Representative Council with <span class="col_117-118" refersTo="page_0074"/>power to originate legislation. They are to have extended executive powers. There are to be standing inter-Cabinet committees or councils. I read this with great interest. I do not labour the point that the idea of the communal council, which this is, originated with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition; but it is being developed, and every one of these factors finds its origin in the philosophy of the United Party. No wonder it is a matter of drawing praise! There remains the issue of parity of salaries. Who has debated this question of narrowing the gap and parity of salaries over and over again in this House? There is the question of Coloured representation on statutory bodies. I wonder if it is known how many provincial statutory bodies in Natal are multi-racial bodies at the present time? There is also the request by the Coloured people that unnecessary discriminatory legislation should be scrapped, and that was agreed to. If one goes through that list, as far as the Coloured people of this country are concerned, where does the credit lie? With separate development, which for years has brought about the negation of these things, or with the philosophy of the United Party, which over the years has pleaded that these things be done?</p>

<p>However, let us not get carried away. I should like to ask a further question. If a United Party Government were in power at the present time, or any Government that did not subscribe to the policy of separate development, and if it were to come out with a series of announcements that these changes were envisaged, would there be a chorus of euphoria from the political commentators and observers outside? I doubt it very much. What one would get would be a vigorous attack on the United Party Government because it was only now coming out with tardy measures of this kind which were too few and too late. The only reason why there is this atmosphere of euphoria is because for so long we have had from this Government the very antithesis of what is now envisaged. The position was very well put, I think by the hon. member for Von Brandis, when he said that for the most part this was merely a promissory note. We know what promissory notes are like. They are fine as long as they are moving quickly from one sticky palm to another. It is only when they come to rest in someone&#x2019;s sticky palm, and he is called to account to pay them, that there is usually trouble, and this is what the country will be watching for in respect of these changes that have been suggested. It is not sufficient these days to promise. What is required now is to be able to see the results of those promises. As I have said, credit is due for the changes of direction, changes in emphasis if you like, which have been foreshadowed. For the philosophy behind this, I see no credit for the Government. I am sufficiently a realist, and sufficiently human, to give the Government credit for making the necessary changes they are. We are told by the hon. member for Vereengiging that those of us who sit on this side of the House are unfair because we do not refer to the advantages which have accrued from separate development, such as the building of houses, the building of schools, the provision of sports fields, the advocating of better wages, the advocating of better working conditions and other matters of this kind.</p>

<p>However, it is absolutely naïve to suggest that these are attributes that belong solely to the philosophy of separate development. Any Government worth its salt&#x2014;I emphasize &#x201C;any Government&#x201D;&#x2014;in the decade preceding 1975, would have felt obliged and compelled to improve circumstances such as these. We now have the money to do this. We live in an era in which it is necessary, if it were not necessary before&#x2014;and I am not suggesting that it was not. However, the compulsion, the will and the wherewithal to do this are now there. Any Government, whether it is a Government that stands for the society in which we believe or whether it is a Government which stands for separate development would, if it had the right view of things, have felt obliged to do these things. It is quite unrelated to separate development, and it is no reason to praise the philosophy in its workability or in its morals to say merely that these things have been done. Separate development did these things, but the one thing that separate development cannot do in the society of today is to provide a political solution, particularly as a result of the summit meeting of Black leaders where once again I emphasize that independence was rejected &#x201C;at this point of time&#x201D; and in the very next paragraph of their statement &#x201C;at this point of time &#x2026;&#x201D; to use their phrase as stated in that document, &#x201C;&#x2026; federation was considered as a possibility&#x201D;. The two are juxtaposed, he one against the other in their statement, viz. a rejection &#x201C;at this <span class="col_119-120" refersTo="page_0075"/>point of time&#x201D; of independence and an acceptance of the possibility &#x201C;at this point of time&#x201D; of federation as providing an answer. Why is it preferable? Because as I have tried to indicate we know the terms upon which independence is offered by the hon. the Prime Minister. It is known to the Black leaders and it is rejected by them. The federal principle, whether it is ours or whether it is one similar to ours, not only provides the day-to-day necessities which I have already enumerated&#x2014;schools, hospitals, sports fields, etc.&#x2014;necessities which I concede separate development can also provide, but it has some hope of providing a solution to the politically vexed question in South Africa and that is the question of political representation of minority and majority groups in a multi-racial country.</p>

<p>I want to mention one final point. Even if the Black leaders had accepted independence at this point of time, separate development offers no solution as to the political future of the Coloureds and the Indians. Only under a federal principle of some kind, preferably ours, even with the acceptance of independence for the rest, is an answer provided to those two important communities. So I say that despite what has taken place recently and despite all the congratulatory remarks which have been uttered in that regard, when it comes to measuring policy against policy and philosophy against philosophy, very little indeed of real importance for the future by way of political comfort is to be found in the policy of separate development which this Government still follows.

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development_and_of_bantu_education">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, who has just resumed his seat, has spoken very appreciatively of our outgoing Minister of Finance. I wish to thank him on behalf of this side of the House for the friendly words he has addressed to the Minister and I can assure him that we accept his words as being genuine.</p>

<p>The hon. member also had something to say about differentiation and discrimination. I hope that before I sit down today there will be some time left for me to deal with those two concepts. The hon. member will just have to wait a little should he like to listen to me. I think, however, he has already heard what I had to say in that connection in the past.</p>

<p>This motion which was moved here yesterday, was moved under the flag of détente. In several ways the motion also refers to the relationship between Whites and Blacks and, of course, the other race groups in South Africa. The hon. member for Mooi River has also spoken about these relationships and I must say that his speech was stimulating. As a matter of fact, also the hon. member&#x2019;s speech stimulated me to take part in this debate. However, as far as that hon. member is concerned, I cannot do more than admit that. He expressed certain sentiments and referred to certain standards in his speech concerning race relations. However, his words were only hollow sounds; he came with clever and perhaps a little pious phrases. I shall point this out as I deal with this particular matter in my speech today. His statements yesterday cannot all stand the test of reality, and in politics we have to do with reality above all else. His statements cannot stand the test of principles and of high ideals as our policy is able to. The hon. member for Mooi River especially mentioned, freedom from fear and want&#x2014;he referred to a fear complex&#x2014;and the desire for stability. Fear and stability are two very important concepts. I maintain that our society is not at all characterized by fear, neither in the ranks of the Whites nor amongst the Bantu people or the other non-White groups in South Africa. What fears do we as Whites in South Africa harbour? I am genuinely convinced that we fear nothing at all. We are not at all motivated or driven by fear in South Africa.</p>

<p>*When I say that the Whites are not driven or motivated by fear, I want to add that there is, in particular, one great positive urge or motive among our Whites and that is the urge to which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana also referred here today. i.e. the urge for self-preservation, to maintain one&#x2019;s own as a group or a species. We&#x2019; want to maintain our selves in South Africa. We want to develop and maintain our own being, our own identity, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana called it. In the strength of many years of experience&#x2014;I should almost like to say of every minute and moment of my waking day&#x2014; I believe that among our Bantu and other non-Whites groups as well, there are far more positive aspirations than there is a <span class="col_121-122" refersTo="page_0076"/>fear complex. Among our Bantu there are far stronger aspirations to achieve certain things than there are feelings of fear.</p>

<p>The White man&#x2019;s urge for self-preservation is very definitely linked to the other concept which the hon. member for Mooi River raised yesterday, i.e. that of stability or permanence.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to speak about South Africa here. For the stability of the Whites the realization of our self-preservation is of the utmost importance. We as Whites in South Africa have no stability if we cannot realize our self-preservation, if it cannot be placed beyond any danger for us. Why? For one single and distinct reason. If we know that our self-preservation is not endangered and we are able to realize it, then we as a White group are reassured. Reassurance is the very first concept a society wants so as to be able to see clearly the road ahead and to be able to develop without fear, as was said by the hon. member. We should feel reassured about our continued existence, our possessions, our civilization and our freedom, reassured about everything which is dear to us. Therefore reassurance is, above all else, a pre-requisite for stability and we as Whites in South Africa very definitely have&#x2014;far too little is said about this on the opposite side&#x2014;a right, a claim to reassurance and to stability in South Africa. The policy of the National Party is really the only policy&#x2014;even if it has its shortcomings&#x2014;which makes provision for the Whites to be reassured. [Interjections.] Hon. members on that side are awakening from their dreams now that they hear me using the word &#x201C;shortcomings&#x201D;. I say that the policy of the National Party, even if it has some shortcomings here and there, is the only policy which holds out stability for the White man in South Africa and which gives them that assurance as a group and as individuals.</p>

<p>It is not only my opinion. This is the experience we in South Africa have expressed at the polls. This is not only the experience borne out by the voters at the polls; it is also the experience of many former members of the United Party, members who came to us such a long time ago that some of them have already passed through our Cabinet while others are only entering the Cabinet now. According to the policy of the National Party we want each one of the Bantu peoples and the other non-White peoples in our country&#x2014;the Indians, the Coloureds, and so forth&#x2014;to have in equal measure everyone of those things I have just mentioned and which we insist upon for our own White survival and stability, i.e. this reassurance and stability. We say that each Bantu people will have its own development in future, that each one must be assisted in achieving it.

But what I want to demonstrate here, and demonstrate very emphatically, is that, according to the <span class="col_123-124" refersTo="page_0077"/>policy of the National Party and on the basis of what the National Party has done up to now through its Government and through all the bodies at its disposal, the Whites of South Africa are the main and especially the most essential ally of each one of the Bantu peoples and of the Indians and the Coloureds. The hon. member is agreeing with me now; he did not want to say so himself yesterday. Sir, each one of those Non-White peoples must realize that not one of them has more genuine allies than we who have been placed here with them by our Creator in one geographical context. Our policy does not only reassure each one of those peoples; we help them to develop; we guarantee, as we claim for ourselves, the self-preservation and future peculiar to each one of those peoples in so far as we are able to have a share in it. But the old fact and truism remains: A nation saves itself. Each one of those peoples must contribute their own share to their own development, for without their own efforts they cannot procure a future of their own.</p>

<p>The National Party in South Africa is pre-eminently the party which recognizes and professes nationalism in its pure and natural form, i.e. as the essence and soul of a nation: that is what nationalism is, and whoever denies, conceals or ignores this, acts contrary to nature.

The National Party is the only one of our political parties in South Africa which is acquainted with avenues and channels for the nationalism of these other peoples, just as is the case with ours.

<p>I did not say the hon. member said it. I say we hear about it. I know the hon. member did not say it, and I hope it is because he shares my belief in respect of land that he did not say it. But there are people in that party who say so and there are many who write about it. This misconception of the sharing of power, the sharing of wealth and the sharing of land, is a false value which is being held out. Sir, people who have to live as close to each other as we are living here, cannot share power. Where does one find that peoples share power and authority with each other? Where does one find that? The sharing of power and authority among <span class="col_125-126" refersTo="page_0078"/>peoples leads to conflict and the use of force between peoples and not to peaceful co-existence. I should very much like to hear where in the world peoples in one national context share power and authority with each other. [Interjections.] Where attempts are made to share power and authority, it will lead to subjection; it leads to subversion and it leads to the disappearance of one or the other or of everyone. It must necessarily lead to all these things. It has led to those things in the past. What must peoples that co-exist do with each other? They can only do what we as individuals have to do with each other. Peoples can only accept one another; peoples can only tolerate one another. That is all they can do. There are only those two objectives, and that is what our policy does. The policy of the hon. members on the opposite side is not to accept peoples. They are forever tampering with the existence and the future of separate peoples, peoples who were placed here in South Africa by the Creator.</p>

<p>What about the Coloured people?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have said this so many times before. The moment I start speaking about my work on the basis of principles, hon. members start discussing the Coloured people. I made a remark about it a moment ago. I am quite prepared to speak to the hon. member about the Coloured people, but then one must have the time to do so and this is not the time now. I just want to remind hon. members that I was briefly dealing with the sharing of authority and power. The policy of the United Party, which is a dangerous policy, is one which will ineluctably lead to these things. I have mentioned, such as the subversion of one another and the subjection of one to the other and eventually to the disappearance of one or the other.</p>

<p>In connection with the sharing or the division of land, I should like to point out that, historically, land in South Africa has, through the years and through the decades, already been divided among the peoples, between the White and the Black peoples. The land has already been divided and we cannot share land with each other just as we cannot share power and authority with each other. All we still have to do now&#x2014; and I hope we are going to proceed with this in this session this year&#x2014;is to round off allocations in respect of that land still further. We hope to be able to do so during this session. The other matter that is mentioned is wealth, money, earnings. I also want to emphasize that income or earnings is not something which can be shared with one another either, as has already been said and written. In an orderly society, income or earnings is something which has to be earned by those who desire it. It cannot be received in the form of gifts from the entrepreneurs. These are things which must be earned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But surely the opportunity to earn it should be there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There must be opportunities and there must be proper remuneration and proper arrangements in connection with the earning thereof, but there is no such thing that someone who desires funds or money or earnings can receive it as hand-outs. Income must be earned. This is a cultural concept. This is a Biblical concept which dates back to the days of the Creation. [Interjections.] I am very pleased when the hon. members say that. It points to progress.</p>

<p>In regard to these things it is quite essential that we in South Africa, as different peoples who co-exist here, should be understanding peoples who can understand and accept one another. Secondly, as I have said, these peoples should be tolerant peoples who can tolerate one another. Arising from this, there is the desirability for us to remain in contact with one another so that we can talk with one another or, to use the modern idiom, so that we can conduct dialogue with one another so as to understand one another&#x2019;s aspirations and standpoints, to learn to tolerate one another, for it demands a great deal to learn to tolerate one another. Individually, we all spend a lifetime learning to tolerate one another&#x2014; as peoples and as members of those peoples. But this is essential in order to ensure security and stability for everyone. In this connection we recently had a very important conference of the Bantu homeland leaders with the Prime Minister, with me and others. No matter how important this was, we simply must remember it was by no means the only instance of dialogue that was conducted on the part of the Government with the Bantu homelands and with the Bantu peoples. As far as dialogue is concerned, this is the most important event, i.e. that the Prime Minister holds talks with them, but there is far more dialogue than <span class="col_127-128" refersTo="page_0079"/>that. Since that meeting, in the past 14 days, I have already made contact, at my level, with two or three other homeland governments.</p>

<p>No, on the contrary; it is not I who speak and they who listen. I think the talking comes mostly from their side. At this most recent interview which took place between the Prime Minister and other peoples&#x2014;this was the second that has taken place in the past year&#x2014;great progress was in fact made. Progress was made, even compared with the first one. I want to say to the credit of our hon. the Prime Minister and likewise to the credit of the Bantu leaders themselves that, contrary to the prior desires and subsequent sorrow of certain newspapers, that interview with the Prime Minister was conducted in an atmosphere of complete calm and relaxation, or détente. They were conducted in a very fine spirit and concluded in the same way. Basic concepts were expressed throughout, from their side and from ours. There were in fact understandings which developed between us. I just want to mention a few; examples, since I cannot deal with everything now. There is the question of land tenure and home-ownership to which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana referred this: afternoon. The views of the National Party were put to them very clearly, i.e. that just as the land in the Bantu homelands only belongs to those Bantu peoples themselves, so the land here in White South Africa be-, longs only to the Whites. In cases where land of one particular group still belongs to another group, the matter is gradually being put right.</p>

<p>And they accept it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member that on that day we said very little about land tenure to the non-White leaders. Consequently, the sharing of land tenure is unthinkable in our policy. This must be understood very clearly, since it reaches down to the roots of every people&#x2019;s assurance, security and stability. These then are the principles we spoke about a moment ago. In respect of the ownership of homes I myself furnished statistics to the conference in order to show that at present, in South Africa, 30% of the homes in the urban Bantu residential areas in White South Africa are owned by the Bantu inhabitants of those homes. It is in respect of this policy of home-ownership in the urban Bantu residential areas which has been applied by our Government in the past that the hon. the Prime Minister announced&#x2014;it was referred to this afternoon&#x2014;that we undertake to go into that aspect of the matter again. In this regard we must not lose sight of the fundamentalism of our policy, i.e. that there are separate homelands for these different peoples and in those homelands these peoples have their own exclusive rights, of which land tenure and voting rights are probably the most striking. This applies in respect of the Bantu as well as here in the White homeland. The second fundamentalism of which I want to remind hon. members, is the ethnic concept, concept that the people of South Africa are not just beings such as the birds in the skies, although even they can be divided into groups. The people of South Africa are all, groupwise, connected with their own particular people and country: The Xhosas with the Xhosa people; the Zulus with the Zulu people and we, the Whites, with the White people of South Africa. We must understand this ethnic concept. We spoke, for example, about influx control. Hon. members may perhaps be able to grasp that this is an extremely difficult matter to discuss. The hon. the Prime Minister stated the crux and the essence of the objects of influx control to the meeting. After all, there is an object with influx control. It is not something which was just fabricated for the fun of it or for the sake of a few officials who wanted to do something administratively. The Prime Minister put it to them in a very tangible way. There is, for example, the quoted situation of a town where there is employment for 10 000 Bantu persons. What happens when 30 000 Bantu come streaming in to take up that employment? They realize that this would lead to chaos. They were asked what should be done in a case like this. One of the leaders &#x2014;I am not going to mention names&#x2014;said things that made almost everyone laugh. One of the leaders said that those 20 000 surplus workers should be transported back. The Prime Minister and all of us laughed and said that this method had already been <span class="col_129-130" refersTo="page_0080"/>tried in the past and that those people were back where they had came from even before the vehicles were back. These leaders sensed the basic problem, the dilemma of the situation. That is why, when we discussed the situation with them, seven of the eight were willing to take part in further dialogue at departmental level to try and devise and propose something here to deal with that situation and to prevent those 20 000 superfluous workers from taking the work out of the hands of the 10 000 who are entitled to it, and causing all manner of other chaotic conditions. In this way we had a very fruitful discussion &#x2014;I have to race against time now&#x2014;about trade matters as well, about the urban Bantu councils and the urban representatives&#x2019; councils to see whether one could reorganize them in respect of management affairs, in regard to education and transport in the urban areas. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana discussed these specific matters this afternoon. I want to tell him that the changes which will come, and there will undoubtedly be changes, will take place within the policy of the National Party. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I deal with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x2019;s speech, I would like to associate members in these benches with the comments of farewell and the tributes which have been paid to the former leader of the House, the Minister of Finance, on the occasion of his departure from this House, presumably for higher office. This gentleman has served this House and this country over a long period. He has come a long way. I happen to have an association with a small village in the Free State from which he comes. He has come a long way from Hobhouse to the State House. He came into politics in the 1930s as a fiery young Nationalist with a burning ideological mission, and over the years he has mellowed. He has become an elder statesman, and while he has never lost his feeling for his cause, he has mellowed in his manner and he has been able to meet his political opponents with tremendous dignity and with understanding.</p>

<p>*He is a man who, in the thirties, fervently believed in the economic upliftment of his less-privileged Afrikaner countrymen and became a man who is accepted in the international sphere as an authority on the subject of international finance.</p>

<p>&#x2020;However, it is in this House that he appeared to be most at home. His speech this afternoon was the masterpiece of a man who has been in this House for many years, a man who has become a part of this House. I think it is as a member of this House that we shall remember him, for his Budget speeches with their parables, their fables, their allusions to Confucius, for the dexterity with which he attempted, not always successfully, to reconcile the demands of South Africa&#x2019;s economy with the ideological policy of the party of which he was a member. As the leader of this House he was fairminded, he was efficient and he was approachable. We would like to wish him and his wife well on their retirement from this House for possibly further and higher office in the service of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development seemed to be surprised that a motion which had reference to détente also dealt with race relations.</p>

<p>Well, I am glad the hon. the Minister realizes this for the reason for the deterioration of our relationships with Africa over the years has been the question of race relations in South Africa, and perhaps the reason why it has improved is the belief of people out side South Africa that there is going to be a radical restructuring of Nationalist Party policy. He talks of realities and principles as the two fundamentals on which politics is based today. However, he denies the realities of the existence on a permanent basis of millions and millions of Black South Africans working and living in the cities of South Africa. He talks of principle, and yet what is the principle in saying: &#x201C;You, the Coloured citizens of South Africa, can be born here, can live here and can die here but you can never have any say in the Parliament that governs you.&#x201D;? Is that a principle? Of course not. We shall <span class="col_131-132" refersTo="page_0081"/>deal further with various other aspects of discrimination during the course of this debate. However, I want to refer to the motion before the House and to say that while we in these benches share with members to our right a lack of confidence in the Government, we do not believe that the motion before the House adequately expresses the reasons for which we have this lack of confidence. Therefore as an amendment to the motion, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;Government&#x201D;, where it occurs for the first time, and to substitute &#x201C;because of its failure to formulate a policy which can&#x2014;</block>

<li>(a) achieve its stated goal of eliminating race discrimination;</li>

<li>(b) provide for the sharing of power by the citizens of South Africa; and</li>

<li>(c) enable it to govern without depriving citizens of their civil liberties.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Naturally this debate takes place against the background of detente. There has been widespread relief in South Africa and a welcoming of the détente situation which has developed. We in the Progressive Party welcome these new developments, for even in opposition we have worked for this kind of détente over the years. While leaders to the north and south of the Zambesi have been busy slamming one another, the Progressive Party has argued in favour of dialogue and communication and of identification with Africa. At times when official contact scarcely existed in the north we went to the north to keep open the slender lines of contact and to forge new links with the African Continent. Naturally we are pleased today to find that alongside the informal links which we have already forged, it appears that new and important Government-to-Government links are now being established. I want to say to this House and to the hon. the Prime Minister that we shall continue building bridges. We have no doubt that we shall be criticized by our political opponents as we have been in the past, but just as the recent months have demonstrated, so the future will show that because this party is the only parliamentary party that has consistently opposed race discrimination we are well placed to play a role in trying to improve the relationships between South Africa and the rest of the continent.</p>

<p>In the circumstances in which South Africa has found itself in recent years there is no doubt that the bringing about of détente has been a notable achievement. But frankly, Sir, I am concerned at the state of euphoria in which certain Government members and organs of the Government Press seem to find themselves at present. I believe that this is extremely dangerous because it is causing many people in South Africa to ignore the realities of the situation and the commitments and the dangers which are implicit in détente. Détente is no change of substance, but it does reflect a change of climate, a change of mood. It gives South Africa some time, it gives the hon. the Prime Minister some breathing space and it gives him an opportunity. If he does not use this time and this opportunity, however, détente wil disappear and we shall be worse off than ever before. I believe that implicit in détente&#x2014;I think the hon. the Prime Minister will agree with me&#x2014;is a commitment by this Government to us its influence to try to bring about a settlement in Rhodesia, to give South West Africa independence on the basis of the freely expressed will of the inhabitants of that territory and perhaps most important of all to make changes within South Africa in order to move South Africa as fast as possible away from apartheid and away from race discrimination. This is a formidable task, but if the Government does not do it, détente will be a passing phase. The Government&#x2019;s willingness to try to use its influence in a settlement in Rhodesia and the fact that the Government has said it would act in respect of South West Africa have been prerequisites for détente. But the key to make détente last and the key to achieving a lasting working arrangement with the other States in Africa has to be the elimination of apartheid and race discrimination within our country.</p>

<p>In a sense South Africa has been given the goodwill of leaders and States to the north on credit; on credit in the form of undertakings implied in the speeches by ambassador Botha, Minister Koornhof and the hon. the Prime Minister himself. If the hon. the Prime Minister does not deliver the goods by eliminating race discrimination and apartheid within South Africa, he will have forfeited for the people of South Africa the goodwill of the leaders to the north which we and he enjoy at the moment. Because of the importance of this task and because of the consequences to South Africa both internally and externally, we in the Progressive Party, will support <span class="col_133-134" refersTo="page_0082"/>the Government in any step that it takes to eliminate apartheid and discrimination in South Africa. But equally, we shall continue to criticize and to attack the Government whenever it clings to policies which we&#x2014;you and I&#x2014;know are manifestly discriminatory or which place the ideology of race separation before common human dignity. Much credit for the recent turn of events has been given to those within the Government who have been involved in the delicate negotiations, and to the hon. the Prime Minister in particular. Although I believe that it is appropriate, the Government and the hon. the Prime Minister must not forget that it has been his party&#x2019;s own race policies which have been applied over the years which have been the prime cause of South Africa&#x2019;s isolation from the rest of Africa in the past. This has been the cause. [Interjections.] Well, why change the policy if it was not the cause?</p>

<p>I want to mention in particular the patient and dedicated approach as well as the work done by the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I can sense how they winced every time they heard that the hon. the Minister of Defence was going to make a speech that dealt in any way with Africa or African leaders to the north. I think that this is an appropriate occasion for the South African Parliament and those of us in this House to refer to the important and constructive part played in recent developments of President Kaunda of Zambia. Whatever differences the South African Government has had with him in the past, I believe that we should recognize that on this occasion he has shown qualities of statesmanship and wisdom which, together with the efforts of our Prime Minister, have brought about a new and hopeful situation in Southern Africa. Neither should we ignore the contributions made by individual South Africans to this new climate that is developing in Africa. I think of a businessman like Mr. Harry Oppenheimer or of an administrator such as Sir Richard Luyt&#x2014;men who in the interests of South Africa have maintained close personal contact with the African states over the years. I think, too, of a man such as Chief Gatsha Buthelezi who, in spite of his opposition to apartheid, and in spite of the humiliation which he says his people endure, has gone to the capitals of African states and argued with the people against boycotts and violence in favour of dialogue and communication.</p>

<p>I believe that it is the existence of a growing opposition to the race policies of this Government and the belief that there is a prospect of real change in South Africa away from those policies that has made détente possible. Were it not for that, there would have been no change in atmosphere, and no détente.</p>

<p>The leaders to the north believe that the Prime Minister wants to move away from apartheid and race discrimination. If they for one moment thought that the Prime Minister was going to follow the ideological path mapped out for him by Dr. Verwoerd, there would have been no détente today.</p>

<p>Yes, or perhaps by &#x201C;M.C.&#x201D; But we are talking of his predecessor and not the Minister himself. Last year, following my discussions in Gaborone, Lusaka, Nairobi and Lagos, I reported to the House on this very point. In these words I referred to the attitude of the Black leaders I had met towards the Prime Minister: &#x201C;Observers see him allowing apartheid to crumble in a natural way; they see political discussion taking place across the colour line in spite of the Prohibition of Political Interference Act. They see Blacks doing more skilled work in spite of job reservation and the colour bar. They see our airports, our aircraft and hotels desegregated in spite of apartheid; they see more and more South Africans participating in mixed sport even though it is given another name; they hear his appeals to human dignity. These are all plus factors for the Prime Minister and South Africa.&#x201D; This is what I reported last year. I said there was a sneaking regard for him not because of policies of separate development but because they believed there was growing opposition to those policies and because the Prime Minister realized that he had to dismantle the ideology of Dr. Verwoerd and move South Africa towards a new attitude.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear that there could have been no détente nor will the détente last unless there is a clear commitment away from apartheid and <span class="col_135-136" refersTo="page_0083"/>race discrimination. I want to refer to the interview with President Kaunda which appeared in the latest edition of <i>Africa</i> where on three occasions this President said that he believed that the Prime Minister, in spite of difficult circumstances within his own country, wants to persuade his people to change, change to implement policy or change away from policy. This is of course a clear indication that this Prime Minister and the National Party want to move away from apartheid and race discrimination. This is the basis of this whole situation at the moment and I believe that it is very important that the Prime Minister should follow this line and should project himself into the future and tell this House where he is in fact going to take South Africa.</p>

<p>There have been encouraging moves away from apartheid recently. We welcome them but I think that hon. members are going to find that you will not be able to get away from race discrimination within the framework of the National Party policy of separate development. Their policy is going to have to crumble if indeed they are going to be able to get away from race discrimination. So the essence of this issue is: What is meant by race discrimination? This was referred to by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. All of us in this House are saying that it must go. However, do we all mean the same thing when we say that we must get rid of race discrimination? The most authoritative and concise statement&#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated this yesterday&#x2014;on this issue was made by ambassador Pik Botha at the UN. What I want to know is not only whether the hon. the Prime Minister and his party subscribe to that statement&#x2014;which I presume they do&#x2014;but do he and the rest of his party also agree exactly on what it means? I have no doubt that people at the UN who listened to that statement, people who read it in newspapers throughout the world, people who watched it being made on television, interpreted it in only one way and that is that race barriers in South Africa are coming down. To people around the world that is what the speech of Mr. Pik Botha meant&#x2014;race barriers are coming down in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to know from the hon. the Prime Minister whether that is the import of that speech. Is that the import of the speech? Are we moving away from present Government policies towards new ones where South African citizens will not be precluded or limited on the grounds of race or colour from participating in any way in the social, economic and political life of the country? This is a cardinal point and I believe that the hon. the Prime Minister owes it to this House and the country to ensure that there is no confusion as to what is meant by this new concept of moving away from race discrimination. We have had the hon. the Minister of the Interior telling us that in actual fact we are a group of nations. We do not discriminate between races, we are like Western Europe or South America, we are nations and so we differentiate between nations and we do not discriminate on the grounds of race or colour.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the moment we are all South Africans. We may be peoples or nations or groups but we are still all citizens of South Africa and the Prime Minister can do nothing to change that. We are all citizens of South Africa and the hon. the Prime Minister cannot force people out of their citizenship. Citizens of South Africa who are differentiated against because of their so-called nationhood are in fact discriminated against on the grounds of their race and coolur.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the hon. the Prime Minister and hon. members on that side of the House I should like to provide a few simple illustrations of this point. A White Portuguese or a Spaniard, or a member of some other nation in Europe, can come into the urban areas of this country where the work is to be found, move freely there and own property there. Yet the Black South African, no matter how long he has lived and worked here may not move freely and may not own property in the urban areas. Why do we discriminate against the Black South African and not the White European?</p>

<p>This is discrimination in its most cruel form on the basis of race in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister must explain the statements made by the hon. the Minister, viz. that we do discriminate on the basis of race but on the basis of nationhood.</p>

<p>It was also stated that we are going to get rid of the inequalities but maintain separation. There have been welcome statements about easing job restrictions, improving housing and education and getting rid of the wage gap. All I can say to the hon. the Prime Minister is this: Do not let us have to wait for a further 28 years of Nationalist Party rule before these discriminations are eliminated. I believe that he has to speed up the programme. I believe that he should give us a timetable in terms of which he intends getting rid of this discrimination, in terms of State expenditure, in respect of the various sections of the population. There are inequalities built into the situation. The Separate Amenities Act of 1953 actually made provision for inequality. It gave the State or local authorities specific permission to provide amenities on an unequal basis. I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister whether he will concede that the inclusion of that provision was wrong? Will he agree to remove it so that even within the framework of his own policy there can be equality in this regard? There is the Group Areas Act, there is beach apartheid. These have in practice resulted in gross discrimination against people of colour.</p>

<p>Is he prepared to set up a commission on which White, Black and Brown will serve to re-examine the allocation of land under the Group Areas Act, to re-examine the beach allocations and to point out where there is discrimination that should be removed?</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, swimming pools as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the last point is this: Is apartheid discrimination? I believe that enforced segregation or apartheid, except where this is done by mutual consent between groups who are equals, is discrimination. Obviously separation agreed between groups as equals is not discrimination; this is a voluntary situation; but for the powerful to impose separation on the powerless is discrimination, and in the context of Africa where White Parliaments, White legislatures, keep out people, the people who are kept out believe that they are being discriminated against, that they are being rejected on grounds of race and colour. This is their objection. Mr. Speaker, changes have taken place which indicate that the Prime Minister is coming to realize that apartheid in itself, unless it is done by mutual consent between individuals, is discriminatory. What was said upon their return to this country by the gentlemen who went to the United Nations as observers? Mr. Ulster said upon his return that the apartheid&#x2014;not just discrimination only in terms of wages and salaries&#x2014;should be removed. Mr. Naidoo said when he returned that all the signs of enforced separation should disappear. Sir, I am not going to argue that this can be done overnight; the hon. the Prime Minister has pointed out the difficulties, but what is important in defining what Pik Botha meant is that he, the Prime Minister is prepared to try to move South Africa as fast as possible to an open society, to a society in which each citizen has the opportunity of participating fully in the facilities and the advantages and the privileges and the responsibilities of that community, and that race and colour alone will not be the criteria for separation. Mr. Speaker, it is important that there should be no confusion between the hon. the Minister of the Interior and us on this side of the House. It is important that there should be no confusion between the hon. the Minister and the hon. <span class="col_139-140" refersTo="page_0085"/>member for Waterberg. It is tremendously important that there should be basic agreement on what is meant by removing race discrimination.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a final aspect of détente which I must touch upon before my time expires. The events over the past three months, and especially the Prime Minister&#x2019;s initiatives in relation to Rhodesia, have, I believe, ushered in a new phase of politics in Southern Africa. I would call this the new phase of the politics of negotiation. I believe that the era of exclusive White decision-making has come to an end and that in Rhodesia and in South West Africa, and in due course in South Africa, Governments representing élite minorities, no matter how powerful they may be in the statutory sense, are going to sit round the table and negotiate a basis for the sharing of power with those who have the confidence of the majority of the citizens. Sir, in the case of Rhodesia I believe that the Prime Minister recognized the realities of the situation. He has said repeatedly that he has not interfered with the internal affairs of Rhodesia and we must accept that, but at the same time all the evidence points to his having agreed with the President of Zambia to back a settlement in Rhodesia based on a non-racial qualified franchise. This may or may not be so, but I think the hon. the Prime Minister should tell this House whether he accepts that this is the basis of a settlement in Rhodesia.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, there is something much more fundamental. What the Prime Minister did do in respect of Rhodesia was not to interfere but nevertheless to urge the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Mr. Smith, in spite of his statutory authority, in spite of his landslide election victory, to sit round a table with the representatives of African nationalist organizations, terrorist organizations, and with Black nationalists whom his Government had banned for the last 10 years, in order to negotiate with these people a system of sharing power in Rhodesia. I believe that this assessment of the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of Rhodesia is going to have a profound effect on the politics of the whole of Southern Africa, just as the Prime Minister&#x2019;s assessment in January and February of 1973. He was correct in his assessment of the situation when the Black workers went on strike when, in spite of his statutory powers, he said: &#x201C;Let us negotiate&#x201D;. This was very correct, but it has made the Black people realize that they do have growing economic power and that the Government is going to respect and acknowledge this. In exactly the same way I believe the events to the north, in which the hon. the Prime Minister played a very important part&#x2014; and all credit to him for doing so&#x2014;are going to tell Black South Africans one of these days we will negotiate a future for all of us here in Southern Africa. The Prime Minister says there will be no sharing of power in South Africa. The Nationalist Party is at pains to explain that Rhodesia is different; that South Africa has embarked on a different road of separate development. Sir, separate development may be the policy of the other side of the House, but it is not the reality of South Africa, because we have a single economy. More and more Blacks and Browns are being integrated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, into that economy. We have increasing numbers of Coloureds and Indians and Africans living permanently in the so-called White areas of South Africa. We have the Black people, except in the case of the Transkei, rejecting the concept of fragmentation of independence. We have educational advancement and economic progress, and as the Prime Minister knows that with this and the organizational infrastructure which is being created, the Black people are becoming more important and they are becoming more powerful and we, the White people, are going to have to negotiate with them as far as the future of South Africa is concerned. We in the Progressive Party believe that this could best be done by the decentralization of power along the lines of a geographic federation, of introducing a Bill of Rights to guarantee individuals against discrimination, by having provision for the protection of minorities, by seeing that there is a phasing in during the transition period, from exclusive White participation to the participation of all the people of South Africa in the government of South Africa. Sir, this is why we believe that it is important that there should be negotiation, that there should be a national convention representative of the various factors of power in South Africa, in order to talk about the future and the sharing of power. [Interjections.] Sir, I believe that there is a lesson to be learned from events in the north and that lesson is: Do not think that you can avoid negotiation; do not delay negotiating as people have done elsewhere <span class="col_141-142" refersTo="page_0086"/>in the world when they have had their backs to the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the nature of things, one would like to have time to argue with the hon. member for Sea Point about all the points which he has made here. But one cannot do so in half an hour. Perhaps it is because I do not argue well that I am unable to do so, and therefore I apologize for not being able to devote too much attention to the hon. member. I should, however, like to put just one question to the hon. member. May I first put a question to the hon. member for Houghton?

We hear this from two hon. members who have debated very broadly across the floor of this House. One of two things is happening. I have half an idea that the hon. member for Houghton takes up one standpoint to appease the Whites and wants to dupe them as far as the future is concerned while the leader takes up the other standpoint to mislead the Blacks and to dupe them as far as the future is concerned. I do not know which of the two standpoints is the correct one.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We must understand each other. We in South Africa, we in this House, may argue as we please when dealing with a delicate matter such as racial affairs, but I think one thing nobody may do, neither we on this side of the House nor the opposite side: We may not be dishonest; our motives may not be such that we are either not understood or that we are inherently dishonest. I cannot understand how a party here in this House can take up two directly opposite standpoints, as happened a few seconds ago in this House. In that event such a party cannot say that it is posing as an honest party with honest motives before South Africa. I cannot see how a party can do something like that under such circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. the leader of the Progressive Party, who has just resumed his seat, indicated that he, too, had been travelling in Africa. Previously the hon. member for Houghton indicated that she, too, had travelled in Africa. Both have travelled. I do not know whether they have always followed the same course; they have travelled, however. Now the question is what those two have gone to tell the people, their friends, there in Africa. Did the hon. member indicate to them and did she make great play of the fact that she would apply the system of qualified franchise in South Africa or did she fail to mention it? I have an idea that she did not mention it there, but told some other story. However, I cannot image their being able to take up a double standpoint in this House, their being able to go about in Africa and advocating peace without their either having taken up the same standpoint <span class="col_143-144" refersTo="page_0087"/>or having indulged in double talk. It is such a mix-up that one cannot make head or tail of it.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the leader of the Progressive Party that if he thinks he can make an impression here or if he tries to make an impression in politics, he must search his own heart. He must see to it that what he and his people say corresponds to such an extent that at least the impression of honesty is created. [Interjections.] The hon. the leader of the Progressive Party indicated that he was able to give us very sound advice in consequence of his travels in Africa. From what he said here today it is very clear that he has gone to stir up things in Africa, while he comes here hoping that that which we are doing here, but which he does not understand at all, actually means that we are engaged in creating an integrated Progstate in South Africa. That is what the hon. member said. As a matter of fact, from what I deduced from what the hon. member said this afternoon, he does not understand it.</p>

<p>Now I want to turn to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. There is something which the Opposition parties in South Africa have not understood over the years. The course of the history of this continent and that which we have tried to do here and all that has been written and said in this House, has not made even the slightest impression on them. They still do not understand it. What is happening today, is not something which has its beginnings in the present time. It has its beginnings in the times prior to World War II. It has its beginnings as far back as World War I when the great idea of the right of small nations to self-determination occurred to the leaders. This idea has run its course up to where we stand today in the midst of emotional world politics with hundreds of small communities experiencing this urge. Many have become independent and others still want to become independent. As far as this process is concerned, hon. members on the opposite side have never understood what is happening in South Africa. It is for this reason that they are able to quote so incorrectly. The problem we face in South Africa today, is to try, to the best of our ability&#x2014;it does not matter whether our ability is good enough or not&#x2014;and with all the honesty at our disposal, to find an answer to the greatest problem in the world today, and that is how more than one people can achieve peaceful co-existence in the same country. That is basic. When one starts arguing about this, one must realize one thing: Whatever one offers as a solution must basically satisfy one requirement, and that is that it must be honest towards the people for whom one envisages it. If it is not inherently honest, one cannot hope to get co-operation and one cannot gain the confidence of the people in one&#x2019;s own country. Nor can one create the confidence amongst those people for whom one is trying to implement the policy. In this grand effort the National Party has been making over the years, we have differed with hon. members on the opposite side. We have told them that there are only two possibilities. On the one hand there is the possibility of trying to create an integrated state in this country. History is against that, however, as are examples of something of this sort elsewhere in the world: the knowledge we have gained in South Africa, is against it and our common sense also tells us that it cannot work for certain very fundamental and obvious reasons. Usually there is a clash of deep emotions and interests between people trying to realize themselves in the same state. Cultures, sentiments, ideals and other interests differ, and such differences give rise to tension and conflict.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>While I am thinking of it, I shall come to the hon. member in a moment. So this is the answer we must try to find here. There are just the two possibilities. I want to say to hon. members of both opposition parties that it is easy to reproach us here with a whole lot of detail concerning millions of people who come into contact every day in so many places and in so many ways in the whole complexity of life, as a result of which conflict arises. In the light of this detail they then forget the great fundamental cause. What is the point at issue? The point at issue simply is that we in South Africa must make provision for all those sentiments which we agree do exist. Over the years we have tried to implement a policy and to bring that policy to fulfilment. I do not want to talk about it and explain what it is. Hon. members know it and if they do not know it yet, they will never know it. However, I want to point out to hon. members their role in this time. This is our <span class="col_145-146" refersTo="page_0088"/>difficulty and it is against this that a finger must be pointed. In the course of the debate yesterday, as in previous debates, hon. members reproached us on this side. Now is it right to level the reproach at us in this House that everything we do is a form of discrimination, while the architect of this policy said years ago&#x2014;this has been mentioned as an example so many times by our own Prime Minister in this house&#x2014;that this philosophy, if all of us worked at it together, would lead to the ending of discrimination. We are on the way to that. What have hon. members on the opposite been doing, however, during the past few years while this policy was taking shape in South Africa? Their contribution was to try to destroy and to belittle everything, and I am going to mention examples of this. You will remember, Sir, that when the idea of separate homelands was advanced years ago, they were the ones who tried to wreck it with what they said and did. They were offensive towards those people in the homelands. They tried to incite people in the homelands against the possibility of an existence of their own in those homelands. You will recall, Sir, how they contemptuously called the leaders of those people, who are of great value to those people, &#x201C;Government stooges&#x201D;. They will remember what they achieved by that. In doing so they did something lamentable. They wounded those people, who mean a great deal to their various peoples.</p>

Those hon. members disparaged those countries, which should mean a great deal to those people, by saying that they were not viable. What contribution did they make then to get order here? I just want to say that what we have achieved is the wonder of South Africa, and the fact that one of these homelands have come to determine the date on which it will become independent, is now told in history, that history which they do not understand, which they have tried to wreck over the years.</p>

<p>That will be the only one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The only one? The hon. member is again putting his foot into it. The contribution which they have made over the years was aimed at wrecking what we have done. Therefore I say that what we have achieved over the years, is a miracle, but it is a greater miracle that we have done it in spite of them and without their co-operation. What would the position in South Africa have been today had we been able to look back and say that we have had a joint effort in this country to create homelands and to make a start with the creation of an entity to which people could link their ideals and which, on the road ahead, would bring the independence which are to bring about the peace and security of South Africa? It is not only that which must bring the peace and security, but it is an important element. Rather than helping us, they have been trying to destroy it. What have they achieved by doing so? They have been trying to wreck the only policy which can possibly succeed in South Africa. That is a crime which they have committed against this country. By trying to destroy the only possibility of success, they made a contribution to the undermining of South Africa&#x2019;s democratic course of development of peace and prosperity. I think they should think back. Today all of them want to climb on the bandwagon. Today they are falling over their own feet to fall around the necks of those same &#x201C;Government stooges&#x201D; and to prompt them. Today they give us to understand that we are following their policy and that it is their fruits which we are plucking. Now the whole bunch of them are climbing on the brandwagon I am looking at the hon. member for Hillbrow who is sitting over there interrupting me. I want to tell him that it is not just in this field that he does not understand the history and has tried to wreck it, but also in the field of détente. Does this House not remember President Banda? He is a man for whom we all have great respect, a man who has achieved much for his own country a man who is highly esteemed amongst his own people, a man who has acted honourably towards South Africa and to whom we showed the honour which he deserves when he was here, a man who also showed the same honour towards us when our President was there. After he had gone out of his way, as leader of bis country, to maintain the courteous and correct attitudes towards South Africa, the hon. member, who was <span class="col_147-148" refersTo="page_0089"/>being so presumptuous when he said &#x201C;it will not happen&#x201D;, also did not think anything would come from that.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member referred with contempt to &#x201C;that little country&#x201D;. As a matter of fact, by doing so, the hon. member did his country a disservice. I have not yet heard that he has since apologized for that attitude. He ought to do it. I cannot remember that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has done anything about that either. But it is so far back in the past, that it will not serve any purpose to do anything about it now. That hon. member did not understand the history either. Now all the hon. members on the opposite side want to climb on the brandwagon of success and now that there is détente, they are all there.</p>

<p>Whatever we have done in this country, it cannot be said of us that our motives are not honest. The hon. member who has just sat down, and all the hon. members on the opposite side of this House have tried to make a point of making apartheid synonymous with racial discrimination. That is their point of departure. When we try in this country under very difficult circumstances to achieve the almost impossible, the aggressive words &#x201C;racial discrimination&#x201D; is pushed down our throats, and then the hon. member tries to prescribe to the hon. the Prime Minister what he ought to do. The hon. the Prime Minister will speak for himself. I would like to tell the hon. member, however, that he and his party should be careful in the future about what they say in this House and about the standpoint of their party. The first thing the hon. member can do is to indicate to the world outside, the world in which he travels around so much, which one of the two directions they advocate is the correct one. He can, in the first instance, try to be honest and try not to retain racial discrimination in his own party policy, as the hon. member for Houghton wants to do.</p>

<p>He made the remark: &#x201C;Om dit reg te kry, is een van die belangrikste vereistes dat daar eerlikheid moet wees tussen die verskillende volke.&#x201D; I do not know whether he was implying that from this side of the House, from the official Opposition, there has ever been dishonesty in the presentation of our policy. I believe that if we read the Hansard speeches of my leader, speeches which he made over a period of 27 years, we shall find an honest presentation of a policy which can have meaningful success in South Africa. Honesty has been the watch-word of the presentation of our policy. I do not believe that as far as we are concerned there is any problem on this side. I believe, too, that the hon. the Minister must agree that this Government has been fortunate in that it has had&#x2014;I admit that we have difficult problems in South Africa&#x2014;an extremely responsible Opposition to help it. I believe that we played a responsible role at all times. When the hon. the Minister said that we tried to break down their policy, that we tried to destroy what they were doing and that we do not readily want to accept the policy of independent homelands, I want to remind him that the main argument we have used all the time is that in terms of Government policy, its policy of independence, they have failed to develop the homelands in terms of the Government&#x2019;s own Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s recommendation. I believe that one of the big problems this Government faces today is that the homelands as such are as yet underdeveloped parts of South Africa. If the Government had taken our advice and done what we suggested, I believe that many of the problems which the homelands have today would have been solved.</p>

<p>*The aggressive word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; did not originate with us in the debate, but was used by the hon. members on the other side&#x2019;s own ambassador at UN. He raised the issue. He said that discrimination should be done away with. We fully agree with him, but we only want to indicate how it can be done. It should also be done much more rapidly.</p>

<p><span class="col_149-150" refersTo="page_0090"/>&#x2020;I want to raise a few other points. The motion of the Leader of the Opposition emphasized that if we are to achieve a better understanding and reach agreement with our neighbouring States in Southern Africa, it will depend not only on the quality of statesmanship that directs those efforts but also very largely on the confidence we can engender in all races in South Africa concerning the policies we are following. With the ability we have and the honesty we can engender, we must make it clear that all race groups will enjoy equal opportunities in this country.</p>

<p>It will also depend on the extent to which we can eliminate hurtful discrimination based on race and colour by the policies we follow. The Leader of the Opposition did right to mention these points. I believe they deserved emphasis. It is also encouraging to note that the Prime Minister and the Government appear to agree with the Leader of the Opposition. In recent days we of the Opposition have noted with satisfaction that great progress has been made in trying to eliminate many discriminatory practices in this country. Many of the steps which the Government is taking or which have been proposed by the Government at this stage are steps that we on this side of the House have been proposing over a very long period of time.</p>

<p>We note with satisfaction the successful talks which the hon. the Prime Minister recently held with the Coloured Representative Council&#x2019;s liaison committee. We are also pleased to note that good progress has apparently been made. It is pleasing to note, too, from the reports on those meetings, that every proposal put forward by the liaison committee has been accepted in principle by the Government. We note that there is going to be an expansion of power in as far as the functions of the Coloured Representative Council are concerned, and that the Executive Council of that body is to be given Cabinet status. Representation of Coloureds on various statutory boards is something we have pleaded for, and we are pleased to note that this is now going to take place. There will be a greater say in local government and the Executive Council will be given Cabinet status. The establishment of a statutory inter-Cabinet council will serve as a link between Parliament and the C.R.C. This is also a proposal they made. But unfortunately the Cabinet Committee which the hon. the Prime Minister envisaged he would appoint, will only be a contact between the Cabinet and the leaders of the C.R.C. It will not be meaningful contact between the C.R.C. and Parliament. We pleaded, when the C.R.C. was established and the great debate took place, that there should be a link between the C.R.C. and Parliament. I believe that any debate that we have in this hon. House about the Coloured people when the Coloured people themselves have not the opportunity to be present, is meaningless. Hon. members will recall that towards the end of last session we had debates about the future of the Coloured people. But these debates got us nowhere. The reason for this is that there was not meaningful discussion about the Coloured people because the Coloured people themselves were not able to be present. If this link between the C.R.C. and Parliament could be for all parties, so that all parties could participate, we would be taking a step in the right direction. However, we welcome these talks. We are glad that they are taking place, but I must emphasize that the cardinal issue that the Coloured people themselves emphasized, even accepting that the powers and the functions of the C.R.C. are to be extended and that a joint Cabinet Committee is to be established, is that the Coloured people made it quite clear that their best interests and the best interests of South Africa would be served only when the Coloured people received representation in Parliament. It is after all Parliament which is the sovereign authority in this land and I believe <span class="col_151-152" refersTo="page_0091"/>that it will be futile in the long term to try to establish two sovereign authorities in one country. One notices with great optimism and interest the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement that he did not wish to bind the future of the Coloured people and that the Government&#x2019;s policy on the future of the C.R.C. was not static. We are hopeful that these first steps which have been taken mean that we are perhaps witnessing the first steps towards the establishment of some federal arrangement. As far as the C.R.C. and the talks and the future negotiations that the Coloured people will have with the Government are concerned, I want to leave the matter there. But we do hope that what we have seen are at least the first faltering steps towards the establishing of some federal arrangement. We ultimately hope that the Coloured people will be granted representation in a parliament, be it a federal parliament, in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>There is another important issue which I would like to raise. We have spoken about discrimination and differentiation and we have tried to describe what those two words mean. As far as I am concerned, they mean very much the same thing.</p>

<p>I believe that if the Prime Minister wants to do a service to South Africa, he will direct his Ministers &#x2014;in fact his whole Cabinet&#x2014;to direct the attention of their departments to see, in whatever fields they operate, wherever they find difficulties, discrimination and things that are causing hardship to people whether they can eliminate them as quickly as possible. The first matter that I want to raise is the problem that we have in Port Elizabeth. I am very grateful that the hon. the ex-Minister of Indian Affairs is here.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister will know, in Port Elizabeth we have a very broadminded and very successful Indian community of some 5 000 people. I think the people of Port Elizabeth are proud of the Indian community there. They look upon them as South Africans. The Indians have played a great part in the development of our cities. They are mostly traders. At one time they were mostly trading in an area called South End, which has now been established as a White area, and the Indians have been removed from this area. They are now mostly trading in what is known as a free trade area in the northern section of our city. The remainder consists of some 100 to 200 Indian traders distributed throughout Port Elizabeth. They are shopkeepers, barbers, shoemakers, all trading successfully in many different ways. Most of their customers are White because they are trading in a White area. Now what has happened? These unfortunate traders have been advised that in August they have to remove themselves from the premises which they presently occupy and that they must establish their businesses in the free trade area. My appeal to the hon. the Minister is to do something about these people. Leave them to trade in their present premises for the rest of their lives. There is no need to move them. They are not harming anybody; they are serving a useful purpose; they are law-abiding and all they want to do is to be left alone to carry on with their businesses. This is a kind of discrimination, in terms of the Government&#x2019;s own policy&#x2014; and I am not going to argue about whether their policy is a good policy or not&#x2014;they can leave these people there to carry on with their trades until the end of their lifetime, and then perhaps some other arrangement can be made. If the hon. the Minister is prepared to do this, he can buy a tremendous amount of goodwill and do a tremendous amount to establish better race relations between the Whites and the Indians. I want to say to the Minister that these Indians are not people who are moaning; they are not people who keep on telling one about their disabilities or their difficulties; they face whatever comes to them. The Minister has it in his power to try to eliminate what could lead to a good deal of racial ill-feeling if he carries on with the present proposals. There are many ways in which the hon. the Minister can solve this problem. I am sure that he will take a good look at it and I hope that he will then be able to sort this thing out in the best interests of Port Elizabeth and of the country. Sir, this is just one instance where something can be done by a department on its own initiative to help to solve a problem.</p>

<p>I want to come now to another case where discrimination has also been brought about through the ill-advised action taken by a department. I am not going to ask <span class="col_153-154" refersTo="page_0092"/>the Government to change its policy in this respect; I am again just appealing to the Minister to see whether in terms of their own policy they cannot do something to make things easier and to bring about betterrace relations in South Africa. The hon. the Minister of Transport as Minister in charge of Railways will know that what is happening now with the development of his policy of centralized traffic control, is that many stations throughout South Africa are being closed down; they are becoming redundant. The area to which I want to refer is the Cradock constituency. I do not know whether the hon. member for Cradock is here; he knows about this. In that area a small station called Baroda between Cradock and Rosmead has been closed down in terms of the policy of centralized traffic control and several buildings have been left unoccupied, buildings which cost a lot of money to erect. A Coloured principal of a school in that area decided that he would hire these buildings from the Railway Administration to establish a boarding house to enable the children from the surrounding farms to attend school. Under normal circumstances these people would have to walk 7, 10 or 15 miles to attend school&#x2014;an impossible situation. So this headmaster did what he thought was the right thing. He rented the premises from the Railways, and the Railways were only too pleased to find some use for houses that were becoming redundant by the hundreds. The principal established his school there and had everything fixed up. The children attended school and everything was going well. The principal was satisfied that he had done the best he could do for the Coloured children in the area. It was not long afterwards that he got further advice from the S.A. Railway Administration that he must vacate the premises because a certain gentleman had asked that this arrangement be terminated because he lived nearby and this was not in the spirit of apartheid. So what happened? The principal was told that he had to vacate the premises. I believe that this kind of thing is bad. If the department concerned had looked at the situation more carefully and considered the implications, this need never have happened. I am absolutely convinced that if the children concerned had been White, there would never have been any request that such a building should be vacated. This is the kind of discrimination which in terms of the Government&#x2019;s own policy they can do something about. There are hundreds of these cases. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration will know of one case. We had Bantu females selling flowers in Port Elizabeth. They were known as the Bantu flower-sellers. They were there for dozens of years, plying their trade and providing a service for the housewives of Port Elizabeth. One day, in terms of the Government&#x2019;s separate development policy and group areas legislation, these flower-sellers, who were registered in Uitenhage, were told that Bantu living in Uitenhage could not sell flowers in Port Elizabeth. They were told to stop doing so and their livelihood was cut away from under their feet. I want to say, with all due respect to the hon. the Minister concerned, Mr. Janson, that when representations were made to him the matter was fixed up, but it took two years before they realized that a mistake had been made, and permission was then granted for these people to go on trading. I believe that these are the kind of things that Ministers should look at in their departments. They should have a good look at what is happening and at the implications of group areas, and where circumstances are hurtful, they should try to rectify the situation. In a small village where I have interests&#x2014;the hon. the Minister of Community Development knows about it and he has told me that the matter will be dealt with and that it will be fixed up, for which I am grateful&#x2014;there was another case where an over-officious policeman suddenly decided to prosecute White property-owners for housing Coloured people in an area which has been declared a White area, and therefore they became disqualified persons. These people had been living there for years, but suddenly, because of this over-zealous application of a Government law, these people were told to move. There is no need for that sort of thing. I believe that where you get a case like that, where White property-owners are even prosecuted for doing a perfectly normal thing, giving these people work and housing them when they are doing no harm, it can only lead to ill-feeling and racial bitterness in South Africa. So I believe that even in terms of the Government&#x2019;s own policy&#x2014;and I do not want to debate whether it is a good policy or a bad one&#x2014;they can do a tremendous amount to alleviate cases like those I have mentioned here and eliminate ill-feeling and dissatisfaction between the different race groups.</p>

<from><span class="col_155-156" refersTo="page_0093"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is always with great interest that I listen to the speeches by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central. When he rose today, I listened once again with great expectations, but really, the hon. member&#x2019;s speech was disappointing. At the start he said that the policy of the United Party contained no ambiguities. He undoubtedly said this with his tongue in his cheek, because even today one of them is stating that the White Parliament will disappear while another states that the White parliament will be retained. The hon. member states that they will give the Coloureds political rights in Parliament on a federal basis, while the hon. member for Bezuidenhout states that they will remove all forms of discrimination. He states that they will remove all forms of differentiation, but where does that lead to? Does that mean that they will throw open the schools? The hon. member devoted more than half of his time to an attempt to explain Government policy on the Coloureds and he could find no fault with it. The hon. member made a plea on behalf of the Indian community of Port Elizabeth, but he could have solved that problem in an easier way. I solved it a better way. I took the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs around Port Elizabeth for a full day. He listened to all the problems and on top of that he attended an enjoyable party with the Indians that evening. That is how things can be done. The hon. member need not come and waste his time in the House on that.</p>

<p>Since we were together last, the hon. member has become the deputy leader of the United Party in the Cape. I should like to congratulate him on that&#x2014;he is a good man. I think, however, that the reason for his being unable to achieve anything in this debate today is the fact that his heart is not with the United Party; his heart is on this side of the House. He knows that we are on the right path.</p>

<p>We have many experts on agriculture; he will have to wait a long time.</p>

<p>All the speeches in this debate thus far have had one central line of thought, namely that we are living in times of change. The world has entered a new era, an era in which the traditional institutions, the overall pattern built up over the past three decades since the Second World War is suddenly being challenged and summarily swept away and in which there is a striving towards new things and new lines of thought. The most important and probably the most characteristic manifestation of this new spirit of the times is probably the large-scale reshuffling of world leaders that has taken place over the past 12 months. One need only think of the major world leaders who were at the helm this time last year, but who are now no longer there. We can call to mind Heath, Papadopoulos, Markarios, Caetano, Spinola, Pompidou. Norman Kirk, Willie Brandt, Golda Meir, Haile Selassie, Richard Nixon and others. Some are dead and others have disappeared from the scene This is a sign that humanity is continually striving towards new things. Here in Africa the striving towards a change in leaders has not, perhaps, manifested itself so strongly. The slight tremor of that kind of phenomenon which we are experiencing here, has now manifested itself in the form of the Pegasus survey which gives evidence of the United Party supporters on the Rand and in Cape Town no longer wanting their leader. We should be sorry if they were to want to get rid of their leaders by means of opinion surveys and opinion tests of this kind. I think Carlisle said: &#x201C;Change whenever needful is always painful.&#x201D; To us it is decidedly painful to see how the Leader of the Opposition, a man whom we have always held in high esteem and respect as a person, owing to his integrity and his loyalty, being subverted and undermined by people within his party. We trust that this process, through which the United Party is necessarily on the road to its downfall, will accelerate and will not be too prolonged. It cannot be helped, because the United Party is a sinking ship. The waves are already breaking over it and while the captain stands on the mast and tries to announce his policy in well modulated phrases, there is mutiny on his ship. In these times of challenging world problems, of changing leaders, of inflation, recession, unemployment, monetary instability, energy crises, and all these things, South Africa stands as virtually the sole exception in the world, as the hon. the Minister of Finance again indicated this afternoon. South Africa stands with a sound and prospering economy, with a strong and dedicated Government and with <span class="col_157-158" refersTo="page_0094"/>peace and quiet while elsewhere, bombs are exploding. Above all, South Africa stands with a strong and dynamic leader, a leader unassailably strong within his own party, a leader who enjoys the support of all population groups in this country Hon. members need only consult the <i>Sunday Times</i>&#x2014;even last Sunday&#x2019;s edition&#x2014;if they do not believe me. He is a leader who has been called &#x201C;the statesman of Africa&#x201D; by the Institute of Conflict in London. He is a leader who, even in the great world outside Africa, has drawn attention to himself and enjoys the interest of the world. In the past it was strong and dynamic leaders who made world history and kept the world on its course. In our time it is occurring to an ever increasing extent that the masses are starting to take over and that mass hysteria and mass emotion determine the destiny of nations. We are grateful that the National Party has again provided a leader who is really at the helm, a leader who is steering the ship of the White nation in Southern Africa through the rocks of the stormy sea. This period and this situation offer a leader what is probably the greatest challenge ever faced by a leader in the world before. However, the wisdom of his statesmanship raises new hope for peace, prosperity and progress in Southern Africa. The National Party and its leader are creating a new order in Southern Africa, a new order in which a group of states will exist which will be politically sovereign and independent of each other and economically inter-dependent on each other. It will be a group of states in which mutual respect and understanding, helpfulness and prosperity will ensure peace. It will be a group of nations in which no nation will have to live in fear of aggression, but in which due cognizance will be taken of the needs and the aspirations of each nation. What a privilege is it not to create order in this challenging country, in these challenging times and out of this challenging diversity. Of course, it requires wisdom, statesmanship, endless patience, perseverance and faith I believe, however, that the hon. the Prime Minister, following the course he does, with the peace ventures he has already undertaken, will lead Southern Africa out of the valley of suspicion, mistrust and bloodshed to the highlands of peace and mutual confidence. It must be very clearly stated that whereas this possibility and the strong probability of détente politics, of détente in Africa, is developing, it has not come upon us suddenly, as if dropped from heaven. For the past 30 years the National Party and its leaders have been thinking and working on the foundations and the basic foundation structures of a policy which has in fact made this occurrence possible. These events over the past weeks and months in Africa have proved unequivocally that the solution of the problem of Southern Africa and peace and progress in South Africa can only be built on the policy of separate development because only that policy guarantees the sovereignty which is sacred to every people. It guarantees the retention of identity which is the pride of every people and it guarantees the realization of the national striving which keeps the national feeling alive. No other policy can or will ever succeed in Southern Africa and this is most clearly demonstrated, too, by the dilemma of minority groups of White persons elsewhere in Africa and the laborious process of achieving peace and finding solutions to the problems there. Let this be a lesson to those two parties sitting there. Let it be a lesson to those who think that they can outwit the Black people by means of ancy flourishes and placatory noises. Let the events in Africa be a lesson to those who think that by means of manoevuvring they can pull the wool over the eyes of the Black people and establish White supremacy forever in a unitary state, a lesson spelt out in letters of fire, that Africa does not allow itself to be hoodwinked by trickery, that in Africa, it is only basic truths that count. The choice facing Southern Africa, therefore, is clear. It is either separate development with full sovereignty for each nation within its own territory, or a unitary state with a majority government in accordance with the principle of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. The policy of separate development on which the National Party has been working and laboriously building over the past three decades is recognized and understood by most people in South Africa today That is why it is now possible to continue doing away with irksome forms of discrimination on the basis of colour, systematically, purposefully and in an orderly way. This was held out as a prospect many years ago by the late Dr. Verwoed when he said that the day the policy of separate development was accepted by all the peoples in South Africa, discrimination in South Africa could disappear. The emphasis, when we talk about the <span class="col_159-160" refersTo="page_0095"/>disappearance of discrimination, must fall on the orderly way. We are not a revolutionary party. We are a party which believes in evolution. We do not believe in drastic revolutionary changes. Of course there will still be differentiating measures, such differentiating measures as are required by every people to protect what belongs to it. I am sorry the hon. member for Umhlatuzana is not here. He would like to know what differentiation is and what discrimination is. According to their policy which proposes a multi-racial nation, they cannot differentiate If one applies any differences in respect of multi-racialism, then it is discrimination. However, when one is dealing with a number of different peoples, as in our case here, each people has the right to take such steps in order to protect what belongs to it, its culture and its pattern and philosophy of life. By taking such steps, it does not imply thereby that it is better than any other people, it does not imply thereby that it is superior. All it implies is that it is proud of what belongs to it, of those things which are sacred to every people and which it would like to preserve intact. The National Party believes in a multi-national community. That is why we are able to do away with discrimination on the basis of colour and race, and we can still protect what belongs to us by taking such differentiating measures as will ensure that we do not lose our identity as a people. The benefits and blessings of the policy of separate development enjoyed by hon. members on that side, hon. members on this side and all the people of this country, and which will eventually manifest themselves in Southern Africa as well, are the fruit of the thoughts and work of the National Party. Now I am probably justified in asking: While for the past 30 years this party has been building on a policy of separate development which can provide us with these fruits, what has that party done? What has their contribution been to the political development of South Africa? What has their contribution been to the solution of the problems of South Africa and Southern Africa? The answer is easy, namely an absolute round nil. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that they were the pathfinders, that they were the people who showed us the way. They are pathfinders, of the kind that, when we see that they are indicating a certain direction, we know that the correct path runs in the opposite direction. Today, after 27 years, they are still sitting in the Opposition benches, without a policy on which they are able to agree among themselves and without a policy which they can take to the people. They have made no contribution. What they, with their short-sightedness and lack of vision, have in fact done, is to have created a façade of hatred abroad, not just against this party, but against the country and its people, by means of misrepresentations and distortions and gruesome stories in their newspapers. That façade of hatred is still virtually impenetrable, a façade of hatred which they and their newspapers have created by means of misrepresentations and gruesome stories. I must say that some of them, and some of their newspapers in particular, are today still so blinded by Afrikaner hatred that they are still continuing, through insidious suggestion and dripping insinuation, with the undermining operation and in so doing providing with ammunition the enemies we want to destroy. I should not like to call into question the loyalty and integrity of any hon. member on that side of the House, but we are living at a juncture in which we must choose our words very carefully. We are living at a juncture in which, for the sake of short-term political benefit, people stand up in this House or on a platform and speak about a police state and compare the Government&#x2019;s policy with Nazism. That is what some people are very prone to doing. Not only do I say that such allegations are untrue, I also begin to doubt the loyalty of such a person. While the hon. the Prime Minister is engaged in this great effort, while he is engaged in the extremely sensitive task of bringing about détente politics in Southern Africa and an hon. member of the House appears on television in the United States of America and, in reply to a question asking about the success that might attend the Prime Minister&#x2019;s efforts, express scepticism, with a kind of intellectual arrogance, about these efforts. I say that this is nothing but sour envy. Then I doubt the loyalty of that member. When the same hon. member was asked whether she thought that South Africa should remain in UN or whether it should withdraw, she said that it should remain because it was necessary for UN to supervise the dismantling of apartheid. When an hon. member says something of that sort, I doubt the loyalty of such an hon. member towards South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I never accused the member of having in fact done so, but I want to ask whether my information to the effect that she did in fact do so, is correct. I want to ask her whether, when she gets the chance, she will rise in this House and support that standpoint. Is it the policy of their party that South Africa should be placed under the supervision of UN? Will the hon. member advocate that policy before her voters in Houghton? [Interjections.] I should like to ask the Leader of the Progressive Party in his absence whether it is his policy that South Africa should be placed under the supervision of UN. If that is not his policy, he must tell us here and he must repudiate that hon. member.</p>

<p>We are living at a juncture which makes it essential, in the interests of all the people in South Africa, for us to say or do nothing that will make our hon. Prime Minister&#x2019;s arduous task even more arduous. We may not hamper or obstruct this difficult peace plan. All of us in all parties must do everything possible to assist the Prime Minister because he enters Africa and holds talks with the leaders of other African states, then he does not speak on behalf of the National Party alone, but on behalf of South Africa That is why it is the task of all of us in this House to support this effort and to do nothing to obstruct it. If this peace crusade of the hon. the Prime Minister does not succeed, what is the alternative? The alternative to peace is surely strife, confrontation and bloodshed.</p>

<p>It is also essential for this effort to succeed because Southern Africa is undoubtedly threatened by the Russian and Chinese Communists. It is strange and also co-incidental that at the stage when through propaganda, colonialism started to acquire such a leprous hue and emotional value that the Western powers, one after the other, made haste to leave Africa, Russia and China were ready immediately to ensure that socialist states came into being in Africa and to provide economic and military aid. Similarly, when the British withdrew their fleet east of Suez in 1968, the Russian navy was immediately ready to fill that void. Today it is calculated that there are more than 25 Russian warships in the Indian Ocean, and since 1971 they have tripled their activities in the Indian Ocean. Russia and China have diplomatic relations with 32 African states, among them Botswana, one of our enighbouring states. Over the past 15 years China has made more than R6,3 billion available to 23 African states, in addition to aid in one form or another. More then 25 000 Chinese workers are working in Africa. China&#x2019;s motives in Africa are clearly apparent from the innumerable trade and cultural missions, the deputations from China, the radio broadcasts from Peking to Africa, and from the subtle indoctrination of diplomats and technicians. Chou En Lai and other Chinese leaders visit Africa and associate themselves with the radical, revolutionary struggle against colonialism in Southern Africa. It is particularly important for Southern African to take cognizance of the fact that the whole philosophy on which Chinese Communism is based, does not believe in peace, but is based on continual conflict. It is very easy to detect this. In Mao Testung&#x2019;s little red book he states, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Political power grows out the barrel of a gun.</block>

<p>That is one of his most famous sayings. He has also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">War is good because it is purifying.</block>

<p>Then, too, he states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Only through the successful use of violence can a true revolutionary character be built.</block>

<p>At another place he also states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Revolutionary war is an anti-toxin that purges us of our sins.</block>

<p>That is the philosophy on which the politics of these people is based and that is why it is certain that as long as they are in <span class="col_163-164" refersTo="page_0097"/>Africa there will not be peace. Fortunately there are leaders in Africa who are aware of this danger and who, together with South Africa are prepared to combat this Red tidal wave. On 23 October 1974, in the Other Place, the hon. the Prime Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; I believe that South Africa has come to the cross-roads. I think that Southern Africa has to make a choice. I think that that choice lies between peace on one hand or an escalation of strife on the other. &#x2026; The toll of major confrontation will be high. I would go so far as to say that it will be too high for Southern Africa to pay.</block>

<p>In the light of dangers threatening us, as I have indicated, and in the light of these grave words from our hon. Prime Minister, it is urgently necessary for co-operation in Africa to succeed. That is why I want to make an appeal once again to all members here present, that we should do nothing and say nothing to hinder that effort. In recent months all of us, each South African, has become aware of how decisive and final is the choice which Africa will have to make. We are all aware of the key role to be played by South Africa in this regard. We have all become aware of the task and the calling facing each South African as regards the recognition of human dignity and the elimination of any hint of superiority and paternalism towards our non-White peoples. We cannot all go to Africa and conduct dialogue. That we must leave to our trusted and tried leaders who are exceptionally well qualified to do that. Each of us, in our everyday transactions, can cause detente to succeed through the realization of our Christian charity, through showing simple decency and friendliness and helpfulness towards everyone with whom we come in contact. We who sit here and imagine that we are leaders, also have a task. It is also our task to provide fearless but tactful leadership where our people&#x2014;not only Nationalists, but also, and particularly, the United Party supporters&#x2014;have not yet correctly sensed the attitude and spirit of the new era. There, too, we must provide honest leadership. It is my considered opinion that the accelerating changes taking place in Africa offer us in Southern Africa a unique opportunity for the forming of the future here in Africa, a future which will be for the good of all the peoples in Africa. I believe that the National Party has the right man at the helm for that great task.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the course of my speech I shall react to the arguments which the hon. member who has just sat down used in his speech. At this stage, however, I want to repeat only one sentence and return to it later in the course of my speech. The hon. member said, &#x201C;Slimmigheid sal nie baat nie.&#x201D; (Trickery will be to no avail.)</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I believe that one of the most difficult tasks facing us in this House, particularly at this time, is to assess in relation to the affairs of our country, those acts, those political acts of omission or commission, those policy changes which are apparent or subtle and which will in future be regarded by posterity as important milestones in the history of our country. We who are sitting in this House find it difficult, I believe, to sift them and to find out which are the important ones, but I believe that in this session, following on the change which has taken place in Southern Africa, there is a responsibility resting on each one of us to assess the events of recent months, the situation in which we find ourselves and the action, urgent or less urgent, which we believe has now been taken in the interests of this country. I believe further that we in this House in the course of this debate must frankly indicate whether we believe, and I must indicate whether I believe and for what reasons, that the Nationalist Government will be able, in adequate measure, in the weeks and months that lie ahead to adapt to the inevitable and necessary change. Obviously, Mr. Speaker, in the time that is available I must confine myself to a limited field of Government policy and Government administration, and therefore I propose to canvass the ability of the Government to adapt its policies in a manner which will be effective in bringing about real, permanent and effectual racial co-operation in South Africa. Such co-operation is in my opinion a prerequisite, a <i>sine qua non,</i> to meaningful inter-State co-operation in Southern Africa, and such co-operation is necessary, Sir, if we are to be able to combat with any chance of success the attempts by Communism to infiltrate into Southern Africa and into South Africa itself. I think we can emphasize again that the greatest obstacle that we can establish to combat <span class="col_165-166" refersTo="page_0098"/>Communism is a strong State with loyal citizens, who will apply the principle of respect for each other, who will have their freedom in the State in which they live and a citizenship that is based on a broad patriotism to which all the people in the country subscribe. Let me say at once that I regard the statement of our Ambassador on behalf of the Government at the United Nations on 23 October 1974 as an acceptable, challenging, realistic statement which should be supported by everyone in South Africa. It was an unequivocal indication of direction That discrimination based on skin colour alone is indefensible. Sir, this was enlarged upon by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs in a broadcast in December, when he said, in dealing with this matter, that we must do away with humiliating measures and practices which harm good relations between White and non-White. Sir, these sentiments are being echoed, I believe, in the hearts and minds of the vast majority of South Africans who anticipate and look forward to a new future for this country of ours.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I believe that there must be action. There must be rapid action; there must be change, and these statements which have been made must not be allowed to become pious statements of intent with no indication that they are to be implemented. The people of South Africa are looking forward to that implementation and to what it will mean to us as a nation to have that implementation made effective. But. Sir, the road to the implementation of these declarations is not easy. The statement by the hon. the Prime Minister, followed by the statement of our Ambassador at the United Nations and subsequently by the statement by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he was overseas, provided an opening, a break in the isolation, in the bondage, which has surrounded South Africa because of the use throughout the world of that one word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; with all its connotations, true or false, that could be used against South Africa. When that speech was made by the Prime Minister, when the speech was made in UN, Black African leaders indicated immediately a preparedness to discus and to accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the South African Government. I want to say that in accepting the <i>bona fides</i> of the South African Government we must be certain that in getting rid of the odium attaching South Africa&#x2014; the newspapers supporting the Government themselves said that we became the &#x201C;muis-hond&#x201D; of the world because of the use of this word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;&#x2014;in doing away with that odium which attaches us&#x2014;which we can now do because of the breakthrough made by the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister and our attitude at UN&#x2014;we must realize that words are not an effective deodorant.</p>

<p>The public and the world want to see the action and change necessary in this regard. We shah have to accept, as I accept, that these declarations mean fundamental changes in what we have euphemistically called &#x201C;the South African way of life&#x201D;. This is a comfortable expression which means that most Whites need not disturb themselves in the way in which we have chosen to live. Sir, why do I say this? I say this because we must realize that the change of attitude from confrontation to communication, internally and externally, is not going to be an easy one. The hon. member for Potchefstroom and others who have sat with me for three years on the Schlebusch Commission, later the Le Grange Commission, will know that if there is one thing that we gained insight into, through evidence and through reading thousands of documents, it was the fact that the attitude of confrontation between White and non-White was conceived, nourished and developed by the word-weapons which we unfortunately as White people to a great extent gave to the radicals and those who wished to beat us, words like the word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; which could be given a blanket interpretation to any audience to which they spoke.</p>

<p>Sir, I have also learned, and I think my colleagues will agree with me, that equally unacceptable to the non-Whites is liberal paternalism, that spirit in which, as I said, in what we euphemistically call &#x201C;our South African way of live&#x201D;, we make concessions as a pale palliative to our consciences. Equally there is the shallowness&#x2014;and here I wish to join issue with the hon. member for Sea Point&#x2014;of the hon. member for Sea Point in the Sea Point constituency where I live and other live and who says: &#x201C;Here you will do this with a public amenity&#x201D;, and then goes back to Pinelands where he lives and where he enjoys the full and complete separateness which exists there. [Interjections.] Sir, that sort of attitude has got to stop. [Interjection.] The hon. member says it is childish. I hope that the Progressive Party, which has a policy commission consisting of more members than it has Members of Parliament, will at some <span class="col_167-168" refersTo="page_0099"/>time tell us what its policy is in regard to race relations. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to say that what is said and what is done must no longer be vague. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs said we must be honest in what we do and say in these matters. I welcome the fact, that the hon. the Prime Minister, as he stated earlier this afternoon, will inform us about what is to be done&#x2014;this is something we have asked for over the years&#x2014;in regard to the appointment of non-Whites on certain statutory bodies. We will no doubt hear about that later from him, but I want to say this. I keenly anticipate hearing from the hon. the Minister of Community Development and the hon. the Minister of the Interior what they are going to do in that regard. However, when we make statements and declare attitudes and changes, I want to repeat what the hon. member for Algoa said: &#x201C;Slimmigheid sal nie baat nie.&#x201D; For example, when we make a statement, when an official statement is made that the Nico Malan Opera House and Theatre will be open to all races, that is not enough.</p>

<p>We must spell out what is meant because immediately there is the attitude that that statement can be interpreted in several ways. It can be applied by having separate nights for separate races, or it can be applied by having separate seating for the races within the hall. As far as I am concerned. I hope and trust that some member of the Government will tell us that when they say that the opera house is open to all races they mean that it will be open to all races at all times for all performances There must be no niggardly separation or differentiation as regards the seating in that complex. I believe that is the attitude which we have to adopt. We cannot make statements or announcements unless there is absolute clarity on them.</p>

<p>I want to return to one statement which was made by our ambassador to the United Nations. I hope that the hon. member on that side of the House who follows me will deal with this. The ambassador stated that peoples who want to associate with one another may do so but that peoples who do not want to associate with one another need not. Am I to interpret that as falling within the policy of multinationalism and that when the ambassador speaks about peoples he means that the Xhosas may associate with the Zulus if they want to and also, as we believe ought to be the case, that there is the personal choice for individuals to associate with those citizens of their own country with whom they wish to associate, no matter what race colour or creed they are? I believe this is a matter about which there can be doubt and on which clarity is needed.</p>

<p>How do we go about trying to solve this problem in South Africa? Both sides of this House accept that there are changes that must take place. We on this side have approached the problem we have by considering the two aspects of our national life that have to be reconciled. We have stated that in our view it is reasonable for the Whites to want security in a country in which they are outnumbered four or five to one. They want to be sure that their civilization and their achievements will be protected, that their standards, their property and enterprise will be safeguarded. Those are perfectly reasonable expectations. What are the needs of the Blacks and the other non-White communities? Their needs are also reasonable. They want relief from political impotence, from economic stagnation. They want the right to greater opportunities and to self-government, to education, work, medical services and social welfare, and they want a fair share in the progress and growth of South Africa that would end without their contributions. Those are the two needs which have to be reconciled.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging said yesterday that we should accent the <i>bona fides</i> of the National Party, I hope we do; I am sure we do. However, the National Party must not say, when we accept its <i>bona fides,</i> that we do not do so when we say that we do not accept that there is infallibility in so far as their policy is concerned. The hon. member must be prepared to argue his party&#x2019;s policy against the alternative. I believe that if we can have a debate as to how to eliminate discrimination we will be making a constructive contribution towards sorting out the problems of South Africa. However, if that side of the House says that federation in any shape or form is out as far as they are concerned and that the only solution is the development of separate nationalisms then it is futile to argue with them. The concept of federalism is accepted by the Black leaders in this country while the concept of separate national development is not accepted.</p>

The concept of federation is one which is accepted and not separate nationalism and independence as far as the Black people of South Africa are concerned. But let me go further; let us assume that this Government succeeds in its attempts to create separate national homelands or sovereign independent states. What will they achieve? They will achieve a state in which they have hived off from South Africa half the Bantu population of South Africa. Left with us is still an equal number of Bantu people who must have their political future in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>There is no division on the point of federation and I have told the House that. That is where we want to go. My hon. leader has said over and over again that if these states have reached the stage of independence they will be entitled to their independence, but we want them within a federal state and not as independent states. Let me go further. If we are to indicate <i>bona fides</i> I think we have to look immediately at those steps which must be taken without delay so far as our country is concerned. We must be able to take steps which are indicating in cold reality the way which we are prepared to go in this country. I want to give to the Government today, if I can, some indications of what I believe are the steps that must be taken this week, this month, by this Government to give body and meaning to the undertaking which has been given in the United Nations and elsewhere. The non-White groups in this country are looking for practical indications from us that they are accepted as South Africans, that their personal hopes and aspirations are respected and that they are as much of South Africa as we Whites claim to be, rightfully, of Africa. What is the change that is to take place and which I believe should take place immediately? I want to repeat what I said before, namely that no man has more power in Africa than the Prime Minister of this country. No man has more power, but at the same time the hon. the Prime Minister is shouldered with the responsibility of seeing to it, by his actions, that the faith which is available to him now in the Black people of Africa, is not lost or frittered away by inactivity in certain matters in our domestic scene. I want to specify some of these. The hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation is not here, but is there a single member on that side of the House who does not believe that selection of international teams to represent South Africa must be done on merit and that that will come in this country? If none of them can contest that that is a reality, for Heaven&#x2019;s sake, let the hon. the Minister declare it tomorrow, that if sporting bodies want to select their international teams on merit they may do so. It has to come.</p>

<p>Let us look at the question of passports and visas. Where over the years the hon. the Minister of the Interior &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Hon. members must not converse so loudly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; has been utilizing his discretionary powers in regard to passports and visas to stop mixed teams, to stop Coloured sportsmen coming here and to stop people who might be critical of the Government from coming to or leaving South Africa. Let him declare that in future his discretion in dealing with passports and visas will be focussed solely upon what is required for the safety of South Africa. Look at the untold harm over the years. There is no law to say that a Black jockey cannot come to South Africa, but a Minister uses his discretion in issuing a passport or visa and to apply something for which there is no law. There is no law in South Africa which says that there cannot be mixed sport in this country. It is the actions of the Minister of Community Development in not granting permits or the Minister of the Interior in controlling passports and visas. As far as the hon. the Minister of Community Development is concerned, I want to remind him that there are 24 289 Coloured families, 10 247 Indian families and 1 257 Chinese families who are on the removals list because of the implementation of the Group Areas Act. They have to move and live somewhere else. The hon. the Minister knows what a task it is to find accommodation for those people. In the meantime they have lived for years, and they have continued <span class="col_171-172" refersTo="page_0101"/>to live for years, with this sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. If the hon. the Minister were to announce tomorrow that there would be no more compulsory removals, except where necessary for slum clearance and where alternative accommodation was available to the families who are to be removed, he would build a fountain of goodwill. It would be unsurpassed by anything he has ever done in his department if such an announcement were to be made. Let the hon. the Minister say to the Cape Town city council that if they want to provide amenities here and there for their citizens, and that is what their citizens want, they can go ahead. Let him go ahead and, in my constituency, provide amenities for the non-White people at the Green Point cycle track. The voters of Green Point would approve of it; they would send me back to this House. But let the city council decide. It is not a matter for Government decision.</p>

<p>In the Public Service, is there any earthly reason why, in view of the state of the finances of this country with the bonanza on gold income tax in the last year, this Cabinet cannot announce that from next month the professional classes in the Government service will get equal pay for equal qualifications and equal responsibilities? It can be afforded. How many of these people are there? This would be an indication of intent to carry out what the Government says is its policy. Let this Government tomorrow say: We cannot go on with this folly of a situation which, according to the regulations applicable, does not permit a Black man to carry a White passenger in his taxi, if he is the owner of the taxi. If the Black man is not the owner of the taxi, if it is a White man who owns the taxi and the Black man is a driver, the same taxi can carry a White passenger. How can we have these ludicrous situations, these discriminations?</p>

<p>I have already said that I would like to refer to one other thing. It may be just a side issue, but it is a very vital thing in the city of Cape Town. I wonder to what extent this imposition of bus apartheid is responsible for the fact that when a pensioner in my constituency wishes to go half a mile to the library to change a book and back again, and he is too old to walk that far, it costs him 32c. Sixteen cent is the minimum bus tariff for any stage in Cape Town. That is what is happening. How much is the rise in the fare influenced by the cost of implementing this bus apartheid? Surely this is again a matter that the hon. the Minister of Transport and the other hon. Ministers concerned could leave to the bus companies and municipalities so that they can run the best service in the most economical manner for the people of their city. If the people want to have the luxury of apartheid, then run your first class exclusive buses and double the fare if you want to. Let those people pay and not everybody else, not the needy. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>In the time that I have left I would like to say that we have got to live and learn to live in this country, respecting people irrespective of their colour and irrespective of the positions in which they are. I believe that that is what we have to do, and that these steps which I have outlined are steps which the Government can take immediately.</p>

<p>In the light of the reactions I have had, such as those of the hon. member for Potchefstroom, I find it necessary to support my hon. leader and to say that I cannot believe that this Government is capable of making adaptations fast enough and effective enough in South Africa to give truth and import and substance to the words of our ambassador at the United Nations.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the United Party has brought a motion of no confidence to this House. We have to take a look at the United Party itself in the first place, the party which brought this motion to the House. In the first place, this is a party with a policy which is in essence discriminatory, a policy they are unable to sell to Africa. In the second place, this is a party which is divided internally, divided in such a way that it will never be able to heal this split. This morning we read in the newspaper that the hon. member for Randburg was in trouble, and I should like to know whether he subsequently lost his head, or did not lose his head, or alternatively, whether his head was impaled on a stake.</p>

<p>On 4 December 1974 <i>Oggendblad,</i> under a fairly prominent heading (translation) &#x201C;Hatred renting the United Party, says Japie&#x201D;, published a report in which the following was stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Major problem within the United Party is the ineradicable hatred certain <span class="col_173-174" refersTo="page_0102"/>politicians entertain towards one another, Mr. Japie Basson, M.P., said in an interview yesterday.</block>

<p>Mr. Basson said, and I quote again from that report (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A centralized party system such as the one which exists in England limits the possibility of provincial party leaders, such as Mr. Harry Schwarz and Mr. Myburgh Streicher, becoming so powerful so as to create ill-feeling against general party interests.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout says the leader of the United Party in the Transvaal and the leader of the United Party in the Cape are too powerful and are using that power to create dissension, which goes against the interests of the party. The hon. front-bencher went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The major problem of the present United Party party system is that it creates an opportunity for people to hate one another without there being an efficient central mechanism to contain this hatred.</block>

<p>What is even more important to us in these times, is to know who hates whom in the United Party. I want to ask the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to tell me who are the people he hates. Does he hate the hon. member for Hillbrow, or does he not hate him? The hon. member for Hillbrow can tell us whether or not he hates the hon. member for Randburg. The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town can tell us&#x2014;after all, we know him&#x2014;whether or not he hates the hon. member for Yeoville. I see the hon. member does not want to answer. Perhaps he could tell us: Does he love him? The problem in the United Party is a twofold problem. On the one hand it is a problem of policy; the fellows cannot agree on a policy. The second problem is a problem of personalities. I have to add a third: there is a leadership problem. This report contains a few facts from which we are able to make these deductions. Apart from the fact that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says that the members hate one another internally&#x2014;it says so here in black and white &#x2026;</p>

[Interjections.] We know &#x2014;it is a well-known fact&#x2014;that a bitter struggle was waged in the caucus of the United Party during the past few days because the hon. member for Randburg used certain interests, his companies, to have an opinion poll conducted to get at the throats of his own leader and the members of the Old Guard in his party. We know that such a struggle was waged. Does the hon. member want to deny this? Does he want to deny that a struggle was waged in the caucus of the United Party recently? A party which is divided internally, as is the case with the United Party, is unable to make any positive contribution to solve the problems of South Africa, because such a party does not speak with one voice. The important aspect as far as policy is concerned in respect of which that party does not speak with one voice, is the question as to whether or not this White Parliament will continue to exist as a sovereign power.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was my intention this afternoon to come back to the speech of the hon. member for Green Point, but due to the interesting developments <span class="col_179-180" refersTo="page_0105"/>of the past few hours, it would be more convenient for me to leave his speech until some later occasion when the latest developments in the United Party are over. There are serious differences among the members of the United Party caucus. These differences are concerned with policy, for example, with the continued existence of the White Parliament, with leadership, with the approach to the political problems of South Africa, with discrimination, the protection of the so-called rights of the individual, human rights, and so on. These differences manifested themselves in the formation of two groups in the United Party: on the one hand, the reformists, and on the other hand, the conformists; the one side is called the Young Turks, and the other side the Old Guard. We may also refer to the one part as the dynamic part of the United Party and the other part as the sterile part. At present this polarization of the United Party is the most important factor in the political life of that party. It is important for us to decide for ourselves who the Young Turks in the United Party are. They are the hon. member for Bryanston, the hon. member for Sandton, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the hon. member for Yeoville. I am a little uncertain about the hon. member for Edenvale. Sometimes he ranges himself on the side of the left wing of the Old Guard, and at other times with the right wing of the Young Turks. One cannot quite fathom him out. Now an important thing has happened. The hon. member for Randburg has been kicked out of the caucus of the United Party. The reason for his being kicked out is particularly interesting. Recently, so we understand, two opinion polls were conducted. The one poll, so we understand, was conducted by him, and he subsequently discussed this opinion poll in a private conversation with a newspaper. Afterwards <i>The Star,</i> acting on its own initiative, arranged an opinion poll of its own, and this poll was published.</p>

<p>Now the chairman of the United Party caucus comes along and furnishes the reasons for the hon. member&#x2019;s dismissal. If we analyse these reasons, we see that he was kicked out purely on account of the fact that he conducted an opinion poll and that he went to the newspaper with the details of this opinion poll and held a discussion with them. It is not because this poll that he had conducted was published. The resolution of the United Party caucus does not imply that the hon. member for Randburg was dishonest, it does not imply that he projected a false opinion to the world or that the opinion is scientifically unacceptable to the United Party caucus. After this resolution of the United Party caucus had been published, I want to assert that the opinion poll of the United Party which was conducted by <i>The Star</i> achieved enhanced status. There was no attack on it whatsoever by the United Party caucus in its resolution. This man is being kicked out of the United Party caucus for a relatively small and trivial thing. As a member of a caucus I want to say that his action was quite wrong, but if there had been a fine spirit in that caucus, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout assured us last night, the leaders would have taken the accused by the arm and said: &#x201C;Friend, you are a newcomer to this caucus; you acted wrongly and are not allowed to behave in this manner.&#x201D; They would then have reprimanded him.</p>

<p>However, this is not what it is all about in the United Party caucus. This man was apprehended for a far greater reason. This reason is that an attempt was made to get to the heart of the Young Turks as such. This resolution of the United Party caucus is not a resolution which was directed solely at the hon. member for Randburg. It was aimed at the Young Turks in that party, as I have already said. It was adopted as a result of the policy of the Young Turks, as a result of the success of the Young Turks and as a result of the methods of the Young Turks. That is why the caucus took action against the Young Turks in this regard. Every Young Turk sitting in this House must realize that the resolution adopted by the caucus last night is not only a resolution aimed at the hon. member for Randburg sitting here, but a resolution aimed at each of those Young Turks; it is a resolution against the hon. member for Bezuidenhout; it is a resolution against the hon. member for Sandton; it is a resolution against the hon. member for Bryanston, and it is more or less a resolution against the hon. member for Edenvale, but the most important thing of all is this: It is not only a blow aimed at the hon. member for Randburg, but a resolution aimed at the hon. member for Yeoville. The history of the United Party has now developed in such a way that the hon. member for Randburg has had to become a symbol of the dissension within the United Party caucus. Sir, the Old Guard in the United <span class="col_181-182" refersTo="page_0106"/>Party decided to make him the martyr, to crucify him, while they actually intend going much further. Sir, when this resolution was proposed in the caucus, the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;so I presume&#x2014;most assuredly interpreted it as I interpret it, but the hon. member for Yeoville defended this resolution along with the other few Young Turks sitting here. There was no agreement on this resolution. They defended this resolution since they realized that this resolution was directed at them as much as it was directed at the hon. member for Randburg, and that is why they had to try to prevent a split. No, Sir, our conclusion today is that there are more people than just the hon. member for Randburg who have become losers. I want to say to the hon. member for Sandton: &#x201C;You were a loser in the caucus yesterday.&#x201D; The hon. member for Bryanston was a loser in his caucus yesterday; the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was a loser in his caucus yesterday, and the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;and he is the most important of them all&#x2014;suffered a serious defeat in the United Party caucus yesterday. Sir, in the past few years we have seen how the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal, Mr. Harry Schwarz, was built up as a winner. At all costs his &#x201C;winning image&#x201D; always had to be held up to us; at breakfast on Sunday mornings we had to read: &#x201C;Harry Schwarz triumphs again&#x201D;; Harry Schwarz the great winner&#x201D;; (translation) &#x201C;Harry Schwarz&#x2019;s opponents have now been destroyed&#x201D;, and so on. Sir, this winning image of the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal was destroyed in the United Party caucus yesterday because he was the loser there. I want to make an important statement here, and that is that every member of the Old Guard, as they are sitting here today, also interprets yesterday&#x2019;s resolution as a victory over the Young Turks I have mentioned here. I want to put this question to the hon. member for Hillbrow, who is one of the ringleaders of the Old Guard: Do you deny that you interpret this caucus resolution as a victory over the hon. member for Yeoville? Sir, I challenge the hon. member for Hillbrow to deny that he interprets this resolution as a victory over the Young Turks.</p>

<p>Sir, we are now drawing closer to the position of the hon. member for Yeoville. We have got to know the hon. member for Yeoville in this House as a man with exceptional talents, talents for which there was no scope within the ranks of the United Party. Sir, this opinion poll that was published evoked an interesting reaction, and I want to examine this reaction a little. The hon. member for Yeoville reacted to this opinion poll as follows; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The results were very interesting and deserve careful study.</block>

<p>Sir, with those words the hon. member for Yeoville lent status to this opinion poll. He tried to persuade the people to take this opinion poll seriously. He is trying to get people to take more notice of this opinion poll. In other words, if this opinion poll is an act of disloyalty towards the members of the caucus and towards the Leader of the United Party, I want to tell you that the action of the hon. member for Yeoville is probably more disloyal than the action of the hon. member for Randburg, for the hon. member for Randburg actually committed a private sin, whereas the hon. member for Yeoville committed a public sin; he committed a far graver sin. I now want to put this question to this group of frightened men in the Old Guard: Why did you not kick out the hon. member for Yeoville, for it is obvious that you have more reason to kick him out than you have to kick out the hon. member for Randburg?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I substitute the word by &#x201C;politically slightly hesitant&#x201D;. The Old Guard of the United Party decided to bully the little ones, but they were afraid of the hon. member for Yeoville. Sir, if one compares the reaction to this opinion poll of the hon. member for Yeoville with that of the hon. member for Hillbrow, it is interesting, for the hon. member for Hillbrow immediately issued a statement which conflicted with that of his leader in the Transvaal; he said that this opinion poll was &#x201C;divisive mumbo-jumbo&#x201D;; he rejected it altogether. But one expects this from a man who is loyal to Sir De Villiers Graaff, the Leader of the United Party. He issued this statement without the permission of his leader in the Transvaal and, in all probability, without his knowledge. This means that the hon. member for Hillbrow preferred to stand by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and not by his leader in the Transvaal. Sir, a very clear split has arisen between the hon. member for Hillbrow and the hon. member for Yeoville. Perhaps the hon. member for Hillbrow will now feel more at liberty to furnish us with a reply to this question: &#x201C;Do you hate the hon. member for Yeoville?&#x201D; Sir, the question is what is going to happen to the United Party now? The hon. member for Randburg says that he is going to remain in the United Party. I now want to put this question to the hon. member for Yeoville, for he has the power to do so: Is he going to take disciplinary action against the hon. member for Randburg in order to kick him out of the United Party, or is he going to take him under his wing in the Transvaal where he is no longer able to protect the hon. member for Randburg within the Parliamentary caucus of the United Party? I come next to the hon. member for Sandton: This hon. member once adopted a very bold attitude when Mr. George Oliver said certain things which he did not like; he then said that he personally was going to initiate steps in the Transvaal to kick out Mr. George Oliver, and he issued a statement to that effect to the newspapers. He can now tell us whether he is going to be as rash towards the hon. member for Randburg so as to get him kicked out of the Transvaal United Party. Sir, let us consider what the position is today. The United Party leader in the Transvaal, Mr. Harry Schwarz, knows that every political leader, to be able to act, needs a power structure. The power structure of the hon. member for Yeoville consists of his Young Turks as they are sitting in that caucus; that is his power structure. This resolution of the United Party caucus means that his power structure has been weakened. Sir, the resolution of yesterday inflicted a grievous political injury on him. He is becoming a political invalid. The hon. member for Randburg was his right-hand. I understand that he also wrote out the cheques with his right hand. But his left hand is the hon. member for Bryanston and his left foot is the hon. member for Sandton. But now his right hand has been removed. Sir, the power structure of the hon. member for Yeoville has shrunk. The hon. member for Yeoville is now without a right hand. He knows as well as all of us do that steps are being <span class="col_185-186" refersTo="page_0108"/>taken and that the aim of the United Party caucus and the Old Guard is to amputate his right hand, to amputate his left foot and also his right foot and to make of him a political invalid, and once they have done all these things, they will throw him out, for as long as he has a power structure of any kind they will not be able to take action against him. The hon. member must realize that if he wants to play a political role in South Africa, he must get out of the United Party before he is politically maimed to such an extent that he can no longer be of any political significance whatsoever.</p>

<p>And while we are looking at this position in the United Party, Sir, how grateful cannot we and South Africa be that we belong to the National Party of which we can be proud. In this Party we have a party which is going from strength to strength; a party which does not suppress, but develops; a party which does not suppress, but liberates its people; a party which, under the leadership of the hon. the Prime Minister, is progressing step by step, which is progressing successfully to enable South Africa to take up its place in the comity of nations. It is at this time that we should like to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that we urgently require his leadership and that we are proud to be able to be members of a party such as this one and to be able to sit together in a caucus with a leader such as the one we have.</p>

<p>I think it is quite incredible that at the start of this parliamentary session, when the whole of Southern Africa is at a crucial point, the official Opposition should have time for all this nonsense and the witch hunts that are going on. No wonder that the Nationalists are laughing all the way to the polls. [Interjections.] There can be one of three reasons only for this peculiar behaviour on the part of the official Opposition. The first reason is that the United Party cannot get its priorities right. That is the first possible reason. The second possible reason is that this is just another manifestation of the inherent death wish which I for a long time have said the United Party is harbouring, and the third reason is just poor leadership. For one of these reasons, or perhaps for all three of these reasons, they are in this position, but whatever the reason is, it is a complete bore and it is high time that the official Opposition got on with the job of opposing the Government. [Interjections.] Throughout this debate the hon. the Prime Minister has sat in his bench with what I can best describe as a self-satisfied smile on his face &#x2026; [Interjections] listening to all the accolades being heaped on his head. Before he gets too pleased with himself I want to remind him of one or two home truths.</p>

<p>The first is that I should like to remind him that 10 years ago, almost to the day, in the no-confidence debate of 1965, I warned the Government that it should not attempt to bolster up the Smith Government because this would not be for the good of Rhodesia in the long run, and that the problems that Rhodesia had to settle, that is the co-existence of a small White minority with a large Black majority and the maintenance of decent and rising standards of living for everybody, would not be settled by bolstering up that Government. Now, 10 years later, when the strategic position has changed immensely, the hon. the Prime Minister has just managed to draw South Africa back from what could easily have become a Vietnam situation in Southern Africa. The whole process of negotiation is much more difficult than it would have been if the Prime Minister, when he took over nine years ago, had immediately set in train some attempt at negotiation by Mr. Smith with the Black leaders.</p>

<p>What does the hon. gentleman think is happening in Africa today because of the inability of White minorities to settle their quarrels by negotiation with Black majorities? There is something else of which I should like to remind the hon. the Prime Minister. If he had been spending the last eight or nine years dismantling the clumsy structure of apartheid in South Africa it would not have required a last-minute veto by the three major powers, the United Kingdom, the United States and France, to save South Africa at the United Nations at the end of last year. I do not think that we ought in South Africa to be confusing brinkmanship with statesmanship, and it seems to me that that is what we are in danger of doing. I was in the United States very shortly after the hon. the Prime Minister had made his now famous &#x201C;give us six months&#x201D; speech, and I want to tell him that he has aroused great expectations overseas. Everywhere I went in the States&#x2014;and I was travelling from coast to coast meeting people&#x2014;everybody wanted to know what the Prime Minister meant with this speech. I wish I could have told them. Unfortunately I did not know. I said that we would have to wait and see because nobody knew, as the hon. the Prime Minister had not told us. I want to tell him, Sir, as one golfer to another, although his golf is infinitely superior to mine, that having started his backswing he had better see to it that he follows through because having aroused all these expectations, people overseas are now expecting something to emanate from this situation. And, of course, the expectations that have been aroused overseas are doubled and quadrupled here at home. I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that nobody construed his speech to mean anything less than radical changes in race policy inside South Africa, and I might say that Mr. Pik Botha&#x2019;s speech at the United Nations confirmed that impression. Nobody thought in terms of the Government&#x2019;s relationship with Black Africa. They were thinking in terms of the Government&#x2019;s relationship with Black South Africans. That is what they were thinking about.</p>

I do not confuse that and I will never confuse that. I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that nobody was thinking in terms of the pinpricks that everybody says he or she is willing to see removed in South Africa. Nobody was thinking in terms of petty apartheid or even of the Nico Malan Theatre, although that is of some significance. They thought of the whole grim collection of laws to segregate people compulsorily, economically, politically, socially and educationally. Those were the laws they were thinking of. No one was thinking in terms of separate development and the possible emergence of a single little independent Bantustan. They thought in terms of the realities of South Africa, of its highly integrated economy, of the fact that more than half the Black population live outside the homelands, in South Africa, and they thought about our highly sophisticated Coloured and Indian population. I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister that when people thought of a changed South Africa they were thinking not only of change as far as race discrimination was concerned. They were also extremely interested in the whole question of civil rights. Let me tell that loyal South African who is biting his finger-nails at the moment, the hon. member for Algoa, that not even he would have got to first base overseas if he had tried to explain away the holding in solitary confinement of 40 people for over four months. Not even he could explain away the abrogation of <i>habeas corpus</i> and, as I say, detention without trial for long periods. The whole question of civil rights in South Africa is a disaster area overseas. It is impossible to explain&#x2014;I certainly do not attempt it&#x2014;why a country, <span class="col_189-190" refersTo="page_0110"/>a modern developed country like South Africa with its great achievements in science, in the business world, in the world of art and in the sports world, should so incongruously be adopting the tactics of some miserable little Republic. It is quite incomprehensible abroad; people just do not understand it. The sharp image of South Africa as a modern developed country becomes a blurred picture of a frightened insecure little country ruled by a small minority of White people who are only able to maintain their position, their security and their existence by drastic measures to suppress free speech and free association.</p>

<p>When that hon. member goes overseas and mixes freely with people he will find that there are far more people of my circle than there are of his circle, millions more. Overseas he is in a tiny minority and it is only in South Africa among a small minority of White people supporting the Government that he is in the majority. As I have said, the expectations which the hon. the Prime Minister aroused overseas and here, I might add, include a return to the normal rule of law in South Africa. It is widely accepted in all the Western countries that the suppression of civil rights is justifiable only in times of national emergency and that measures which suspends civil liberties should be adopted only with the utmost reluctance, with the utmost circumspection and should only be employed with the utmost use of safeguards. I take Britain as an example.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the nicest interjection. I am just coming to that point. In Britain, where there is a state of national emergency, where there is street warfare, where there is open terrorism and where well over 1 000 people have been killed and well over 10 000 have been injured, the recent law that was put on the British Statute Book was drawn up with the utmost circumspection, because the maintenance of the rule of law is held in such high respect. The British Government has passed the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, and the detention of anyone without trial cannot go on longer than seven days and then only with the permission of the Home Secretary. South African Terrorism Act&#x2014;need I still point it out?&#x2014;provides for indefinite solitary confinement and detention. The British measure is effective for only six months, after which it can be renewed by the Home Secretary only after the British Parliament has agreed to it. Our law is a permanent part of our legislation. It is permanently on our Statute Book. In Britain, unlike South Africa, there is no suggestion of solitary confinement, of non-access by persons other than officers of the State. There is no embargo on information such as the embargo I encountered yesterday when I attempted to get some information from the hon. the Minister of Justice. Detainees have access to lawyers and are entitled to know their rights. There is no question of the power of the courts being excluded to supervise the manner in which the law is implemented. This is really the great function of the law courts, viz. to watch-dog the implementation of the law.</p>

<p>There is no question of the death penalty, there are no minimum sentences prescribed and there is no retrospective clause. Most important of all, there is a very narrow definition of terrorism in the British Act. If hon. members think they have an easy reply by saying &#x201C;Well, that is why there is terrorism in England&#x201D;, let me inform them that the people who commit terrorist acts are dedicated fanatics who are prepared to die for their cause. This sort of deterrent, i.e. the death penalty and indefinite detention, does not have any effect on them. As I say, it is the deep respect for the rule of law that the British people have which has resulted in so circumspect a law being on the Statute Book in order to attempt to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>I want to mention two other instances which I think the Government must consider in view of the serious repercussions abroad as a result of the kind of action taken at home. The hon. member for Green Point yesterday referred to the question of visas and passports. I shall not go into that in any detail now except to ask the hon. the Minister of the Interior&#x2014;if I may have his attention for a moment&#x2014;if he thinks we did ourselves any good by the summary treatment we handed out to Senator Diggs at Jan Smuts Airport the other day by not even allowing him to leave the airport building. Does the Minister <span class="col_191-192" refersTo="page_0111"/>really think that that kind of thing wins us friends in America? Does it not rather consolidate the support of the Republicans who otherwise would not support Senator Diggs?</p>

<p>I want to ask, too, whether the hon. the Minister of Justice thinks that he did South Africa any good by treating the editor of one of the leading English language newspapers in the ham-handed way he did over the publication of a report concerning a banned pro-Frelimo Rally in September of last year. The hon. the Minister, who acted on a report in the wrong newspaper, ordered the summary arrest of the editor who was dragged out of a social function in Durban where he was to deliver a speech, carted down to the police station, finger-printed, held for several hours and finally released on R50 bail. When he and the senior assistant editor of the newspaper were eventually charged under the Riotous Assemblies Act, the editor who had been so summarily treated was found not guilty and discharged, while the assistant editor was cautioned and discharged. The Argus company, to which the newspaper belonged, was fined, I think, the princely sum of R10. I would say this is an indication that the court regarded the whole matter as an absurdity, but nevertheless what did happen was that this case naturally received banner headlines overseas. It was a crude attempt to intimidate the Press, and I am glad to say that it was an attempt that is not going to succeed.</p>

<p>I want to turn now to another instance of what I consider to be ministerial ham-handedness. It is perhaps not fair to lay all the blame for this at the feet of the hon. the Minister of Justice. I have no doubt that this was a Cabinet decision and I shall return to that in a moment. I am referring now to the pathetic case of Bram Fischer. When I used the word &#x201C;pathetic&#x201D; I do not mean the man; I mean the Government&#x2019;s handling of this case. That has been absolutely pathetic. As we all know, section 71 of the Prisons Act lays down, <i>inter alia,</i> that every prisoner whose release is expedient on the grounds of physical condition may, on the recommendation of a medical officer, be released by the Minister either conditionally or on parole, as the Minister may direct. Of course, the State President may also release any man, even a man who is under life sentence. There is no mention in the law of the political beliefs of the prisoner; there is no mention in the law of the political crimes which he may or may not have committed and for which he may have been convicted. These are blanket provisions and they apply to all prisoners.</p>

<p>Having taken part in many appeals to the hon. the Minister in the past, I am very well aware that the Government has been adamant in its refusal to grant remission of sentence or amnesty of any kind to political prisoners. I am aware of this because I have failed on many occasions to get it, but surely in a case like Bram Fischer&#x2019;s the Government might have shown some flexibility. Here is a man who is known throughout the world largely because of the Government&#x2019;s actions in this regard. Here is a man who is dying of cancer and who is a terminal case. He has a few months to live at the most so I am told by his son-in-law who is a medical man who sees him almost every day. Here is a man who is barely able to totter a few yards down the corridor with the help of sticks and who is unable to get in or out of bed by himself, but the hon. the Minister gives as one of his specious reasons for refusing the Fischer family&#x2019;s plea that he be allowed to spend his last few months with them, that this man is a security risk. I ask you, how absurd can you be!</p>

<p>The other absurd reason the hon. the Minister gave was that this man had been awarded the Lenin Prize. So what? This was announced eight years ago and what possible bearing does it have on the attitude of the hon. the Minister to a dying man? The third specious reason that he gave was that Fischer, together with his &#x201C;comrades&#x201D;&#x2014;mark the emotive word that is always used&#x2014;in gaol had prepared a memorandum for the Commission of Inquiry into Penal Reform. What was the crime there? The only &#x201C;crime&#x201D; as far as I can see was that these men were preparing an open memo for submission to a Government commission. There was nothing secret about it. It was not a plot to blow up John Vorster Square! It is true that it was outside the terms of reference of the commission, but everybody has been rather confused about the somewhat ambiguous terms of reference of this commission. I would think that the hon. the Minister would study this memorandum very carefully because I can think of nobody who is in a better position to point out abuses in prison than an educated man who has spent ten years in gaol as Bram Fischer already has. This is one of the reasons which were given by the hon. the <span class="col_193-194" refersTo="page_0112"/>Minister for refusing the plea of clemency by the family of the man concerned. I want to say quite categorically that if ever there was a case where section 71 of the Prisons Act should be applied by the hon. the Minister of Justice it is in the case of Bram Fischer. There is no reason that I can see except heartlessness for the refusal of the hon. the Minister so to do.</p>

<p>There is of course another reason, and this is why I said that I did not want to put all the blame at the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s feet. I can just imagine what the real reason is, and anybody with a little imagination will be able to see it. I can imagine the whole Cabinet sitting there in solemn conclave to consider this case. I do not think that the hon. the Minister took this decision by himself. I think they all sat there in solemn conclave &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister might take full responsibility for it, but I do not think that the decision was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s alone. I think the Cabinet sat there and somebody asked: &#x201C;But what will Dr. Hertzog and the Herstigtes say?&#x201D; Somebody might even have asked: &#x201C;What will the official Opposition say&#x201D;?, and then said: &#x201C;They will all say that we are going soft on Communism.&#x201D; Then panic set in and any question of the release of this man was shelved. I ask the hon. the Minister to consider whether in fact the decision that has been taken is the right one. I ask him to reconsider this case and to show a little mercy and a little compassion so that he can bring South Africa more in line with the thinking which undoubtedly would have taken place in any other Western country that I know of. The sad thing about South Africa is, of course, that our threshold of tolerance is rising all the time. One sees it in the case of the detainees who were held for over four months and apart from one or two exceptions there was hardly a whimper of protest from anybody. Yet I remember that in 1971, when there were Police raids on a widespread scale and a large number of people were detained, there was an uproar. A great fuss was kicked up in South Africa. It seems to me that South Africa is indeed living up to those shrewd predictions Dr. Verwoerd made when he wrote this thesis. He talked about the blunting of the emotions. One only has to do something over and over again for the emotions to be blunted. That is what is happening and has been happening in South Africa over 26 years of Nationalist Party rule. South Africa&#x2019;s emotions have been blunted and the things we ought to be reacting to, we are not reacting to at all.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to re-emphasize that the whole overall image of South Africa has to change if we have any genuine desire to be re-admitted to the comity of the Western nations and if we want to put a halt to the growing hostility of our own people in South Africa. I want to support the third leg of the amendment which my hon. leader has moved, viz. that the Government must take steps to restore the civil liberties of South Africa and to find a way to govern this country so that it is not necessary to abrogate those civil rights, and that means a change in the whole racial pattern in South Africa. I want to remind this country, and the Government in particular, because that is where the power lies, that if demands are not met today, the demands that will be made tomorrow will be ever so much greater. That, I think, is something we all ought to think on very seriously.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Houghton will excuse me if I do not reply immediately to the points on which she attacked me, viz. the security position in general with reference to the position overseas and specifically in Britain. I may just say in passing that it is, after all, evident that what is happening in Britain, has never yet happened in South Africa on a similar scale. You will allow me, Mr. Speaker, to return to this at a later stage, and if I do not have the time at my disposal to do so, I shall debate the matter further during the discussion of my Vote.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the O&#x2019;Malley case. I shall try to react to that as well at a later stage. In case time does not allow me to return to it, I should like to say to her at this stage that she has obviously not done her homework in regard to the O&#x2019;Malley case. She is a lady who usually does her homework, but this time she did not do it, or she does not understand the court case at all. That is her problem.</p>

<p><span class="col_195-196" refersTo="page_0113"/>She also referred here to my handling of the unfortunate case of Mr. Bram Fischer. Let me inform you immediately that I understand, on the basis of the medical reports which reach me every day, that Mr. Fischer does have cancer. I want to say immediately that I, as one human being to another, am very sorry for the man. If I could apply humanitarian consideration purely and simply, as the hon. member for Houghton does, I should give very serious consideration to releasing him. But I am unfortunately the executive head of the Department of Prisons. There are many prisoners who are ill and who have wives and children. Those wives and children are often in a pitiable state because of the crimes those men committed. Now the question is whether I should release everyone on parole on purely humanitarian considerations and whether I should allow those who are ill to go immediately. Should I do this simply because the hon. member feels sympathy for a man who has become ill? I, too, feel sympathy for him.</p>

<p>It is not &#x201C;Oh, come on!&#x201D;. All the hon. member must do is listen.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton is not the only one who has asked me to release Mr. Fischer. I have received a series of letters and a series of telegrams. There are all sorts of pressure groups which are trying to persuade me to release him unconditionally. One of the most interesting of these is one which I received from the youth of East Germany. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The members of the Free German Youth Organization and the whole youth of the GDR &#x2026;</block>

<p>I presume that that means &#x201C;German Democratic Republic&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; emphatically support world-wide demand &#x2026;</block>

<p>They do not ask me; &#x201C;they demand&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; immediate release of dangerously ill South African Communist Party leader and Lenin Prize winner, Abram Fischer. We most strongly condemn the policy of apartheid and all forms of discrimination against the oppressed African people and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners.</block>

<p>It was the &#x201C;Central Council&#x201D; which sent this telegram to me. It is also very interesting to look at the address to which they sent this telegram. This address reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Minister of Justice, James Kruger, Room 516, H. F. Verwoerd Building, Pretoria, Republic of South Africa, Parliament Street, Cape Town.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, if I had not known that the hon. member for Houghton, although she is able to speak Afrikaans, has a total contempt for the language owing to the fact that she never uses it, I could even have suspected her of telling them: Send the man a telegram. I should like, however, to lay her odds of ten to one that the East German youth have completely forgotten about Mr. Bram Fischer. I am sure that they were incited from South Africa, and that they were told: Make sure that that telegram reaches that man. Send it to Parliament Street, 516, H. F. Verwoerd Building, Cape Town. These pressure groups are organized from here.</p>

<p>I also received a number of letters. These letters are in the form of a petition, but I should have preferred a petition because it would have been less conspicuous. I received these letters from various places, and they read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister of Justice: We the under-signed, citizens of the Republic of South Africa, do make earnest to you, Sir, to grant clemency and to release from prison Mr. Bram Fischer at <span class="col_197-198" refersTo="page_0114"/>presently gravely ill in the H. F. Verwoerd Hospital in Pretoria. At this time of impending and tremendous changes in Southern Africa and especially at this time of peace and goodwill, such an act of mercy could have consequences of great benefit to us all. May you be guided to make such a decision.</block>

<p>I received a string of letters, all worded in precisely the same way, which actually means that this is a petition. One would have appreciated a little more honesty; if they had said: &#x201C;The following people are signatories to a petition against the detention of Mr. Fischer&#x201D; for example, instead of trying such a stupid bluff and sending the things all over the place, asking people to sign them and post them to the Minister. It is interesting to take cognizance of the persons who signed these letters: <i>Inter alia</i> Mr. Graham McIntosh, M.P.&#x2014;he is so proud of his &#x201C;M.P.&#x2019;&#x2019;-ship that he appends it to everything&#x2014;and Mr. Lawrence Wood, M.P. Mr. Dennis Hurley is also among these. Senator Winchester as well. It is a wonder that we did not have all the Young Turks, and that they did not all sign these letters, despite the fact that the hon. member for Durban North conceded to me that I know more about this case than other people do. Apparently he could not get that through to his members either. Now I just want to tell you this: Sir, only the day before yesterday the daughter of Mr. Fischer wanted to come and see me, and just after that I heard that the other daughter had allegedly stated that if her sister were unable to succeed in the Cape, she would employ her own means of getting Fischer released. I want to ask the hon. member for Houghton now: Was she in contact with the Fischer daughters?</p>

You will remember what the Rivonia case brought to light. In one case Mr. Justice De Wet had the following to say about these men&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The crime of which the accused have been found guilty is essentially high treason. The State has seen fit not to charge them with high treason.

<p>The hon. member must not be so hasty. It is generally known that over the years, until recently, until just before his illness, this man alleged that <span class="col_199-200" refersTo="page_0115"/>there would be a radical change in South Africa and that he would yet become Prime Minister; that was his aspiration. He was still saying that until a few months ago, until just before his illness. All the time he was in prison he was trying to incite people to do certain things. He had a hand, as I said in the Press, in the drafting of a document, for the Prison Reform Commission, a document in which the total hatred of the man, not only of the prison system, but of the whole social system was expressed.</p>

<p>I shall read one or two of the paragraphs to you, in support of my statement. Here is one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Far from turning our thoughts away from politics and political actions which led to our imprisonment, this spiritual isolation &#x2026;</block>

<p>this is in prison now&#x2014; &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; convinces us of the rightness of the stand that we made.</block>

<p>This was the &#x201C;stand&#x201D; of &#x201C;high treason&#x201D;, Sir, to which the judge referred. And here we have another gem, in another paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As our time in prison has lengthened we have come to realize that the penal sub-system to which we are subjected reflects the general policy of the State. With that realization what was an intellectual opposition to the social policies of the State has hardened and has become a deep personal hatred of the regime which does these vicious things to us.</block>

<p>Sir, I want to tell you that this would almost have amused me if it had not been such a serious matter, that we find these words &#x201C;what was an intellectual opposition&#x201D;. If this is the sort of &#x201C;intellectual opposition&#x201D;, Sir, then I just want to tell you that we are dealing with psychopaths of the most serious grade here, people who do not realize what they tried to do and who have no feeling of guilt about it. But this is very typical, Sir, may I tell you, these attacks on the prisons, and I am not afraid of criticism of the prisons. We debate it every time. But I say that it is very typical because what did Bram Fischer himself write? Under the heading &#x201C;Immediate Tasks&#x201D; he declared (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We must throw everything into the struggle in the campaign against the South African penal system and in the campaign for decent treatment of political prisoners and their early release so that they can fulfil their essential roles in solving the problems in this country. It would be criminal negligence and dereliction of duty towards our leaders if we did not make use of the advantages of the good work which has already been done in this field.</block>

<p>And this is still being done, Sir, by people such as the hon. member for Houghton, who lends herself to this. Mention has been made of the fact that I said he is a Lenin prize-winner. Let me just tell you what a Lenin prize-winner is. There are only two kinds of prizes. There is a Lenin Prize for technological progress and there is a Lenin Prize for peace, and the word &#x201C;peace&#x201D; is used in the communistic context and this means, immediately, party political activities and subversive activities in Western countries. As far as I could discover&#x2014;and there may be others&#x2014;there are only six winners of the Lenin Peace Prize among the 240 million Russians and all those Chinese and in all the satellite countries, and this man, for whom representations are now being made, was one of them. The point which I made in this regard&#x2014;and this Dr. Wilson and the hon. member as well did not understand at all&#x2014;was the high value that they attached to the work of this man, the absolute fanatic with whom we are dealing here. I say that these are things which I must bear in mind when I give consideration to this case, and the principal thing which I must bear in mind, is the medical history. Let us consider the medical history.</p>

<p>Mr. Fischer was in prison and fell while he was going into the shower, and he injured his leg. Because we know that a great fuss is made of it, no matter how slightly he is injured in the prison, and that in his case he has many friends outside and also in Parliament who will immediately take up the cudgels for him, I gave instructions that in such cases he was to be taken immediately to an outside hospital and that reports were to be compiled and sworn statements taken of how the injury occurred. They took him to hospital and originally they thought that he had merely fractured his leg. Subsequently they realized that there might be cancer somewhere in his <span class="col_201-202" refersTo="page_0116"/>body. His condition deteriorated in hospital. It deteriorated to such an extent that, by the middle of December, he was almost unable to speak to people. He was completely finished. His son-in-law justifiably thought that his last days had come. The family came to see me. I dealt with them, to the best of my ability, in a friendly way. I said to them: &#x201C;My friends, it will depend on medical reports. I must wait to see what the position is, bearing in mind this man&#x2019;s background. I just want to tell hon. members what the position was when I arrived back from a holiday on 20 January, but before I come to that, I would just like to indicate under whose care this man was while he was very ill. His regular doctor is a specialist, Prof. T. Fichardt. He is assisted, in helping this man, by Dr. D. Marais, an orthopaedist, Prof. G. Falkson, cancer chemotherapist, Dr. Alfonso Rossouw, neurologist, Prof. C. R. Jansen, nuclear physician&#x2014;I might say that Prof. Jansen&#x2019;s name is world known for his work in the field of nuclear medicine&#x2014;Dr. W. J. Pepler, anatomical pathologist, Dr. Meiring, chemical pathologist. Prof. A. G. Sandison, head of the Radiotherapy Department, and Dr. L. F. Malherbe, internist. Nine specialists, the best in South Africa as far as cancer is concerned, have given their attention to this man. My department has done this at our expense.</p>

<p>If the hon. member would only keep quiet, I would tell her what I found upon my return. On 10 January the medical report was as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The patient was in succession this week by Dr. Dan Marais, Dr. Alfonso Rossouw, Prof. C. R. Jansen and Prof. A. G. Sandison, and although they are surprised and satisfied with the response of the local lesions to the telecobalt therapy, they are also concerned about increasing cancer cachexia, and they all think that the prognosis is extremely poor.</block>

<block name="quote">In summary, one can say that Bram&#x2019;s general condition has improved to such an extent, that he can be discharged from the hospital if he has somewhere to go to where he can receive good care under medical supervision.</block>

<p>In other words, Sir, on 10 January this man was reacting positively as a result of his hospitalization. On 14 and 15 January I then found the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">14th: Rested well, eating more enriched diets. Receiving physiotherapy and now walking with aid and sitting with assistance. He is fully <i>compos mentis.</i> However, finds difficulty to find the right word occasionally. Convalescent, making good progress. Results of a blood-test showed a distinct improvement in the red cell count from 75% to 88% of normality.</block>

<block name="quote">15th: He woke feeling nauseous due to too much enrichment of the food, the diet being enriched to build up physical strength. Ate a good breakfast of prunes, scrambled egg and mince. Physical aspects good. Mentally improving and can now hold an intelligent conversation.</block>

<p>Then, on the 20th, I received this summary (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At this juncture any other patient would now be discharged from the hospital to recuperate at home with his family until such time as his condition <span class="col_203-204" refersTo="page_0117"/>again deteriorates to such an extent that he cannot be cared for at home.</block>

<block name="quote">In summary, I can repeat that Bram Fischer has recuperated to such an extent with relation to the metastatic cancer of the brain and the hip that he can now be discharged from hospital, if he has a place to go to such as the home of his daughter and son-in-law, Dr. Tim Wilson, where he could be cared for under good medical supervision to the end of his days, which are now rapidly drawing to a close.</block>

<p>The diagnosis was that there was a source of cancer somewhere, but they could not find it. They then decided that he should receive treatment from an internist. This doctor said the following on 4 February, i.e. yesterday (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Further examinations will now have to be made, but the findings so far indicate a tumour of the pancreas. That would explain the symptoms of epigastric pain &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x201C;Epigastric pain&#x201D; is, in reality, simply a pain in the stomach&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; nausea and vomiting with backache.</block>

<p>A doctor tells me that the nausea could also be due to cobalt radiation. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The symptoms of a pancreas tumour can of course closely simulate those of a stomach ulcus. To me it seems as if we are locating the primary cancer in this case.</block>

<p>They are still looking for the primary cancer in this man; they were still doing so only yesterday. Now, I have been told, by people who know far more about it, that there are different kinds of cancer and that it is necessary to locate the cancer first, to diagnose the cancer, to determine whether it is going to be the cause of your death or whether you can recover. I have been told that there are many people who have had cancer and who are completely healthy today and will remain healthy until they die of old age in their beds.</p>

<p>We all weigh 100 lbs. when we come out of hospital. One recuperates afterwards and picks up weight. Yesterday, his daughter came to me and indicated that she wanted the man to come home. I now want to ask the hon. member why the man should go home. These ten doctors are looking for the cause of his illness, but she wants him to come home. When I asked her why she wanted the man to come home, she said that her sister and brother-in-law had to undertake a two-hour journey between Johannesburg and Pretoria to visit him, and that it was too tiring for them. However, they do not consider their father. She also complained that the man could not read all the books that he wanted to read. I then told her that I would speak to the General and if there were any books that he wanted to read, he could possibly get the books for him. That is no real problem. However, I bear the responsibility of restoring that man to health because he is a prisoner. If I were to allow that man to go home and he should die within a week, the hon. member will ask in my Vote why I let the man go home and say: &#x201C;You knew he was going to die; that is why you let him go&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Herein lies the dilemma: Should the man recover without a final diagnosis I know from the reports which I have that this man will carry on with anti-Afrikaans activities to the end. Should he remain ill, however, I can tell them that he belongs in a hospital and I then give him the best treatment which one person can give another, because I am sorry for him as a person. Can I do more for him than that? One would now expect that if the family comes to see me&#x2014;I receive them gladly and listen to them&#x2014;they would say to me: &#x201C;We have a favour to ask of you; we are now prepared to give the following undertaking on our part &#x2026;&#x201D; That is not the attitude of this family, however. The attitude of this family is. &#x201C;You are almighty; you can restrict the man as you like; you can clamp down on him just as you like.&#x201D; Then I said to them: &#x201C;But, my friends, I have him in custody. You want him released. Tell me on what conditions and I will then consider it. Let him make the conditions and then I can consider them&#x201D;.

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. I do not want to answer any questions now. If they were to come forward with constructive proposals now, one could consider them. But what is more, before I can consider anything, it is necessary, to my mind, that the doctor is able to tell me with certainty, or with a reasonable degree of certainty, where the cancer is, whether the cancer is still active and whether it is incurable. As far as that is concerned, I am completely and utterly in the hands of the doctors, and I am waiting for a report in which one of them tells me that although his life expectancy cannot be determined, there is no hope for him whatsoever. What do I find in the reports, however? They are looking here and they are looking there, and this is possible and that is possible. I do not know what the position is. After all, I am not a doctor myself. It is also necessary for me to indicate the place where this man will be detained. Unless the people can convince me to the contrary&#x2014;and I am open to conviction&#x2014;it is my personal feeling that he must not be kept in Johannesburg. There is a very simple reason for this. Mr. Wilson said to me, terribly sarcastically: &#x201C;You will say that all the &#x2018;goggas&#x2019; are in Johannesburg&#x201D;. I am not going to confirm this. I may have such suspicions, but I will not say anything like that. What I can in fact say, is that the headquarters of the Communist Party, of which Mr. Fischer was the leader, was in Rivonia in the Johannesburg area, and most of the people who were charged with him, were all people from that area. It is not possible for me to allow, even from the mere inspiration of his presence, a new communist movement to begin in South Africa after we had, with so much effort, grief and debating, crushed the previous communists.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the nature of the matter hon. members will understand if I do not follow up on the hon. Minister&#x2019;s arguments. This also applies to the statements by the hon. member for Pretoria Central. I say this simply because I believe that we cannot afford to waste time while, in this important period we are living in, South Africa is waiting for positive and energetic action and leadership.</p>

<p>In company with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other speakers on this side, I too want to express my personal appreciation for the initiative displayed by the hon. Prime Minister and the Government in recent months. In this regard I have in mind in particular the Prime Minister&#x2019;s diplomacy in Southern Africa, the speech by Mr. Pik Botha before the Security Council concerning the indefensibility of discrimination on grounds of race and colour, the Prime Minister&#x2019;s discussion with members of the various non-White groups, the changes with regard to admission to the Nico Malan Theatre and other signs of a new approach. In this connection there are two developments which I regard as particularly important. Firstly, the assurance the hon. the Prime Minister gave the members of the Coloured Persons Representative Council that favourable consideration would be given to the removal of those forms of discrimination that create unnecessary friction and that have nothing to do with the maintenance of group identity, if I have interpreted the hon. the Prime Minister correctly. As does every member of the Opposition, I heartily welcome this statement. I hope that in the course of my speech I shall be able to go into this matter further. However, it is very clear that if we are really in earnest about <span class="col_207-208" refersTo="page_0119"/>doing away with discrimination, it is essential for us to involve the non-White himself in order to ascertain what they regard as discrimination, and not you and I, Sir. The forms of discrimination which they in fact find unacceptable or indefensible, must be ascertained. The policy of colour discrimination and enforced racial separation followed by this Government and previous Governments up to now, was imported and applied without consultation with and without the agreement of the various non-White groups. I say &#x201C;without consultation and without agreement&#x201D; because <i>inter alia</i> all political power was concentrated in the hands of Whites. We as Whites, therefore, were able to impose and execute our ideologies and our conceptions of how society should be ordered because we regarded it as self-evident that we knew best what was in the interests of South Africa and all its people. It is clear that we can no longer continue to exercise the sole right to take decisions of this nature, with the monopoly on the decision-making processes where the interests of other groups are involved.</p>

Surely this is the essence of the matter.</p>

<p>In the light of the fact that this Government has repeatedly declared that it will not give the non-White groups any representation in this Parliament&#x2014;which is the sovereign legislative body in South Africa&#x2014;it is essential for other ways to be found. It is the task and the responsibility of this Government to find ways to involve non-White groups in the process whereby they ascertain what they regard as discrimination and how that discrimination affects them. Various ways have been suggested. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout suggested that a Select Committee be appointed to investigate the matter. Then there is the possibility that a representative commission of inquiry could be appointed. Members of the other groups could also be represented in such a commission.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make an earnest appeal to my hon. friend opposite to tell me in what other way we can involve those people in the ascertaining of this vital question if we do not want to allow them to come and sit here in the House and make their contribution here. We must do so in order to be able to carry out the promise made by the hon. the Prime Minister and the promise made by Mr. Botha before the Security Council of U.N. Whether this takes place by means of a Select Committee, a commission of inquiry or according to any other method, I just want to say that we do not have all the time in the world to do it. Within the next few months, not only in the interests of our relations with U.N. or in the interests of détente in Africa or in the interests of our relations with the outside world, but also in the interests of our internal relations, people must be given the message of hope that will show that we are in earnest in creating a different structure in South Africa.</p>

<p>The second development to which I want to refer, is the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement which he made last year in this House in which he said&#x2014;I could quote it, but let me rather leave it at that&#x2014;that while it is the policy to extend the powers of the Coloured Persons Representative Council to the maximum, there is a common ground, a wide area of common interest, which White and Coloured must consider and decide on jointly. That is what the hon. the Prime Minister said, if I understood and interpreted him correctly. In the light of this the hon. the Prime Minister announced that a joint Cabinet committee would be established and that the Coloureds would be given a say in other statutory bodies. I really do not believe that this arrangement will satisfy the political aspirations of the Coloured population, just as I am convinced that if the roles were switched, the Afrikaner would not have been satisfied with that kind of arrangement as the realisation and embodiment of his political aspirations. We would not have been satisfied with that, nor is it an adequate answer to the needs and aspirations of the Coloureds. What is important, is the acknowledgment implicit in that announcement, <span class="col_209-210" refersTo="page_0120"/>namely that there are common interests and a common destiny and also, arising out of that, that the existing separate machinery&#x2014;the Coloured Council on the one hand and the White Parliament on the other&#x2014;cannot effectively look after the interests of the Coloured group in that common area. The separate machinery is unable to deal with this and for that reason, joint machinery must be created. This is an acknowledgment and I am therefore grateful for the lead taken by the hon. the Prime Minister. His announcement is an admission that the interests of Coloureds and Whites may only be divisible at a certain level and that in many spheres our interests are interwoven and indivisible. It is a recognition that the policy of apartheid, of division, cannot serve as the final and comprehensive answer to our relations problems. There are some of us who have been trying for many years to bring home this simple fact to our people, often in the face om much vilification. I am grateful for these signs of realism, even though we are only standing on the threshold thereof. This means, too, that the road of parallelism, as a reply to this problem, is dead because along that road provision is not made for the common ground of interests concerning which we must deliberate jointly. What I am saying here about the Coloureds naturally applies to the Indian community too. What I want to convey thereby is that we shall have to seek different answers to those we have had thus far in this matter. To put it differently, where indivisible and indistinguishable interests are concerned, we shall have to find some arrangement according to which there will be a joint say for all the groups sharing in those communal interests. I personally believe that the federal policy is the only one capable of doing so. If we continue as we are doing now, we are simply maintaining a situation of supremacy, rationalize as we may. Please, let us have no illusions on that score.</p>

<p>I want to come back to some of the concepts which are often used, have been used in this debate too and will probably still be used in the future. I do so in an effort on my part to make constructive contribution to this debate on the abolition of discrimination. It seems to me that in considering the pattern of race relations, the pattern that has developed over the past 26 or 27 years in South Africa in particular, we can distinguish three elements. Firstly there is the concept &#x201C;differentiation&#x201D;. Then there is &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; which I shall come back to. In the first instance there is differentiation. To me this embraces merely the acknowledgment, as such, of the existence of a specific group or category of persons with its own distinct interests and identity. That is what differentiation is, namely the acknowledgment of distinct groups and their own identities. If there is differentiation or a distinction drawn between such groups or categories, then the aim of that differentiation is to serve the specific interests of that specific group without the interest of any other group being detrimentally affected or threatened thereby or without any rights or privileges of that specific group being detrimentally affected. I should like to mention a few examples in this connection.</p>

<p>Hon. members are aware that we in South Africa have recognized to Bantu law as a legal system for the Bantu. That is a differentiating measure. It acknowledges the fact that the Bantu are there and that they have their own legal system. We did not simply make the Roman-Dutch legal system of the Whites applicable to the Bantu because that would have been a form of cultural domination. We acknowledged that they are there and that they have their own legal system and we granted recognition to that legal system. That is a differentiating measure. We did not prejudice the Bantu thereby, nor did we prejudice or detrimentally affect the Whites. Our recognition of the separate language and cultural rights of Afrikaans and English-speaking people in South Africa is also a differentiating measure. It is a recognition that various groups exist and that cultural and other interests of those groups must be recognized. No one is harmed thereby. It is simply the acknowledgment and acceptance of the interests of those groups. So I could continue. There is also the fact that we recognize polygamy among the Bantu. Take the question of the setting aside of land for the Bantu. In spite of the interpretation given to this by the hon. member for Vereeniging and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, the setting aside of land for the Bantu was from the earliest times a differentiating measure with the aim of recognizing the facts. The Bantu community was there and the Whites came across this position. All the Whites said, was: We uphold your right to possess your land. No one was prejudiced thereby, because that land was not possessed by individuals; it was land belonging to the Bantu <span class="col_211-212" refersTo="page_0121"/>nations as units. We recognized that. We did not tell the Bantu: You may not obtain the Western right of ownership of land elsewhere. That was not the intention, not if we are speaking of differentiation. I need not go into the matter any further. I can only say that there is nothing to be said against this form of differentiation because it does not benefit one group or person more than another group or person nor does it put one group or person in a position inferior to any other. The aim remains consistent&#x2014;to act solely in the interests of a specific group.</p>

<p>In contrast we get, in the second place, the concept of discrimination. In essence, discrimination means&#x2014;and I am trying to state this as accurately as possible in order to try and assist the progress of debate in this regard&#x2014;that a situation is created in which one group or person is benefited more than another group or person, or where a specific group or person or their interests are subordinated to another group or person or their interests, where one group or person possesses rights and privileges which are denied another group or person, or that obligations or restrictions are placed on one group or person which are not also placed on other groups or persons. That is discrimination. That is prejudicing as against benefiting, the granting of rights and the denial of rights the imposition of obligations as against the absence of such obligations. If, then, we talk about colour or race discrimination, then it means that colour or race is the factor employed to discriminate against or in favour of groups or persons in the way in which I have indicated here.</p>

<p>It is very clear that in South Africa, in our Statute Book and in practice, there are hundreds of cases of discrimination of this nature. I need not mention them. I have already indicated that our political structure is a discriminatory structure because the other race groups are not represented here in Parliament, the highest authority, the legislative authority. That is discrimination. We can say that it is essential or desirable; we can say that it can be explained historically, but it is discrimination. I can mention other examples of discrimination: The colour bar legislation, in accordance with which certain people are unable to obtain certificates of competence; job reservation; the arrangement that where White and Coloured trade unions are separate, the management of the White trade union has the right to negotiate and also to bind the other; the Nursing Association where the same situation applies, where only the White Nursing Association can negotiate and has the right to bind the other, too: the salaries that are still being paid to lecturers at non-White universities where Black lecturers are paid less than others; the pensions payable to the various population groups; the Prohibition of Interdicts Act; taxes that have to be paid by the Bantu, and all the other restrictions. There can surely be no doubt about the fact that these measures discriminate because they benefit certain people as against others, and all I want to plead is this: If we are in earnest when we say that we want to do away with discrimination, let us then make an immediate start with these measures; after all, this is not in dispute; no reasonable, rational person could doubt that we have here forms of colour and racial discrimination. It is not differentiation; it is purely and solely discrimination and no reasonable person can doubt it. If we are in earnest about doing away with discrimination based on race or colour, then we must start with these things. I take it that it is these things that our ambassador at U.N.O. had in mind when he spoke about discrimination. It is pointless for us to try to get away from these things by coming along with the glib story that it is not discrimination but differentiation.</p>

<p>Sir, these things constitute discrimination and this is surely clear to every one of us. I want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Green Point said, namely that many of these things can be changed immediately. We need not wait for a commission of inquiry.</p>

<p>Sir, the third factor I want to mention in this regard which, in my opinion, has not yet been properly considered here and which, to me, is actually more important than the other two, is the principle of apartheid&#x2014;apartheid not as recognition of the existence of diverse groups, but the enforced separation of people on the grounds of race and colour. A far greater area of our society than is taken up by discrimination and differentiation is regulated by the principle of enforced separation between person and person and group and group on the grounds of race and colour. As far as I am able to judge this has been a cornerstone of the Government&#x2019;s policy thus far, although fortunately, in recent times there have been signs that in certain cases the Government is <span class="col_213-214" refersTo="page_0122"/>anxious to move away from this as for example in the field of sport, and now, in the Nico Malan Theatre too, etc. It is generally known that it was the policy of this Government under the late Dr. Verwoerd to effect separation in South Africa on the grounds of race and colour in every possible sphere and to the greatest extent practicable. This has been said time and again and is really not in dispute. Sir, examples of these things are legion, for example group areas, separate universities, separate trade unions, the nursing profession and academic associations. It was not even permissible for an academic association to be mixed, and hon. members know that as well as I. There are all the forms of petty apartheid that have been mentioned so often over the floor of this House, such as buses, taxis, beaches, theatres toilets, restaurants, hotels, seats, entrances. These are all examples of enforced separation between person and person on the grounds of race and colour. Our whole country is full of it. Our daily life is full of it. There is the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, the Immorality Act, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, sport. Just name it. More specifically, it is the principle we have laid down in legislation over the past 26 years and have applied time and again in practice.</p>

<p>This enforced separation is aggravated still further when it is accompanied by real discrimination. For example, as I have already mentioned, there is the case of the separate universities. This is not just enforced separation, but within the separate universities we still discriminate, too, on the basis of race and colour. In our Reservation of Separate Amenities Act it states in the Act that nothing done under the Act will be declared invalid merely on the grounds that those facilities are not equal. Sir, there is no doubt that this enforced separation on grounds of race and colour with all its implications and consequences, together with the policy of discrimination, must carry the primary blame for the bitterness and the dissatisfaction to be met with among large numbers of the various non-White groups and for the hostility towards South Africa on the part of other Black States in Africa and the outside world in general. Surely it is clear that when a person is prohibited on the grounds of his race or colour from having access to or use of places and amenities to which other people with a different colour of skin do have access, or&#x2014;and again I am choosing my words with care&#x2014;when anyone, on the basis of his race or colour, is restricted from associating freely with a person of another colour or race group, it necessarily results in such a person and the colour or race group to which he belongs feeling stigmatized and in fact being stigmatized, and his human dignity is in fact being injured by this measure. The tragic situation that our hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs cannot even take any of the persons he took with him to U.N.O. to a restaurant here in Cape Town to have a cup of tea together, is proof of that. [Interjections.] That is the truth. It is these things that fundamentally hurt human dignity. [Interjections.] I want to say at once that I realize that many of these practices did not only arise today; but I do want to say that the only basis on which such enforced apartheid and separation may be acceptable, is when the decision in this regard are taken jointly by all the groups concerned. In other words, it is only when White and non-White decide together that a specific form of separation or apartheid is desirable and when, in addition, they also have an equal say in the execution and the application of that decision, only then can the element of stigma and of injuring of human dignity possibly disappear. But as long as it is the White person who decides on these matters alone and in addition arrogates to himself the sole right to execute and apply a decision of this kind, he should not expect to obtain the approval and the co-operation of the people who belong to other colour groups and who are affected by those measures.</p>

<p>Sir, in this regard it is said that these separating measures are only a consequence of the multinational nature of our society and that through them recognition is granted to the specific group identity of each specific group or people. Even though that were so, I want to repeat that we cannot expect the other peoples or groups to be content with measures of this nature if they have not had a joint say in the decision-making process and the process of execution. I want to add at once that in the execution of these measures it is not true, either, to say that this constitutes execution of the concept of national diversity, because the distinction we draw in the case of these measures is between White and non-White. We do not have separate entrances for Indians, Coloureds, Xhosas, Tswanas, Zulus or whatever. It is not correct to say that these measures merely constitute <span class="col_215-216" refersTo="page_0123"/>execution of the concept of national diversity. In addition I also want to say that these measures have nothing to do with the maintenance of group identity. The identity of the White person is not endangered when he enters the same bus as a non-White. His identity is not endangered when he passes through the same gate. His identity is not endangered if he has to stand in the same queue. The attempt to explain and justify these measures on the basis of the maintenance of one&#x2019;s own identity simply does not work. It has no validity whatsoever. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to refer in passing to a few ideas raised by the hon. member. I begin with that big word which he used, viz. &#x201C;stigmatized&#x201D;. Because there are certain laws which apply to non-Whites and to Whites, he says that the Black people, the non-Whites, are stigmatized by them. He referred to such Acts as, <i>inter alia,</i> the Immorality Act. Let me put a simple question to him. This law can be contravened by a White or a Bantu. The hon. member says that we stigmatize the Bantu by it. Why? Why is it always said that it is aimed at those people? If that law is contravened by a White and a Bantu, is the White not charged as well, or does the hon. member not understand this? So does this constitute discrimination against a Bantu only?</p>

Is that correct? I am asking the hon. member for Bezuidenhout whether that is correct? I address my question also to the hon. member who has just spoken of mandatory racial segregation and mandatory residential areas.

<p>Mr. Speaker, you must forgive me if I do not want to argue further about this kind of thing. Yesterday a striking speech was made by the hon. member for Pretoria Central, in which he pointed out the rifts in the United Party. I am not going to do likewise and waste my time on the death of an opponent. After all, it is a macabre way of passing one&#x2019;s time to keep dancing on the corpse of a man who is already dead. I do not intend dancing on the skeleton of a party which deserved to die long ago in any event. The United Party does not need a Pegasus poll or a diagnosis; it only needs someone to conduct a post-mortem. That party, which is dead already, died as a result of its lack of policy, as a result of strife in its ranks, as a result of concessions to its left wing every now and again in order to satisfy everyone, as a result of that spirit in which it says one thing to the Black man and another thing to the White man and one thing in the rural areas and another thing in the urban areas. That is what killed it, and it is not necessary to mourn the passing away of a party which has already played its role. I believe that some people in the United Party will still be able to play a role, and I hope that what happened last night, is the beginning of a process which should have begun long ago, viz. to purge that party of a group of people who do the sort of things that are now going to be continued by a new party.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am worried about South Africa and the Opposition is also a part of South Africa. I am worried about the interests of South Africa and when the Opposition has become to decrepit, it is to the disadvantage of South Africa. The hon. member for Durban Point can laugh about it, but I do not think it is necessary to laugh. I have said in public what I want to say this afternoon here in this House: <span class="col_217-218" refersTo="page_0124"/>This party has died from the lack of policy, but the policy of that other party on the Opposition benches will mean the death not only of a party, but of South Africa, of Whites and Christians in South Africa. It is time that the conservatives in the United Party wake up to that idea and realize where the enemy lies. I say that the policy of that party, the Progressive Party, is the death of South Africa and I am going to try and explain that. I want to put a simple question to those members who tell me I am talking rubbish: Who of them will stand up to look Whites and non-Whites squarely in the eyes and tell us what the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs was unable to elicit yesterday from the leader and the back-stage leaders of that party? Do you believe in an unqualified franchise for the Black people of South Africa together with the Whites in one Parliament, yes or no? And whether it is the corner-stone or grave-stone, just say it. The silence which reigns over there and the embarrassed laughter is an admission that where they are going is either the complete domination or the destruction of White civilization here and the elimination of the Whites in South Africa. There is no getting away from that. None of the investigations of that Afrikaner who represents that party, will be able to change this in any way. Write Finis on to White civilization and carry on with your investigation, whether it be a Pegasus poll or whatever.</p>

<p>I would prefer to deal with the party to whose hands the future of South Africa has been entrusted. I want to avail myself of the opportunity this afternoon to say a few things which I think we on both sides of the House, and not only inside this Chamber, but also outside, must take into consideration. I want to say it, by way of summary, with reference to those inspired words which the hon. the Prime Minister has used and put into practice repeatedly, viz. that the policy of the Nationalist Party is to grant to others what we demand for ourselves. I think there is one thing which we must understand clearly, which we must say honestly to all non-Whites in this country, and which we must always keep saying honestly, as Whites, to our own people and to the world outside under any circumstances which might arise, viz. that that sentence also contains the words &#x201C;what I demand for myself&#x201D;. What do I demand for myself? What does the White man in this country demand for himself and what has this Government promised to try to guarantee for the country? What we demand for ourselves, we did not get through theft. Nor did we get it in any other way than the legal way which has existed throughout the centuries. The territory and material goods which we have acquired, even if sometimes by means of war, was acquired by the labour of the Whites, whether of French, English or Dutch descent. What we demand is nothing new. We are not going to demand land from any other country, Botswana or Lesotho. We demand only that we have acquired for ourselves over the years. We demand that the heritage of our fathers must remain the heritage of our children. To that the National Party has committed itself. However, we demand more than just material goods. What we as party promise to our people is their due. The cultural goods which we have inherited, the Christian civilization which was given us, must also be retained for our progeny and for other people with whom we coexist. For this reason the National Party has said&#x2014;and the hon. the Prime Minister repeated in this House what he said in the Other Place&#x2014;that we shall give to others what we demand for ourselves. But under no circumstances will we give ourselves. He said this at the leaders&#x2019; conference as well. We are not prepared to share this Parliament with others, not now and not in the distant future either. This is how the Prime Minister put it (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;As far as we are concerned, we grant our own Black peoples development in political, economic and in all other spheres, and it is clear that this policy is being implemented in ever greater earnest. I make no apology for returning back to the position of the Whites in particular. The Whites have been established here for centuries. They have the right to demand for themselves the maintenance of their identity, while at the same time they also grant this to all other peoples.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Let it also be clearly understood that the National Party and the conservative people in that party on the opposite side have the same task. They can play their part, as the hon. member for Turffontein did when he made that bitter choice and is now going to a valued colleague and play a great role in the development of what we promised to give to our people.</p>

<p>I want to come to the second aspect and members of the Opposition will perhaps be a little less noisy now. What do <span class="col_219-220" refersTo="page_0125"/>we mean with this concept &#x201C;Grant to others &#x2026;&#x201D;? Perhaps I should then speak in all earnest even to my own people, but also to other people who have promised much and given little. These words &#x201C;Grant to others &#x2026;&#x201D; are not a question of a passive action and cannot apply, as a passive attitude, to the National Party that must carry out its task in the turbulence of the year 1975. &#x201C;Grant to others &#x2026;&#x201D; does not mean that we sit back and simply let others acquire for themselves those things which they are capable of acquiring. We pride ourselves on being a Christian people, and I believe we have the right to be thankful for that. I must add to this, whether or not it sounds like a sermon, that one can read somewhere in the Bible that if you say to a man who comes to you naked and hungry: &#x201C;Depart in peace, be ye warned and filled&#x201D;, and you do not give him clothes and you do not give him food, then you have not come close to the Gospel. This is what the National Party is putting into practise in these days of challenge, viz. to help others to acquire what we have acquired for ourselves.</p>

<p>What happens to the urban Bantu?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am still coming to the urban Bantu. The former hon. Minister of Finance said in his moving farewell message to all of us&#x2014;to me and to other hon. members&#x2014;that a golden future is awaiting South Africa provided only we carry on confidently, and provided we work. Those were the words which the hon. the Minister used. We must abandon the petty disputes in our own parties and elsewhere of which the English proverb says: &#x201C;You cannot see the wood for the trees,&#x201D; and the squabbling about who said what, and on what date and in which year. There is work ahead for us to do. I believe that the National Party is great and strong enough also to admit that we can make mistakes in the execution of our task, but it is also true that the only person who does not make a mistake is that person who does nothing. It is easy to stand on the sidelines and criticize, but I am not going to confine myself to replying to someone who keeps interjecting with that hackneyed old phrase: &#x201C;What about the Coloureds and what about the Indians?&#x201D; I am going to confine myself to my own department and say what we envisage for the coming year and what we shall do in the implementation of our policy with respect to the Black peoples.</p>

<p>In the first place I should like to state it as our ultimate goal that we are going to work towards the establishment of self-sufficient, viable homelands for the various Bantu peoples, where they can live as peoples in their own right, can work and develop their areas, whether it happens now, or in ten, 20 or in 30 years&#x2019; time. That is a milestone for the achievement of which we can all co-operate. We can work to give them constitutional rights and to give them land tenure as is now being done by the other division of our department to ensure consolidation is disposed of. We can work by encouraging people to bring capital to those countries. We can also work to inspire the homeland leaders and we, both the Opposition and this side of the House, can collaborate by eliminating suspicion-mongering and by not using other people as pawns when we conduct a debate across the floor of this House. The name of the chief member of the executive council of KwaZulu, that of Chief Minister Buthelezi, has been mentioned repeatedly in this House.</p>

<p>Today I want to say with hesitation, but in all earnest and with the utmost responsibility, that for a long time in this House the argument has been advanced that Chief Minister Buthelezi rejected the homeland idea completely and that the National Party should consequently throw in the towel. I just want to say that the National Party will not do so. By quoting from an official document. I want to point out a strange aspect of the same case. I do not want to make confidential conversations public, but I want to refer to the official statement issued by the office of the Prime Minister. The moment it suits them, some homeland leaders can say one thing, while on another occasion, when they are with their friends, they sing a different tune by saying something else. Under the heading &#x201C;Foreign investment in the homelands&#x201D; in the statement issued by the office of the Prime Minister, I want to quote the following:</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. Chief Buthelezi raised the question of concessions on the part of the Government to homelands to negotiate directly with other parties on vestments.</block>

<p><span class="col_221-222" refersTo="page_0126"/>At that stage the &#x201C;homelands&#x201D; idea, the idea of a homeland which has the right to negotiate directly and on its own behalf, suited Mr. Buthelezi. As far as other measures too were concerned, Mr. Buthelezi came to the same deliberations to talk to the hon. the Prime Minister and to the Republic&#x2019;s Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. However, when Chief Buthelezi walked out, he said that he did not want to speak to them. Certain groups of the Press gave the utmost prominence to this. They then made a hero and a martyr of him. I am not reproaching Mr. Buthelezi for this; I am reproaching those people who are constantly using homeland leaders in a game which they are playing with the future of South Africa.</p>

<p>We shall have to face the fact that until such time as the ideal of full homeland development has been realized and until such time as we find the solution to our problems as we see them, there will be an interim stage when we shall have to deal with serious problems. We shall have to deal with serious problems, as we are already experiencing at present.</p>

<p>&#x2020;It is not merely a question of working for a solution; we have to cope with the problem in the meantime, a most difficult problem at all times to cope with.</p>

<p>*In this connection I should like to tell you that in the urban areas&#x2014;and not only the &#x201C;urban areas&#x201D; in the sense that the Witwatersrand is the only such area&#x2014;we will have to face up to one reality, viz. that, as has been demonstrated in a homeland area just outside Pretoria, as well as in the whole of Europe, industrialization brings about a concentration of people. With all the influx control measures which we have and which we shall have to apply rigidly, it remains a fact that, as the animals go where the pastures are, so people come to where there are job opportunities and food for them.</p>

<p>He can come with me to see what land ownership has achieved for the Bantu outside Pretoria. He can see what the evils of family housing are, as against housing of migrant labour.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that it is a monstrosity, but he must use his commonsense, of which he has sufficient. I want to ask him again what I asked him last year already: If the system of migrant labour is changed into one of family housing, would he, as a representative of Cape Town, agree with the Divisional Council that the slum conditions on the Cape Flats where there was an uncontrolled influx of people, should be cleared, or does he not agree with that?</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If he agrees with that, then why the constant discussion of influx control measures and the existence of pass laws? Surely that is ridiculous. As far as the problems brought about by migrant labour are concerned, I told the hon. member for Durban North in this House the year before last that we must work on a charter for migrant labour, and we are in fact working on it. I want to tell hon. members that, following an inquiry by the department, one interim report as appeared, a considerable number of whose recommendations have already been implemented, recommendations to eliminate irritations and to make it possible for fewer arrests to take place. It is <span class="col_223-224" refersTo="page_0127"/>an intensive inquiry which is still continuing, and we shall carry on with it to eliminate the unnecessary areas of friction between people and for people, both White and Black, as far as this is possible.</p>

<p>I want to come to another point in regard to which I should like to request the co-operation of both sides of this House. There are people who complain that Bantu are receiving too much training. Sometimes there are even people in the National Party who criticize us, saying that we are doing too much in this regard. A trained Bantu in his homeland is just as essential a part of the infrastructure of the Government of that homeland as railway lines and other things could possibly be. The training of Bantu and the increasing creation of training facilities for them so that they can eventually take over the government of their people, is of cardinal importance for Whites and for non-Whites. We must simply face this fact.</p>

<p>As far as the representation of the Bantu is concerned, it has already been announced by the hon. the Prime Minister in Press statements that we are presently working on an altered type of representation so that dialogue can take place on a local level and more responsibility could perhaps be given gradually to the Bantu leaders, always in the knowledge that in White South Africa the Whites will continue to govern. I want to express my confidence that, if such changes do come, we shall succeed in maintaining dialogue on local level and developing it. With the greatest respect and appreciation, I want to say that even if the hon. the Prime Minister and other Ministers take all possible steps to meet African leaders and homeland leaders, it will be to no avail if we do not continually conduct that dialogue on a local level as well. When Germany is on the way to Moscow and thinks that it can conquer Moscow, then its lines in the rear are broken. These lines in the rear, lines which must be maintained while we govern, while this Cabinet continues with its great task, these lines all true and faithful South Africans can help to build. Therefore I want to make an appeal this afternoon&#x2014;also in connection with further steps which people might have in mind&#x2014; to the Press and to the public, and to people whose intentions are honest even though they differ from us politically: Bring those things, which cause local or country-wide irritation, to our attention, and they will be investigated.</p>

<p>We want to give you the assurance, in this House, that, as far as this department is concerned, with the ideals which we as National Party have set for ourselves in view, we will deal daily with the problems which come before us, and that we will solve the problems in every sphere, in so far as it is within our ability to do so, with the greatest sympathy, in co-operation with homeland leaders and other leaders of the Black peoples. And if, in the meantime, measures have to be adopted which must be seen as interim measures until all the facilities have been provided in their own areas, until they are independent in their own areas, until a commonwealth of nations has been created with those countries, as the Prime Minister has said, in whatever form it might take, this department will continue to play its part in the creation and the development of happy interrelations between peoples and individuals.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House always listen to the hon. the Deputy Minister with great interest because, he has a perceptivity of mind that is denied many of his colleagues. Today I want to reply only indirectly to what he has said because he was not really speaking to this side of the House; he was speaking to that side of the House. In fact, it is surprising that he was not sitting here in order to read them a lecture. But with the rapt attention they listened to him, I would like to think that his message went home.</p>

<p>I want to refer only to one aspect of what this hon. Deputy Minister has said, viz. that we on this side had no policy. You know that we have difficulty in keeping ahead on policy because that Government is continually taking over our policies. They are not only taking our policies, they are now also taking over our personnel to apply them. Every day they tell us how bankrupt we are, that we have no personnel, that we have no manpower, and that we have nobody of any consequence. Yet every time any man from this side steps to that side, within a year he finds himself in the Cabinet. Is that indicative of the wealth of human material that is available on the other side? &#x2026; [Interjections.] To me this signifies the exact opposite.</p>

<p><span class="col_225-226" refersTo="page_0128"/>This hon. Deputy Minister told us some of the things that he was going to do, things that he had in mind. I want to take this line of thinking a little further, because I want to suggest to him what he will have to do. When I came to this hon. House nine years ago I took as the theme for my first little effort the challenge of change and tried to indicate that probably the most characteristic feature of the age in which we live was change&#x2014;rapid, dramatic and accelerating change. And I tried to indicate how this change would be reflected in our way of life and in the world in which we live. Today I would like to return, with your permission, to this basic theme. But I would like to try to picture how this change is going to manifest itself in South Africa itself. I ask hon. members on that side of the House, and particularly the hon. Deputy Minister who has spoken and whose <i>bona tides</i> I accept, to do an experiment with me. Let us look at South Africa as we believe it will be in 10 years&#x2019; time; let us make this projection and try to visualize South Africa as it will be in 10 years&#x2019; time. [Interjections.] I am sorry, I want to know what the hon. member is saying.</p>

<p>You see. Sir, that kind of puerility which comes from that hon. Deputy Minister just highlights his ignorance and the fact that he does not know what we are talking about. Mr. Speaker, I suggest that we do this experiment and look 10 years ahead. I maintain that this is not very difficult to do, because 10 years is not a long period in time; 10 years is just around the corner; in fact, in 10 years&#x2019; time many of us ought to be around still and some of the ambitious ones over there will probably still be sitting in this House, although I believe that then they will be dealing with issues totally different from those with which we are dealing at the moment. It is not difficult to speculate about the future in this sense, because if change is going to come as a result of revolution, then the situation and end result becomes entirely unpredictable, but if change is going to come as a result of evolution, which we all hope will be the case, then on the national level and over a short period of time I believe the situation is entirely predictable. Because once you have a certain set of events, once you have certain factors that are operating, then the politician can influence it only in a marginal way. A classic situation that I have in mind is what this hon. gentleman has referred to. You know. Sir, a &#x201C;hoeksteen&#x201D; Nationalist Party philosophy is that the number of Black people in the so-called White areas must be reduced. For 25 years they promised the faithful how they were going to do this. They have had every single legal enactment that you could possibly think of to reduce the number of Black people in the so-called White areas, and what do you have today? You have a straight-line relationship&#x2014;they have been unable to change this because the politician can only change this situation in a marginal way.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with change here, and to my mind the amazing situation so far as that side of the House is concerned is that they do not anticipate change and go out to meet it. They are continually resisting change. They accept change when it is forced upon them and they do change, but they do not do it willingly and voluntarily; they do it reluctantly; they walk forward, but they walk forward like a man in borrowed shoes, because superimposed upon their whole system is indoctrination. They have indoctrinated their people over the years not only not to accept change but to resist change. Sir, that is why today they are being hoist by their own petard; that is why today these &#x201C;Kafferboetie&#x201D; chickens are coming home to roost with a vengeance. Just look at this silly situation, Sir: We are supposed to be an enlightened society; we are living in 1975; we have a Prime Minister who has more power than any Prime Minister has ever had before; he is hailed as &#x2018;&#x2018;the man of Africa, the man of the moment&#x201D;.</p>

I can conjure up the scene as they sit there, each one saying what he feels the effect will be on the &#x201C;volk daarbuite&#x201D;, and then a pronouncement is made; they say, &#x201C;No, they cannot play against a mixed team&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, have you ever in your life heard of a situation where so many grown-up men, so highly paid, sit for hours at a meeting to debate such a silly issue, and have you ever heard of an instance anywhere in the world where a Cabinet has arrived at such a <span class="col_227-228" refersTo="page_0129"/>stupid decision? You see, Sir, they dare not move in this matter because they cannot make changes; they cannot move forward with enthusiasm and yet remain plausible. You see, Sir, they are in effect very fortunate, because here they have an Opposition which is not hindering them at all. This Opposition is blazing the way and showing them what to do. We are the pacesetters. We set the policies which they take over. Mr. Speaker, could you imagine what would happen if our roles were reversed? Could you imagine what would happen in South Africa if we had to do what they are doing at the present time? Sir, there would not have been a single member over there. They would have been holding protest meetings throughout South Africa, and the kind of propaganda they would have given forth would have made Albert Hertzog look like a liberal. [Interjections.] Sir, we are setting the tone for them all the time. Let me give an example. We said that if you want to live in Africa you will have to have Black diplomats. We said that if you want to sell separate freedoms at the U.N., you cannot conceivably find anybody better qualified than Chief Kaiser Matanzima to do so. We were told that this was nonsense. We were told that this was unnecessary. We had the classical rejoinder from the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who said he would conduct his diplomacy by means of a telephone. And what happened? It got to the stage where he realized he was wrong. He was wrong all along. Now, of course, we must have Black diplomats. But think of the time we have lost. Now we have the situation after 25 years of government by that side, where the three ex-Protectorates, part of Southern Africa, part of our customs system, part of our monetary system, do not even have diplomatic representation here, and over the whole of Africa we have diplomatic relations with only one State. Now that the hon. the Prime Minister has been cast in the role of a Dr. Kissinger and is floating around all over Africa, he must operate in a vacuum because there is not a single African State apart from Malawi where we have diplomatic representation. Mr. Speaker, I have tried to indicate how that Government does change, and I have tried to indicate how they do it with great reluctance. How tragic for South Africa that they always do it when it is too late.</p>

<p>But, Sir, let us return to this experiment I want to do, and that is to look at South Africa in 10 years&#x2019; time. Certain issues are predictable. Hon. gentlemen can tell me where I am wrong. In 10 years&#x2019; time South Africa will have a total population of about 30 million people. Of those 15 approximately will be White, 15% will be Coloured and Asian, and the remaining 70% to 75% will be Black. But the important element is this, of the 23 million to 25 million Black people we will have in South Africa in 10 years&#x2019; time, some 15 million of them will be living outside the homelands. Our economy in 10 years&#x2019; time ought to be strong. We will probably earn from gold something in the region of R5 000 million a year. Our GNP in real terms, which is now in the region of R11 000 million, will probably have doubled by then and will be in the region of R22 000 million, which is a massive amount. But, more important than anything else, the buying power of the non-White people in this country will in 10 years&#x2019; time be in the region of R20 million a day. This will give us a completely new dimension, because it will make them a force of immense potency in the South African set-up. It will mean that their economic and their political bargaining power will be vastly greater than it is at the present time. In 10 years&#x2019; time to the north of us we will have either dictatorships or we will have majority Governments, which in most cases probably means the same thing. We will still have a tenuous foothold in the U.N., but the influence from overseas will be vastly greater than it is at the present time. For years we said to the Government that they must do away with the master and servant legislation because it is archaic. They would not do so, until the Americans refused to buy our coal. And what happened then? They changed this legislation within a week. That is the kind of influence that we are going to have from overseas in the future. Against this sort of background, what is the situation then likely to be in South Africa in the main fields in which we are interested, the social, the economic and political fields? Against this setting it is very easy to predict what the situation is going to be.</p>

<p>I want to deal first briefly with the social field. In the social field this edifice, this compulsory apartheid, this vast network of legislation that the Government has built up over so many years will have to be dismantled. For years this Government, particularly under the influence of the hon. <span class="col_229-230" refersTo="page_0130"/>the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development who is the ideologue in the Nationalist Party, the Suslov of the Communist Party, has built up this network of walls between people. The most important thing over the next 10 years in the social field is that we shall have to break down the walls and that we shall have to build bridges. However, you can only build a bridge if you can get two firm perches, one on either side of the gap, and so much goodwill has been eroded away over the last quarter of a century that we may well have difficulty in finding suitable footholds on the other side to build those bridges. We shall need bridges because they will probably be our only method of escape. This Government reminds me always&#x2014;I say it without any disrespect&#x2014;of the occasion when I went to the feeble-minded institution at Potchefstroom to look at the inmates there. I went one day and they had about 100 of them out on a sportsfield. Half of them were in front and they were erecting benches around the sportsfield that people could sit on. They were very happy. Everybody was fully active; they were all building seats. However, some half an hour later came another group, another contingent, which set about breaking all these up again. Everybody was very happy; half of them building up and the other half breaking down.</p>

<p>This is a permit-ridden Government. This is an era of permits, but I say that in the next period of 10 years this whole era of permits will be behind us and nobody will mourn the passing thereof. In 10 years&#x2019; time we shall still have separation. You have separation all over the world. However, that separation in 10 years&#x2019; time will be voluntary; it will not be entrenched in law. This is the great disservice that this Government has done South Africa: What ought to have been voluntary they made mandatory; what ought to have been a question of personal choice, they sanctified in law. In 10 years&#x2019; time people will not be talking about Black people being temporary permanent sojourners or permanent temporary sojourners and if they did so, one would know that they were mad. This is what we really ought to know at the present time. In 10 years&#x2019; time it will be understood that they are permanently settled here in White South Africa. From this will follow a number of things. If these people are here permanently they will be entitled to citizenship rights. This means that they will have the opportunity of freehold title to the homes that they occupy. Nobody who sits on that side will be able to deny that. I say that this will come as assuredly as I stand here. There will be mixed areas or open areas and there will be exclusive areas. There will be residential areas where Black people will live as they do now and areas where Whites live, but there will also be open or mixed areas as we have at the present time. Exactly the same will happen to our schools and universities. For years the Afrikaans-medium universities in this country said that they did not want Black students. That will change in 10 years&#x2019; time. Pretoria and Potchefstroom would be happy to have them as RAU has already indicated. RAU has said they will be very happy to take Black students. Who is going to stop them? Is the hon. the Minister of National Education going to stop them? In 10 years&#x2019; time we shall have 100 Nico Malan theatres throughout South Africa where people of all races will enjoy theatre and the arts and will be rubbing shoulders with one another.</p>

<p>In 10 years&#x2019; time we shall have mixed sport, whether the hon. the Minister calls it multinational or multiracial sport. It will be accepted by everybody except by a small group of bittereinders who, under the spiritual guidance of the hon. member for Waterberg, will be starting on the second Great Trek, this time heading back for the bush! You will be doing away with petty <span class="col_231-232" refersTo="page_0131"/>apartheid in all your urban areas. Mr. Speaker, you might recollect a year ago when the hon. member for Westdene&#x2014;he was the fall guy&#x2014;had to put a question to the Government. It was after the Johannesburg city council had decided to open their parks and their libraries. He put the question to the Government: &#x201C;Has your attention been drawn to this, and what are you going to do about it?&#x201D; The Government thought it so important that the hon. the Prime Minister responded. He in turn thought it so important that he not only gave his answer in Afrikaans, but also gave it to us in English. We were treated to a wonderful example of kragdadigheid. The things that he was going to do to the Johannesburg city council! You have no idea! What has happened to all that? Pretoria has thrown its parks open and everybody will be doing it. There is nothing that the Government can do to stop it. What I have tried to indicate in the social field is that there will be all these changes which are entirely predictable. We can take the steps to meet them now. Why resist what is inevitable?</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at the economic field. South Africa will develop economically not because of this Government, but despite it, because we have all the ingredients for natural growth. The most important features in the economic field over the next ten years will be to give all our people to an increasing degree an equal opportunity to share in the revenue potential of our country and to develop a solid and prosperous Black middle class, because that will be our only protection against revolution. Every time we talk about a greater sharing of wealth, the hon. the Prime Minister gets highly excited, but all it means is that there is an unequal distribution of earning capacity today. The latest figures suggest&#x2014;I give it in dollars so that one can relate it to other figures&#x2014;that the <i>per capita</i> income of the White man in this country today is $3 150 per year. The <i>per capita</i> income for the Coloured and the Asian is only $350, one-tenth of what the White man gets. The <i>per capita</i> income for the Black man is $185, only half of what the Coloured and the Indian get. But this is not discrimination, this is differentiation, they tell us. If I were on the receiving end, I certainly would not call it differentiation. The latest market research exercise by the University of South Africa has shown that 23% of the Black people in this country live under the MSL, the minimum subsistence level. They suggest that 10% of the Coloureds also fall into this category. Less than 1 % of the Whites in this country are under the MSL. But this is not discrimination, it is differentiation. The ILO has recently calculated that in the field of industrial workers, where you are dealing with a highly specialized category, the Black people receive 19% of the wages that the White people receive. Then we have all these pious protestations from the Government that they will close the wage gap. The recent surveys done by the <i>Financial Mail</i> show that that wage gap, in absolute terms, is not shrinking or contracting, but is in fact getting bigger all the time. In ten years&#x2019; time nobody will be talking about job reservation any more. In fact, you have these little exercises, the Ripley believe-it-or-not exercises, and the question will be: &#x201C;In which country did you have job reservation, that strange form of medieval guildism?&#x201D; Bright little boys will say: &#x201C;In South Africa&#x201D;, and the guy who said &#x201C;It will be removed over my dead body&#x201D; is Marais Viljoen, who is not with us now and will not be with us then. The Physical Planning Act will be gone. Where else in the world can one develop an economic system on racial ratios? My information is that even now 80% or more of the applications are passed summarily provided they are reasonably fully motivated. In 10 years&#x2019; time we shall be in the midst of a crash training programme, and if anybody mentions this then, there will be no sneering from that side because in South Africa at present 40% of the workers are entirely unskilled. We are at a comparable stage of development with Australia, where 6% of their workers are unskilled, and that is the target we shall have to aim at. The migratory system will be in the process of being phased out. You have migratory workers all over the world, but we must all realize that South Africa is the only country in the world where we have them in those large numbers. South Africa is the only country in the world applying the migratory label to its own people, and South Africa is the only country in the world where migratory workers do not arise spontaneously but where you manufacture them in law. In 10 years&#x2019; time we shall have trade unions. If we are wise and take the right steps now, those trade unions will be mixed and there will then be a chance of stability, but if we follow the stupidity of the present Minister, in 10 years&#x2019; time many of the trade unions will be Black and <span class="col_233-234" refersTo="page_0132"/>we shall then be facing a torrid time. In the economic field it is vitally important for us to ensure that everyone has a greater opportunity to share the revenue potential in our country, and as I said what is vitally important is that the Blacks should be turned into a prosperous, stable middle class. This is our only protection and our only defence against revolution.</p>

<p>Then we come to the political field, and unfortunately my time is so very limited. Here we will really have massive change. In the political field in 10 years&#x2019; time we will probably have one independent Bantustan and it will be there as a monument. People from overseas will go and look at it as they do now. However, it will stand there as a monument to the political folly of that side of the House. The whole concept of separate development at that stage would be rejected by the Black people because, as they have already said, they are not prepared to forfeit their portion of South Africa&#x2019;s wealth. It will also be rejected by the White people because economic factors at that stage will have made it completely obsolete. It is true that we will have a form of regionalism. It is true that we will have homeland Governments which will enjoy a great degree of autonomy. They will be using this as a form of leverage in order to bargain for increased rights. By that stage the Indians and Coloureds will have moved, politically speaking, very close to the Whites because the fallacy of separate development and a separate future for them will have become apparent even to those who are politically absolutely obtuse. However, in 10 years&#x2019; time the political destiny of South Africa will be in the hands of some 15 million non-homeland Black people, and they will be fully integrated in our economic system, in our defence services and in our Police. I also want to suggest that they will constitute nearly 50% of our Civil Service. Those Black people will be making political demands that any Government in this country will find impossible to resist. At that stage the unitary system would have served its purpose. It will have become apparent to everyone that it cannot meet South Africa&#x2019;s requirements. I think one of the most prominent economists in this country is Prof. Viljoen. Years ago I had the opportunity of studying under him at the University of Pretoria. Here is a man who does not support this side of the House, yet he said at a recent congress that economic factors in South Africa point to the fact that the only conceivable solution to our political problems is a federal system. This Parliament which symbolizes the unitary system in South Africa will in ten years&#x2019; time be busy devolving many of its existing powers to subsidiary units. Everybody will in ten years time accept it that there must be some constitutional agency where men of all colours can meet together in order to plan the future of this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for the past half hour the hon. member for Hillbrow has treated us to a vision he saw in the crystal ball into which Madam Rose normally gazes. He visualized all manner of things concerning South Africa&#x2019;s position in ten years&#x2019; time. I am pleased that the hon. member was realistic enough not to try to see in the crystal ball what the future of his party will be in ten years&#x2019; time. [Interjections.] He did not even venture to say what his own position in his party would be for the hon. member finally realized that, in view of what is happening in his party at the moment, those of them remaining <span class="col_235-236" refersTo="page_0133"/>after that period has elapsed will be only a tiny nonentity in the political history of South Africa. The hon. member&#x2019;s problem is that he not only gazed into a crystal ball, he also gazed at a mirror in which he saw himself and the weakness of his own party reflected. This is the hon. member&#x2019;s greatest problem. In the course of my speech I will in fact deal with a few of the points the hon. member discussed.</p>

<p>If that hon. member opposite had resigned his seat to accommodate his leader, there would have been no need for him to speak nonsense in this House.</p>

<p>I want to return for a few moments to the history made in the United Party caucus yesterday when the hon. member for Randburg was suspended from that caucus. The hon. member for Pretoria Central referred to the matter, but I want to address myself on another level to my United Party counterpart in the Transvaal, and put a few questions to him, questions which should also be put to his own people. I come now to the first question which I want to put to the hon. member for Yeoville, the leader of the United Party in the Transvaal. The hon. member for Randburg has been suspended from the caucus of his party. Therefore he no longer enjoys the confidence of his colleagues in this House; therefore he is no longer deemed good enough to sit in this House as a representative of that party. I want to be very honest with the hon. member for Yeoville and ask him in all earnest to tell me what his position is now in respect of that hon. member. Is it not his obvious course as the leader of his party in the Transvaal to summon the executive committee of his party in the Transvaal and get rid of that hon. member as a member of the United Party? How can that hon. member remain a member of the party in the Transvaal if he is not a member of the caucus? That is my first question. I think that is logical. In terms of any party's disciplinary code it would go without saying. In our party, in any event, it would go without saying, i.e. that the moment someone is suspended from the caucus, for whatever reason, the party executive of the province in which he is a member would take immediate action. Therefore, I want to put this question to the hon. member very pertinently, and I think he owes the House a reply in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>There is a second question I should like to put to the hon. member for Yeoville, and I think it is necessary for us to discuss this as well. What I want to ask is this: What exactly is the position of the hon. member for Yeoville himself? Where do his sympathies lie?</p>

According to our information the member for Randburg was the master-mind behind the entire organization to have him chosen as party leader in the Transvaal. I think specific replies should be given to these questions. I think these are questions in regard to which the United Party should adopt a standpoint quite apart from the standpoint of the kindred spirits who, from the nature of the case, are concerned in it. One thing is, in fact, a responsibility the hon. member has which he cannot evade, and that is the responsibility he as party leader in the Transvaal has to act decisively so that discipline will be maintained in that party. I hone that, when it suits him, the hon. member will in fact reply to it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say at the outset that we are living in a world of instability and insecurity. There are smouldering situations in the Middle East; there is unrest in Cyprus: there are bomb attacks in England and Ireland; there is economic stagnation and insecurity everywhere. All nine of the signatories to the EEC two years ago have already been changed and superseded. There are problems in Portugal and Angola and over a period of twelve years there have been 32 coup d&#x2019;états in Africa. In that atmosphere and against that background South Africa stands out as a tower of strength and stability because South Africa has the power, the policy, the leaders, the economic stability, the raw materials, everything, and with these things it can face the world as the strongest State in Africa, as the most stable state in Africa, and also as regards a large part of the world. I want to give you a single figure: We need only consider that our present Prime Minister is only the seventh Prime Minister of South Africa over a period of 65 years, compared with the fact that Italy has already had 33 governments since 1945. This, then, indicates the stability and the success of a country such as South Africa. The reason for this is clear. It is because the National Party of South Africa has the principles and the policy in accordance with which it can absorb and handle, in an evolutionary way, the developments which are taking place in the world as well as in its own country without any problems arising, because we have the ability to adjust within the framework of the broad principles and policy of our party. That is also why we are going from strength to strength.</p>

<p>Let us take an example. Let us take the example which is under discussion at present, i.e. liaison with Africa, and the role which South Africa has to play in this regard under the present circumstances. The fact simply is that we form an indissoluble part of Africa. I think we should all realize and accept that Africa has been good to us for many years, that we chose Africa as our only fatherland more than two centuries ago, that we have been calling ourselves Africans for many years, that a section of our White people call themselves Afrikaners, children of Africa. These are all signs that we have gradually dissolved the ties with Europe in all spheres. We have in fact maintained the necessary contacts, but we threw in our lot indissolubly with that of Africa because we are from Africa and of Africa and want to remain so. The future of Africa will be determined by the inhabitants of Africa, by the White and Black Africans jointly. It is true that we are now being reproached because for many years we made no effort to liaise with Africa. In this regard I want to quote from Hansard, just to illustrate how clearly the position was in fact received by leaders in South <span class="col_239-240" refersTo="page_0135"/>Africa many years ago. I am quoting from Hansard of 2 May 1957, column 5219. This is what the then Prime Minister, the late Advocate J. G. Strydom, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But in the past 15 to 20 years particularly great changes have come about, and South Africa will have to keep these changes in mind. That is why I said two years ago at Vryheid that as a White race in South Africa we would have to bear this in mind and that we could not set out from the standpoint that the non-White countries which become independent must necessarily be our enemies; that we would have to adopt a policy that we and they can exist peacefully in Africa; that we and they must all realize that there is and must be room in Africa for countries which are under White domination as well as for other countries which are non-White, and that in the ordinary course of events, as those countries develop, it will have to come about that between us and particularly countries south of the Sahara &#x2026; with a view to economic and other matters &#x2026; there will have to be contact between us as governments and that in the course of time there will have to be ordinary relations and even diplomatic relations.</block>

<p>This was a wise, prophetic look at the future from the year 1957 by the then Leader of the National Party. It was stated as part of the policy which might possibly have been executed.</p>

<p>The next passage I want to quote is from a speech by the late Dr. Verwoerd. I am quoting from Hansard of 24 April 1964, column 4900&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In dealing with this matter on previous occasions I went on to add what I had reiterated in interviews with various persons from time to time when they asked me whether this meant that we would be willing to have diplomatic relations with Africa states if they stopped uttering threats against us, if they stopped expressing hostile sentiments, if they stopped their boycott movements, in other words, with countries which desired to have friendly relations with South Africa. My reply was &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.</block>

<p>In column 4901 he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Just as non-White states like India and Egypt had had non-White representation here in the past, suitable forms could be found for the maintenance of harmonious relations between ourselves and the Back states of Africa; it depended on them, not on us.</block>

<p>These standpoints, as they were stated by these two leaders I have just mentioned here, were seen and spelt out as a distant prospect. That which was envisaged has now been realized during the period of government of the present Prime Minister. This Prime Minister had the necessary vision; he saw the opening; he saw the opportunity; he saw that the time was ripe for the opportunity, and he had the courage of his convictions to seize the opportunity and utilize it in spite of criticism, and for this South Africa as a whole wants to pay tribute to him and thank him. He had the courage of his convictions to liaise with Malawi at the very outset of his period of government and to effect an exchange of diplomats with Malawi, an arrangement which has so far worked perfectly and without any problems, and this was in due course followed up by various other announcements of work that had to be done in this continent. In October last year the Prime Minister delivered his now very well-known speech in the Senate in which he expressed his standpoint very clearly. I quote it as the hon. the Prime Minister himself summarized it in his Nigel speech (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am prepared to extend my hand of friendship and peace to the rest of Africa, to discuss these problems with them. Let us not expend the power and energy and money we have on arms and instruments of murder, but let us rather apply those powers and energy to developing and building up our beautiful continent of Africa. Let us, instead of displaying hostility towards one another, help and assist one another and continue to coexist in this part of the world.</block>

<p>This was the message of the Prime Minister last year in September. After how many years, then, was there a positive reaction from Africa? On the following Saturday, at a ceremony during the course of which he was awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Lusaka, President Kaunda made a speech in which he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_241-242" refersTo="page_0136"/>This is the voice of reason for which Africa and the world have waited for many years.</block>

<p>He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As we understand now, the Government of South Africa has stated through the Prime Minister, Mr. Vorster, that South Africa should project its future within the context of Africa, that South Africa belongs to Africa, and the peoples of South Africa&#x2014;Black, White, Brown, Yellow and so forth&#x2014;belong to Africa and have as much right as anyone else to enjoy the fruits of this continent.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know the hon. member has already read it here, but I am quoting it again because, with reference to the speeches made here by the hon. member&#x2019;s leaders, it seems to me as though they do not realize what has happened here. That is my problem. Mr. Speaker, after everything that has been done here, after all this preparatory work, which eventually led to the success in the form in which it has been achieved so far, an article appeared in a British publication published by the Institute for the Study of Conflict in which the writer, Peter Janke, analysed the entire position in Southern Africa and arrived at the following conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the most significant factor in Southern Africa is the curious new ascendancy of Mr. Vorster as a leading statesman in Africa. Ironically, Black African leaders have been prepared to confer with Mr. Vorster on a basis of reality in politics, just when the British policy aims to isolate him. His role as an African Statesman may only be the beginning.</block>

<p>This is how an outsider sees our present Prime Minister and the task he is at present performing in Africa and the role he is playing here. Mr. Speaker, I am deliberately sketching this background at length in order to bring me to the attitude of the present Opposition in regard to this entire matter. Typically, in the spirit manifested by the United Party during the past years, their attitude is: &#x201C;That is all very well, but ...&#x201D; they always come up with a &#x201C;but&#x201D;. The Leader of the United Party says that they would have done it better; that they would have done it more effectively and more rapidly; that they would have done it immediately and would have done it better in all respects. The Leader of the Progressive Party said: &#x201C;We will make no progress unless we change our domestic policy&#x2014;no progress&#x201D;, and the hon. member for Houghton also emphasized today that we would make no progress unless we changed our domestic policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River said that Africa was waiting for our leadership, but that the South African Government could not cross the threshold because we were shackled to our political ideologies. I think I am interpreting them correctly. In other words, what we actually have before us here is this: You have in fact achieved a small measure of success, but we want to warn you that if, in your internal policy in South Africa, you do not run away, panickstricken, from every form of control which exists at present, if you are not going to do away with all the things the hon. members for Hillbrow and Edenvale spelt out here this afternoon, there is going to be no progress of any kind. In other words, the demand is being made on us that this Government, which received a mandate on 24 April to implement a particular policy, should immediately violate that policy and implement the policy of the Progressive Party and the United Party. This is the request; this is the assertion which is now being made here; this is the standpoint you are now putting to us here. The argument is that if we do not do so, we will not make any progress; we will not cross the threshold. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I want to begin by saying what this policy of détente does not entail&#x2014;for it seems to me the Opposition is under the wrong impression. My problem with the <span class="col_243-244" refersTo="page_0137"/>hon. member for Hillbrow in particular is that, as a result of a few developments to the north of us here in Africa, and a few minor problems in Mozambique, and a few changes here in Africa, he has had the fright of his life, has seized the bit between his teeth and has run away as quickly as possible to get away from everything he has himself been advocating all these years.</p>

<p>We shall not run away. We shall deal with the matter. But I want to say what detente is not. In the first place I want to say that the Government of South Africa is not conducting these discussions and is not engaged in these things which are in progress at the moment from a position of weakness or fear. We are acting from a position of strength. This is the last standpoint I want to state at once, South Africa&#x2019;s economy is sound. The inflation which is afflicting all the countries of the world is afflicting South Africa as well, but nevertheless South Africa is economically sound, among the soundest on the entire continent of Africa and among the soundest in the outside world. South Africa is militarily prepared for any eventuality. Our military strength is not being applied for the purpose of launching attacks or for any imperialistic ideas, but for the purposes of defence we are prepared, and everyone knows this. In the third place, South Africa is politically strong, with a Government which has been in power for 26 years and has now received a new mandate with a firmer instruction than ever before to continue with its task. In the fourth place, the inhabitants, the people of South Africa, are a resolute people who know exactly what they will or will not permit and who, as Africans, will, from the nature of the case, defend what is their own with body and soul. From the nature of the case, the Opposition wants to evade and run away at once from any pressure, from whatever source, wants to abandon everything immediately and run away. Sir, the world has taught us that no one has respect for a weakling who succumbs at the first sign of trouble.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Every speech issuing from the opposite side says we should abandon everything and run away. I want to take another argument. There is the entire question of making progress with the concept of co-operation and a standpoint of better understanding among countries in Africa. Agreement in respect of one another&#x2019;s internal policies, one another&#x2019;s internal situations, is certainly not a requirement or a condition for discussions and cooperation with other countries. Surely it cannot be a condition. After all, the U.S.A, does not for one single moment approve of the internal policy of Russia, but they can nevertheless achieve a détente and co-operate in the space programme. The U.S.A, does not for a single moment agree with the policy of Red China and yet reciprocal visits and discussions can take place and they can even compete with each other in the field of sport and play table tennis in Peking. In regard to this matter, I want to say again what détente is not. The South African Government will not allow itself to be dictated to in respect of its domestic policy, just as we do not wish to dictate to other countries what their domestic policy should be. We will not allow ourselves to be dictated to. We want to be accepted as we are, and the changes which have to be effected in South Africa will be effected by us on the basis of our own decisions, in our own way and in our own time. We will not allow ourselves to be pushed into anything or threatened by anyone, not by the Opposition or by any outsiders either. We will carry on as we see fit, according to our own judgment. I want to concede at once that society in South Africa and our conditions here are by no means perfect. Which society is perfect? Mention one to me. We made mistakes in the past and we will make mistakes again in the future because we are human, and people are fallible and make mistakes. This is also the case in other countries. Who are the Opposition to adopt a righteous attitude here, particularly when they speak about discrimination, while their entire policy, the political dispensation they are seeking to achieve, their handling of politics in South Africa, is the worst form of discrimination one could ever hope to find? Where could one find a greater degree of discrimination in the political sphere than in the federal policy of the United Party in which people obtain the franchise or do not obtain it, according to the contribution they make towards the welfare of the State?</p>

<p>Yes, I wonder what it is now. The hon. member is referring to UN. but just look as the state they are in! The fact remains that the whole approach of the United Party is that their communal councils, or whatever they may be called, will be constituted on a basis according to which the non-Whites will not be represented according to their numbers. This is a cunning way&#x2014;it makes no difference what it is called&#x2014;in which the United Party, if I may use the student expression, wants to do the non-Whites out of their rights on the basis of their numbers. If one is not prepared to share political power, one must share territory. If one is not prepared to share territory, one must share political power, and if one shares political power, one must carry it through to the full consequences of one&#x2019;s policy, i.e. that one will share on a basis of one man, one vote, in other words, according to the numerical strength of the various population groups in the country. If you do anything other than that, it is discrimination. [Interjections.] The hon. Leader of the Opposition knows that they are not prepared in any way to move away from discrimination, as they call it, in respect of schools. At this juncture I should like to put a question to the hon. member for Hillbrow. Is separation in itself discrimination?</p>

<p>I will take another example. Just take the case of the hon. member for Randburg. He is not permitted to sit among those hon. members. [Interjections.] Hon. members know full well that they will not enforce mixed primary and high schools in education in South Africa. [Interjections.] Therefore, hon. members are not prepared to carry that policy through to its logical conclusion. There is very clear proof as to why this cannot be done. Even in the most liberal states in the U.S.A., Massachusetts and Boston, there are problems with mixed schools. The hon. members of the Opposition will not allow mixed residential areas either. In fact, there are a number of things they will not allow. The political hypocrisy inherent in this is, therefore, that while they accuse us of discrimination, they themselves are not prepared to get away from discrimination, according to the same definition they attach to discrimination, i.e. separation in this manner.</p>

It is embodied in the form which my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, analysed, i.e. qualified franchise. The Progressive Party has not yet told us, do not wish to and will not tell us, whether they are in favour of qualified franchise or unqualified franchise. As long as they advocate qualified franchise, they are discriminating against people on the basis of their possessions and qualifications.</p>

Why do they place such heavy emphasis on race discrimination? What about discrimination between men and women? Is this less dangerous or less ugly than race discrimination? In many countries of the world today men and women do not earn the same salaries. In many countries the women&#x2019;s status is not the same as that of the men. That is discrimination. Why do you not feel as strongly about that as you do about race discrimination? In certain Moslem countries non-Moslems are treated differently from Moslems. That is discrimination.

<p>The hon. member places emphasis on this one single concept, that of race discrimination, while you have made the discrimination concept an integral part of your own policy throughout. The fact remains that this party will set its own house in order as it becomes necessary to do so from time to time. However, there are certain basic principles which will have to be and will be maintained for the sake of the practical approach in politics. There are three basic concepts which will remain in this party&#x2019;s policy in spite of what the outside world says. The first the question of the maintenance of identity, which is a foundation stone of the policy. Those laws which are concerned with the maintenance of the identity of the various peoples will remain, no matter who exerts pressure. Secondly, the laws dealing with the elimination of areas of friction, will also remain. As circumstances develop, we decide on that from time to time. These laws which are necessary to obviate or reduce areas of friction will remain and where they are no longer necessary they will disappear because they are no longer practically necessary. This, therefore, is a practical and realistic approach. The third aspect which will remain under all circumstances, according to our standpoint, is that the political power of the White man in this Parliament will not be shared, for the moment one shares political power one can never again remove it.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by putting a very serious question to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. [Interjection.] In any case, he seems to have been appointed as such, because he acted here this afternoon as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The hon. the Minister is the leader of the Nationalist Party in the Transvaal and he is loyal to his leader. The hon. the Prime Minister had to send a member of this House on to a siding by making him a Railway commissioner when he had to be considered for a Cabinet post. A vacancy then occurred in the constituency of Pietersburg. Now, my question to the hon. the Minister is the following: How serious is the hon. the Minister in his repeated professions of loyalty to his leader while he allows a person to stand as official Nationalist Party candidate notwithstanding the fact that that person has given money to the HNP, was a shareholder in the HNP newspaper, <i>Die Afrikaner,</i> who thanked the speakers at an HNP meeting and now says that he is a good member of the Nationalist Party and supports the verligte Prime Minister? I think we are entitled to an answer, because the hon. leader of the Transvaal questions us on our domestic affairs. Therefore he should also be prepared to reply to questions on his party&#x2019;s domestic affairs. We want to know how he is now able to say that he is a good Nationalist, while appointing HNP shareholders in the HNP newspaper as official Nationalist Party candidates.</p>

<p>I want to go still further. I see all the aspirants sitting there: The four hon. Deputy Ministers who have been overlooked, as well as the hon. member for Potchefstroom, <span class="col_249-250" refersTo="page_0140"/>who has been waiting for promotion for a long time. They are sitting there and what has happened? The hon. the Prime Minister has had to come and look for a person from this side of the House ti fill the vacancy in the Cabinet because there is not a single person among all his loyal supporters and among his Deputy Ministers whom he regards as competent enough to fill the vacancy. This is the party we are dealing with.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to say that they need not worry about the United Party and any problems we may have. We shall deal with our problems in our own way as we have always done. Let them try to sort out some of their problems on that side of the House. I might just mention in passing that I understand that the latest count gives the hon. member for Waterberg, when he splits off, 37 followers that he will take with him. When the vacancy in Pietersburg is filled that figure will increase to 38 members. But I have already wasted enough time &#x2026;</p>

I deliberately tried to reciprocate to show just how irresponsible that is, particularly on the part of a Minister.</p>

<p>Let us look now at some of the things the hon. Minister said this afternoon. Apart from the history lesson he tried to give us &#x2014;it was obviously prepared for him&#x2014; which he himself did not seem to understand, he took us to task for talking about discrimination. We did not make a speech at the United Nations on behalf of the South African Government. We did not talk about removing discrimination. It was the Government&#x2019;s representative who did so, who stood up at the United Nations and said: &#x201C;Discrimination based on colour is indefensible and we are working to remove it.&#x201D; Now, when we simply draw it to the Government&#x2019;s attention, there is a hullabaloo, as though we initiated the discussion. His Government did so. He as a Minister must accept joint Cabinet responsibility for that decision. That hon. Minister is as committed as the Prime Minister, as committed as anyone else, to their policy of abolishing discrimination based on colour. The hon. Minister nods his head. He is committed to a policy of eliminating discrimination based on colour, but what did he do for ten or 15 minutes this afternoon?

<p>You do not consider that as discrimination&#x2014;that the law should compel different children to go to different schools?</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Discrimination which you apply to yourself is your own choice. [Interjections.] Can&#x2019;t the hon. the Prime Minister understand that the whole essence of federation is the decentralization of authority and power to communities? Each one of those communities will run its own affairs in its own way. If one community, the White community, says that it will have its own schools because it is its right to do so, that is not discrimination based on colour. It is the right of the Whites to do so if they should wish to do so in the same way as it is the right of a private school to refuse admission to one White child and accept another White child. It is their right to discriminate between two applicants who wish to go to the school. It is the choice of the community. What we are getting at is that this Government is committed to a policy of removing discrimination based on colour. Now we want to see them get on with carrying it out; it must be done.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House have never advocated and do not advocate a social revolution in South Africa. What we are advocating is an evolutionary policy in which human rights will be recognized and in which individuals, within their communities, will have the opportunity of participating in governing themselves, and in which there will be a Federal Assembly, a central point, where all communities can be represented. We have never stood and never will stand for one man one vote. That is why this party has said openly and publicly, and I repeat it now, that we will not be part of any left wing united front with the Progressive Party or with any other party. We of the United Party stand on our own feet, on our policy, on our principles. We will have nothing to do with any contrived front with any other opposition party, because we believe that its policy is as dangerous for South Africa as the policy of this Government. They are equally dangerous because both are based on a unitary system.</p>

<p>Let me ask the members of the Progressive Party a question. How is their commission getting on, their glamour-boy commission?</p>

<p>They have a caucus of seven and they split three ways. We want to know about that commission because we would like to know whether they still stand for a qualified franchise. We will never get an answer from them. Mr. Speaker, but that is the whole basis of their existence. That is the fraud on which they were elected to Parliament. Within months of their coming to Parliament, elected on the fraud of a qualified franchise, they appointed a glamour-boy commission to think up a new policy. That is just as dangerous as the Government is because both are blinded by the unitary Westminster concept.</p>

<p>However, I did not rise to talk about our policy this afternoon. I want to talk on the motion which is before the House and which, I believe, is of vital importance. My leader talked of a flare path, of lighting the way. Unfortunately, the only member on that side who understands what a flare path is, is the one who was shunted into a Railway commissionership. I believe that the responsibility now resting on South Africa could well affect the destiny of the world because Southern Africa could hold the balance of power between the East and the West. In this debate we have had to listen to a vision of the potential of this region which is frightening in its smallness. I want to deal with two aspects with which I am particularly concerned. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs tried to belittle the leader of the Opposition and asked: &#x201C;Do you not know that a transport treaty involving the countries in Southern Africa has been signed and already exists?&#x201D; I thought that perhaps I had slipped up since I had not heard of it, so I looked up the reference he gave. I have it here and I want to deal with it. The reference is to the BSL Countries Customs Agreement. This is the treaty, the depth and breadth of the vision of this Government concerning détente in Southern Africa. Article 15 of this Agreement provides that there will be tariffs for goods in transit equal to those applied to domestic traffic, and it ensures <span class="col_253-254" refersTo="page_0142"/>that there will be equal opportunities for publicly owned road transport in transit. Article 16 deals with the freedom of transit and what you may and may not take through a country. These two clauses are held up as a &#x201C;transport treaty&#x201D; whose total&#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but then one does not call it a transport treaty or transport agreement. This is a customs agreement. I want to contrast my vision of this region of Southern Africa. If only this Government had tried years ago to bring together &#x2014;this is not détente but a part of normal life&#x2014;all the countries linked by common transport systems. I know we have a Mozambique Convention, but if one has a treal understanding of the potential of this area, one will realize that the one thing that links us all and crosses national boundaries is communications: Rail, road, telephone and air. That is the thing that binds us together and links us with our neighbouring countries. I would have expected that somewhere from the Government benches there would have come some thought, some vision, of an agreement which would co-ordinate the transport of all our countries, but it is left to my leader to light the way. It is left to my leader to give even an elementary concept such as this to the Government. Imagine if, with the planning of roads and railways lines, we had had a plan for the whole of Southern Africa instead of spider-webs within each country! There would not have been a Tan-Zam railway line, built and run by Chinese communists. This would have been part of the network of Southern Africa communications. Once one has communications linking countries, they are linked by common interests and the sabotage of a railway line in one country affects all the members who are concerned in that transit system. This is the sort of vision we have, a vision looking beyond a piffling little customs agreement. We envisage an agreement that does not only deal with tariff rates on goods, but one that is also aimed at establishing common interests between countries and people.</p>

<p>Once you have a common interest, once you have linked countries together, you will have given them a common security consciousness, a common desire to ensure the protection of the security of the whole region. Common interest is the overriding factor which leads to friendship. We have now&#x2014;which is something we agree with&#x2014; attempts to bring people together, to talk to people so as to bring about peace in Southern Africa. However, the whole motion of my leader is aimed at trying to lift the Government out of the narrow trough in which they seem to be wallowing. Theirs is a question of thinking small. My leader is trying to make them think big, to think beyond the minor things like rail tariffs, to see the bigger vision, the bigger picture. The hon. the Minister of Transport knows what happens when a foreign harbour closes and the effect that this has on the harbours of this country. He knows what happens when a boundary is closed to international traffic, and the effect it has had on the passage of our railways through various countries. However, if we had had a Southern Africa treaty linking the transport needs of all the adjoining countries of this region, we would not experience the closing of boundaries, we would not experience a breakdown in regard to ports because everyone would be linked together working according to a planned and co-ordinated transport system.</p>

<p>We are, however, unable to give the lead in this regard unless we are able to handle our own problems in South Africa. When we have 45 ships lined up outside Durban harbour we cannot say: We are going to give you leadership; we are going to offer gateways to the world.</p>

<p>In this motion of ours the two problems facing the Government have been highlighted. Firstly, there is the lack of vision outwards and secondly, the failure in South Africa to provide the infrastructure upon which that vision can be built. Let us imagine countries that are linked by common interests with a common transport system and let us imagine what this would mean to the hon. the Minister of Defence. If we had access to airfields throughout Southern Africa which were available for <span class="col_255-256" refersTo="page_0143"/>the purpose of common security, we would find this fact of inestimable value. I accept what the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs says, namely, that one does not start with a defence treaty but that it comes at the end of the road of friendship when one has established mutual confidence. But just imagine what the position would be in the sphere of defence if we had a common agreement which removed the need for heavy expenditure in regard to the manpower and material resources required by each individual country. Let us imagine, for instance, that in such an agreement there was a ban on terrorist camps. What a difference this would make to the whole Southern Africa scene. While we admit that we have to move towards these things gradually, the thing that worries us is the lack of foresight. In this field again the most we have had has been the offer of non-aggression pacts. In other words, the vision is limited to a non-aggression pact. What about our communications, the part we could play with Silvermine? We would have a common interest in the security of Southern Africa as a whole and we would have a common effort and a common endeavour in this regard. Then we could have Cactus instead of Sam missiles throughout the region; then we could have the interests of South Africa and of Southern Africa linked in such a way that it would become a bulwark of the West and of civilization. These things, Sir, are all reality; they are all possible. The big problem is that the Government has never thought them possible, and now that it has suddenly awakened to the need to do something to create peace, it finds itself unable to catch up with the era in which it is living, and so it is fiddling; it is thinking small and fiddling with problems instead of thinking big and doing something imaginative about it, and the reason is the constant fear of this Government, the phobia that we have heard over and over in this debate: &#x201C;We are not prepared to share power with Black people in South Africa.&#x201D; The hon. the Deputy Minister talked of a heritage, the heritage that we have received from our forefathers. Surely part of that heritage is South Africa. Surely we inherited a Republic of South Africa, an entity, from our forefathers. Sir, how can you talk of a heritage when you are busy destroying it, when you are busy cutting bonds which should be binding us? Sir, that Government, excluding those to whom I referred, the 35 who support the hon. member for Waterberg &#x2026;</p>

<p>There may be 37, or 38 but after Pietersburg, I am allowing for the fact that there are some who may get cold feet; in fact, they all have cold feet, but apart from that hard core of verkrampte HNPs, the thinking members on that side of the House know in their hearts that they have got to take steps in South Africa, that they have got to do things which they cannot do alone, and they cannot do it because their own party will not let them. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Defence would like to take steps to solve some of our problems; I am sure the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations and Rehoboth Affairs would like to take steps to solve our problems; he would like to take giant strides forward, but he cannot do so because of this fear of the elements in their own party who will not allow them to move fast enough. Sir, I want to forecast that when the break comes in that party, they will have to look to us to help them to save South Africa, because without us, without our concepts, without our idea of decentralisation of power, without our federal policy, which can take the friction out of racial communication and which can create a framework in which peoples of different colour can live together, that Government cannot survive; it is in a &#x201C;doodlooppad&#x201D; <i>(cul de sac),</i> and it has reached the point now where even the Prime Minister admits that he has got to have areas of common administration, where he is going to appoint people of different races to serve on the same board, something that we proposed in respect of universities and all sorts of bodies. That was regarded as heretical, as the end of the world, as the end of White civilization. But now they are going to do it because they have found that we were right all along; and so, Mr. Speaker, on issue after issue they are going to find that we were right all along. They are going to find that there are areas of common interest where one cannot create a foreign State and say that is the end of the problem, because these people, the Coloureds and Indians, will be with us in &#x201C;White&#x201D; South Africa for ever.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with this one thought. At the end of the 30 years of which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration <span class="col_257-258" refersTo="page_0144"/>spoke, there will be some 50 million people in South Africa. He talked as though we have a lifetime to move slowly, step by step, forward, but if the pace is slower than the growth of our population, a solution will never be found because the population will grow faster than the capacity to cater for it. It frightens me when I hear a Minister talking as though time is immaterial, talking of 10 and 20 and 30 years of slowly building up economically independent homelands. After 30 years it will be too late, and in the failure of the policy of this Government will lie the end of the Western standards which the White man has brought to this country. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have always regarded the hon. member for Durban Point as a reasonably absorbing and very interesting speaker, but I am sorry to tell him that his display this afternoon was probably one of his poorest displays in this House. Sir, this afternoon he made me think of the clergyman who wrote in the margin of his manuscript: &#x201C;Shout loud, argument is weak&#x201D;. I want to tell the hon. member that he really had very few arguments. He said that we should not worry about the United Party; they would solve their problems themselves. Sir, we accept that they will solve their problems themselves, but I also want to tell them that they have been struggling for many years now to solve their problems, and if they are not even able to solve the problems of their little party, what chance do they have of ever solving South Africa&#x2019;s problems? Sir, then we also heard here about a survey which the hon. member made. We have been hearing a great deal, these days, about a Pegasus survey, and it was interesting to be able to listen to the Vause Raw survey of the National Party this afternoon. But I want to give the hon. member this assurance: On this side of the House there are only Nationalists, people who stand steadfastly by their party and will follow that party through thick and thin. The hon. member had a very difficult task today. He had to build up an image of the United Party here this afternoon, and in order to build up that image, he again had to resort to the federal policy of his party. Now I want to put this question to the hon. member: If they supposedly have such a good policy, if they supposedly have the answers to the problems of South Africa, why can they not sell their policy? After all, in April last year they had a very good opportunity to sell that policy to the voters. Subsequently we had by-elections, and there are more ahead. After all, this is the opportunity for that party to offer that policy to the voters of South Africa. Now the hon. member states that under their federal policy, each community will preside over its own affairs and will have its own schools. Now I want to ask the hon. member this: If a specific community states that it does not want its own schools, but would prefer to send its children to the other community&#x2019;s schools, what are we going to do then? In other words, you must agree that the policy of the National Party is a policy offering a solution to the problems of South Africa. The hon. member said that his party recognizes the rights of people. But why does he not tell us in what respect we have deprived people of rights? Is it not true, Sir, that this party has given the people of South Africa more opportunities in the quarter century in which it has been in power than they had ever had in all previous years in South Africa? Sir, I am convinced that the United Party has lost contact with the pulse and the heart-beat of South Africa and its people. As a young man I want to tell the United Party that the youth of South Africa is sick and tired of all the problems and internal struggles of the United Party. If the hon. members want to make a contribution in the interests of South Africa, they must solve those problems and behead those who must be beheaded and suspend those who must be suspended. After that the hon. members must come up with positive action in the interests of South Africa. When I ask myself the question whether the United Party is capable of making a contribution in South Africa, there is only one answer, namely no. That is what the voters in South Africa say, too, and that is why they do not trust the United Party and that is why they will never put the Government of this country in the hands of the United Party. The United Party does not have a contribution to make.</p>

<p>Yesterday we heard a master of his trade speaking when the former Minister of Finance made his last speech in the House. It was very clear to us from that speech that the world is plunged into an economic crisis and that there are many countries in the world that are struggling with economic problems. However it is also very clear to us&#x2014;it became clear to us from that speech <span class="col_259-260" refersTo="page_0145"/>&#x2014;that in this very economic crisis, South Africa is coming through, that in this very time it is well established in the economic sphere and compares with the best in the world. Why has South Africa achieved this? We were able to achieve it by effecting measures, economic measures which, possibly, have not always been so popular. If we consider the fuel crisis, we must all acknowledge that some of the measures have often caused one to grumble while driving through the Karoo on a summer&#x2019;s day. On the other hand, however, we also know that those measures were necessary in the interests of South Africa in order to establish South Africa economically.</p>

<p>The world is not only plunged into an economic crisis. I believe that the major problem facing the world is that of relations between people and that of relations between nations. If South Africa can become a leader in the economic sphere, I want to make the statement that in the sphere of relations, too, South Africa can become a leader in the world. I personally have the necessary confidence in South Africa to believe that it can in fact become that. In order to prove this, one only has to go back a little. I should not like to go scratching in the past, but after the Second World War, South Africa was a country which did not reflect a good image abroad. After the war, we in South Africa had virtual chaos in many spheres. I want to make the statement&#x2014;the hon. member for Maitland knows it&#x2014;that if we had continued in that fashion, we in this country would have experienced one disaster after another in the sphere of relations. I do not believe that we would have existed this afternoon as we do in fact exist. Could we have gone on in that way? No! That is why Providence decreed that the National Party come to power in 1948. As a religious person I accept and I shall always defend the viewpoint that it was by dispensation of Providence that this party was entrusted with the government of the country. What has this party done in the quarter century of its rule? Has this Government only acted in a negative way? Has it, as the Opposition maintains, only deprived people of their rights? Do the hon. members not want to be positive too, for a change, do they not want to be grateful, too, for a change? Do they not want to admit that in this quarter century of government in South Africa we have had an ordering, an ordering of people in their areas, an ordering of people to enable them to realize themselves among and together with their own people? Do the hon. members not want to admit and concede that in this quarter century we have achieved orderliness in South Africa and that we have eliminated friction in innumerable spheres? Do the hon. members not want to admit that in this quarter century we have made people aware of their identity? Every people in South Africa is proud of its identity today. Hon. members will not change a Xhosa into a Zulu. He is proud of his identity, and he wants to maintain that identity. I can claim this on behalf of the National Party and the Government: That we have taught people to be proud of their identity. Hon. members will concede, if they want to be honest, that in this quarter century of government the National Party has made people become established, economically and otherwise. What was the situation after the war? In many instances there was poverty, but we do not want to go back to those times. In South Africa today we are faring well economically and we are thriving. In this quarter century we have granted people participation in the political sphere. Hon. members would do well to commission another survey, namely on how many people had the right to cast their vote in the field of politics before 1948 and how many people there are in South Africa today who do not have the franchise and who have no share in the political set-up. I want to concede that there was sacrifice when the National Party with its policy, came to power, sacrifice not only on the part of the non-White, as is always maintained, but sacrifice, too, on the part of the White. I want to concede that there were rightist extremists, and there still are today, who thought that one need only put up a sign board at every entrance saying &#x201C;non-Whites only&#x201D; and &#x201C;Whites only&#x201D; and that one would then have heaven on earth. I want to concede that there are still such people today. I want to concede that there are leftist extremists; we still have some of them in this House today. They are people who move in a liberal direction and who then believe that we in South Africa would have the best possible life. There were people who expected wonders after 1948, but that is not how the National Party went to work. It went to work in an orderly and stable way and what happened? We had the crystallizing out of an orderly, established and economically sound South Africa, a South Africa which can take its place in the world today, a <span class="col_261-262" refersTo="page_0146"/>South Africa that is respected today and a South Africa whose voice is listened to. We managed to get one basic principle established in this time, namely political control over one&#x2019;s own people and not the pre- 1948 confusion, not the chaos which would have continued and worsened, but an orderly South Africa which today can move beyond and over its borders and which can play an important role in all terrains in this world. I should not like to refer to other countries, but there are many countries that have failed as far as the relations question is concerned. There are countries in this world that refuse to face this fact and that are therefore heading for a crisis. South Africa has risen above this. South Africa has risen above all this and will rise further, but then everyone&#x2019;s contribution is necessary now and scoring political points will get us nowhere. It will get us nowhere to try and outwit each other with discrimination, differentiation and all these things. If we want to make South Africa a leader in the field of relations&#x2014;it can become that &#x2014;we must now come up with positive actions and with positive contributions. We must look ahead and work with the future in mind. In this connection there are a few important matters that are necessary and I should like to mention them here. This is how I, as a young man, see South Africa and should like to see the future. The first will be that we shall have to realize that it is possible to exist together in South Africa as different peoples without domination and without interference. One thing must be very clear to us, namely that the White nation will not tolerate interference with its affairs or domination in the political field. In the same way there are the Black peoples in South Africa, too, who will not tolerate this. Now, there are people who want to make it difficult for peoples to coexist in South Africa. I want to refer to the Progressive Party in particular, because I think that their contribution is to make this road to be followed by South Africa, extremely difficult. What they are really doing is trying to cause South Africa to come to grief. What we need in these times is for White, Brown and Black people with the right attitude to come to the fore to further develop the stability, the peace and the order of South Africa and to make it possible for us in this country to live together, and go to meet a happy future, so that we may be an example, to the whole world, of people who have found each other and understand each other, people who have proffered each other the hand of friendship and have accepted it from each other and co-operate and do not dominate or have the wish to interfere.</p>

<p>A second thing is necessary, namely that each national group in this country should work at its own affairs with dedication, and there is a great deal of work to be done. Each people in South Africa has fences it must put up and mend. My people have them. I am not ashamed to say so this afternoon. In addition there is still an enormous amount of work to be done in respect of the White nation. This afternoon I want to refer in particular to our Coloured population, and I do so because I had the privilege of working among these people for eight years, of entering their houses and standing with them. I do this because I have sympathy for those people. There is an enormous amount of upliftment work which must be done. There is a task for every Coloured leader to perform. Each of them has the task of going to his people with a positive message, to take their hand and to say: &#x201C;Let us stand up, let us build ourselves up, let us mend the broken fences in the life of our people.&#x201D; It will be of no avail always to lay the problems of the Coloureds at the door of the Whites and to accuse the Whites and hold them responsible for all the Coloureds&#x2019; problems. I believe that these people are responsible for many of their own problems, just as my people are responsible for my people&#x2019;s problems. That is why each will have to look to its own domestic affairs in this country, and when we do this we will have less time to run around saying irresponsible things. We shall then be able to create a South Africa which will be an example to this world.</p>

<p>There is another thing we must do. We must have mutual respect and esteem for each other. I want to say that I as a White man have great respect for a man with a brown or a black skin. I also expect that same respect and esteem from him. Too many hurtful things are still being said in South Africa by Whites and non-Whites. We derive no benefit from these things that are said and done. They cannot build us up as a country. All of us, whoever we may be, have the task of co-operating to eradicate these things. However, we should not then lay the blame for everything that occurs outside, at the door of the Government, and hold the Government responsible for it. If something occurs to cause friction <span class="col_263-264" refersTo="page_0147"/>between White and non-White we must not run to the Government and say: &#x201C;You are guilty, you are responsible for this. You come along with this legislation and that is why these things occur&#x201D;. We need the co-operation of the general public of South Africa to build up these relationships and to have mutual respect and esteem for each other. I want to mention a very small thing to you. Recently I was standing in a place of business in Oudtshoorn and a non-White offered the White person behind the counter a cup of tea. The White person was an English speaking person, but that is just in passing. That White person did not even say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; for the cup of tea that was offered to him. I mention this minor matter as an example of the things we must eradicate. If we can eradicate them, we shall find each other and we shall be able to live together.</p>

<p>I want to mention yet another matter. Leaders must be positive and must act positively. It will get us nowhere to speak about bloodshed and confrontation because in my opinion it is a leader&#x2019;s task to lead his people to every opportunity created for it and to utilize that opportunity. It is easy to denigrate the National Party and the Government and not tell the public at large what has already been done or tell them about the opportunities that have already been created. It is a great pity that so many opportunities lie unutilized by the wayside. For that reason there is a task for every leader in South Africa to be so minded as to be able to take his people along with him. There are too many leaders who have no followers left and who say things every day which only cause friction.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that things do not occur overnight. It is in the interests of South Africa, its people and its nations that we should adopt a mature approach. It will get us nowhere to say, as the hon. members on that side of the House do, that we must remove this and that and that we must open this door and that, because this will only cause us great distress. This side of the House, this Government, this party will continue in a mature way to do things in South Africa in such a fashion as to take its people with it and it will act in such a way as to be able to take the whole of South Africa, Black, White and Brown, with it. We have a message we must disseminate abroad. If we love South Africa, if we love our country we must all disseminate the message abroad and we must all exert ourselves to bind people together and to have them live together.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that South Africa could provide a powerful illustration of sound relations, but then we must not try to outwit each other politically. We must realize that it will be the deliberations in this House that will be decisive and that it is here that the matter of our survival will be settled. May all of us, White, Brown and Black, have the courage to do what must be done and to live and act in such a way as to promote South Africa&#x2019;s name and cause its image to shine out into the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Oudtshoorn expressed sentiments towards the end of his speech with which, I think, every one of us in this House will agree, but at the beginning of his speech he made a series of contentious and totally unfounded assertions. The suggestion which I think caps everything is the one that South Africa&#x2019;s international image in 1948 was not a good one. Where was the hon. member at that time? He says he was still a young man at that time, but I do not believe he could have been that young. It is a well-known fact that, in 1948, South Africa was a respected country in the world comity. Take, for example, the number of State visits paid by Prime Ministers to other countries during the sixties and at the beginning of the seventies.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to answer a question now. Except for the visits to Africa which, as we have been told, took place in secrecy, the hon. the Prime Minister suddenly disappeared from South Africa two or three years ago to show his face in Portugal and Switzerland. Surely, the hon. member knows only too well that, in 1948, South Africa&#x2019;s international image was a good <span class="col_265-266" refersTo="page_0148"/>one. The hon. member asked with some surprise which rights had been taken away, especially in the case of the Coloured people whom he knows well. Is he not aware of the fact that all this Government has been doing for a number of years was to take away the rights of people and that the Coloured people, for example, suffered most on account of that? What happened to their original franchise, their right of representation in this House, the right of their students to attend certain universities and the right of the universities to admit them? They also had certain rights on municipal level, but all those rights have been taken away. Let us consider the other population groups. In 1948 there were a great many settled Bantu who were exempt from the pass laws. There were about 40 000 or 50 000 such Bantu. Are those not rights which have been taken away by this Government? [Interjections.] Yes, they said that the Indians would be repatriated, but they did not do so after all; therefore I do not know whether it is a right that has been taken away from them. Let us say that the right of the Indians to be repatriated free of charge was taken away, for this is the way the hon. member wants to argue.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I believe that all members of this House with the single exception, perhaps, of the hon. the Minister of Information, accept the fact that, for the sake of peace and security, many changes must come about in South Africa. The fact that changes must come is something that need not be debated. What concerns me and what I would like to know is whether the White people, our people, are sufficiently motivated and prepared to assist whichever Government is in power to bring about those changes. Naturally, the Government is placed in the best situation to bring about changes and to prepare and motivate people to accept those changes. This particular Government has been in power for a period of a quarter of a century. Why I do not hesitate to support the motion of no-confidence is that, instead of using its long period of being in office to prepare the people for the situation in which we find ourselves, the Government has gone out of its way to create a false sense of security in the minds of the White people of South Africa. The Government has been hampered by its policy and political philosophy which&#x2014;I want to state it again here&#x2014;is of course based on prejudice and discrimination. As a result of this, this attitude, an antipathy towards change has been built up amongst the Whites in South Africa. I see that the hon. member for Vereeniging is back in the House. He spoke a lot about differentiation and discrimination. Let me just mention a matter such as job reservation. Has that got anything to do with the maintenance of the identity of the White man?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it has.</p>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course not, Sir; it is just blatant discrimination; and this is a cornerstone, let us say, of National Party policy. All of a sudden the Government is forced to bring about changes. I immediately concede that it has brought about certain changes and perhaps is in the process of making others, but what concerns me is that in bringing about those changes, it fails miserably to use opportunity to break down the deep-seated prejudice which exists in the minds of so many of its supporters. The Government is always busy finding excuses for bringing about changes and adjustments. People are inevitably told that outside circumstances are in fact forcing the Government to do so. It is true that the majority of the White people accept this. They look upon the changes as being concessions.</p>

<p>Unwittingly they regard the changes which are being made as sacrifices that the White people have made. It is as a result of this that there has developed an attitude which I can only describe as a false sense of security amongst our people. Such an attitude also results in changes being made rather reluctantly and with no definite will to expedite matters or, in fact, to make them worthwhile.</p>

<p>The Government must also accept responsibility for another attitude which it has cultivated in the minds of the people of South Africa, an attitude which I believe is very dangerous in the climate in which we find ourselves today. That is that when changes are being made many of the White people adopt a paternalistic attitude towards those changes. Their approach is paternalistic. With the prevailing attitude among the non-White groups in South Africa being what it is, I believe that there is no room left for this paternalistic attitude. Even where the Government is engaged in perfecting changes which are in accordance with the philosophies of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s own policy, it is guilty of this approach. When the late Dr. Verwoerd <span class="col_267-268" refersTo="page_0149"/>announced his vision of independent Bantustans, he adopted very much the same attitude. Hon. members may remember that at the time he in fact made great play of it. He said it was not something that he would have liked to see but something that had been forced upon us. I believe that from that very moment the Bantustan project or experiment, call it what you like, became, rather a reluctant, experiment or project of the exponents and supporters of that particular policy.</p>

<p>I want to mention something else which I believe is closely related to the success of the Government&#x2019;s own policy. I am referring to the question of the acquisition of land. In terms of its own declared policy in regard to the acquisition of land, adequate and sufficient land is a vital prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Government&#x2019;s policy. Instead of giving their own supporters a proper lead and motivating them in favour of the proper and valid reasons for the acquisition or purchase of land, viz. that it is right that the Government purchase land for the Africans in order to establish these Bantustans, we have witnessed something else. A rather futile attempt is being made to put the blame on somebody else. Great stress is always placed on the fact that all that the Government in fact is doing is fulfilling the 1936 land settlement agreement. In other words, they are not motivating the people in respect of their own policy. It is somebody else&#x2019;s.</p>

<p>May I put a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pyper">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am sorry, I am busy at the moment.</p>

<p>We have heard from Nationalist commentators that it is wrong to draw an analogy between what is happening in Rhodesia at the present moment and the position in South Africa. The most common explanation is that in as far as it is true that South Africa is, let us say, twisting Rhodesia&#x2019;s arm, it is only doing so or prodding it along in order to make Rhodesia face up to the consequence, the logical consequence, of its own policy which is, if we are to believe that Afrikaans Press, the handing over of power to a Black majority. If we are to believe the Prime Minister of Rhodesia, the logical consequence of its policy is, of course, civilized rule. I do not want to deal with that matter. The fact remains, however, that we are being told that in as far as South Africa is making an effort in this regard, it is doing so in order to make Rhodesia accept the logical consequences of its policy. If that argument is correct, then surely the time has come for this Nationalist Government also to accept the logical consequences of its policy, a policy which we know is one of geographical separation. If this policy of geographical separation is to be a success the Government must within the shortest possible time establish separate states which are large enough to give the inhabitants of those states a chance to become viable and independent. As far as the position of land is concerned, it must at this stage be known to the Government that the 1936 land settlement agreement is inadequate for this purpose. When will the Government start giving a lead to its own people in this regard? If it is going to exceed the 1936 quota, if it is its intention to exceed that quota&#x2014;I believe it has no option but to do so in order to accommodate the logical consequences of its policy&#x2014;then the time has come for the Government to come out into the open and give a definite lead to its supporters in this regard because there are changes that must take place in the attitude even of its own followers in order to make its policy successful. It is also quite clear to me that the Government has failed to prepare and to motivate its own supporters sufficiently to make a success of its policy. But this is only part of the story. The majority of changes that must come will be changes which are really contrary to the basic policies of the Government and contrary to basic Nationalist Party philosophy. Judging from its past performance, the Government is prepared to do so from time to time. Unfortunately the Government never reaps the full benefit of these changes because of its obsession in pretending that these changes or adjustments are not really changes but that they form part of its own policy and philosophy. One invariably finds that precious time is wasted &#x2014;and we cannot afford to lose that precious time&#x2014;while the Government racks its brains to find out how to camouflage these changes to its own supporters. Invariably it falls back on the old formula of creating the illusion that these are not really changes but rather exceptions which are then regarded as concessions which of course are then looked upon as sacrifices made by the Whites. What is so wrong with the Government, with hon. members <span class="col_269-270" refersTo="page_0150"/>opposite, is that they do not do enough to cultivate the right attitude in the minds of their own supporters. I believe that the attitude which they should adopt in the first place is that these are changes which are brought about because they are fair, right and just and, secondly, that not to do so would be gross discrimination.</p>

<p>In the field of sport the Government has been engaged for a few years in gradually implementing some of the aspects of United Party policy, and we are grateful for that; I am not going to attack them about that. But once again it unfortunately neglects to give the people a proper lead. It fails to motivate them to bring about changes for the right reasons.</p>

<p>About three years ago the hon. the Prime Minister announced the Government&#x2019;s sports policy. He very ably read out his statement here in this House although in fact it had been drafted by the Broederbond &#x2014;but that is purely incidental&#x2014;after they had had a look at our policy. But instead of using the opportunity at that time, instead of using his considerable influence and telling his supporters that the changes were being made because the Government was convinced that it was right and just to give all sportsmen of South Africa, irrespective of their colour and race, the opportunity to represent the country of their birth, purely as an acknowledgment of the inherent right of a person to represent on merit the country of his birth at international level, the Prime Minister made it quite clear that South Africa was acting only in terms of the conditions laid down by world governing bodies such as those controlling the Olympic Games and the Davis Cup and the Federation Cup. Here again the attitude was that this was not something that we would like to see, but that this was something which had been forced on us by some outside force. The tragedy of this approach and this attitude is that it opens up the way for further pressure. The moment you concede that outside forces are forcing you to change, then of course more pressure is put on you in the hope that more changes will come. But what is most important is that the White people look upon these changes as concessions instead of accepting that they are just doing their duty by removing discrimination in a particular field, however small that field may be.</p>

<p>In the field of labour many changes and adjustments have been made lately and over the years. Unfortunately again the same attitude and approach is evident When job reservation is relaxed and adjustments in certain categories of labour are made&#x2014;we had in the building industry quite a number of changes being made recently, where Blacks were allowed to do jobs previously done by Whites&#x2014;the Government fails to motivate its own supporters and the people of South Africa correctly. The most famous excuse is always that they have opened up this job or this category of work because there are no Whites to do it. What are the consequences of this in so far as the non-Whites are concerned? They surely must look upon it in this way: &#x201C;If this is our only avenue of advancement, when there are no Whites to do a particular job, it will be far better for us not to have any Whites.&#x201D; It is true that in certain fields there are not enough Whites to do the work, but surely our attitude should not be that their advancement is subject to the condition that they can only advance and do certain jobs because there are not enough Whites to do it. I believe that the attitude which the Government must adopt, if they are serious in bringing about successful change in South Africa, is that they have opened up certain jobs in the field of labour not because they have been forced to do so but because they have recognized that it is right and just to eliminate discrimination. If the Government is prepared to adopt that sort of attitude towards its own people, it will in fact be giving a certain lead to them.</p>

<p>We recently had the case of the Nico Malan theatre. When it was opened last week we heard from some Nationalist commentators and politicians about the &#x201C;vergunning aan Kleurlinge&#x201D;. The opening up of the Nico Malan theatre to other race groups was not a &#x201C;vergunning&#x201D;; it was not a favour. This is not a sacrifice. What was done was that the Nationalist Party, at the level of the provinces, was merely rectifying a gross injustice. How can we have confidence in a Government which has demonstrated that even when it is bringing about changes, and when you can get it so far as to bring about changes which require the undivided support of all the White people in South Africa, it fails to derive the full benefit for South Africa, whether these changes are being made in accordance with its policy or contrary to its policy? But whether hon. members agree with this or not, whether they want to agree with it or not, the fact remains that <span class="col_271-272" refersTo="page_0151"/>the Government in future will be increasingly forced to bring about changes which are in line with the basic policy and the philosophy of the United Party. Although it is true that as an Opposition we do not command the support of the majority of the Whites&#x2014;and I say this to show how relevant we are&#x2014;we as a party have cultivated through the years in the minds of our supporters certain attitudes and we have adopted certain approaches which I believe will make change in South Africa less painful. This has been our great contribution over the last 26 years during which we have been in opposition. We have done that by preparing our people and inculcating in them different attitudes which will in fact assist in bringing about the changes which we so desperately need. Let us consider some of the concepts on which we have spent time.</p>

<p>First of all, we have the concept of the sharing of power and responsibility. These are concepts which go together; you cannot have the one without the other. Above all, these are concepts which are based on a deep conviction that all of us, irrespective of colour and race, share a common fatherland and a common destiny. Now let us leave for the moment the Bantustans on one side and let us look at this concept of a common fatherland and a common destiny. That concept will at all times be valid in respect of the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the permanent urban African population. If need be, and for the sake of argument, I am even prepared to exclude, among the urban Africans, the genuine migrant labourer who comes from the homelands. If we accept the concept of a common fatherland for those four groups of people with a common destiny, our assumption will of course be valid. It is valid in our policy and it has also been valid in the policy of the Nationalist Party. Because we have adopted this approach, because we have spent all our time in getting our people to accept that we have a common fatherland and a common destiny, we have motivated and prepared our supporters on these lines and they are therefore better equipped to bring about the essential changes which must come in order to remove discrimination. I just want to mention one fact. This whole argument about freehold title to the urban African and the right of the urban African to an undisturbed family life, reveals discrimination which cannot be justified under any circumstances. Once one has a people who can accept, as our supporters do, that we have a common fatherland and a common destiny, then there is no difficulty in putting that policy into practice. However, because the Government has inculcated different attitudes, it is in this difficulty.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the concept that the wealth and the riches of South Africa do not belong to any particular group. As far as our party is concerned we accept that South Africa has been brought economically to its present position as a result of the mutual efforts of all the various race groups in South Africa. All the peoples in South Africa have made a contribution, no matter how small, to building up the country to its present position. Therefore, I believe that any attempt to trick one group or other into forfeiting its legitimate share of the wealth and prosperity of South Africa will be an unforgivable sin. Our philosophy is, in fact, free of restrictions, and this means that we do not have to waste time on uneconomic projects. We and our people are better equipped to build up South Africa economically in order to provide a better living for all of us, so that we can take our place as the unrivalled economic leader in Capricorn Africa, as my hon. leader called it.</p>

<p>In the last instance I want to come to the most important concept of all. Although hon. members opposite are not even prepared to accept the word in their political vocabulary, the concept I want to deal with is that of &#x201C;federalism&#x201D;. We have definite evidence that this concept is increasingly being accepted by the non-White race groups in South Africa. If we want peace and security in South Africa we must say farewell to the unitary system of government which has served us well over the years when, in the minds of the Whites, only the White communities really mattered. However, the most meaningful change which can be made will be a constitutional change, and it will have to be in a federal direction. We in the United Party have come to grips with that reality, but I am afraid that it is on this particular issue, on account of its policy and philosophy, that the Nationalist Party is completely out of court. The United Party with its policy and philosophy is not running the danger of becoming redundant and irrelevant in South Africa. It is the basic political philosophy of the Nationalist Party that is running that particular risk. It is <span class="col_273-274" refersTo="page_0152"/>only through the adoption of a federal constitution that South Africa can find a proper solution to the most pressing problems in our pluralistic society. What is the most pressing problem? I believe it is the real security and protection of minorities. Closely related to this is the execution of the principle that there should be no domination of one group by another in matters concerning the other group only. These are concepts which we are trying to sell to the people of South Africa and in which we are trying to educate our supporters. These are concepts which will be of worth to South Africa when we eventually have to face up to the real challenge.</p>

<p>Finally, the Government can experiment, if it so wishes, with Cabinet committees for the Coloureds and the Indians and to link those race groups to the Cabinet of this Parliament, but the fact remains that when it comes to Indians and to Coloureds they will never be accommodated within the concept of multi-national States. In the end South Africa will have to have a multiracial federal assembly where the representation of the people will be not on the basis of race or colour, but upon another objective criterion. Whether this is to be done by us as a party or whether it is to be done by the Nationalist Party, historians will still record that we in the United Party, although we were in the Opposition, we in fact cultivated the right attitudes and provided the right type of leadership to our own supporters and set the right example for change in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened very attentively to the speech made by the hon. member for Durban Central and now I just want to ask him whether he remained neutral last night or whether he voted for or against Dick. I shall come back to the hon. member, but in the light of the motion proposed by the hon. Leader of the Opposition, I want to suggest and ask whether he would not make a few minor changes. I thought it would be a good thing if we changed the motion as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House, while sincerely commending the objects of achieving détente in the United Party, has no confidence in the United Party, <i>inter alia,</i> because of the failure of the leadership of the United Party to appreciate adequately that it is in the interests of mutual understanding, peace in the party and security of the Leader&#x2019;s position to, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></block>

<ol>

<li>(a) encourage regional and provincial leadership initiatives with the object of achieving agreements between the provincial leaders in respect of&#x2014;

<li>(i) migrant labour by one provincial leader in another province without a visa at Mahlabatini, cf. Yeoville v. Zululand;</li>

<li>(ii) the protection of the rights of minorities through a convention of membership rights, cf. Grow and Growths v. Hickman, Wiley and Streicher;</li>

<li>(iii) improved communication between provincial leaders, cf. Schwarz v. Cadman;</li>

<li>(iv) defence of existing leaders, of the Transvaal Rural Council Kobus Davel v. Schwarz;</li>

<li>(v) mutual political, financial and propaganda aid and support, cf. Harry and the Young Turks v. Jakes;</li>

<li>(vi) the use of the energy resources of the region, cf. Japie and the <i>Sunday Times;</i></li>

<li>(vii) strategic scheming, cf. Dick, Harry and Japie v. Jakes, Div and Myburgh;</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>To my mind section (b) of the motion should read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To achieve a rapid and honourable settlement of the Enthoven &#x2019;t Hooft opinion poll based on the wishes of all the United Party caucus members after effective consultation and ignoring of the facts; and</block>

<p>(c) to strengthen Sir Div&#x2019;s own position more particularly in the field of concessions to Harry and the Young Turks, by&#x2014;</p>

<li>(iii) taking more effective steps to combat with military precision the crippling effect of internal quarrels, discord, viciousness, subversion, out-witting, doubletalk, lack of policy, lack of leadership and mutual hatred.</li>

</ol>

<p>With reference to the point raised by the hon. member for Durban Central about the purchase of land in terms of the 1936 Act, I now want to ask the hon. member a question across the floor of the House. The hon. member says that too little land is being allocated in terms of the 1936 Act. He said we should buy more land. Will that hon. member tell me how much more land we should buy, and where?</p>

<p>That hon. member will never answer my question. I shall tell you what they are doing, Mr. Speaker. At our meetings in the rural areas they and the H.N.P. out-do one another down in shouting that the National Party is giving South Africa away. There they put their arms round one another&#x2019;s shoulders and try to be more verkramp than the members of the H.N.P. This is what that party sitting over there is doing. In the rural areas they make ultra right-wing statements and accuse us, the National Party, of being integrationists.</p>

<p>The hon. member said the National Party should change its policy. That hon. member and that party are the last people to talk of change. They do not have sufficient strength themselves to be able to change. This is their problem: They cannot adapt themselves; they are completely sterile and senile politically. It is not I who says this; it is the Transvaal leader of the United Party who says this. It is stated here: &#x201C;Schwarz&#x2019;s warning to the United Party: Change or Fail&#x201D;. Because that party does not have the ability to adapt itself, they are completely irrelevant in respect of the political situation in South Africa today. They are no longer playing any role whatsoever. On the contrary. This internal quarrel and fight has reached such proportions now that they have even lost their publicity value in the present political setup here in South Africa. Allow me to quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Harry Schwarz, Transvaal leader of the United Party, this week bluntly told his party that it was in danger of becoming irrelevant in South African politics unless certain steps were taken.</block>

<p>That party does not have the inner strength to be able to bring about changes. The meaningful changes which have taken place in South Africa since 1910, took place under the leadership of the National Party, and all meaningful changes which will take place in future will take place under the leadership of the National Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we came here to Parliament on Monday, each of us came with a document in our hands. I, too, had one in my hand. In the light of the events we are experiencing, one asks oneself what the public at large thinks of the Prime Minister and the Government. What is the image of the Government in the eye of the public at large? I think that if one is to call in an umpire, one could perhaps call in one&#x2019;s enemies to tell one what the image of the Government is. I think that a very good enemy of the Government is the <i>Sunday Times,</i> to be specific Mr. Stanley Uys. I decided to call him in as umpire and to see what he says about the Government and the Opposition. I then read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 2 February&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Vorster turned up at the opening of Parliament on Friday looking well pleased with himself. And so he might be&#x2014;when a Progressive Party M.P. calls him a &#x201C;statesman&#x201D;, and when the Institute for the Study of Conflict adds the further accolade of nominating him as &#x201C;the leading statesman of Africa&#x201D;, then, indeed his star is in the ascendant &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">For a political party that has been in office for 27 years to have its leader acclaimed in such glowing terms is a remarkable achievement. It is enough to make the parliamentary opposition wonder where they fit in.</block>

<p>And then the columnist asks the further question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where does it fit in?</block>

<p>And then he replies&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are we all going to end up wearing &#x201C;I like John&#x201D; badges on our lapels?</block>

<p>After all, this is not a secret: surely we know that many of the members on the other side of the House have already bought themselves those &#x201C;I like John&#x201D; badges, but as yet they are only wearing them at home. They are still too ashamed to wear them here. After all, we know from private conversations that there are many members who wear such buttons. I do not say that the hon. member for Simonstown wears such a button, but who am I, now, to tell him that he does not wear it. I shall not express an opinion on the hon. member for Yeoville. In these times in which the Leader of the National Party, our hon. Prime Minister, is described by a body like the Institute for the Study of Conflict&#x2014;a body which does enjoy status&#x2014;as the &#x201C;leading statesman of Africa&#x201D;, we get a motion of no confidence in the Government from the Opposition!</p>

<p>When last, or when ever has the Prime Minister of South Africa been built up in such glowing terms by the world Press and throughout the world? But the Opposition in South Africa comes along and introduces a motion of no confidence in that internationally recognized leader of ours! Surely, that is too crazy for words.</p>

<p>While I am discussing that party, I should like to return to the Randburg incident, or the Enthoven &#x2019;t Hooft incident, or, as I understand it after last night, the &#x201C;Enthoven onthooft&#x201D; incident, to see what the situation is in that party. I come back to this matter which was touched on by my colleague, the hon. member for Pretoria Central, and the hon. Minister for Information, <span class="col_279-280" refersTo="page_0155"/>because it is relevant to raise it again, new facts having again brought to light yesterday concerning the affair. Yesterday the hon. member for Yeoville was asked, in his capacity as leader&#x2014;one does not know for how long&#x2014;what he was going to do about the case of Randburg. Was he going to kick him out of the United Party? Was he going to follow the lead of his caucus here or was he not going to follow it? The hon. member was clearly &#x201C;zipped&#x201D; at that stage because he did not want to reply to us. Since we adjourned yesterday, further facts have come to light. No one had really known exactly why the hon. member for Randburg had been suspended. Now I cannot provide the reasons, but I quote the chairman of the caucus of the United Party, viz. the hon. member for Griqualand East, who is known as one of the verkrampte members of the Old Guard of the party. That hon. member made a statement to <i>The Argus</i> on behalf of the caucus&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Enthoven admitted initiating a public opinion poll which contained questions relating, <i>inter alia,</i> to the party&#x2019;s national and provincial leadership.</block>

<p>Then he said a little more, but here is the real <i>coup de grace&#x2014;</i></p>

<p>The caucus considered his conduct which was deliberate &#x2026;</p>

<p>In other words, &#x201C;doelbewus&#x201D; (deliberate)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And to have been disloyal both to his colleagues and the leader of the Party and decided, therefore, that it was incompatible with continued membership of the caucus.</block>

<p>This member is accused of serious things, in political language. He was &#x201C;deliberately disloyal&#x201D; to his colleagues and still worse, to his leader. And if I read <i>The Argus</i> correctly here, he also refused to apologize after an opportunity to do so had been granted him. Apparently he was fairly impudent to the caucus and said that he would not apologize.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is quite correct&#x2014;he was probably only honest, or trying to be honest in the United Party. The hon. member for Randburg intentionally made himself guilty of casting suspicion on, subverting and undermining the Leader of the Opposition, his colleagues and the position of his party in the eyes of the public, with military precision. The worst of all is that the hon. member for Randburg apparently then admitted to the caucus that he had initiated the opinion survey, according to <i>The Argus.</i> I do not want to put words he did not use into the hon. member&#x2019;s mouth. But, Sir, the worst of all is this: after having been deliberately disloyal towards his leader and his colleagues, he refused to apologize. Mr. Speaker, what did the hon. member do? He challenged the caucus, the hierarchy, the leader of the United Party; he coldbloodedly challenged them; that is what the hon. member for Randburg did.</p>

<p>Sir, I now come to the new facts. Yesterday, when the hon. member for Yeoville was asked, &#x201C;Are you going to follow, in the Transvaal, the leadership of your caucus here in the Cape as leader of the United Party in the Transvaal?&#x201D;, he was unwilling to reply. Surely it is customary for hon. members to ask each other reasonable questions across the floor of the House to which one can provide a prompt reply. After all, the question to the hon. member was not a trick question; he was asked: &#x201C;Do you stand by the leadership of your caucus or not?&#x201D; That was the question to which the hon. member for Yeoville had to reply, but the hon. member was not prepared to take Parliament into his confidence. But what I find shocking, Mr. Speaker, is that at that stage when the hon. member for Yeoville was unwilling to reply to fair questions across the floor of the House, he had already issued a statement and a reply to <i>The Argus,</i> which was then virtually on the street. Sir, that hon. member did not want to reply to the question here in Parliament. I do not know why, but I suspect that the hon. member was afraid that if he were to say here what he said to <i>The Argus,</i> there would have been a reaction from the hon. member for Wynberg, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and the hon. member for Albany. What then, Sir, did the hon. member for Yeoville say in connection with the Randburg incident? After his caucus had found a man guilty of deliberate undermining, he said the following, as reported in yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Argus&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_281-282" refersTo="page_0156"/>Mr. Harry Schwarz, the Transvaal leader of the United Party said that Mr. Enthoven was still a member of the party and he hoped he would remain so.</block>

<p>He said: &#x201C;He hoped he would remain so.&#x201D; [Interjection.] There the hon. member confirms that he said so; there is therefore no dispute. Sir, there was another statement in <i>The Argus</i> and that was the statement by the hon. member for Bryanston&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Horace van Rensburg, M.P. for Bryanston and one of the party&#x2019;s young reformists, said today, &#x201C;I deeply regret Mr. Enthoven&#x2019;s expulsion from the United Party caucus. Mr. Enthoven remains a member of the United Party and in this capacity I will continue to give him my support.</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member for Bryanston said. Sir, to me the conduct of those two members of the caucus of the United Party is absolutely unheard-of. Surely it is accepted that the caucuses of parliaments and of parties throughout the free world work as follows: A caucus discusses a matter and if it is unable to agree, it votes on that matter, and then the minority must abide by the decision of the caucus majority and when one leaves that caucus, whether one likes the decision or not, one defends the decision of the majority. Mr. Speaker, it is a matter of honour; if one has lost in a caucus vote and one leaves the caucus, one defends the decision of the caucus majority. If one is not prepared to do that, then, as a man of honour, there is only one course of action open to one; then one must leave that caucus. One does not remain in that caucus and then go and make statements to the newspapers which one does not even want to make in Parliament; one does not go and tell the newspapers that one is going to retain that suspended member in one&#x2019;s party. Sir, that is absolutely disloyal; it is unheard-of.</p>

Sir, surely that is absolutely unheard-of. One does not allow such things in politics; one cannot allow them because what becomes then of one&#x2019;s party discipline? Sir, I want to tell you what happened. There is a deep-lying struggle, a fight to the death in the United Party; they have each other by the throat.

<p>Sir, I want to tell you that the hon. member for Yeoville cannot accept defeat; he cannot lose. After all, I have known him for many years. We were together in the Provincial Council. When the hon. member loses, then he gets angry, and he could not accept the defeat his little friend suffered in the caucus; that is why he is standing by him. That is what this implies. Since the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and the <i>Sunday Times</i> decided to build him up, he has been a winning horse. He has overtaken everything in his way. He stampeded Mr. Oberholzer, the leader in the Provincial Council, out of his way; then he stampeded the former Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal out of his way and from there on he simply kept on running and kept on winning and he ran right into this House. His image has always been that of a winning horse; he was a winning horse. It was said of him: &#x201C;Nothing succeeds like success.&#x201D; The hon. member for Yeoville, who is a winning horse, has now come a cropper for the first time, here in Cape Town.</p>

<p>Sir, yesterday I heard the interjection here that his skin is already hanging behind the door of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. One does not know what else is going to happen, but, Sir, what do these events imply? The Young Turks in the United Party, because they are not prepared to follow the leadership of their party, because they are not prepared to dissociate themselves from the hon. member for Randburg, are guilty of the most extreme form of disloyalty towards their leader and towards their party. As decent United Party supporters it behoves them to stand by their leader and their caucus and not to take the part of a man who has been accused of deliberate disloyalty towards his leader and his party and his colleagues. Sir, I now want to put this straight question to the hon. member for Yeoville: Is the hon. member for Randburg going to remain a member of the United Party of the Transvaal? I do not know whether the hon. member has already made his statement to the newspapers as was the case yesterday, but I want to ask him directly whether the hon. member for Randburg is going to remain a member of the chief central committee of the United Party in the Transvaal? He must reply to this. Does he want to deny that there is polarization in the United Party caucus between Young Turks and Old Guard supporters? I ask the hon. member for Yeoville to reply to this. But I also want to put a question to the hon. member for Albany: Does he approve of this action on the part of the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal, of his standing by a suspended member of the U.P. caucus, and is he going to take action against the hon. member for Yeoville and against the hon. member for Bryanston? Since the hon. member for Bryanston is now in the House. I want to ask him whether he is reconsidering his position in the U.P.</p>

This struggle between Young Turk and Old Guard has now reached the point at which that bomb is going to explode and I tell you now, Sir, that there are members on that side of the House who are going to leave because they are disloyal towards their caucus, towards their leader and towards their party.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#enthoven">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members are aware that I have had a spot of bother with my caucus. I do not want to go into details as regards the infighting within the United Party because it does not concern other people. Hon. members will probably recall that about this time last year, in January, the hon. member for Yeoville also had a spot of bother with his caucus. I have thought much about these two incidents and I am sure that the House would be interested to know what my conclusion is. My conclusion is that it is something about the stars in January which just does not favour reform. That is all I wish to say.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, addressing the House from the cross-benches has certain advantages. One has a certain amount of freedom <span class="col_285-286" refersTo="page_0158"/>from restraint, when one talks from these benches that one does not have from the benches of a political party. One can perhaps be a bit more objective than one can be if one talks as a member of a political party, and I intend using that freedom today in talking to the motion before the House.</p>

<p>I think to any of us who have listened to this debate during its course so far it is quite clear than when one forgets all the party political ballyhoo across the floor of this House, there is in fact quite a sincere and meaningful consensus amongst all the members of the House and amongst the political parties represented here. It is a consensus which is meaningful as to how we, the Whites in South Africa, should face the future. I think I should like to mention a few of the points which have struck me as being very important.</p>

<p>The first is that there is no political party and no member of this House who does not welcome the changes which are taking place in Southern Africa and who does not regard them as necessary changes, changes which in the long run are going to work towards a more stable southern continent. Secondly, I think, we all accept that more changes are going to come in the future and that these changes will also be necessary. I think, thirdly, that we accept that there is a method which has been worked out in this part of the world as to how these changes should come about. It is on the model of consultations where the various leaders who are involved in a certain problem get around a table together and talk about solving problems without any interference from any outside source, so that they can sit there and come to decisions which are in the best interest of their own people. I think this model has been established in Southern Africa, it has been very successful up to now and I think it is going to be successful also in future. I also think that we have reached a consensus that in regard to the new dispensation which has come to this part of the world, there will be no room for discrimination on the lines of race. I think this has been accepted by everybody in this House. I think we have also accepted that under the new dispensation there has to be equality of opportunity for all and I think that we all in this House accepts that we have to work for a free enterprise community in this southern part of Africa. I think if one analyses it this is a very meaningful consensus and a very encouraging thing for South Africa to know that the parties represented in this Parliament are agreed on such basic principles as these with which to face the future. But there are stumbling blocks, Mr. Speaker, which make it perhaps difficult for us to act on this consensus with the determination and the forcefulness which we would like to apply to it. I think that to explain some of these stumbling blocks, to my mind perhaps the most serious stumbling blocks, one has to look at the various paths by which we have come to this consensus at this particular moment in time. We have come by different political paths and different political parties and although these political parties at times in the past took decisions which perhaps at the time seemed right, the result of those decisions and the inheritance we have from those political decisions are serious stumbling blocks to our advancement in the future. I should like to take two examples, one in regard to the Nationalist Party and one in regard to the United Party.</p>

<p>In the case of the Nationalist Party the party built up a complete edifice of legislation to enforce separation in South Africa. It indoctrinated its people through its propaganda machine. It told its people: &#x201C;If you tamper with this legislation in the slightest you will find yourselves on a slippery slope which will result in integration and the end of White identity in South Africa.&#x201D; This was believed by the people and when the hon. the Prime Minister and the Government felt that it was in fact necessary to get rid of some of this legislation or to adjust some of it they immediately ran up against what I call the political inheritance of an earlier era. They ran up against people who genuinely and sincerely believed that if you tampered with this legislation it would mean the end of the White man&#x2019;s survival in South Africa. Quite clearly, when we sit in this position and we look at the consensus which we have for the future, this still remains a problem for the Nationalist Party. It is a problem which the United Party are not slow to exploit. I refer to the fact that the Nationalist Party has built up this process of discrimination.</p>

<p>When we look at the United Party, we find that the United Party has not been blameless in this sort of thing either. It has also made very serious mistakes. I think, when I look back, that the most serious mistake which the United Party made was when the late Dr. Verwoerd <span class="col_287-288" refersTo="page_0159"/>came to this House with a policy of independent homelands. The United Party then took the line that independent homelands would be a threat to the security of the White man in South Africa. Their propaganda machine told their people that if you had independent homelands they would become platforms of Communism and havens for terrorism and that they would house all sorts of anti-White forces. The United Party, to combat this threat which was presented by Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s policy, introduced a slogan to describe their policy. The slogan was &#x201C;White leadership over an undivided South Africa for the foreseeable future&#x201D;. The effect of this was to instill amongst United Party supporters the idea that unless one had the security of White leadership the future of the White man was not secure. It sowed tremendous distrust amongst the White people against Black people, and especially against Black people who had control over their own destinies. It sowed distrust, obviously, amongst the Black people as to the motives of the White people. In hindsight, I do not think there are many of us who look back on that and can say that, as we sit here today, we can benefit from those decisions which were taken then.</p>

<p>We find ourselves in the situation that the United Party has now changed its stand radically from the stand which it adopted in those days. The policy of the United Party is now shared power. I think it goes without saying that shared power is not reconcilable with White leadership. They are two distinctly different ideas. But, in the same way as the Nationalist Party had the problem I discussed earlier, so also the United Party had the problem that it had indoctrinated its people for so many years to believe that White leadership was their security, that when it came to amending the programme of principles of the party, it was felt that you could not drop White leadership. So what the Party did was that it in fact altered the definition of White leadership to make it absolutely clear that White leadership did not mean baasskap, did not mean domination, but in fact meant the proper use of the evolutionary process and the constitutional process which we have. We have the situation in the United Party today where our policy is that we believe in using the constitutional evolutionary process to bring about a situation of shared power in South Africa through consultation. But unfortunately the policy of the United Party can also be interpreted as being one of White leadership until such time as the White electorate decide they want shared power, in which case the machinery will be there to bring about shared power. It is this kind of problem, this dichotomy of thought, which is a stumbling block to the United Pary in going forward as fearlessly and as determinedly as we would like to see it on this consensus which I have discussed earlier.</p>

<p>I think there is also one further aspect which applies both to the Nationalist Party and to the United Party. It is also something we have inherited from the past in the same way as the other two examples which I have shown. I think it is perhaps one of the greatest tragedies of White politics that because we both have a dilemma in respect of a certain issue it is never properly debated across the floor of this House. In this regard I want to refer to the fact that both the main parties as we are today have built into them a protection of White privilege at the cost of Black opportunity. Let me explain it in this way: In the policy of separate development a certain situation has arisen in respect of the consolidation of the homelands. According to the Government&#x2019;s policy it has taken the stand that it cannot go beyond the provisions of the 1936 land legislation. That means that over 80% of the present area of South Africa by law is going to be preserved for the exclusive benefit of the White person save for what he is going to give to the Indian and the Coloured people. In view of the consensus which I have discussed earlier and the concepts of equal opportunity and no race discrimination, can we reconcile this with giving all the Black people 13% of the country and retaining for ourselves 80% of the country? Can we reconcile this with those two principles? On the second aspect we are committed to sitting around a table and talking and discussing our problems with the leaders of the other race groups. Let me put any member of the National Party in the position of any Black leader. Could you imagine yourself sitting around a table and agreeing to a formula whereby your people, for evermore, are going to be excluded from land ownership in 80% of the country? I do not think you will be able to do that. I do not think it is reasonable to expect negotiations where this is a prerequisite to come to any success. It is not only the National Party that has this problem; the United Party also has this problem. In the United Party the same problem <span class="col_289-290" refersTo="page_0160"/>will arise within a different formula. Eventually the Black leaders you are going to talk to are going to say: &#x201C;Right, what percentage of South Africa is going to be governed by Black people and what percentage of South Africa is going to be under the jurisdiction of the Whites? What percentage of South Africa is going to be reserved by legislation for exclusive White use?&#x201D; I think these are the cardinal questions which are going to be asked and the cardinal questions that we, in fact, have to face as Whites before we can ensure the success of the prerequisites I mentioned earlier. I think it is a tragedy in a way, that because of the dilemma which exists in both parties, the official Opposition has not been able to challenge the Government on its consolidation plans for the homelands and has not been able to say to the Government that its consolidation proposals are just not adequate enough, that they will never be successful and that they must be done on a far greater and far more imaginative scale. I think it is a tragedy that the official Opposition is not in a position to say to the Government that in order for separate development to succeed you have to have something which is equitable in the eyes of the people of South Africa and in the eyes of the world. This goes far beyond the buying of land, because it is absolutely impossible to consider that this could be done through the purchase of land. It is going to mean redrawing boundaries and it is going to mean the acceptance of the fact that White people are going to live in Black areas. There is nothing else we can do if we want the policy to have any chance of success. Through not being able to challenge the Government on this, it has been left to the Government to challenge itself. I think that this has perhaps been one of the great lost opportunities over the past few years of our political development.</p>

<p>At this particular moment in our history, I do think we have this consensus to go into the future. I think we all do have a genuine feeling to see this future dispensation in South Africa on a proper and justifiable basis. I am convinced of that. However, I think that this question as to whether we as White people are going to be prepared to realize and accept that our entrenched position of privilege cannot last if we want peace and prosperity, is going to necessitate negotiation for something more equitable and more justifiable. Unless we are prepared to solve that question, the fact that we have all the right formulae, the fact that we have the right model of consultation, the fact that the spirit is good and that everything is now going for us, will not matter because we shall fall down on the basic, fundamental issues. We here who represent the White people of South Africa and who realize this particular fundamental problem, must tackle it. If we are going to do this by way of separate development, let us do the thing properly. Let us consolidate on an enormous scale, spend the money which is required for economic development and let us get the show on the road. If, on the other hand, practical problems arise that make it impossible to do things this way, let us look at federation and accept the situation that one cannot reserve the majority of the country for oneself by means of a Group Areas Act; one cannot, with federal councils, have the vast majority of South Africa under the control of Whites in a federal parliament, because the Black people whom one wants to have as partners in this arrangement will not agree. If we can come to grips with this problem I think we will settle the present problems of South Africa which perhaps appear to be so enormous to many of us, in a very short space of time. That is all I have to say.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Randburg will probably not hold it against me if I do not pay much attention to his speech. It sounded such a lonely speech. The hon. member must surely feel particularly lonely today. It must be particularly difficult for one if one is pushed out and one looks over one&#x2019;s shoulder and does not see any of one&#x2019;s friends nearby. Perhaps they are still coming. The hon. member must make another speech; perhaps they are still coming. In the meantime he is very close to the home where he belongs. Not that he will get more clarity there than he had before, because there they are also looking for a policy. The hon. member made a point of referring to the 80% of the land which was supposedly in the possession of the Whites in South Africa and which was reserved for the Whites by this Government. He also referred to the remaining small part assigned to the Black peoples of South Africa. The hon. member did not, however, mention at the same time that some of the best land in South Africa was in the hands of the Black people and that a large part of the land which the Whites have is land which is not as fertile and not <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_0161"/>as rich in water as the land which the Black man possesses. The hon. member must learn one thing. I think I can give him some advice in this regard. In politics a man has to have a standpoint; he cannot have three or four at the same time. The hon. member will have to decide very soon for himself whether he is at home in the left wing of the United Party or in the right wing of the Progressive Party. He will have to decide for himself what standpoint to adopt, because he cannot sit on all the chairs at the same time. I hope he will find a home very soon. Then perhaps he will be happier and less lonely.</p>

<p>No reasonable person will disagree with me if I make the statement that the present unrest and the present tension being experienced throughout the world, and consequently on the continent on which we live as well, may be attributed to a number of factors. The first of these is that the present tension in the world has its origin in Russia&#x2019;s expansionist urge and in its indirect strategy and militaristic intimidation of peoples. I do not think any reasonable person will dispute that. The second factor is that the initiation of insurgence and revolution by Red China, especially in certain parts of Africa and in under-developed countries, is the major cause of tension and strife between peoples. In the third place the inability of the free world to take united action against these whether at the U.N. or in NATO, or in other organizations into which the free world organizes itself, is one of the causes of tension. A fact which is closely bound up with this, is the fact that Russia and China understand something entirely different by the concept &#x201C;détente&#x201D; from what the Western World and the free world usually understand by it. What the free world understands by it, is co-existence and non-interference in each other&#x2019;s internal affairs, while what Russia and China understand by it amounts to world domination by means of world revolution and even violence. A further cause of the tension in which we are living, is the degree to which the labour organizations of the free world have in many instances become the objects and the victims of leftist penetration as a result of which large parts of the free world have been rendered helpless, so that governments cannot act properly. The hon. member for Mooi River spelt it out in so many words the other day when he said that this was one of the problems of democracy. Another important factor giving rise to the tension in the world, is the sham power-bloc of Afro-Asian countries which had its origin in the anti-colonialistic period. As a result of the actions of this group, irrational decisions are taken at the U.N. today, causing the weapon of oil to be employed against Western countries and countries of the free world. Without my running the risk of over-simplification, I think I can say that the factors I have mentioned have contributed successively since 1946 to the heightening of the tension in the world and have also contributed to the position in which the Republic of South Africa has come to find itself in due course.</p>

<p>It is strange to me that a responsible Opposition which lays claim to being the alternative government of the country and which has moved a motion of no confidence in the hon. the Prime Minister because he has either accomplished certain things or failed to complete other things, has failed to see the whole background to the tension in the world in launching its attack. They have concentrated exclusively &#x2014;and I have two speeches with me from which I can prove this&#x2014;on the so-called policy of this Government and its fundamental internal premises. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made the following statement. In his speech he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; fundamental changes in the political philosophy which cause the weaknesses in the Government&#x2019;s political philosophy.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said it was largely the fault of this Government that South Africa was involved in and had been dragged into this tension. The Opposition makes four fundamental mistakes, apart from the fact that they do not take the factors I have just mentioned into account, factors which they ignore altogether as though they did not exist. They ignore the fact that the conditions which I have described existed as far back as 1946 when there was a United Party Government in power. It was at that time that South Africa suffered defeat in the council-chambers of the world for the first time. South Africa was slapped in the face and insulted, and that was under a greater statesman than the Leader of the Opposition will pretend to be, viz. his great predecessor. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">In the first clash South suffered defeat mainly because the people were not in a position to listen to arguments. Arguments vrere advanced by peoples who are <span class="col_293-294" refersTo="page_0162"/>much more capable of advancing arguments than I am, but it was all to no avail.</block>

<p>The great predecessor of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that as far back as 1946 the world was in such a position that it would not listen to arguments about South Africa and that &#x201C;in the first clash South Africa suffered defeat.&#x201D; That was not when this Government created its internal policy. At that time we did not have this Government which, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout alleges, is chiefly responsible for the condition in which our country is today. When General Smuts was at the height of his glory, when he was the statesman of the world, he had to admit: &#x201C;South Africa suffered defeat because people would not listen to arguments&#x201D;. That is the first blunder on the part of the Opposition.</p>

<p>The second blunder is that the Opposition negates and minimizes the National Party&#x2019;s answer of the right of self-determination for the various peoples in South Africa. It is inherent in the U.N.&#x2019;s manifesto&#x2014;and their predecessor helped to write it into that manifesto&#x2014;that if there is to be peace and détente and proper respect amongst nations, there must be the right of self-determination for nations, mutual respect for one another and the absence of interference in one another&#x2019;s domestic affairs. This was written into the manifesto of the U.N. by the great predecessor of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, and it is also the policy of the present Prime Minister and of the party which he leads, viz. that we stand by the principle of the right to self-determination and that we want to give the peoples in Southern Africa the opportunity, without interference in the domestic affairs of one another, to come to live in a spirit of détente, each exercising its own right of self-determination. This the Opposition negates in its motion of no confidence.</p>

<p>I think that there is a third blunder on the part of the Opposition, and that is that they, when they talk of détente, most probably understand it to mean something different to what we do. I want to put it this way: The National Party and the Prime Minister understand détente to mean relaxing of tension amongst peoples without interference in one another&#x2019;s domestic affairs. We sincerely desire peace built on mutual respect. What of the Opposition? If one has listened to them over the past few days, one cannot come to any other conclusion but that they do not support détente, but that they support appeasement. They are in favour of appeasement.</p>

<p>I do not say that the hon. member for Albany stands for appeasement. But he is not really a member of that Opposition. The only thing is that the hon. member is still sitting there. Surely the hon. member&#x2019;s heart is not there. The standpoint of the official Opposition is not a standpoint of détente; it is a standpoint of appeasement. I say this can only lead to greater misunderstanding and to confusion. I want to direct a friendly warning to the Opposition this afternoon: Watch out that what you offer does not create expectations which you yourself know cannot be satisfied.</p>

<p>The fourth mistake which the Opposition makes, is that they do not take account of the White nation&#x2019;s right and its will to self-determination. I have now been listening to speakers on the Opposition side for days on end, and if there is one thing which is totally lacking among them, then it is the point of departure that there is also a White nation in this country, a nation of Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans who do not want to abdicate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>H&#x2019;s is a voice crying in the wilderness. I am speaking of the official standpoint of the Opposition and when I speak of the Opposition, I speak of the Progressive Party as well, because they are further on the road of &#x201C;appeasement&#x201D; than even the hon. Leader of the Opposition. No policy which the majority of Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans do not want to accept, will ever be able to succeed in the Republic of South Africa. Now it has been said, <i>inter alia</i> by the previous speaker, that this Government is the cause of the Whites in South Africa thinking this way. That is not correct. This Government is the result of what the Whites in South Africa think. If this Government were to take up the standpoint tomorrow which the Opposition does, then the day after tomorrow we would be sitting where they are sitting and they would have no place at all to sit. If change has to come to this country by peaceful means, if it has to come by means of evolutionary <span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_0163"/>development and not revolution, then it must come with the assurance that White South Africa does not have to abdicate, otherwise there cannot be peace. White South Africa is, however the very assurance that peace can come here, because from its heart, from its tradition, from its convictions and from its philosophy of life, it wants to bring peace and has been bringing peace over 300 years. The fact that White South Africa does not want to abdicate and that they do not want any appeasement, has been experienced by the Opposition for 26 years. For how much longer will they have to experience it before they understand it?</p>

<p>If these matters are to be discussed, then surely we as South Africans must make a few admissions, and the few admissions which we must make are that the National Party, the Government and especially the Prime Minister, have great merit in these times. A party which after 26 years should be showing signs of growing old, is showing the opposite; it is showing the signs of a party which has a message; it is showing the signs of a party which is full of vigour in the modern time. Sir, this party has led South Africa on the road of economic strength and raised standards of living for all the people of South Africa. The president of the South African Foundation aid recently that the <i>per capita</i> income of the Whites in South Africa was higher than the <i>per capita</i> income in France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands; that that of the Coloureds was higher than that in India, Brazil and Zambia, and that the <i>ver capita</i> income of the Black people in South Africa was higher than that of the populations of 35 out of 48 African States. Only yesterday evening the following extract from the report of the World Bank appeared here in the evening newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has the fourth highest gross national product <i>per capita</i> in Africa.</block>

<p>This being the position, Sir, surely things cannot be going as badly with South Africa as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition alleges. Why does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition not rise above his petty party political squabbles in this time; why does he not act like a South African for South Africa in these days?</p>

<p>Sir, in the second place this Government also has merit because this Government is the party and the instrument which has created other instruments in South Africa so as to enable the different peoples of the Republic of South Africa to make their voices heard, and not only to enable them to make their voices heard in the world, but also to deliberate with one another. Sir, before this Government came into power, there were, after all, no means by which different peoples could make themselves heard. Before this Government came into power, there were, after all, no instruments through which the different peoples could deliberate with one another; this Government created these. After all, this Government has created the round tables for the peoples of South Africa at which to confer and deliberate with one another and tell one another where things are wrong and where things are right. This has happened under the leadership of this Prime Minister more than anyone else. Sir, that is not reason for a motion of no-confidence; that is reason for a motion of recognition and of thanks.</p>

<p>Sir, in the third place, this creation of instruments for the various peoples of South Africa in the spirit of self-determination in the modern world, did not take place on the basis of the principle of the sharing of power; it took place on the principle of the division and the distribution of power&#x2014;not of sharing power, but of dividing power amongst those amongst whom it must be divided and of distributing power amongst those amongst whom it must be distributed, and that brought into being, also as far as government is concerned the germ of government on the basis of human dignity. Sir, let me say this here this afternoon; I believe in it personally: All people are equal before God; all peoples have the right to equal opportunity and self-determination, but equality, Sir, does not mean the surrender of one&#x2019;s own dissimilarity for the sake of a deadly conformity, and that is the basic mistake which the Opposition makes, and as long as they make this mistake, they will continue to find themselves in the situation in which they are at present, and their situation will deteriorate and they will be consumed from within by moth and rust.</p>

<p>Sir, this Government has another merit. Its merit is that it has made South Africa an orderly state. In a world riddled with disorder, in a world riddled with riots, in <span class="col_297-298" refersTo="page_0164"/>a world riddled with industrial unrest, in a world riddled with subversion and insurgence, it has made this country an orderly state in which law is maintained, internally and externally&#x2014;the guarantee of stability and the security of its people, also guaranteed by its military preparedness. Last night the hon. member for Durban Point gave his reason for not having any confidence in this Government as &#x201C;The way in which the Government has acted by way of small thinking&#x201D;. Sir, we have never been guilty of &#x201C;small thinking&#x201D;. When has this Government ever refused to co-operate with any country of the free world? Countries of the free world have refused to cooperate with us, under the intimidation of Russia and other powers, but we have never refused, generally, to co-operate with other countries. The hon. member referred here to Silvermine. He said Silvermine must be used for Southern Africa. But Silvermine is not intended just for Southern Africa; its intention is general and it is used generally; it is used for many countries. It is a large undertaking of this Government. &#x201C;Small thinking&#x201D;? That was &#x201C;big thinking&#x201D;. When this Government in spite of arms boycotts, in spite of efforts to cut us off, made South Africa prepared also in the military field, we thought big. The hon. member spoke of &#x201C;common security&#x201D;. In the past this Government has not refused to pursue common security with its neighbours, and when change came to the north of us, this Government declared immediately, through the hon. the Prime Minister and through the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and through myself in this Parliament, that we were prepared to cooperate with our neighbours and that we would not interfere in their internal affairs, but then they should not interfere in our affairs either. Surely that is not &#x201C;small thinking&#x201D;, Sir. I say in the past we cooperated with every neighbouring state in the technological field, in the economic field, in the agricultural field and in every field in which we could possibly make a contribution&#x2014;and in future we must continue doing so. But the détente for which we stand, and the détente for which we guard this Prime Minister&#x2019;s back and strengthen his arms, is to allow no interference in one another&#x2019;s domestic affairs and to be prepared to conclude non-aggression pacts with every friendly country in Southern Africa, and, furthermore, in a joint effort to help guarantee the sea route around the Cape for free sea traffic; and in the fourth place to resist Communism as far as is humanly possible, with the help of all in Southern Africa who are prepared to help us.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, I say in conclusion that this is not small thinking; these are not grounds for a change in the fundamental thinking in the ranks of the Government. The National Party Government has a message for the future. The National Party Government has a message of good hope. It is a message of right and justice; it is a message from which strength radiates, also in our negotiations with other peoples.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Once again, today, Mr. Speaker, we have listened to the hon. the Minister of Defence who, in his customary fashion, tried to create the impression that this side of the House cannot really be entrusted with the future of the country and that when it comes to détente we are in favour of appeasement. I do not believe that anyone on this side of the House has anything to learn from that hon. gentleman or from anyone on that side of the House when it comes to patriotism or the question of the maintenance of South Africa&#x2019;s position on the southern tip of Africa. Our problem with hon. members opposite is that when this side of the House shows the Government where it is wrong, as we have, in fact, been doing over the past 27 years, and it then has to change its policy in the course of time, we are accused of advocating appeasement. Sir, we have no quarrel with the hon. gentlemen concerning the fact that there are countries in the world, particularly the communist block, which are, perhaps, looking at South Africa with greedy eyes. Everyone knows that is so. But our quarrel with that hon. gentleman is this: If these dangers are facing South Africa, what, then, is the duty of any government worth its salt? Its duty is then to ensure that it enjoys the support of every last South African, be he White, Black or Coloured. That very hon. gentleman and his government have often given the enemies and the critics of South Africa in world forums, reason to criticize this country, more than ever before.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman quotes the words of Dr. Jan Marais concerning the wonderful economic position of this country. That is correct, but he ought also to quote what Dr. Marais said recently when he spoke about the 50 questions which any South African finds difficult to justify to his <span class="col_299-300" refersTo="page_0165"/>friends overseas. How much have those hon. gentlemen done to rectify that? For years we have had to hear that it was the policy of this Government to grant self-determination to groups. But, Sir, they always put the cart before the horse. Before there was a chance to place the Bantu on the road to self-government, for example, their representation in this House had to disappear. Before the Coloureds acquired that mouthpiece of theirs, the Coloured Persons Representative Council, with which they could liberate themselves as the hon. gentleman now states, their representation here had first to disappear. That is why I do not find it strange that we had to endure the criticism we did. For how many years did that side of the House not say that it was their acknowledged policy to discriminate? They were a party of discrimination. Now, after 25 or 26 years we must hear that they want to move away from discrimination. That hon. gentleman himself made a speech at Stellenbosch last year in which he said that there was nothing wrong with sharing other cultural amenities with Brown people of the same cultural background, or attending gatherings with them. But, Sir, as the leader of his party in the Cape, he allowed the Nico Malan Theatre to be closed to the Coloureds for four or five years. But, Sir, that is now the fault of the outside world; it is the fault of the enemies of South Africa that we are criticized so much. For years members on the other side of the House told us that they advocated discrimination. As long ago as 23 January 1964, in a motion of no confidence, the then member for South Coast attacked the Government on its policy of discrimination in regard to the Coloureds. He stated the following in 1964 (Hansard, vol. 9, column 171)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to ask him why; he is so fond of putting questions to us. Why did the Government discriminate against the Coloured people in Natal?</block>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Transport: It has been said in the debates over and over again. The hon. member should read Hansard.</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. D. E. Mitchell: Sir, the hon. the Minister does not find it so easy to reply. He says we will find it in Hansard. I challenge him: Let the Minister tell me where in Hansard we can find the answer to that question.</block>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Transport: The policy of this party is to discriminate. That is why we discriminate.</block>

<p>That is what the former Minister of Transport said. Then they still want to know why South Africa has the image overseas which it has. He expects of us that we should help him under these circumstances. But naturally we are prepared to defend South Africa under all circumstances in spite of that Government. We have never yet refused to do so. However that is what the hon. the Minister of Transport said on 23 January 1964. But what does the hon. member for Waterberg say, according to <i>Die Transvaler</i> of Thursday, 4 February? It was only a few days ago. In it the following words appear: &#x201C;Discrimination&#x2014;this is the thin edge of the wedge.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Why, then, is the hon. member arguing? I read further (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Were a policy of no discrimination, as it is understood in the liberalistic Western world, to be applied in South Africa, it would be the end of separate development. My own point of view, and this is the basis of our general legislation on separate development, is that one must provide each of the various South African peoples with its own place to live in. That is its home where it can enjoy rights and privileges, which a member of another national community will not necessarily be able to lay claim to within that place.</block>

<p>If that is the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude, I want to know from him, now that the hon. the Minister of Defence and the Administrator of the Cape have announced that the Coloureds, the Bantu and the Indians&#x2014; everyone&#x2014;may attend the Nico Malan Theatre, where he stands in this respect. I want to quote further from this newspaper report (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_301-302" refersTo="page_0166"/>Dr. Treurnicht states that with the cry of &#x201C;no discrimination&#x201D; one cannot come to a halt and say &#x201C;he will not get at my political rights ..</block>

<p>And now I come to the point (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He finds it unsatisfactory that people advocate change and moving away from discrimination without specifying exactly what they have in mind. I think there are people who are getting carried away with the concept of &#x201C;no discrimination&#x201D;. It sounds well in the ears of the outside world where discrimination is condemned as the deadliest of crimes.</block>

<p>If that is the attitude of our ambassador at U.N., namely that South Africa wants to get away from discrimination, if that is the attitude adopted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he made a speech before tire congress of the National Party at Stellenbosch, namely that the Government wants to do away with discriminatory legislation, legislation serving no purpose, and if the hon. the Prime Minister told the Coloureds that, I want to ask that hon. member where he stands in this regard with reference to this statement, speech or explanation concerning discrimination which he delivered himself of. In this House we must know what his standpoint is and what the standpoint is of other members who agree with him. I want to ask the hon. member: Does he, for example, agree with what appeared in this Morning&#x2019;s <i>Beeld,</i> particularly where it states that if there are concessions now, there will have to be political rights later? Does he agree, for example, with the Club R.S.A. of Johannesburg which is going to offer and has already offered certain opportunities to non-Whites?</p>

We on this side welcome this phenomenon. We are pleased that the Government wants it this way. It is just that it is strange to me that the hon. Administrator of the Cape could have told us, as recently as in November, that the Nico Malan would remain as it is and that the Minister of Defence could have said at the same time that that kind of thing must now be eradicated. Less than three months afterwards the announcement was made, by the hon. gentleman himself, that when he said it, no change was necessary as far as the Nico Malan was concerned.</p>

People on this side of the House should be grateful that there has been a change of heart. There must be appreciation for the fact that the shortcomings of separate development have been perceived. Hover, one cannot have the situation, as is again the case today, where some members of this Parliament received an invitation to attend a certain regional symposium. That symposium is being arranged by the S.A. Co-ordinating Consumer Council. Members are asked whether they want to attend this symposium. However, it is also stated on the invitation that if any organization nominates a person who is not of European descent, it is a requirement that besides the name and address, the identity number must also be given on the application form.

<p>The Newlands Hotel. Because the hotel is licensed, persons sending non-White representatives must make application before the time in order that the necessary permission may be obtained and the necessary permits issued. This is the kind of conduct which the Government must spell out to us. It has now had the opportunity&#x2014;and it must not only do so at U.N.&#x2014; to spell out to us in this House what they mean by &#x201C;moving away from discrimination&#x201D;. And it will be pointless to hide behind differentiation and regard it as a further loophole in consequence of which still further discrimination may be applied. Nor will that have the desired effect. Although one can understand what the hon. gentlemen on that side of the House mean or may mean by differentiation, I believe that under these circumstances it was not the right choice of word. It will be much better if hon. members on that side of the House stand by their point of view that they advocate the retention of group identity in this country. In the same way, separate development in respect of the Coloureds is now becoming something entirely different. Here, too, the Government, in conformity with its new movement, should rather think in terms of partnership or a joint say. I want to give the hon. gentlemen, and particularly the hon. Minister of Coloured Relations, an example. The Coloured university, the University of the Western Cape, has decided that it now wants to pay salaries and wages on an equal basis. They want to pay equal salaries for equal training. From reports in the Press it is evident that the reply they received was that if they wished to do this, they would have to utilize their own funds. If it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to break away from discrimination, how can that kind of reply be furnished to the University of the Western Cape? The hon. members on that side of the House do not accept absolute separation, but they also say that they are not in favour of absolute integration. After all, that is the attitude we have adopted through the years, namely that there is a choice between absolute separation and absolute integration. Under the Government&#x2019;s policy, particularly as far as the Coloureds are concerned, no doors are closed except that of representation in this Parliament. For the rest they leave the whole future open. Nothing is closed and any policy can be followed in the future. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations whether he envisages having a form of federation with the Coloureds in the future. If that is his solution, I believe that he must take the House into his confidence and tell us precisely how it is to be done. We want to know this because he has provided no final answer and the hon. the Prime Minister has provided no final answer. We on this side of the House welcome steps such as a statutory Cabinet Committee and a cabinet in place of the Executive with statutory status as steps in the right direction. We welcome the fact, for example, that they want to give more departments to the Coloured Council, but in spite of that and in spite of the increased status they are going to give the executive of the Coloured Council, there is only one thing they have in mind, namely to grant a greater joint say to these people. In the words of the hon. member for Waterberg, one cannot withdraw halfway, because the more effectively this group, the Coloureds, progresses in the handling of its own affairs, the greater is going to be the pressure to have a real share in the Government of the country. I believe that the Government has been influenced to come up with the changes <span class="col_305-306" refersTo="page_0168"/>it has announced. I believe that the Government has been influenced by certain factors in particular. In this regard there is, firstly, the enormous rise that has taken place in the educational level of the Coloureds, and then, too, the enormous rise in the level of their maturity as people and as a group. Another factor is that they have to an ever-increasing extent developed a sophisticated group of leaders among their own people. In addition I believe that the Government has been influenced because the Whites simply no longer have the human material to do everything for all groups in South Africa. I believe that the Government has possibly been influenced by a third factor as well, namely that in the face of the pressure from within and from without, they believe, as we have done through the years, that the common loyalty of all South Africans must be utilized in the best interests of the whole of South Africa. That is why a Dan Ulster had to go to U.N. How can one make use of such a man to represent one&#x2019;s country at international level and then refuse him and his people a share in mutual internal affairs? After all, it is an anachronism to use a prominent non-White to represent South Africa at that level and then to tell him: &#x201C;You and your people must take up a second class position and you will not have an opportunity to have a say in mutual domestic matters.&#x201D; I believe that the Government itself also realizes this, but why do they not say so and why do they not take steps in accordance with that realization and that influence? But whatever it is that has influenced them, we on this side of the House can give them the assurance&#x2014;this has already been done on a number of occasions by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;that we on this side of the House will not obstruct them in taking these steps. Then the hon. the Minister of Defence asks why we are not positive and why we do not stand up here like big South Africans and express our gratitude towards the Government. How much gratitude must we still express for steps which, as we regard them, are in the interests of South Africa? Wherever we are able, we too shall attempt to influence the Coloureds not to close the doors themselves that have been opened to them. They, as a section of the population of South Africa, should rather utilize all the opportunities to display greater self-administrative abilities, the better to prepare themselves for yet greater participation in the administration of the country, a participation which must inevitably come. We must all realize that we have the best weapon against domestic unrest in our hands and that there is more to win than to lose. We can only have peace if each person is granted his rightful place and his rightful share in South Africa. That is why it amazed me again, recently, to see that after the hon. the Prime Minister held discussions with the Coloureds, a press statement was issued in which Dr. Rhoodie, Secretary for Information, stated the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There will not be integrated restaurants.</block>

<p>Whereas we now have the position that the Nico Malan Theatre has already been thrown open, is it really so wrong to demand that there should be restaurants in our major cities in South Africa where these people of note can enjoy lunch or supper with Whites, if they so choose? Why should the door for something of that nature be closed? Is it only to satisfy the hon. member for Waterberg again? The lack of open facilities provided by the public makes the entire situation undesirable and absolutely ridiculous. This is the kind of thing they can do. This is the kind of situation which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition envisaged where the Government ought to move faster and where it can do things with ease. However, the Government is placing a stumbling block along the path by having that kind of thing in South Africa. For how long can we allow overseas friends of South Africa, our non-White friends, to use our facilities, but deny them to our own educated and cultivated non-Whites. Your detente will be so much more substantial if you were to do this kind of thing, not to satisfy the outside world, but to have your own South Africans understand that they are appreciated and that they are not unnecessarily discriminated against.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, where one has facilities created by the public, it is the right of that man who is the owner or the company which is the owner to say who may enter those premises. One can allow them to do this just as one allows hotels to do this today. I want to tell the hon. the Minister of Defence and also the hon. the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama relations that they must not confuse us with the Progressive Party. We suggest these things in a reasonable and sensible way. They need not only listen to us; they must also listen to what is being said by reasonable and intelligent people in their own ranks in connection with these matters. For example, I have cuttings in connection with the youth congress held in Natal which was addressed by the hon. member for Johannesburg West. Some of the members of the National Youth Bond themselves asked whether it would have been so wrong to have had a non-White to address them on that occasion. [Time expired]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member for Newton Park. It was interesting to hear how he interpreted what has happened recently and what his interpretation is of what underlies the philosophies of the Government party and the Opposition parties. I shall come back later to a few of the things he said. He raised quite a number of issues and I feel that I should react to a few of them. But I would prefer to discuss this entire matter in slightly more general terms, and then come back immediately afterwards to the one concept which ran through this entire debate. Although the motion itself comprises an entire page and touches on a variety of matters, like a round of bird-shot that is fired in the hope of hitting something somewhere, the debate was reduced to a discussion of lesser matters such as differentiation and discrimination. It was only here and there that it touched on fundamental matters.</p>

<p>My hon. Cape leader discussed matters of a more fundamental nature but, Sir, I want to say that the time for the sort of debate we have had here during the past few days,&#x2014;and I am not including all hon. members in this&#x2014;is rapidly passing in South Africa. I am saying this now for the second time within a year. Sir, I studied this motion very carefully. In view of the gravity of the times one must of necessity examine certain of the things raised here under a microscope. A number of reasons were advanced here as to why a motion of no confidence was being moved, but in my opinion those reasons were poor. I do not want to touch on the wide area covered by this motion, but I am also going to come back to the concept of discrimination of which we heard so much here. I hope we will now obtain a little more clarity on the concepts of differentiation and discrimination.</p>

<p>Sir, if we take into consideration the importance of the present times and how much these demand of us as leaders in South Africa, I must say that I was disappointed in the speeches made by the hon. members of the Opposition. I was disappointed because, as I said at the outset, this motion was reduced to a list of grievances, for the most part grievances of the other population groups, which we are all familiar with, without there having, in a balanced way, been recognition at the same time for the Government&#x2019;s action in trying to eliminate legitimate grievances because the time was ripe for it. One gains the impression&#x2014;and this is an inescapable impression&#x2014;that we are now being placed in the dock in a court where the U.N. is the prosecutor and the United Party the advocate.</p>

<p>But unfortunately I have to listen to the Opposition and that is why I sometimes know despondency. This strange brand of patriotism is then qualified by a kind of faint approval of the achievements and this is followed by a number of &#x201C;buts&#x201D; which overpower all the recognition, and the undertones are generally those of a Marcus Aurelius speech which was intended to overcome Brutus. He wanted to destroy him, yet he kept on saying: &#x201C;Brutus is an honourable man.&#x201D; [Interjection.] Later on I still want to say something good about the hon.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they read the newspapers you like quoting so much. You yourself know that. Let us understand each other. The second disappointment was the lack of balance when it comes to the equal apportionment of blame for discrimination, in the destructive sense, where it occurs in South African society. The hon. members of the Opposition might say: Very well, the Opposition is there to oppose and we are now dealing with the Government. That is right, but have you ever considered, taking these times into account, that any parliamentary leader, when he rises to speak here, also has a broader responsibility? He can make his contribution and make use of his right by admonishing, especially if his own house is in order, and then effectively broaden the scope of his advice without placing the emphasis solely on the legalistic obstacles in discriminatory measures, whereas we all know that the main day to day problems which exists, the major obstacles, are not necessarily legalistic but are social customs and traditions which have developed over the years.</p>

<p>My third cause for disappointment in this kind of debate is this. Has it not yet dawned on you in the past few years that these people are now able to speak for themselves in respect of these matters which you over-emphasize in this way? Has it not dawned on you that in terms of this policy and the understanding we have achieved with these people in the course of four years, these people themselves are able to state their case well and articulately and are in fact doing so, and that it is not necessary for you to bring non-White politics into this House in this way. These people are able to speak for themselves. Do you know what? The day will come when they will tell you&#x2014;they may already have done so&#x2014;that you are engaged in a form of paternalism. They are able to interpret this list of grievances you have mentioned and convey them to us as one person to another in a far better and far more responsible way&#x2014;this I can tell you, for I have had experience of it. These people are not afraid to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. members need no longer fear that those people are too weak, are not equal to the task or cannot state their case. Hon. members need no longer have that fear. Hon. members will be surprised at the responsibility which some leaders of the non-White groups display. Their responsibility is demonstrated when we discuss matters of real importance and not when we assemble as separate and opposing parties on the one side and the Government on the other. I want to mention just one instance, one which is quite interesting. A non-White leader complained about the ousting at a certain State institution of a certain ethnic group by another ethnic group. He said they were no longer able to tolerate it and that the Government had to do something about it. To this the Government replied: &#x201C;Look, I have a duty to prevent friction and I can do something about it. In fact, it fits in with my policy. But on the other hand the Whites, in turn, are complaining that you are ousting them. What must I do under such circumstances? Must I now make arrangements which amount to my drawing a distinction?&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="col_311-312" refersTo="page_0171"/>The non-White leader immediately saw what was at stake here. He immediately understood that there are certain cases in which this type of action is necessary because we cannot find a blanket reason, as it is called, why a distinction should never be drawn. Not all separation measures are evil.</p>

<p>Questions were asked about work reservation and influx control. If we have employment opportunities for 20000 and 30 000 stream in, what must we do? If something of this kind happens, surely it will cause friction. How will we really be able to determine, through free competition, which of these people are in fact the deserving ones? We will probably find an answer one day; I do not know.</p>

<p>There is better understanding among these people and my experience has been that they no longer, as they did in the past, appreciate this kind of intercession on the part of the Opposition. I have said that to me there are three main disappointments in respect of this matter. No doubt it is not really relevant since the Opposition has the right to move a motion of no confidence just as I have the right to lock my front gate to all visitors, friends and foes alike, without having regard to the consequences of such action. It is my right, and I can do so. But the question is whether I am going to do so and whether it is a good thing. If South Africa&#x2019;s vital interests are coming to the fore so urgently that it has been said on occasion that this session may become of decisive importance, one expects action of another kind.</p>

<p>Even the hon. member for Houghton said that this was an exceptionally important session and went on to take the official Opposition to task for being so divided among themselves. We know that there is still dissension among them and I only hope they will solve their problems. When a parliamentary session is of such decisive importance for our future, and the hon. Opposition can see that untiring efforts are being made to achieve a dispensation based on a policy which has repeatedly been emphasized and approved by the electorate, and an effort is made to carry that policy through to its logical consequences&#x2014;I am coming back to that again later&#x2014;and side effects are being produced which we find are no longer suitable, but harmful, and we want to get rid of them, I really do not know whether motions such as this one &#x2014;I am not referring now to its having been moved, but rather to the way it was framed &#x2014;have not finally deprived the Opposition of the chance to rise to a leadership level. I think it is depriving them of the chance of really rising to this level so that we can have full respect for them as people who fully understand what is happening in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout says that the Opposition need not applaud, but without making any overtures I want to tell him that they can, to a large extent, help to praise the White man&#x2019;s confidence in himself through what is happening. This is very important because it is very important for South Africa. The hon. Opposition should do this instead of sowing suspicion against the aims of the Government. Quite a number of Opposition speakers aroused suspicion about the ability of the Government to achieve the objectives it set itself. I do not want to mention names again. However, there is one hon. member who had too much to say a moment ago when I admonished him, but he has left the Chamber now. It seems to me as though he cannot keep quiet. If his nerves trouble him I can offer him a remedy. I am referring now to the hon. member for Yeoville. After the hon. member for Green Point and other hon. members had sown suspicion in this way, and after we had reached an understanding with the Coloured leaders, the hon. members for Edenvale and Port Elizabeth Central started to interfere in this understanding, this delicate understanding we are trying to develop.</p>

<p>The one says it cannot be carried through to a conclusion because there is no final decision and the people do not have a say up to the highest level. The other one wants to make better proposals for these people than they themselves have made. I then found it good to hear, recently, that the hon. member for Yeoville had sound advice for the United Party and said that he was more interested in South Africa&#x2019;s interests than he was in governing. To me this was a fundamentally sound statement. He said by implication that there were people who played politics too readily, and had other considerations besides South Africa&#x2019;s broad interests. I understand <span class="col_313-314" refersTo="page_0172"/>that the hon. member also discussed the homeland policy and said it ought to be accepted, but how certain I can be of that, I do not know. Hon. members on the opposite side allowed that opportunity to slip, those hon. members who sounded this positive note, have to a certain extent been treated fairly traumatically by them, for they have cut off a part of their arm and he is sitting to one side now, an outcast. I am afraid they have lost their opportunity for this year, and I want to ask the hon. Leader and his followers to think about these matters very seriously and see what they can do about them next year. Even if one has been moving a motion of no confidence here for 27 years, the demands of the times require that the United Party have taken the initiative and framed their motion in such a way this time that it would have been clear that they regarded the interests of South Africa as being so important that it was not a motion of no confidence which was called for, but in fact one of encouragement, and that they, by means of penetrating study, would have indicated where they thought the Government was not doing well. In the times in which we are living, this would have been statesmanship. I hope the hon. member for Yeoville will also participate in the debate.</p>

<p>I just want to round off this concept of discrimination, about which we have had a great deal to say, very quickly by saying that we have now brought it back to the point&#x2014;everyone understands this&#x2014;that there are two forms, as we understand it. This is irrespective of what the dictionary says, as it was quoted by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. There are two concepts in this regard, as they have evolved in political history, i.e. discrimination in the bad sense, where one once again draws a distinction and places the one in a worse position than the other, or in some way or another attaches a stigma to him, or whatever, and the other, according to which differentiation is applied because it is customary and acceptable and because, in its results, it really is better for both to apply it. This is as we see it, and where we differ with the Opposition. It is true, Advocate Pik Botha did say:</p>

<block name="quote">We do have discriminatory practices and we do have discriminatory laws and we shall do everything in our power to move away from discrimination based on race or colour.</block>

<p>But surely this is nothing new. In August last year the hon. the Prime Minister, according to Hansard, said something which he has been saying here for many years. I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">I see it as my constant task to get away from discrimination. I have devoted my energies to that ever since the first day I filled this position. I shall devote my energies to that until the last day that I sit in this House.</block>

<p>But let us come to differentiation now. Here I have to cross swords with a learned friend who actually knows far more about the logic of this matter and about constitutional matters than I do. I am referring to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. The Prime Minister said something else as well and this is the basis of our policy. This is where our philosophies differ and for that reason I do not think that their philosophy, as it has been analysed, is really as correct as the hon. member thinks it is. The National Party adopts the standpoint of multinationalism. If the hon. member wants to laugh about that concept, it is his affair. I see the hon. member is not laughing after all; I am sure he realizes there is something in it. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who is trying to make an interjection there, mentioned in his speech the other day that he accepted multinationalism in South Africa. The National Party adopts the standpoint of multinationalism while the United Party adopts the standpoint of multiracialism. If one adopts the standpoint of multiracialism, one dare not differentiate between races, for then one would be discriminating and giving offence since each one is a unitary society. However, if one adopts the standpoint of multinationalism, one has a right to differentiate and it cannot cause offence since it is the right of every nation to separate itself from another nation at times, as often as it is in its interests to do so. The Prime Minister linked this to the idea of each nation&#x2019;s retention of political power over itself.</p>

<p>What does multiracialism mean, then?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Multiracialism simply means that in one&#x2019;s political authority in particular, one has an absolute <i>potpourri,</i> a homogeneous political system in South Africa. The hon. member must not try to convince me now that a federal system of government for South Africa does not also mean majority government, for it is in fact majority government, and in one&#x2019;s central government decisions are still taken by means of a majority vote in order to determine what should be done for the country. If, as in the case in America, one then has a three-quarters majority, one might as well tear up one&#x2019;s Constitution Act. So the hon. member need not cross swords with me on that score. I now want to say this to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana: If he believes in multiracialism and we in multinationalism, surely there is a difference. When we are separate peoples, the people, if they understand it as we understand it, will be less afraid that the Christian attitude governing interpersonal relationships will disappear, this attitude which does not differentiate, does not suppress, does not begrudge others what one desires for oneself. The people will realize that their political future cannot be prejudiced. However, the hon. member&#x2019;s party is not trusted. Because his party mixes everything up it is being rejected, and has been rejected for 27 years. The hon. member will say now that his philosophy has been in existence for many years and that it is his philosophy which is being accepted. I really must quote to him what was said as long ago as, 1961 and has therefore extended over so many years that it can with justification be called the philosophy of the National Party. This is what Dr. Verwoerd said at that time already about the concept of &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to find a policy according to which, whatever happens in the transitional period &#x2026;</block>

<p>and now I am not denying that there may be suffering or that it may happen that people are hurt&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; therefore, just as in other countries, it is the object and motive to find a way in which there will eventually be no need for discrimination or domination.</block>

<p>The hon. members on that side of the House say that their philosophy applied throughout, and that we are now acting according to their philosophy. Here I have now presented to hon. members a history which ranges over a period of 14 years which proves that our leaders proceeded from the standpoint that discrimination must eventually disappear. There is a time for everything and, when the time is ripe, we can allow measures to disappear. Why cannot we do this, especially if we gradually bring home to the people, so that they can understand it, the fears, traditions and customs and everything that is wrong? Therefore, from 1960 to 1974 the philosophy of the National Party has changed very little. However, occasions arise when we have to reconsider matters. What was the position with the philosophy of the United Party? Was it also as constant? In 1960 they advocated a common voters&#x2019; roll; in 1966 they advocated separate representation for the Coloureds, and in 1970 they announced that the Coloureds had to be removed from the voters&#x2019; roll. Last year, in 1974, they suddenly rediscovered that the Coloureds must have representation in this House. How much has the philosophy of those hon. members in regard to these people not changed!</p>

<p>Even philosophy can change. If we change we are admonished by hon. members opposite that we have changed our policy. Now the hon. member is talking about philosophy again. Philosophy is the basis of policy and policy might change.</p>

<p>*Do not let us get mathematical now. Over the past few years the hon. members opposite have trimmed the sails of their policy to the wind. Hon. members must not seize upon philosophy now to try and justify this. If mistakes have been made, both could have made them. But I am speaking about 1975 now. Is 1975 more important to us or is 1960 more important to us? If we can criticize one another, we on this side of the House can criticize hon. members just as much as they criticize us. A time arrives for taking matters into reconsideration and it has now been decided to reconsider this matter. However, we cannot go along with the world psychosis which says that all differentiation is evil. I think a number of the hon. members on <span class="col_317-318" refersTo="page_0174"/>that side of the House will agree with me when I say this. For that reason there is a systematic evaluation of obsolete customs. The customs have become obsolete precisely because of the development of a good middle-class among our other population groups, which is today entitled to proper recognition. Sometimes one also wants to recognize other people at certain levels while one feels that at other levels they would not belong with one or want to be with one. Many changes have been effected recently in hotels, in sport, in appointments to boards, in respect of salaries&#x2014;about which hon. members opposite have so much to say&#x2014;by means of consultation among the people, with dialogue, by means of separation measures and by means of theatres and in many other respects which I cannot enumerate now. If hon. members want to listen to the U.N. in cases such as this and want to allow themselves to be stampeded, they are doing the wrong thing by the electorate of South Africa. Therefore, hon. members should do their duty as this Government is doing. Hear the U.N. when it is so excessive and listen to it when it is fair. However, when it becomes as excessive as it has at present, so that Mr. Scali had to say of the U.N. what he recently said, one should take cognizance of it, but ignore it. One&#x2019;s answer should be to do one&#x2019;s duty to all the people of South Africa as this Government will do, and it is the duty of hon. members opposite to assist us as we are doing this from day to day.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs has had a very long exchange with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and I do not intend to follow him in that. However, in the course of my speech I hope to return to the distinction that has been drawn by himself and by others between differentiation and discrimination. I am sorry that the hon. the Minister has expressed his profound disappointment in the contribution so far from the Opposition benches. It would appear that we have not spoken with the adoration which he was hoping we would lavish on the hon. the Prime Minister, although I think, in fairness, that most speakers have tried to give credit where credit is due. He also expressed disappointment at our raising the whole question of the non-White, so to speak, because he says they can speak for themselves. That is precisely the dilemma that faces any member of this House. He does not only speak for the White man, the White electorate, but he also has to speak with the knowledge that the vast majority of people cannot speak for themselves in this House.</p>

<p>During this no-confidence debate attention has been focused mainly on discrimination, and understandably so. Following the recent statements by leading Government spokesmen, including the hon. the Prime Minister, it is understandable that the two key areas of détente on the one hand and race discrimination on the other should be the key focus. However, there is a twofold irony underlying the whole debate. In the first place the harsh calls of &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D; which have resounded down the years and have actually earned many people their seats in this House, have scarcely died down and here we get the very members in the front row who advocated &#x201C;swart gevaar&#x201D; and berated those who spoke against race discrimination, discussing the ending of discrimination based on race and colour. It is very good that they should do so, but nevertheless it is somewhat ironic.</p>

<p>I said there were two points of irony. The second is that, now that we have decided that discrimination based on race and colour is wrong and that we must move away from it, suddenly we do not seem to know what discrimination really is. We have heard all kinds of long, tortuous descriptions and word-plays as to what it is all about and I am inevitably reminded of the conversation between Alice and Humpty Dumpty in the book <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass.</i> I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;When I use a word,&#x201D; said Humpty Dumpty in a rather scornful tone, &#x201C;it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.&#x201D;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The question is,&#x201D; said Alice, &#x201C;whether you can make words mean different things.&#x201D;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The question is,&#x201D; said Humpty Dumpty, &#x201C;which is to be master, that is all.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is exactly the underlying irony of this entire debate. We are very much in danger of indulging in a word game instead of focusing on the harsh reality which faces our country. If we do not know what discrimination is yet, I suggest we talk to those who are the daily victims of discrimination. <span class="col_319-320" refersTo="page_0175"/>Perhaps we should go around as a Parliament and talk to a family whose home has just been bulldozed; or perhaps we should talk to a group from the Maitland Garden Village whose community has been uprooted or is to be uprooted and transported elsewhere; or perhaps to the parents of a child who cannot be placed in a school; or to the wife who is forcibly removed from her husband and who has to spend 11 months of the pear apart; or to the approximately 2 685 urban Africans prosecuted daily under the influx control regulations; or we may even discuss the meaning of discrimination with, let us say, an African man who, not for the lack of qualification, but simply because of the colour of his skin, cannot get the job which his qualifications ought to give him entrance to.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have only 20 minutes. Perhaps the hon. member would talk to me afterwards. We must be very careful lest instead of focusing on the real issue we become involved in semantics.</p>

<p>In the first instance, from the debate so far it is clear that discrimination is out and differentiation is in. Very early on in the debate the hon. member for Vereeniging sought to draw a distinction between these two. He made what I think were three important points in his speech.</p>

<p>*In the first place he said, and I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Underlying the National Party&#x2019;s point of view in this regard is the conviction that it is the right of a people to maintain its own identity.</block>

<p>This is the first point. It is also the conviction of that side of the House that they recognize the human dignity of all people, and for that reason they want to eliminate discrimination. There is also a third point, i.e. that the Nationalist Party is in favour of good order. Now, we have these three points, and the Nationalist Party is now in favour of differentiation and not discrimination.</p>

<p>&#x2020;However, what we have to be very clear about is that we are not just dealing with discrimination in another guise. To put it in another way, differentiation must not simply be a softening of the discriminatory blow. Is discrimination really and truly to be rooted out or is it merely to be gently pushed aside so that differentiation can take its place in the form of the sugar coating on a very bitter pill? We must never imagine that simply by the use of cosmetics we can hide the deep wounds that are on the face of this South African society of ours. If we do, our last state will be worse than our first.</p>

<p>Let us take a look for a moment at this word &#x201C;identity&#x201D;. We have talked a great deal about differentiation and discrimination so it seems logical to ask a question about identity. What does it really mean? It is clear from the remarks made by the hon. member for Vereeniging who was followed up by several hon. Ministers and others that the safeguarding of identity is not the separate safeguarding of the Afrikaans-speaking South African or of the English-speaking South African because these two are joined together. It is also not a question of language that we are discussing. It is certainly not merely the safeguarding of a culture. I want to go further and say that it is quite clearly not only, although it may well be included, the safeguarding of the Christian faith or belief. The safeguarding of identity, as it has come to us from hon. members on that side of the House, is undeniably the preservation of the White race and indeed of White privilege. The emphasis is on skin colour.</p>

<p>Very well, if hon. members do not agree with me let me give them an example. Let us take a man who lives in the urban area. He is well-educated; perhaps he is a schoolmaster; he speaks Afrikaans; he lives in a fairly nice home; he is a Christian but he also has a brown skin. That is the distinction. It is not his faith, not his culture, not his language, not his education, so the protection of his identity does not mean the protection of all these other things but basically the protection of the white skin. If that is so then in heaven&#x2019;s name let us admit it! We talk about political honesty. Let us then have some political honesty. Let me put it another way. A man may come to this country as an immigrant from Germany, France, Portugal or England. He comes to settle in South Africa. He knows very little English and no Afrikaans. He knows nothing <span class="col_321-322" refersTo="page_0176"/>of our culture and very little of our history. Despite all this, he is permitted to settle wherever he likes.</p>

<p>It is true. He can get a job anywhere he likes if he has the necessary qualifications; he can buy a house if he has the money; he can settle just wherever he likes, and indeed, in due time, if that is his wish, he can actually become involved in political affairs and exercise a vote and participate in the administration of the country as a full citizen. But if that man happens to be Black, he cannot, although he was born in, say, Johannesburg and has lived there all his life, enjoy the same privileges and opportunities that the other man has. Sir, when we talk about identity, let us be clear about one thing: We are talking not about the preservation of a culture or a language or about faith or about history. [Interjections.] Sir, if an immigrant can come into this country and enjoy all the benefits and privileges of society and this is denied to people who are born here and brought up here, then I must ask in all honesty: Is this differentiation or is this discrimination?</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Vereeniging also went on to talk about &#x201C;goeie orde&#x201D;. I agree with him that it is most essential to have good order. It is always desirable to have stability and order in any society. The hon. member emphasized strongly that to ensure the maintenance of good order, it was imperative that differentiation should be practised. But what if the opposite is the case; what if in fact in the long term the policy of separate development, especially as it is applied in the urban areas, is the very opposite and the very contradiction of good order? Sir, will hon. members on that side of the House then change their policy for the sake of the maintenance of good order? Because it is very clear that if this Government persists in its policy of separate development in the urban areas &#x2014;let us leave aside the homelands for the moment&#x2014;there can be no guarantee that we will not have very considerable unrest in South Africa. Separate development and the moving away from racial discrimination are mutually exclusive, and because of that separate development is a threat to good order. Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration said in this House yesterday, as I believe he said at a public meeting at Krugersdorp&#x2014; and I am quite sure that there will be a lot of &#x201C;Hoor, hoors&#x201D; here&#x2014;that the Progressive Party and the &#x201C;dangers inherent in its policy&#x201D; were a greater danger to South Africa than the United Nations, more dangerous even than all the threats of the Organization for African Unity. Sir, I sympathize with the hon. the Deputy Minister. I can well understand why he sees the Progressive Party as a real danger, not to South Africa but to the Nationalist Party, because as an honest man he knows that the only real alternative to the Nationalist Party policy is the policy of this party. He knows that full well. As he himself said, he was not going to dance on the grave of the United Party. He worries about that, but the only concern I have is that if this is the way people are being expelled, I am going to have to move up the row until I am at the very end! [Interjections.] That is a little disconcerting, to say the least of it.</p>

<p>Sir, may I now, in the few minutes I have left at my disposal, move on to the relationship between the South African economy and this policy of separate development, to try to indicate exactly what I mean by saying that the two are mutually exclusive. The ex-Minister of Finance has consistently stated in this House and elsewhere&#x2014;and I am fully in agreement with him&#x2014;that it is imperative, essential and desirable that the South African economy should grow and continue to grow. But it is equally clear that this economy of ours cannot grow, cannot even stand where it is, unless we begin to share the rights and the privileges and the responsibilities of skilled work with other people apart from the White members of our community. This is very clear, and it is recognized by the Government itself in its recent reduction of job reservation in the building industry for Coloured and Indian workers. But unfortunately it does not go far enough because it still stands in its policy, as enunciated in recent days, that it is contrary to Nationalist Party policy for a Coloured man, no matter how well qualified, to be in a supervisory capacity over a White worker. Am I right or wrong? Sir, if I am right, then <span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_0177"/>of course I must ask some very hard, questions of Mr. Conradie, the Nationalist MEC, because he states in <i>Die Burger</i> that the South African White people have got to come to terms with the fact that there will come a time when Blacks on the basis of qualification will be in a supervisory capacity over Whites. [Interjections.] Sir, this is the question that has to be faced. If this economy of ours is to grow, we must extend the rights of skilled workers to the whole of our community. If you are going to do that, it follows as night must follow day that you cannot simply see economic integration in isolation from social and political rights. And that is where separate development breaks down, because you cannot hold in tension economic integration, which says that there must be a commitment to common goals in the workplace, common goals, a working together, in order for your economy to be efficient, and then when he leaves the workplace, say that the focus must be on group identity alone. Furthermore, it also goes on to say that the semi-permanent or permanent temporary Blacks&#x2014;I do not know what the latest description is of the 5 million Blacks living in the urban areas&#x2014;must eventually return to their homelands and that it is desirable for them to return to their homelands, and to be part of that group situation, and that that is why you have to differentiate. In actual fact you have nothing other than rampant discrimination against people whom we need in our economy on the one hand, but to whom we do not wish to extend the rights of citizenship on the other. Sir, you cannot on the one hand move towards economic integration, as we are doing, in order for our economy to grow, and at the same time disallow people to enter into their natural rights and responsibilities in the social area and in the political area as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should not like to enter into conversation with the Progressive Party. The premises from which we on this side and they approach matters are poles apart, and therefore we can never reach each other and we can never argue with each other on matters such as discrimination. However, I should like to tell the hon. member for Pinelands that the major difference between them and us lies in their failure to appreciate the fact that there are different peoples in South Africa.</p>

<p>Therefore they are moving in the direction of one man, one vote. Until now they have been discriminating. However, I know that they want to get away from the franchise discrimination contained in their policy. The way in which they can get away from it is one man, one vote. If they acknowledge the existence of different peoples in South Africa, then the policy of majority rule, the policy of one man, one vote, is the biggest discrimination which has ever been introduced in South Africa, because it means discrimination against the peoples which constitute the minority groups in South Africa. Therefore I say that we and they cannot enter into conversation with each other on these matters.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition quite justifiably exercised his right to move a motion of no confidence with that content in the House. In this, however, we have only seen the United Party once again as we have always known it, viz. as the Opposition which always does the wrong thing at the wrong time. Therefore, in the idiom of the hon. member for Durban North, the United Party is what it is.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. members of the Opposition, when they take up their Bibles before going to bed tonight, to read Titus 3, verse 3. By that I do not mean to suggest that everything in Titus 3, verse 3 is applicable to them, but I think they will find a few phrases which may provide them with food for thought. The hon. members of the Opposition are in the position that nobody really takes any notice of them any more as an alternative Government. On the political battle-front they are no longer a factor for an alternative Government. The political battle-front on which they are engaged is one on which they are fighting for the right to be the official Opposition. They are engaged in a battle to the death with the Progressive Party for the status of being the official Opposition in this House. I am coming to certain basic facts and philosophies which the United Party fail to see. Because they fail to see these, they can never make progress and they can never be an alternative government or hold the possibility of being an alternative government. The United Party has produced numerous policies which it <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_0178"/>has offered the people. The United Party beats the drum of emotional politicizing. Let me tell them immediately that the time for emotional politics in South Africa has passed. We in South Africa are engaged in the politics of reality, but this they do not want to accept. Over the past years they have tried to exploit supposed grievances in order to make progress. They have tried to run down the economy of South Africa in order to make people afraid of ending up in bankruptcy. It was all to no avail, and their position only weakened. For that reason I say that they are not engaged in a struggle to take over the government of the country, but that they are engaged in a struggle with the Progressive Party, and the Progressive Party might take note of this. However, I think they already know this. I want to suggest here this afternoon that even if the United Party kicked out ten Enthovens from their ranks, even if they made peace with each other&#x2014;such a peace that even the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout held hands as only two lovers can&#x2014;even if they elected for themselves another leader or any leader at all, they could still not become a party which could develop into a possible government for South Africa in the future. The hon. member for Albany agrees with me and in a moment I shall come to these basic facts which they ignore &#x2026;</p>

<p>On that he will agree with me. In this regard nobody is taking any notice of them any more. The recent survey indicates that the United Party got some water in its Pegasus. We know what the result of that is. A vehicle with which that has happened, stops dead. It jerks and snorts and then it stops. The problem with the United Party is that its vehicle has come to a standstill on an uphill stretch and is now going backwards. They are angry with the hon. member for Randburg about the results of this survey. If they are dissatisfied with him and have kicked him out of their caucus because the publication of those results would impede the United Party in its struggle to form an alternative Government in South Africa, I say that they have kicked an innocent man out of the caucus, because this is not relevant, but if they kicked him out because his findings would impede them in their battle against the Progressives, I say they had the fullest right to kick him out, for then he has harmed them.</p>

<p>In South Africa a process of national unification is increasingly taking place. This process has been going on for years. National unity, White unity which is developing in South Africa, does not develop purely by chance. White unity in South Africa is not developing simply on account of group affiliations. White unity is developing in South Africa on account of very strong basic reasons. Since the Second World War a tidal wave of equalization and emancipation has swept the world. It is a philosophy which has gripped the whole world. That philosophy has found expression in Africa. We have seen every day what has taken place in Africa over the years. From this philosophy which has swept the world South Africa has not been excluded. This philosophy concerns South Africa most intimately, because this philosophy has stimulated and developed the slumbering national consciousness of people. Because we have different peoples here in South Africa, this process is also taking place in South Africa. It has been going on for years. The Whites in South Africa have realized this. They realized it after the end of the war. Because the United Party thought in 1948 that they would still be able to go on with the existing pattern, they were defeated as far back as 1948. This happened because the Whites have, since 1948, come together and felt that it could eventually be a threat to the Whites. In other words, it is self-preservation which is stimulating White unification in South Africa. When national unification takes place, it takes place on a basis of principles. White unity in South Africa cannot take place of its own accord. It formulates itself around principles. The basic fact is that the principle on which national unity is built is the principle of recognition of the right of a nation to exist, to determine its own affairs and to be sovereign. In South Africa it would be wrong to recognize and to demand this right for the Whites and to proceed with the pattern without wanting to give the same right to the non-White peoples, for then the battle for self-preservation on the side of the Whites would be a futile one. It is precisely in this respect that the Opposition and the National Party differ from each other. This is where the great difference lies between them and us. This national unity happens to be growing around the <span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_0179"/>principles of the National Party, because the Whites in South Africa can see that the principles of the National Party are those which offer them this guarantee of self-preservation. Now surely it is obvious that when national unity develops around the principles of a political party, this must cause other political parties to lose ground. It is obvious, therefore, that this process will in fact take place in the ranks of the Opposition, as is happening at the moment. The United Party has been losing support over the years. What is really happening? As the years pass, old loyalties which used to be shown them, loyalties which used to support them, disappear. For that reason they completely fail to see the will and aspirations of the present generation, for as new generations are getting the right of decision in South Africa, support for the United Party is declining and disappearing. That is why the United Party refuses to recognize the basic truths and that is why the United Party finds itself in its present position. Much has been said about the quarrels in the ranks of the United Party. These quarrels are seen as the cause for their losing support. It is not true, because their support which is caving in under them, is the cause of their quarrel. So it is just the other way round. Therefore it is my opinion that no matter how hard they try to restore the peace, if they do not come forward with a policy with which they can gain support, these quarrels in their ranks will continue. I do not want to accuse the United Party of not wanting to further or see the continued existence of the White nation in South Africa. I believe they are as anxious about the White man in South Africa as we are. I am not more anxious about that then they are, or let me rather say, than many of them are. But what does the United Party do? Time after time it elects for itself a policy in which it tries to entrench the position of the White man in South Africa. In other words, it accepts the principle of the survival of the Whites in South Africa, but it builds policies on this principle which could lead to its destruction.</p>

<p>They gave the Whites another guarantee as well by implication. The other component which may develop into a component of power is the federal body. According to Hansard of 9 February 1973 (col. 340), what did Mr. Etienne Malan declare here in Parliament? What reassurance did he give to the Whites? He said:</p>

<block name="quote">We also have our own bodies which have investigated existing statistics. Sir, we have already done a great deal of work in this respect and will continue to do so. But hon. members can rest assured that in the federal assembly and amongst the 120 the Whites will be in a substantial majority.</block>

<p>In other words, here the assurance is given that through manipulation the Whites in the federal assembly will always be kept in the majority. Am I correct? In other words, what the hon. member is in fact saying here is that, if the sovereign Parliament were to transfer some of its powers to that federal assembly, the majority vote of the Whites would still apply in the federal assembly. I do not wish to comment on the folly of that, but I do want to say a few words about something which has a bearing on it. The fact is that I cannot believe that there is a single member on the United Party side who would believe that the non-White people would accept such a situation in which power is shared while the supreme authority of the Whites is entrenched. Now the question occurs to me, especially in regard to the composition of the federal assembly and these assurances which have been given: In all the negotiations of the United Party with non-White leaders, what safeguards do they give the non-White leaders in regard to their peoples and their position in the federal assembly and in the federal system? When I put this question, I think we have the right to get an answer to it. Do they tell the non-White leaders in South Africa. &#x201C;We want to create a federal system, we want to share power, but the condition we impose is that we make the sovereignty of the White Parliament the supreme authority and that we shall make sure of having the majority in that federal body&#x201D;? Do they tell the non-White leaders that when they negotiate with them? The hon. member for Yeoville is the negotiator. He has stated that the non-White leaders support the federal scheme. They give a guarantee to the Whites, but I want to ask them this: What guarantee are they giving the non-Whites of which we do not know? I am afraid they cannot give guarantees to the non-Whites and then let down the Whites with the guarantees they give. The United Party should take care, especially in the times in which we are living, not to engage in politics of outmanoeuvring, for on this basis the one or the other must be outmanoeuvred. Either the non-Whites or the Whites will be outmanoeuvred. Let them learn a lesson. The politics of outmanoeuvring may take one a short way, but eventually the moment of truth dawns when outmanoeuvring politics come to a standstill. Then those who have been outmanoeuvred bring to book the people who designed schemes to outmanoeuvre them. We dare not follow a course with the United Pary where people will eventually be brought to book in South Africa. By acting in this way the United Party is making a farce of our democracy in South Africa. No democracy can afford to have an opposition waging a political struggle in its own ranks for the status of being the official Opposition. Then we do not get rational thinking from an opposition; then we do not get sober thinking from an opposition. Then we get a state of panic in opposition ranks, and South Africa cannot afford a panicky opposition.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one hears some very interesting things in this House, and I think the last two speakers on the Nationalist side have demonstrated this. The hon. the Minister of Health decided that he was going to rewrite Shakespeare and history and make Marcus Aurelius the speaker to deliver a speech on the assassination of Julius Caesar instead of Mark Anthony. If I may continue with this Roman metaphor, while Rome was burning the last speaker was riding Caligula&#x2019;s horse and fiddling the facts of other people&#x2019;s policies instead of dealing with what, in fact, are the important things in South Africa.</p>

<p>If I may, one of the things I should like to deal with is the new appointments that have been made to the Cabinet. In the first place, I should like to say to the hon. the Minister of Finance, who is not here at the moment, that I think it is very difficult to replace a man of the calibre of Dr. Diederichs. I think therefore that the hon. the Minister of Finance is starting at a disadvantage. At the same time, however, he and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs <span class="col_331-332" refersTo="page_0181"/>have advantages. On the one hand they have an easy job to do, but on the other hand there are some difficulties. The job is easy because I believe that both the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs are backed by extremely competent officials. I also believe that the job is easy because of the inherent wealth of South Africa and all that is beneficial in this country of ours. These are the things that make their jobs easy. On the other hand, the jobs become difficult because of the world economic situation, because of a threatening world recession and because of the dangers of inflation. I want to say to the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, who is present&#x2014;and ask him to convey these remarks to the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;that we in the Opposition, who deal with finance and economics, will give them every chance. If they go wrong, they must know what to expect from us. But on the other hand we will give them every benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>Sir, may I make a few comments on finance and economics? I believe it is common cause between all of us in this House that the living standards of our people must be raised. This means that not only must wages be increased in order to keep up with inflation, but that real wages must go up, because in the South African scene the under-privileged people can in fact only be satisfied if there is an opportunity for them to improve their real living standards. I want to say to the Minister of Economic Affairs that it is not enough if in fact wages go up merely to keep pace with inflation. Sir, one of the matters which concerns me and which, with respect, should concern every other member in this House and which should concern the Minister of Labour, is that many of our wage determinations are grossly out of date; that the Wage Board is sitting with some 25 wage determinations that they are busy reviewing now; and that they are unable to take on extra work when it is conceded that in fact these matters need urgent attention. I would like to appeal to members of the Cabinet to give immediate attention to the setting up of quicker machinery in order to increase minimum wages in South Africa and in order to deal with wage determinations at greater speed. Secondly, Sir, I want to say that stability in South Africa is considerably dependent upon the ability of people to raise their living standards and not to have their existing standards eroded by inflation. If we are going to pay more in real wages then we must produce more. If we produce more, then people can in fact live better and their standards can be raised. Sir, I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister of Finance and to the authorities that under present conditions demand inflation is no longer a serious problem; that in fact we can in the present situation ease up on monetary restraints in order to enable our productive capacity to be increased; to promote greater production in South Africa, to encourage investment and to make sure that we can produce enough for all our people in South Africa. I also want to say that I believe that the hon. the Minister should apply his mind, particularly when it comes to the presentation of the Budget, to the question of including in it further incentives to productivity. Last year we listed a number of matters here which should be attended to in this regard, but we believe that one of the most important matters that we need to attend to at the present moment is to find ways and means of increasing productivity, because with increased productivity we can afford to pay higher wages, and if we can afford to pay higher wages then all our people in South Africa, irrespective of colour, will be able to live better.</p>

<p>Sir, I also want to deal briefly, if I may do so, with inflation. This is one of the matters which is ignored by the other side. [Interjections.] Sir, hon. members opposite do not like discussing inflation and economics in this House and they make a noise about it when one raises these matters. This debate has gone on for four days and I would like to know what kind of contribution there has been from that side of the House in respect of the real needs of our people and the improvement of their living standards. Hon. members opposite are very good at making noises, but they are not very good at improving the living standards of our people. I want to deal now with inflation and draw the attention of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs to the fact that inflation is in fact a danger to the social structure of any country. We all know that when inflation gets too high, it in fact affects the social structure of your country; it can undermine stability in your country and it can cause labour unrest, and in this delicate situation in which we find ourselves, I regard inflation as being a danger to race relations in this country. Sir, we need to deal with inflation in a more <span class="col_333-334" refersTo="page_0182"/>concrete and a more determined fashion. I think there are a number of things which we should bear in mind. Firstly, the rand as our currency should be maintained as a strong and hard currency in the world. I believe that the rand is under-valued in comparison with many other currencies in the world. If you give the rand its real value, then you will in fact be helping to reduce living costs, because you can then reduce the effects of imported inflation. Secondly, Sir, I think we have got to watch State-controlled expenditure to a greater extent, we have got to watch the tariffs which are imposed by the State. It is no good the State and the Government saying that they are not responsible for a considerable part of inflation, because you only have to look at the recent increases in telephone tariffs and postal tariffs and matters of that sort to realize what the State is doing to increase inflation in South Africa. I believe also that we have got to look at some of the imports into South Africa which are of a luxury nature. I think we need to take steps against the exploitation of the public as well, and I wish to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this again. Nobody can convince me that in fact fruit and vegetables in many parts of the country should have gone up 200% to 300% in the last little while. Nobody can convince me of that and I ask the hon. the Minister to take action to avoid the exploitation of the public in every field where prices are being increased absolutely unnecessarily in the existing circumstances.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I wish to deal with, Sir. We in South Africa are very fortunate in respect of our gold. We all sneak about it. The former Minister of Finance spoke about it often. But one of the things happening in the world today is that there has been a campaign, particularly in the United States of America, to sow suspicion in respect of gold. There are people who have been told to be careful of what they buy because it may not be real gold. They have been warned of the tremendous expense of in fact owning gold. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Finance today. What we should do as a country is to launch a public relations campaign to go against these endeavours to discredit gold in so far as the private individual is concerned, because the truth is that by the private individual not buying gold he is in today&#x2019;s circumstances, in this inflationary age, doing himself a disservice. I believe this Government should start a public relations campaign in this regard.</p>

<p>Then I should like to deal with another new appointment, and that is the appointment of the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs and of Tourism. Sir, I have not crossed swords with the hon. the Minister before in this House, but I want to say to him today that I appreciate that his appointment is the realization of an ambition, and an ambition which he was entitled to hold. I do not hold it against him at all, but may I say in all kindness that I had perhaps as much to do with that appointment as the hon. the Prime Minister had. Without me he might not be sitting where he is today. Sir, if I am responsible for the happiness of the hon. the Minister, perhaps I might also be permitted to say that he is responsible for some of my troubles.</p>

<p>May I say to the hon. the Minister that I regard the portfolio of Indian Affairs as a very vital portfolio. The Indian people are crying out for help. They are a people who want to cooperate with us in South Africa. The Indian people are a people who are vastly discriminated against. The Indian people are a people of culture, a people with a civilization, a people who have tradition and who have standards of value. Sir, they need much to be done for them. Now I think the hon. the Minister will realize that I cannot say to him today that I offer him the hand of friendship, because I believe that in the light of past events both of us would regard that as being hypocritical. But what I can say to him is that I hope that the people for whose welfare he now bears responsibility will prosper while he holds that portfolio. I want to say further that I personally will try to keep away from bitterness and that I will try to be constructive when I speak of matters pertaining to his portfolio. I also want to say, if I may, in conclusion, in dealing with this matter, that this portfolio will prosper under him if he carries out some of the things that he once said he would do if he had the power to do so. I wish him well in the job he has undertaken.</p>

<p>A number of questions have been put across the floor to me today concerning the issue relating to the hon. member for Randburg. There are some strange people in this <span class="col_335-336" refersTo="page_0183"/>House, the same sort of people who in ages gone by used to relish going to public executions and public hangings because they enjoyed the discomfort of others. They are perhaps the people who are the descendants of those who used to join in lynching mobs without knowing either the alleged offence or the individuals concerned. It is this kind of joy which is now pervading the Nationalist Party. Let me answer the questions that have been put to me so that there should be no misunderstanding about it.</p>

<p>Firstly, membership of a caucus and the membership of a political party are two distinct issues. It is clear &#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Certain questions have been put to the hon. member and if he wants to reply, hon. members should listen.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>It is clear that the caucus as a voluntary group in any political party, a voluntary group without a constitution, can by majority vote decide upon its own membership. The issue of whether any conduct on the part of Mr. Enthoven, the hon. member for Randburg, or any other person, warrants disciplinary action by the party is at present under investigation by a legal investigatory committee in the Transvaal of which, I may say, I am not a member.</p>

<p>Thirdly, whatever the personal feelings of any individual in any party are in respect of a decision of a caucus, those decisions are binding on him while he is a member of that caucus. The withdrawal of the privilege of the Whip need not be permanent in respect of any member and any caucus can, if it so chooses, re-admit the person from whom it has withdrawn the privilege of the Whip. I understand, on the highest authority in my party, that this is the view that applies in our caucus.</p>

<p>May I say immediately that, as far as I am concerned, there is no question of disloyalty to the party to which I belong, nor to its elected leader. I want to say also, and I make no secret of it, that I regard the hon. member for Randburg as a friend. I regard him as a person who has done tremendous work as treasurer of the United Party on the Witwatersrand. I shall not even tell you of the vast sums of money that he has been instrumental in raising. I believe, Sir, that he has also rendered a service, not only to the party, but to South Africa in respect of his endeavours in dialogue and race relations. I believe that he has made a contribution in that field.</p>

<p>The test of friendship comes in what you do as a man in adversity. I want to say, and I make no secret of it, that I am my brother&#x2019;s keeper and I will not be his executioner; and if I must be the person to execute him, I would rather walk in the wilderness than be his executioner. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Order!</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>May I deal with what I believe is the attitude of an opposition towards a Government. If a Government does right, I believe that it is the duty of an opposition to support it. When a Government does wrong it is the duty of an opposition to oppose it. It is also the duty of an opposition to provide an alternative. I want to say, with respect, that in so far as the hon. the Prime Minister is concerned, we in fact welcome his efforts to achieve détente in Southern Africa. I want to say to him today that even if his efforts fail, and I hope they do not, we will not attack him for trying; on the contrary, we will applaud him for having tried to bring about peace in Southern Africa. The same thing also applies to the elimination of discrimination. I want to say here today that if the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;I accept his <i>bona fides&#x2014;</i>stumbles in his endeavours to achieve the removal of discrimination in South Africa we offer him, whether he wants it or does not want it, whether he needs it or does not need it, a helping hand. The issue of discrimination has dominated this debate, and I believe that the issue of discrimination is an issue of credibility in so far as South Africa is concerned. It is not just an issue of credibility for a political party or an issue of credibility for the Prime Minister himself; it is an issue of credibility for South Africa. In the eyes of our own Black, Coloured and Indian people, in the eyes of Africa and in the eyes of the world this country is committed to the removal of discrimination. It does not help to say, whether on that side of the House or anywhere else, that we told you years ago to take action. It does not help if we merely say that you are now doing what we asked you to do before. What I want to ask today is if it is not possible in this debate for South Africa&#x2019;s sake to find ourselves on this issue of discrimination. Is it not possible to find a basis upon which we can in fact agree in this House, that there <span class="col_337-338" refersTo="page_0184"/>are some practices which we all agree are discriminatory and that those be removed at the earliest opportunity. Where we differ as to whether a practice is or is not discriminatory can we not agree that we will endeavour in a manner to try to deal with that issue? There are no people better qualified to decide what is humiliating and what impinges and infringes upon their dignity than the people who suffer from those indignities. What I would like to see is that we take the issue of discrimination, because it is so important to us as a country, out of the political scene and that we agree to constitute a multi-racial body upon which the Black, the Coloured and the Indian can serve, on which the Nationalists can serve, the United Party can serve and the Progressive can serve. We could then all endeavour to make a contribution to achieve this in South Africa. This issue is far more important than scoring a debating point; this issue constitute the credibility of South Africa in the eyes of our Black, Coloured and Indian people and in the eyes of Africa. It is an issue which we have to face in the world as a whole. I believe that if we are South Africans and if we believe that South Africa comes first and do not try to score cheap debating points we must try to find each other and try to see to it that we do not have to face the world and being accused: &#x201C;When you said that you would remove discrimination you did not mean it; in fact, it was just a trick.&#x201D; I do not believe that it was a trick. I believe that our Prime Minister, who obviously briefed our ambassador at the United Nations, meant it and was sincere in what he wanted to do. It is perfectly proper for us to debate our different approaches, but can we say that out of this debate &#x2014;we are now in the fourth day of it&#x2014; anything has come in respect of which the other side can say that in fact we have found each other to try to find a solution to South Africa&#x2019;s problems? Credibility is in fact what is important. I want to say here, so that there is no misunderstanding about it, that I believe that the Government has already done certain things which are important. There are many things that did not exist before. There are things which are being done even if they are small. I, for one, do not want to be carping about the Nico Malan, the Blue Train or about all the things that have happened. On the contrary, I want to say &#x201C;Thank you,&#x201D; because I believe that we must also tell the world that these are the things that have already been done. I will give an example of what has been done and where we were in fact applauded by a Nationalist newspaper. The city of Johannesburg took the initiative and decided that it would take steps to remove certain aspects of discrimination. It opened the museums, the libraries and the parks, thereby taking a tremendous risk. They were warned about the risks they were taking, but they are the people who prepared the way and who are prepared to take a chance for the sake of South Africa. Graciously enough, we have a newspaper like <i>Die Vaderland</i> which was prepared to state in its columns that this was an achievement of which the city council in Johannesburg could be proud. That is a big gesture because it is a United Party council while <i>Die Vaderland</i> is a Nationalist Party newspaper. Is such a gesture not the kind of gesture that should motivate us here today? I think we must give credit for what has been done. I think we must tell the world what has been done, not only from the Government benches but also from the Opposition benches. We must agree that we will work together in order to see that what remains of discrimination, is removed from the scene in South Africa. I believe that sincerity and credibility are essential, not only for our country but also for every political party, and when we speak of these matters we must speak in such a way that our people know that we shall do what we say we will do. When we in the United Party speak of a federal structure, we must make it clear that that federal structure will not be a fraud, that it is not a means whereby there will always be a veto, whereby there will always be White baasskap that can be exercised. Sir De Villiers Graaff, my leader made it very clear that he endorsed what the hon. member for Durban North said, i.e. that if in fact we were to anticipate that the White Parliament would remain for ever, the whole conception would be a fraud. It is not a question of the White Parliament &#x201C;could&#x201D; disappear, it is a question of the White Parliament &#x201C;would&#x201D; disappear, subject to the safeguards we have given to the people of South Africa. We must state this sincerely, and we must have the credibility as a political party to put this across. The same point applies in regard to White leadership, in connection with which I have disagreed with my hon. friend across the way. White leadership in South Africa means that we as Whites have political control, and we must bring about a change in South Africa. White <span class="col_339-340" refersTo="page_0185"/>leadership does not mean White baasskap and suppression, and if it does it cannot be part of the United Party&#x2019;s policy. With respect, it is this credibility which is at issue. It is the sincerity of people that is at issue, and that it why it is credibility which South Africa now needs. Sincerity is what must, in fact, prevail. That is why I say that what we need to do in this House, as a result of these days of debate, is to find ourselves and to decide whether, for the sake of South Africa, it is not possible for us to work together to remove discrimination so as to ensure that we can hold our heads high in Africa and in the world.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_planning_and_the_environment_and_of_statistics">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND OF STATISTICS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend reacting at any length to the political part of the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2019;s speech. As far as his remark at the end of his speech is concerned, I can just say that this side of the House, the Government and the Prime Minister, in all they have done&#x2014;which might have been right or which might have been wrong&#x2014;has always been honest There were years when we were accused of not being honest, of not telling our people outside that this was our policy. We have been told that we say one thing in this House while we tell different stories to the U.N. and to our people. It has also been said that we are not honest in the implementation of our policy. After the falseness of the allegation had penetrated to them, however, hon. members on the opposite side accepted it. I do not want to reproach them this afternoon, but then they came forward with another accusation. Then they said that we were going to create dangers on our borders. The point I therefore want to make, is that our Prime Minister, in his consultations with the non-White leaders&#x2014; and there he took the lead&#x2014;has always been honest, and will always be honest. That is one reason why the Government is trusted. Even if people do not like all our policies at this stage, even if we are told that we must go still further, that we must go still faster, there is one thing that cannot be said of us and that is that this side of the House is not honest in its standpoint. I do not want to go into this any further. I assume that the hon. the Prime Minister will cover this whole field tomorrow. I do not have access to the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2019;s statement, he has just read out, but the little I did hear of his statement brought me under the impression that he was telling his colleagues that he was keeping all his options open. That was the impression I gained.</p>

<p>Because time is marching on, I should like to proceed from the economic part of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. I actually want to proceed from the point he made when he said that inflation was the one thing today which could endanger the standard of living of our people and that we must combat it. When I first looked at the motion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition it was very noticeable to me that it contained a number of sub-divisions, the combating of inflation being the last. The hon. member who spoke before me reproached us on this side of the House with having participated in this debate for four days without our having stood up for the ordinary man and championing his cause. I ask hon. members now, which of the hon. members on the opposite side has spoken on behalf of the ordinary man and woman in South Africa in the four days which have passed. Which of them has done so? Not a single one. The only speaker who had something to say about economic affairs, referred to it only in passing. I am going to deal with it this afternoon. I want to say&#x2014;it has been said before&#x2014;that this side of the House has the interests of the ordinary man and woman in South Africa at heart. They are, <i>inter alia,</i> the people who support us, they are the workers of South Africa, including the non-Whites of South Africa, whose interests we also have at heart. We are just as opposed to price increases&#x2014;if I may use price increases and inflation as synonyms&#x2014;but there are certain factors which we simply cannot avoid. Hon. members will allow me to mention a few of those factors. I do not want to score debating points; I do not simply want to win the debate across the floor of this House and then walk out feeling satisfied while the person who is paid his salary at the end of the month, still struggles to make ends meet. Our hearts are with those people. But we must be realistic and face up to the truth of the matter.,</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville spoke of imported goods. Hon. members know that we have an open economy. We must sell to the world; it cannot be otherwise. At the same time, however, we must also buy from the world. Imported goods account for a fifth, or rather, just over 20%, of our domestic spending. It is calculated <span class="col_341-342" refersTo="page_0186"/>that for every 1 % which the wholesale price index of imported goods rises, our consumer price index rises by 0,22%. This cannot be disputed. From November 1973 to November 1974 the wholesale price index for imported goods rose by 28%. In other words, the price of imported goods rose by 28% in that period, i.e. consumer goods which are unpacked and sold in shops, production goods which are used in industrial processes or which are known as intermediary goods, as well as capital goods, i.e. machinery and equipment of all sorts. I concede that such a rise of 28% cannot make itself fully felt in the economy overnight. Nor do I want to suggest that the full 28% has made itself fully felt up to now. But the fact of the matter is that the rise of 28% will bring about an increase of 6,16% in our consumer price index. I mention this simply to demonstrate what a tremendous effect imported goods have on our consumer price index rising.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Where did you get those figures?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>From the Department of Statistics and the office of the Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister. The figures are generally accepted.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Are those figures available to us as well?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. The hon. member may accept these figures. This is a figure which has been determined scientifically and which indicates that imported goods account for just over 20% of our domestic spending. That includes consumer goods, production goods and capital goods. The effect of this is that with every rise of 1 % in imported prices, our consumer price index rises by 0,22%. In other words, the ultimate effect of this rise of 28% over 12 months&#x2014;this exceeds the rise in the previous year&#x2014;was a rise of 6% in our consumer price index, and nobody can do anything about that.</p>

<p>Let us consider a second factor, i.e. that of wages. Before coming to that, I just want to say that not only imports, but also exports have a price-increasing effect on our economic structure, because as the prices of everything we export increases overseas&#x2014;the price of wool, skins and hides, copper and chrome, etc., has increased&#x2014;the domestic prices of those products increase as well. To what extent has the price of fishmeal, for example, not increased abroad? The factories were allowed to export a certain quantity of the fishmeal they produced. The rest they had to sell locally. Because they obtained such a tremendously high price abroad, they maintained that the domestic price had to be increased as well. Increases in the prices of export products mean that the industries and the processing units taking in these goods had to pay more as well. Therefore export prices, too, have a price-increasing effect on domestic prices.</p>

<p>I want to return to the factor of wage increases both for the Whites and the non-Whites. To the extent to which wage increases exceed the increase in productivity, they have the effect of causing our cost structure to rise. There is no escaping from that. As hon. members know, non-White wages were increased by 18% in 1973 and by an average of 24% per worker in 1974. We do not say that this is wrong. Both sides of the House state that this is necessary. The policy of the Government is that the wage gap should be narrowed by increasing non-White wages. That is also the policy on the opposite side of this House. However, this does have the effect of causing our cost structure to rise; profits cannot always absorb the increases. The position already is that a business undertaking needs more money today to do the same volume of business as last year. Consequently it cannot pay these additional wages out of its profits. For that reason prices have to be increased and the consumer has to pay.</p>

<p>What about productivity?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Productivity is being increased. This is something which nobody must lose sight of, neither the public sector, nor the private sector. The wage increases, however, are far higher than increases in productivity can be. If, on a purely economic basis, we are to bring the wages of non-Whites to the level on which they want them, we shall progress far more slowly. Although I do not want to deal with the world&#x2019;s dilemma, this is a worldwide problem, i.e. that purely economic factors do not always determine decisions on national and international financial affairs. There are also social and political <span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_0187"/>factors. As far as non-White wages are concerned, we have almost the same situation.</p>

<p>Then there is the effect rising food prices have of causing our consumer prices to rise. In 1973 our food prices rose by more than 17%. Last year they rose by 18,4%. For the sake of our agriculturalists and for the sake of my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, I should like to say that we must not forget that in the 12 years from 1960 to 1972, food prices rose more slowly in South Africa than did any other goods which make up the components of the consumer price index. In 1973 and in 1974, however, we had extraordinary increases in food prices, which had the effect on the index of causing it to rise considerably. In addition we must remember that the farmers alone did not receive these additional amounts. The money also went towards tractors, tractor tyres, fuel, spare parts, implements and higher wages, and on the distribution side there was the question of higher rail tariffs, higher remuneration for the millers, the bakers, and the other distributors. The farmers did get a part of this, but other persons and groups, too, each received a part of this considerable increase in agricultural prices. Therefore I want to repeat that there are factors concerning prices&#x2014; and here we come to the major part of the increase&#x2014;about which this side of the House can do nothing, about which nobody can do anything and for which the Government must not be blamed. I am not saying that the poor man is to live from this consolation, but I am saying that we must see the position in its proper perspective,</p>

<p>Furthermore. Mr. Speaker, I should like to say this: We should not see inflation in isolation. One cannot wrap it in a shawl, take it to a doctor&#x2019;s surgery, see what its condition is at the surgery and stick a pin into him every now and again so that he may scream. Inflation is a world phenomenon. For that reason I am of the opinion, in the first place, that we must see it in a world context. I do not want to deal with this at length, except to tell hon. members that our consumer price index, i.e. on the basis of December 1973 to December 1974&#x2014;this is one method according to which one can calculate the index; I mention this basis because all the countries with which I want to draw a comparison are also from month to month over 12 months&#x2014;rose by 14,1%. That is very high. But that of the United Kingdom rose by 17,1%; France 14,7%; the U.S.A. 12,1%; Japan 25,4%; Australia 16,4%; Italy 20,3%; the Netherlands 10,3%; Canada 11,6% and Germany, the lowest, 7,1%. In other words, the consumer price index rose in all these countries, and in some of these countries by much more than ours did. Therefore we must see it in this light. The most important thing, however, is that we must see inflation in the context of our own economy. Even if it is a negative achievement, it is one of the achievements of our economy. There are other achievements as well, such as that of the growth rate, there is the question as to whether a country&#x2019;s people have employment and there is the question of how much the people are paid for their work. If we come to these achievements, I can tell hon. members that the gross domestic product of South Africa rose by 7% last year. This in itself is, far higher than anything we find in the rest of the world. I am not speaking of the oil-producing countries. This is already far above any comparable figure in any other comparable country in the Western World. I also want to compare the gross national product. Last year our gross national product rose by 10% and in the U.S.A, there was a negative growth of 1,75%. It has been said here today that South Africa is a rich country and that, thanks to those riches, things must go well. But America, too, is a rich country. The conclusion is merely that the reins in South Africa have been held very, very well, especially during recent years. In the U.S.A, there was a negative growth of 1,75%. West Germany had a growth of a mere 1%, the United Kingdom, minus 0,5%, Japan a negative growth of 3,25% and Canada Italy and France each a growth rate of 4,75%.</p>

<p>Surely those are not <i>per capita</i> figures?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, these are the percentage figures. Then I want to mention that the average growth rate of the 24 OECD countries was only a ¼% last year. South Africa actually stood out with a wonderful growth rate: in this respect South Africa was a shining star in the world. We have debated the question of the <i>per capita</i> growth rates in this House before. If the population increase is very high, then naturally the <i>per capita</i> growth <span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_0188"/>is small. The smaller the population increase, the larger, relatively, the <i>per capita</i> growth rate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now want to put the question here whether our people in South Africa have had work, and I want to say this afternoon that there is work in South Africa for everyone who wants to work, regardless of his colour. Here in South Africa there is work for everyone who wants to work. I do not want to deal with the unemployment figures for Whites, Coloureds and Indians now; we know that these are minimal. Hon. members on the opposite side always say that we cannot quote the unemployment figures for Whites, Coloureds and Indians as proof that there is no unemployment in South Africa, because what of the Bantu? Sir, our economy can absorb all the Bantus in South Africa who want to work. Our gold mines have a labour shortage today. They can produce more if only they can get the workers. If people really want to work, then there is work for them. Our agriculturalists are looking for workers. There is a registered unemployment figure among the Bantu, a figure which probably is not very accurate. However, the registered unemployment figure among the Bantu at the Bantu Administration Boards in the Republic for December 1974 was 94 000, and in the homelands in June 1973&#x2014;that is the latest figure&#x2014;it was 34 000.</p>

<p>I presume that the real figure is actually higher. But the question is what work do these people report for, because a person is offered work in a certain direction and then refuses to accept it because he wants to do a certain type of work only. But, in any event, I should like to make the point here that there is work in South Africa today for everyone who wants to work. We have many foreign Bantu in our country and it is good that they are here; they are welcome here, and I hope that they will continue to offer their services here. We have 485 000 foreign Black workers in South Africa. If we did not have them here we would have had a big shortage of workers in this country.</p>

<p>Sir, I put a further question. I have said that there is a good income in our country for people who want to work. What do our people earn? In 1972-&#x2019;73 the consumer price index figure rose by 9,5%; White wages&#x2014;and this is my answer to the hon. member for Yeoville who said that we must ensure that standards of living did not drop, but rose&#x2014;rose by 12,8% as against a rise of 9,5% in the consumer price index figure. Non-White wages rose by 18,4%. In 1973-&#x2019;74 the consumer price index figure rose on average&#x2014;that is, you take the figures for all the months of the year and then the average&#x2014;by 11,6%; White wages rose by 13,1% and non-White wages by 24,2%. From 1948 to 1974 the consumer price index figure in South Africa rose by 175,9%; in the same time White wages rose by 471,6%, and non-White wages by 416,3%. If one takes the price increases in those 26 years into account, then the average wage of the White worker in South Africa, in actual terms, rose by 107,2%, and the average wage of the non-White worker in South Africa rose by 87,1%; that is, since 1948 the standard of living of the Whites&#x2014;this actual standard of living, not their income in moneys but their actual standard of living&#x2014;has risen by 2,9% per year and that of the non-Whites by 2,4% per year.</p>

<p>I can quote other figures as well. Let us take old-age pensions just from 1970 to 1974. In this time the cost of living&#x2014;I have the indexes here&#x2014;rose by 38%. Old-age pensions rose by 63%. You see, Sir, the Government is thoroughly mindful of ail these things. Because what can one do? On the one hand, one can indeed reduce hardships. If the money is there, one can vote subsidies for food. One can vote large amounts for food subsidies. But, of course, that is nothing but a palliative. One still does not cure the disease of inflation. But one can do it, and that is what the Government is doing. Within the limits of our means, food subsidies are made available. One can see to it that wages and salaries keep abreast of the rises in the cost of living. Here I have already quoted the figures to demonstrate to you that under this Government wages and salaries have more than kept abreast of rises in the cost of living, and now, since salaries and wages have risen more than the cost of living, the onus is really on the worker to show that he will help close this gap by means of higher productivity. We have introduced savings schemes to encourage people to save. There are tax-free saving schemes, various forms of investment where the interest earned is tax free, etc.</p>

<p>People say so often that it does not help to save. Sir, I want to say today that my advice to people, and particularly to young people, is still to save in addition to making other investments. They must <span class="col_347-348" refersTo="page_0189"/>not allow themselves to be misled by the story that it does not help to save. One can save R1 000 or R10 000 today&#x2014;just call it weak money&#x2014;and perhaps it is easy to save that amount. If the economy changes, one may find in a short time that that R1 000 to R10 000 is good money. I think someone who saved and had something in his pocket, never regrets it. I have already mentioned that pensions have been increased. Our public expenditure during the past number of years, has, as far as I know, been financed in an inflationary way in one year only. Every year our public expenditure is financed in a non-inflationary way. On the other hand, take education. What has this Government not done for and spent on education and the training of all our people, for training schemes for our Bantu workers, tax concessions, productivity, investment, and the training of workers in service? More work has been created for our Bantu. In the recent growth phase we did not run into a bottleneck as regards labour. I think hon. members will agree with me. We have had this high growth phase without our economy running into many bottlenecks. One of the reasons for this is that the Government has seen to it that there are enough skilled workers and that it has come to an agreement with the trade unions that certain categories of employment should also be opened to non-Whites.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I take pleasure in saying that it has always been the objective of the Government to ensure prosperity and security for all our people. The Government has always ensured that economic growth and development can take place against the background&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;of confidence and stability. Therefore South Africa is characterized as almost the only country in the world which has economic prosperity and also, as a cause of this, political stability.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I trust the hon. the Minister will forgive me if I do not respond in detail to his speech. The reason for it is simply, as he said at the beginning of his speech, that there are matters on which the Government and the Opposition agree. I think that within the strait-jacket of economic rationality we can appreciate with what dilemmas each government is faced. The same also applies to the remark the hon. the Minister made on the issue regarding the honesty of the Government&#x2019;s efforts in moving away from racial discrimination, and that there seems to be agreement between the Government and the Opposition. We also agree as far as the urgency of it is concerned. However, it is also the responsibility of an Opposition to make it clear on which points it differs from the government, because, surely, if it does not do so, it is not an Opposition and it might just as well join the government and assist in putting matters right where minor differences exist. I think that is what I really want to do today.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Progressive Party, the hon. member for Sea Point, started our contribution to this debate by saying that we have now entered an era of the politics of negotiation. I think there was general agreement that this is the case, not only in South Africa, but also in Rhodesia at this very moment, Angola and Mozambique and in South West Africa. In the politics of negotiation the fundamental point is that the governing party, the ruling elite, can never formulate a completely unilateral solution to the political future of a country. This is the first important point and from this follows that you have to negotiate and compromise in that situation. In the policy of the Progressive Party it is stated very clearly that as a fundamental aspect of our policy we believe that you must have a national convention on which all the various groups in South Africa are represented so that they can deliberate about the nature of the constitution and the entrenched bill of rights that will be operative for the political system of South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the qualified vote.</p>

<p>I think the important point about this convention is that it accommodates exactly and anticipates this development in Southern Africa&#x2014;the politics of negotiation. Obviously any party that enters into such a national convention must state that there are certain non-negotiable factors; there are certain factors in regard to which they are not prepared to compromise because they feel that those factors are important if we are to have orderly, responsible and stable government in South Africa. These were mentioned by the hon. member for Sea Point very clearly in his <span class="col_349-350" refersTo="page_0190"/>speech and they were also reflected in the nature of his amendment to the no-confidence motion. He said, for example, that we are not prepared to negotiate on a federal structure for South Africa where there is an effective sharing of political powers; we believe that has to be part of that constitution. We are not prepared to negotiate on the protection of civil liberties in an entrenched, rigid constitution protecting the rights of individuals and minorities. We are not prepared to negotiate the question of whether race discrimination should be eradicated. The hon. member for Houghton has made a contribution in this debate on the issue of civil liberties and the hon. member for Pinelands has made a contribution on the issue of race discrimination as well.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, what is really at issue in the point of difference between this party and the Government? As has been mentioned by various hon. members on that side, it concerns the question of the sharing of power. As has been mentioned by the hon. member for Bloemfontein East, there is a fundamental difference between the Progressive Party and the Government on the question of the sharing of power. When speaking to one another as reasonable people, without stealing a march on one another, we have to discuss the reason for this difference. Why is this party of the opinion that the sharing of power is a pre-requisite for the stable future of South Africa, even a pre-requisite to secure the continued existence of the Whites? This is what we think; the Government thinks exactly the opposite. Why is this the case? The element in our policy our opponents seize upon as though it is the symbol of the difference between us and the Government is the qualified vote. To our opponents this becomes an indication of the sharing of power. In earlier years it used to be a question of Black majority, but at present I notice there is great concern about discrimination and whether the Black man will be satisfied. If hon. members were to study our policy, they would see that it is only one element to cope with this whole problem of the sharing of power in South Africa. Let me say quite frankly that it is only a minor part of the problem, and I now want to illustrate it. Under the present constitutional setup in South Africa I cannot see that the qualified vote is a feasible political measure. Why? Because we have here a Westminster model of parliamentary democracy which is entrenched in White politics. By implication this means that all power in South Africa is centralized in this political institution. In spite of all the fine pleas we have from Government members, it remains a fact and a political reality in South Africa that every responsible and effective decision that is taken about the destiny of all the people in this country emanates from this House. It is because we have centralized the power here that it is also the centre of conflict in South Africa. One can ask any Black man&#x2014;I presume members of the official Opposition have also done so on various occasions&#x2014;and he will tell you that this is the real institution which is at issue in South Africa. To him this is where his life is determined and where his opportunities are created or withheld from him. Because this is so, the final result thereof is simply that the Government&#x2014;it does not matter whether it is the Nationalist Party or any other Government &#x2014;have to create an administrative bureaucracy which governs the lives of 70% of the people in South Africa. It has no option, and this is the source of political stability in South Africa. It is not Parliament: it is not even the constraining legislation we have; it is not even the communal systems or electorate colleges which we create for the different peoples. Political stability does not lie in this; political stability lies in the administrative structure that is created, for example, Bantu councils and government departments, which regulates the lives of people on a daily basis. For that reason it is inevitably linked to this type of government we have. That is why our policy lays down that there should be a federal political structure in South Africa.</p>

<p>Are you against stability?</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Not at all. Where we are in favour of a federal political structure in South Africa, it means something different to us than what it means to the official Opposition, namely, that one decentralizes powers to political units and define provinces geographically. I have had great appreciation for the statement of the hon. the member for Randburg that we should extend the borders of the provinces in a federal set-up, but even if we were to have such a federal structure the qualified vote will nevertheless not be <span class="col_351-352" refersTo="page_0191"/>a feasible political measure, because this in itself is inadequate. There is no guarantee that minorities would not be able to exercise political power in an arbitrary manner under the guise of the central political institution. This is exactly the problem we are dealing with at the moment, namely that there is a White minority in South Africa which, in terms of its group interests, which is quite understandable, uses political power to entrench its interests. These interests are not only of a cultural nature, as has been said by the hon. the member for Pinelands, but are also economical and political interests. This is what constitutes the source of conflict in South Africa. To the extent that the Whites monopolize the political power, it means, to the same extent, that the other peoples and groups in South Africa&#x2014;Black groups, Coloured groups and Indian groups&#x2014;are unable to obtain instruments with which to develop themselves. It is so simple and we cannot get away from it. It is no use drawing up constitutional blue-prints and tell people to &#x201C;uplift yourselves&#x201D;. People uplift themselves in proportion to the effective political decisions they are able to take. This is one of the major problems in South Africa today. Therefore, it is also a fundamental aspect of our policy that one must have a very rigid constitution which includes a charter of human and civil rights which are guaranteed. Perhaps it may be said that constitutions exist everywhere in the world &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to assure hon. members that I am aware of these questions and that I am now trying to answer them. I am dealing with these questions now, and if my answers do not satisfy the hon. members, we can even discuss them at a later stage. However, my time is very limited and I should like to come back to my speech. That is why a charter within a rigid constitution is an important element, together with a federal political structure, but a constitutional blue print in itself is not enough. We also have to consider the political realities of South Africa itself. We have large-scale social, economical and educational inequality, and this is what really constitutes the source of conflict. Between Black and White there are these differences, these conflicts, and they must be removed. I believe the hon. the Minister of Planning is in earnest to do so, but to us it is important that this should be done as quickly as possible, because to the extent in which the differences between Whites and non-Whites are removed in the economic, social and educational spheres, in other words, reach greater equality, to the same extent the intensity of conflict and aggression between the two groups is going to diminish. It is in this context that we must consider the qualified vote. To discuss the qualified vote out of this context, is to talk political nonsense.</p>

<p>&#x2020;And what does qualified franchise mean within this context? It means that the Progressive Party stands for the right of every South African to qualify for full franchise, and insists that the means to qualify must be made available to all South Africans as rapidly as possible. It also means that the Progressive Party rejects any franchise proposal which makes race the only criterion for participation in politics. Thirdly it means that the Progressive Party proposes the continuous extension of franchise rights to those who attain the defined qualifications and of all of the educational, economic and other opportunities which are necessary to make up those qualifications.</p>

<p>What are those qualifications?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite clear. We have told you a hundred times already. The underlying acceptance of the qualified vote is very simple. These are evolutionary political measures through which effective political participation could be transferred to all South Africans. I can say even at this stage, for the benefit of hon. members who refer to this matter so often, that the political commission set up by the Progressive Party is prepared to consider any alternative and even to suspend the qualified vote should there be a more effective way of effecting this evolutionary transfer. This is precisely what it is all about. It should now be clear to everyone that the Progressive Party is indissolubly committed to the sharing of power in South Africa. This is a difference which exists between us and the Government, and this will continually be an element in our arguments involving discrimination and progress. We cannot get away from it. We have to debate those points. There may be members on both the Opposition and the Government side who say: But this is not going to work. <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0192"/>I can at least say that there are historical precedents where federal systems are, in fact, working. They are there.</p>

<p>Where?</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Switzerland, the U.S.A, and many others. Of one thing I am quite certain, i.e. that there are no historical precedents for what this Government is trying to do. The simple point I want to make, is that there are many historical lessons to be learned from the dilemma in which South Africa finds herself today. It is that an élite minority, with a monopoly of political and economic power, will, as a result of economic and social developments, continually be forced by the majorities in the country to make concessions. This is inevitable. The only alternative is to refuse to do so, but this is merely going to aggravate conflict. This is exactly the position in which we find ourselves at the moment. The Government must make concessions whether or not it wants to do so and although it means well it is compelled to make concessions because it has no alternative. For this reason it is the attitude of this party that when one starts making these concessions one should give very careful consideration to the logical outcome of the concessions one is making. We can consider what happened with the disappearance of the feudal system in Europe and with the coming of industrialization. There has always been a struggle for social and economic rights which, after these have been obtained, revolved around political participation. It seems to me this is a problem South Africa cannot ignore. At some stage or other, whether it is by means of a qualified vote or another system, the Government of this country will have to deal with the question of how to enable all the people of our country to participate in effective political action. If this is not done, the alternative is, as our hon. the Prime Minister has said, too serious even to consider. When the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education and even the hon. the Minister of Defence say that we as a party deliberately propagate the abdication of the Whites, I want to differ from him and I do so in all sincerity. I have no need to say that we must abdicate. However, what is really at issue? I have no need to lose my own self-preservation. But what does self-preservation mean to the Whites in South Africa? I think the hon. member for Pinelands spelled it out quite clearly when he said that self-preservation does not concern a cultural identity or religion. One can practise one&#x2019;s religion; in fact, people in Eastern Europe practise their religion in prisons and catacombs. It does not concern the cultural aspects of the existence of a person as a member of a cultural group. I think the Government has proved itself that there is no distinction between Jews, English, Afrikaners, Portuguese and Germans; they are all Whites. Therefore &#x201C;race&#x201D; is an integral part of this situation, and every Black man considers it as such. He notices the emphasizing of ethnic group solidarity for the Black people as a deliberate effort to divide and rule. It is not I who say this. But there are ample indications that this is the case and that there is a deliberate effort to divide and rule. As long as this attitude prevails, this Government will, while desperately clinging to power in South Africa, constitute the greatest single danger to the Whites in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to dwell on what was said by the hon. member for Rondebosch. He made a few statements, and I want to tell him that the policy which he advocated contained a few stimulating ideas. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that the fundamental difference between their side of the House and us was that we did not believe in the sharing of power. I want to ask him, however, whether he does not know the way things go in Africa. Sharing of power leads to seizure of power, and this applies throughout. For that reason the great colonial powers had to abdicate. One of the most powerful anchors for the preservation of a people as a people is precisely that it should retain the political power in its hands. This is a powerful anchor for the preservation of a people. That is the difference. Let the hon. member come along with this so-called new political structure of his. It is nothing but the old structure of franchise for all civilized people, irrespective of race and colour. It is just that the hon. member, as a doctor and a professor, has presented the thing in respectable dress, that is all. I want to say what the difference is between this side and that side of the House. We believe that we can guarantee our survival in South Africa only when we have a policy in terms of which every nation can be led to self-determination in its own right. While the Opposition speaks of the deep-rooted and inherent differences in civilization and culture between the various population groups, <span class="col_355-356" refersTo="page_0193"/>they nevertheless want to lead all those people along the same parliamentary mechanism, although the conflict outside concerns the possession of power. Surely this must necessarily sow the seeds of a political conflict of which the hon. member spoke. Eventually it will lead to a Babel of confusion and a volcanic eruption, on that convention they want to arrange as well.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to dwell on this, for I know that other hon. members will deal with the hon. member. Where I have risen from this bench today, I want to tell the hon. Chief Whip that I have now really experienced that, as far as speaking turns are concerned, &#x201C;it is more blessed to give than to receive&#x201D;. At this late hour, they say, I have 20 minutes or so to make a few statements here. I want to devote the greater part of my speech today to a speech made by the hon. member for Durban Central. I want to devote it to two very important statements which he made here. His first statement took the form of a question. The question which he asked the House was, &#x201C;What concerns me and what I would like to know is whether the White people, our people, are sufficiently motivated and prepared to assist whatever Government is in power to bring about those changes&#x201D;. The hon. member asks whether our people are motivated for the changes which are coming. I want to tell him that this is a very important question in the sense &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>I hope that you do not only hear, but also understand what you are hearing. The hon. member has asked a very important question. If there has ever been a time in the history of South Africa when great demands were made on us as a White nation and on all parliamentarians, that time is today. There is no doubt about the fact that our nation is faced with relentless and unmerciful circumstances. They know that there are difficult and delicate matters which have to be handled. They know that there are great and thorny problems which are crying out for solutions. It is right of the hon. member to ask whether our nation is motivated to handle this situation and these complicated problems. I want to give the hon. member the assurance today that under the leadership of the hon. the Prime Minister, a National Government and a nation such as ours, all these situations, problems and circumstances will be accepted as challenges. I want to give him the assurance, too, that this nation is convinced that it will possess the necessary courage, patience, faith, self-confidence, penetrating depth of thought, and to a large extent the capacity for self-examination as well, which will enable it to meet these problems and to solve them.</p>

<p>The hon. member has spoken here of a mental attitude. He asked whether the people were properly motivated. I want to tell him&#x2014;he is worried, of course&#x2014;that there are three kinds of mental attitudes which you find in the country if you go into the matter as a member of Parliament and if you are concerned with these compelling and urgent national circumstances. The first is that of fear. The hon. member for Mooi River also spoke about fear the other day. He said one should not give way to fear. But does he want me to be brave and to follow his policy and so to plunge into the abyss with my face shining with courage? Surely I cannot do that. Unfortunately there is a part of our nation, although a small part, which is panic-stricken. This is a dangerous mental attitude, for a nation which at a time such as this is panic-stricken about what is happening in the world and in our own country very easily dies. Therefore it is dangerous if one becomes panic-stricken and unbelieving, if one throws up one&#x2019;s hands in despair and says that the world belongs to the rich and the strong. This is dangerous. It is a form of cowardice if one gets cold feet in the middle of the stream. In fact, in an hour of crisis it is very close to treachery. This is the one attitude and approach which unfortunately one finds among a number of people in the country, those who get cold feet. There are also some other people in the country that I am worried about. They may be people of my own flesh and blood, there may be some of them among our Afrikaners and perhaps among the English-speaking people as well&#x2014;I do not know. I am referring to those people who, when we are faced with a challenge, adopt an attitude of provocation, a kind of stubborn recalcitrance. That is the trouble. They are people who care nothing about world opinion or equal human dignity.</p>

<p>I want to make it quite clear that this group is full of hatred. You cannot solve a problem with <span class="col_357-358" refersTo="page_0194"/>hatred. You cannot solve a problem with emotion. Hatred consumes the person who hates, and when you are dealing with a relations problem, you must display the right attitude. This small group of people acts in a spirit which makes me think of the proverbial mouse who gets drunk and then challenges the cat. They will even attack the world in the face of world opinion, in the face of the U.N. and in the face of everything. They take up an attitude and they believe that we should take no account of the outside world or of events in Africa. This, too, is dangerous. This is recklessness, and recklessness and cowardice, these two mental attitudes, are equally dangerous.</p>

<p>However, there is a third approach, and this is the approach of the National Party and of the National Government. This approach is that you should analyse the problem, that you should not think with your heart, but with your head. You should distanciate yourself from the problem. You should analyse the problem. If you have done that, you have acted according to common sense. In this country of ours, where we have a complex and unique problem, we can also have a dialogue diplomacy. I am not against consultation, and when you have approached the problem from all sides, you are able to find clarity and truth. Therefore I want to tell the hon. member that he need not be concerned. Our nation is motivated. What is it motivated by? It is motivated by the National Government, by the policy of the National Party, a policy which is nothing but a policy based on the philosophy which grew out of the experience which the White man has gained of the Black man and which we are using to solve the problem of race relations in our fatherland.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>The section of my party which believes in this is almost as big as the hon. member who is interrupting me. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I really do apologize to the hon. member I did not mean to say that. The hon. member is not at all a stupid member, but really, he seems to me to be at his most intelligent when he keeps quiet.</p>

<p>I should now like to consider the question of whether our nation is motivated. I think I know what I am talking about here, for I have been actively engaged in politics for about 32 years, and you will not blame me for saying that I have fairly close contact with our people. Do you know what I am finding in these days? I am finding that there is a deep and sincere desire on the part of almost the whole White population for a permanent and equitable solution to this relations problem to be found as soon as possible. In the second place our population has been so motivated and educated by the exchange of ideas in the past that our nation as a whole says today that there should be freedom of development. They say that every opportunity should be created to enable every person, irrespective of race or colour, to experience full freedom of development. We have made progress. We have educated people. This is the motivation of our nation. In the third place, however&#x2014;and this is perhaps the essence of this debate&#x2014;the people of South Africa say that the day has come for us to look at race discrimination. Does this not mean that we are making progress? We must not be frightened of this. We must not be frightened of race discrimination.</p>

<p>The hon. member should please refrain from arguing with me about things on which we are agreed. All of us in this House say that we are against race discrimination. I want to say today that I think the time has come for us in South Africa to define the words &#x201C;race discrimination&#x201D; as a political concept, so that we may get clarity about this concept. We have become bogged down in confused and clouded thinking in this regard. One has to be either an idiot or a genius to understand the interpretation given by some people to the question of discrimination or differentiation. For that reason I say: Let us now be clear about this.</p>

<p>This is where I get to the second statement made by the hon. member. He said, &#x201C;The Government has been hampered by its policy and political philosophy which&#x2014; I want to state it again here&#x2014;is, of course, based on prejudice and discrimination.&#x201D; The hon. member has not been in politics as long as I have, but still I cannot understand how the hon. member can say that our policy is based on discrimination. Surely he knows that this is not so. Our policy is nothing more or less than a method for removing discrimination. For that reason I blame the hon. leader of the United Party <span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0195"/>in Natal for having told me that apartheid and discrimination are almost identical.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has pointed in a speech that we are following a method; that it is our policy eventually to carry the method to its logical conclusion, so that discrimination will disappear. I want to read a few quotations to you, Mr. Speaker. I want to quote what was said by Dr. Verwoerd in the Budget Committee on 14 April 1961. This is very important, for hon. members opposite always say that Dr. Verwoerd was the architect of the policy of separate development. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">That is why I constantly try to explain that I believe that our policy is one in terms of which it will be possible in due course to avoid all discrimination. Hon. members opposite do not believe that that is going to be the outcome of the policy of apartheid. I do believe it.</block>

<p>Do hon. members on that side believe what was said here by Dr. Verwoerd?</p>

<p>Oh, you do not believe it? Then there is something wrong with your belief.</p>

<p>Dr. Verwoerd also went on to say in that speech (column 4618)&#x2014;and this is interesting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is just as much a motive of the Government here as it is a motive of any of the other countries in the world, <i>inter alia,</i> those I mentioned. However, those countries do not want to view our policy in that light. They want to view our policy in the way they interpret it, viz. that we want to dominate and oppress for ever &#x2026; As we developed our policy and put our case more clearly, <i>inter alia,</i> having regard to the latest world developments, we arrived at this clear standpoint that discrimination must be eliminated by carrying separation far enough.</block>

<p>Perhaps I should just quote the following as well, and then I want to address a few words to the Opposition in all amity&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And the Government is trying, by means of its policy, to escape from the dilemma. We may still have to apply certain forms of discrimination during the period of transition, and during this period there may be White domination, but the basis of our policy is to try to escape from this.</block>

<p>Sir, I came to this House of Assembly in the year 1943. At that time we were still a small and a formidable Opposition, an Opposition which was not a negative resistance movement, but which took up a positive attitude. It was during that year in particular, during 1943, that the National Party Government, under the leadership of Dr. Malan, thought out the great and thorny colour or relations problem to its logical conclusion. It was during those years, too, during that same period, the war years, that new ideologies and new schools of thought almost literally burst upon the world everywhere. It was clear from debates in this House at that time that they were of the opinion that race hatred was one of the causes which had given rise to the Second World War. It was striking how in those years, and after the war as well, a tremendous aversion was built up to all forms of race hatred. Today the world does not want to allow one nation or one race to be subordinate to another in the same fatherland. That was a time when concepts such as freedom of development or equal human dignity spread over the world with lightning speed and the developing nations, particularly the Western nations, said that they should help the underdeveloped nations. They regarded colonialism as an evil and race discrimination as a deadly sin. It was against that background that we formulated our policy. I think the hon. members will remember that when race discrimination became the focus of world interest after the World War, when the new world order came about, at that time, when the U.N. was created as an organization which was to neutralize the conflict between nations and to defuse situations of tension in order that there might be world peace, we thought and re-thought and reflected deeply on our policy. Those members, too, have been thinking now for 26 years. They used to sit and think but now they are just sitting. I said that it was in those years that we reflected deeply on our policy of separate development. We thought that we should now devote this whole policy to an attempt to escape from this complex dilemma of race relations in our father land. At the time when we were doing that, of course, we were also <span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0196"/>one of the joint architects of the U.N. We thought that we should find an answer to all these changes and tendencies which had jolted countries and continents into a new awareness. What standpoint would we adopt as a party? That was when we thought the whole policy out as we did and eventually embodied it in the manifesto of 1948. And allow me to say at once that our whole policy is really an answer to the challenge of change. After all, we know that we are living in a changing world. We know that the world has been drawn into a circle of change. All changes for the good represent progress, national progress, and for that reason we formulated our policy in such a way as to enable us to get away from discrimination. And then we produced a set of basic principles. I want hon. members to pay attention to me when I say that this set of basic principles, our policy, is not going to disappear when discriminatory measures or offensive elements are eventually removed. For our policy consists of three components, i.e. the set of basic principles, the course it will take and the ultimate and immediate aims. What did we embody in the manifesto, that set of basic principles? The fundamental principle, the preservation of identity. There are the preservation of sovereignty and the principle of justice, and self-determination and self-development. These are all so many principles. One finds them all over the world. One invests them with universality. Everywhere these will be accepted as principles. Now I want to say today that after 26 years of National Government the set of basic principles underlying the policy of separate development is still intact. When the hon. members see changes here today, they must not think these are concessions; they represent nothing but the development and adjustment of the policy of separate development. [Interjections.] The hon. member may laugh as much as he likes. &#x201C;A smile worth while is the smile you smile when you don&#x2019;t want to smile.&#x201D; That is an embarrassed little laugh on the part of that hon. member, but he cannot laugh away a fact. The hon. member should not try to do that. He can be friendly without laughing in that funny way. I want to say, therefore, that this is the basis. We shall introduce changes, but they will be changes for the good. We shall make adjustments. When you live in a country and you find yourself in a dilemma of complex race relations, you should try to escape. You should make adjustments. What is wrong with adjustments? After all, one even adjusts one&#x2019;s necktie, and what is wrong with that? Only they should not be the wrong adjustments. The trouble is that that party thinks we are going to make the wrong adjustments. No, we are not going to make the wrong adjustments. We have motivated our nation so strongly that we shall make the adjustments in this way, and things that are seen as adjustments and changes are nothing but the development of the policy of separate development of the National Government.</p>

<p>I do not have much time left to speak. I have been able to speak in Parliament for long enough and now I have been allowed only 20 minutes. I think the Chief Whip said that I may only speak for 15 minutes, did he not? [Interjections.] Nevertheless I want to make it very clear that as far as our domestic policy is concerned, it is indissolubly bound up with our Africa policy, while our Africa policy is bound up with our whole foreign policy. It goes without saying, after all, that when we are dealing with a problem in regard to the attitude of the outside world, its solution will depend on our attitude in regard to our domestic policy. &#x201C;No man is an island entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.&#x201D; It goes without saying that we have to set right our domestic relations, which will eventually influence the Africa policy and ultimately link up with the policies of the outside world. We must find our way into the world through Africa, and by doing that, we shall eventually be able to breathe more freely internationally. We shall then have right of say in the international trade pattern of the world, as well as in many other fields of international life.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>May I be allowed to proceed? The hon. member said there is a difference between discrimination and differentiation. I should like to point out to him that the discrimination applied by this Government is exactly the same as the differentiation that they wish to apply. It is discrimination and one cannot get away from it.</p>

<p>The hon. members opposite have shown great interest in the internal affairs of the United Party in order to divert attention from their shortcomings and the ineffectiveness of the Government in meeting the crises of the day. I want to tell them, to satisfy their curiosity, why our caucus has taken certain action against the member for Randburg. The member has been expelled from the caucus, a serious step for any caucus to take. It is, in fact, the most severe sanction it can impose. Now what was the gravamen of the charge against the member for Randburg? It is that he initiated an opinion poll which was framed in such a way that he knew, or should have known, that it would embarrass his colleagues and his leader, and that he was responsible for the publication of material which was detrimental to the party.</p>

<p>The first question we must ask is whether a member responsible for taking a public opinion poll is committing any offence and if the poll itself is undesirable. Of course not! If he wants the information for his own purposes and he holds the poll in his own constituency, if it is not conducted scientifically, that is his own affair. But if he wishes to publish the results and gets involved with the constituencies of other colleagues, one would expect him to respect protocol and to have the courtesy to advise them. If he intends publishing the results or making them available to possible hostile influences, one would expect him to make sure that it is done scientifically and that the public are told, for example, the number of respondents in each constituency, whether the voters were taken from the roll, that they were in the right proportion and that the questions are not loaded in the way in which they are framed. What are the details of the poll which was set in motion by the hon. member for Randburg? Firstly, his questions were loaded in the way in which they were framed and sought to establish the strength of the so-called reformists if they should break away from the party. It has been the party&#x2019;s consistent policy to maintain its internal unity and to counter the exaggerated and provocative publicity that the Press has given to such differences as have in fact arisen. Secondly, it sought to create the illusion that the personal position of the party leader and the party&#x2019;s <span class="col_365-366" refersTo="page_0198"/>effectiveness under his leadership were directly challenged by a rival candidate within the party. Thirdly, and most important, when the hon. member knew that these questions had in the past provoked a response along the lines along which they were directed, he used the Argus Group to expand the poll and to give it wider publicity. He did this without reference to his leader or any other person of authority in the party. He did not have the courtesy even to tell his own provincial chairman that he had conducted a poll in his constituency. No matter how he reasoned, he cannot possibly contend that his action was one of loyalty carried out in the interests of the party. He is not unintelligent and he is not naïve. He must have known the full consequences of his actions. It was a deliberate course of action the results of which could have been foreseen. But supposing he had acted in ignorance, he was left in no doubt as to the attitude of his colleagues in the caucus. If he had acted <i>bona fide</i> one would have expected an apology or an act of contrition. But there has been no word of regret for any harm he may have done to the party, his leader or his colleagues. Instead he has been defiant in the face of general condemnation of his behaviour. There was no alternative for his colleagues but to view his action as one of the grossest disloyalty to them and their leader and to find that his conduct was incompatible with continued membership of the caucus. In the discussion in the caucus there was absolutely no difference of opinion on the aims and the principles of the party as the Press has been at pains to suggest. We in the caucus have taken the action which we have thought fit. It is now up to other bodies in the party to investigate and to do what they think fit in the circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as a person who has known the United Party for so many years, I find this statement of the Chief Whip very strange. When Gen. Hertzog, one of the founders of this party, was the leader of the party, we would neither have had a statement such as the one made by the hon. member for Yeoville in respect of the hon. member for Randburg this afternoon, nor the one that had to be made by the Chief Whip, because a leader of a party would make statements of this nature himself if necessary. However, if the Leader is really in control of that party, such a statement will always be unnecessary. I cannot help smiling when I think of what would happen to members on this side of the House should they be guilty of such behaviour. On our way to the caucus room, each one of us would, in such a case, lose quite a few pounds in weight. This is the difference between one kind of leader and another kind, to which I should like to refer later.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me to say that 36 or 37 years ago I was very close to the party leadership of the United Party. This United Party was founded in 1934. One of the founders was the representative of the constituency of Smithfield, the then Prime Minister, Gen. Hertzog. I was born and bred in Smithfield. In other words, as a young man I was well acquainted with that leader as leader of the National Party. My father was a member of the Provincial Council at the time of the coalition in the United Party, something which brought me even closer to the leadership in those days. What is more, I lost my mother at a very early age and my father was married to the youngest daughter of the youngest brother of Gen. Hertzog. You will appreciate that, as a young man, I was very close to the United Party when it was founded. After all that had happened that party was founded towards the end of 1932 and at the beginning of 1933. Those were important days in the political history of South Africa. Those of us who joined that party just prior to, during and immediately after the provincial elections of 1936, found on looking back that, in spite of all the assurances given by Gen. Smuts, there were people sitting in that United Party who held different views on different aspects. In those days there was not much the people in the United Party were able to do about this. Gen. Hertzog joined that United Party with the best of intentions. Gen. Hertzog had many shortcomings &#x2014;if anyone was familiar with those shortcomings, it was I&#x2014;but two shortcomings he did not have: he was always unimpeachably honest and he was unable to tell a lie. In that United Party the attitude of Gen. Smuts was different. There were seven points of agreement which he accepted.</p>

<speech by="#pansegrouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in the few minutes I had at my disposal last night, I referred, against the background of the problems within the United Party, to its founding in 1934. I also referred briefly to the fact that not long after the founding of the United Party it became clear to General Hertzog and some of his followers that it was accommodating people with varying standpoints concerning matters of importance in South African and foreign politics. I also referred briefly to the fact that it was impossible for a party to resist crises when that party had to accommodate people with varying points of view concerning cardinal standpoints. Without wishing to show off, I referred to the fact that owing to circumstances I was very close to the party leadership in those days and that as a young boy I became acquainted with circumstances within the United Party and the circumstances that followed. I began by saying that those movements were within the party, but owing to strong party leadership it was possible to effect reconciliation within the party for a time. However, the test to which the party was put on 4 September 1939 was too much.</p>

<p>The United Party split in half from top to bottom. The motion of the leader of the United Party was defeated in the House of Assembly and he had to step aside as the first leader of the United Party. The fact I want to state this afternoon, is that the first leader of the United Party spent the last days of his life as a tragic figure, on his farm in the Witbank district. The United Party continued under the leadership of its new leader, the former deputy leader, Gen. Smuts. The United Party lost much of its support, viz. Gen. Hertzog and his followers, but gained a mass of people, from Col. Stallard to Mr. Madeley, from the other side. Whereas there had previously been two distinct schools of thought in the United Party, there were now half a dozen. This fact remains true, that one cannot have people with varying standpoints concerning certain matters in one and the same party. During the war the United Party, under the leadership of Gen. Smuts, came to the fore as a strong party. It achieved an overwhelming victory in the 1943 election.</p>

<p>However this party carried within itself the seeds of destruction owing to the reasons I have just mentioned. We thought that Gen. Smuts was in an unassailably strong position. And yet, in the 1948 election, he lost not only the Government but also his own seat at Standerton. This second leader of the United Party, who was a mighty South African world statesman met his end as the second leader of the United Party and he, too, ended as a tragic figure. Then the United Party came under the leadership of Mr. Strauss. Under his leadership the United Party was still a party consisting of people who were not like-minded. There was soon a murmuring and a rumbling within the United Party under the leadership of Mr. Strauss. He entered the 1953 election with that important slogan that we still remember: &#x201C;Vote for the right to vote again.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that slogan Mr. Strauss lost the election. The rumbling in his party increased and, as if it were already a well-trodden path, Mr. Strauss again succeeded <span class="col_369-370" refersTo="page_0200"/>in losing an influential section of his supporters. Within the United Party there was dissatisfaction. They said: &#x201C;We cannot go on with a leader who is unable to lead us to victory in an election.&#x201D; While Mr. Strauss was abroad, members of the United Party here at home saw fit to carry out a <i>coup d&#x2019;etat</i> within the United Party; something which became fairly common in Africa later on. Fortunately Mr. Strauss injured his ankle skiing while he was abroad since later this spared the members of the United Party a great deal of embarrassment. When he returned to South Africa and they met him at the airport, they were able to look at his injured leg instead of his eyes. [Interjections.] Thus the third leader of the United Party also ended his political career as a tragic figure. Each of the three leaders of the United Party ended his career as a tragic figure in South African politics.</p>

<p>When they got rid of Mr. Strauss, their slogan&#x2014;and now I am only talking about my United Party friends in the Smithfield area&#x2014;was: &#x201C;Now we have a leader; he was born to rule; with this leader we shall win back the power and glory of the United Party.&#x201D; At that time the Leader of the Opposition had everything on his side: A pleasant personality and he was a strong leader. What this hon. leader and these people forgot, was that one cannot lead a party comprised of people with differing points of view concerning matters of cardinal importance.</p>

<p>To me, who was close to Gen. Hertzog as I have said, his expulsion and his tragic end were terrible to experience. Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I am pleased to have had this opportunity. As an impetuous young man in those days I set myself the task, however, great or small my contribution would be and for however short or long a period I should be able to make a contribution, to co-operate with the National Party and its leaders in bringing about the destruction of the United Party. I just mention this in passing and I shall come back to it shortly. Sir De Villiers Graaff, the present leader of the United Party, had to lead this party from victory to victory, but instead he has led it from crisis to crisis and from split to split and in this way he has gradually been losing his best men. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is leading this party from election defeat to election defeat and now we have come to this motion of no-confidence which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has thought fit to propose against the greatest leader in the Western world and his Government.</p>

<p>While this motion has been under discussion, certain things have been happening. While we have been occupied here with a motion of no-confidence, the United Party, according to the evidence of the hon. Leader and the hon. member for Yeoville, has come to realize that it has once again lost one of its very best men. When I look round, I see that the hon. member for Yeoville, the Leader of the United Party in the Transvaal, is not here to support his leader, the Leader of the Opposition. He, who also has some knowledge of this House, knows what his Leader and his Party will have to endure this afternoon under the lash of the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>I do not want to hold up the House any longer this afternoon. But I do just want to tell you one thing. We shall find that the evidence is already there that the Leader of the Opposition, the fourth leader of the United Party, is already a tragic figure in South African politics. It is as if there is a curse on that party to make each of its leaders walk this well-trodden path. I think that all of us can say that we have great respect for him as a person, but as a political leader, this we must tell you, he has failed hopelessly. What happened yesterday about the young people in the United Party, not the Young Turks sitting here, is already history. And it seems to us as if the United Party has been weakening steadily while this motion of no confidence has been in progress.</p>

<p>I made a personal confession in order to tell you what I undertook. I am going to sit down now. I have here in my hand the last speech, already a little yellowed, made by Gen. Hertzog. In the pouring rain, and while we were all getting soaked, he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I stand before you stripped of all official authority. I am once again only an ordinary citizen.</block>

<p>He made his great speech at Smithfield and he referred to the United Party. Here, in his own handwriting, is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I now come to the destruction of the United South African National Party by Gen. Smuts and by his friends, through their participation in the war. The United South African National Party is dead.</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_371-372" refersTo="page_0201"/>It will not rise again. The name of the Party may well be retained, but after the political outrage in which the party has visibly been engaged on and since 4 September, if not even earlier, its aim and striving will never again be the same as that for which it was founded. Consider for a moment with what warm enthusiasm Gen. Smuts and Col. Stallard would work together and exert themselves to govern the country in a spirit of &#x201C;South Africa first.&#x201D;</block>

<p>On 4 November 1939 Gen. Hertzog said that the party was dead. I believed it then. But, like a decapitated chicken they go on kicking, and the time has now arrived when I may tell them that they should stop kicking; they are stone dead. I have lived to see the day when a self-imposed task, however slight my contribution may have been &#x2014;that is neither here nor there&#x2014;has been carried out and the United Party destroyed.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we had to sit and listen here this afternoon to the hon. member for Smith-field telling us how he waited for the death of the United Party during his childhood days in Smithfield. He has been waiting for 40 years, Sir. He is also keen to attend the funeral, and at that funeral he will be prepared to play any role, except that of silent witness. Sir, when one listens to his eloquence, especially on this matter and related matters, then one wonders what the other reasons could be which prevent the hon. the Prime Minister from promoting that senior member to a higher post. Perhaps I could make a suggestion: I think the point really is that the humoristic member for Smithfield is at his funniest when he is trying to be serious.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, I want to refer very briefly in the time available to me to a concept of image politics which appears to dominate the political scene at the present time. It was the custom years ago for politics to be conducted on the basis of policies clearly stated and clearly understood. The modern trend, Sir, under the pressure perhaps of the public media, has been to move towards an image politics where in fact voters vote for symbols such as, shall we say. Heath versus Wilson, or Nixon versus Kennedy, where in fact they symbolize each party and take their votes accordingly. Sir, I believe this trend has reached South Africa; I believe that there is a tendency in South Africa to judge parties by symbols, by images, and not by their policies. Sir, this is something which has its impact on parties, and I believe it has had an impact on his party, an impact which has caused some of the difficulties from which we now suffer. My time is limited and I cannot pursue this matter at any length, but I want to say that so far as this party is concerned, none of the difficulties that have arisen affect its basic aims or principles, arise from its basic policies or involve any challenge to its leadership. Sir, these are the elements which bind this party together, and despite what the hon. member for Smithfield has said, that we have elements in this party that cannot sit together, I believe that there is a binding force, a view of life, a concept of South Africa, that will continue to bind this party together for many years to come. The hon. member for Smithfield looks forward to attending the funeral of the United Party. I wish him a long life. Sir, it is on the basis of these fundamental policies that we have criticized the Government&#x2019;s conduct of affairs on the basis of three main points in our motion. Briefly, the first was the Government&#x2019;s failure to grasp the real nature of our opportunities and responsibilities in Southern Africa; the second was the Government&#x2019;s failure to act decisively in creating conditions in which people in South West Africa may proceed to self-determination; and the third was its failure to attend to discriminatory policies in South Africa that impede our advance to peace and security. Sir, on these three points in the motion we have had a very slight, inadequate reply to the first leg. We have seen that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs has taken his defensive position on the basis of a list of achievements in Southern Africa, and we recognize and applaud those achievements. But, Sir, they are no more than a list of achievements and there has been no evidence whatsoever of that greater vision, of that greater purpose, for which we plead.</p>

<p>He came here like Don Quixote riding the gaunt nag of domestic jurisdiction. When he deals with these matters, as when great issues such as those relating to matters of energy or minorities were presented to him, he immediately takes refuge in the old traditional defence that any such action could be thought to be an interference in the domestic jurisdiction of other States or of our own and should, therefore, be dis <span class="col_373-374" refersTo="page_0202"/>carded without more ado. Sir, this is a threadbare policy; it is an out-of-date-policy. I believe that contracts or treaties between self-governing States, freely accepted, do not constitute domestic intervention and I believe that it is entirely illogical to argue against the expansion of our Southern African interests on the basis that this could lead to intervention in each others&#x2019; domestic affairs.</p>

<p>He was followed, Sir, by Sancho Panza riding a donkey. This Sancho Panza is the Minister of the Interior, who has certain views on foreign affairs. It is he who descries giants and finds out that they are windmills. I believe that Sancho Panza could take advice from Cervantes, who wrote the story and who said: &#x201C;Would it not be better to stay peacefully at home and not roam about seeking better worlds and better bread than is made of corn?&#x201D;</p>

<p>On South West Africa we wait to hear from the hon. the Prime Minister what his reply is to our criticisms. We sincerely wish him well in the progress that we feel must be made in reaching a solution of this stormy and difficult problem. It is a grave impediment to the advance of South Africa. We have not yet had a satisfactory reply, Sir, and we look forward this afternoon hopefully to hearing from the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>On the third leg of the accusation, discrimination, we have heard many speeches, both offensive and defensive, but the real question remains. In South Africa the overwhelming factor is the growth of this country. We do not approach this thing in a mood of prophecy. I believe that anybody who can do arithmetic and calculate compound interest can play this game. The facts are there. They are available from the Department of Statistics and they are available from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. Is or is not this country going to proceed in the next quarter of a century from a population of 25 million now to a population of 50 million? Will we have to increase our economy at an even greater rate of growth? Is it a fact that if we have a population of 50 million we will need at least something like 5 million occupying the higher managerial, technical and professional occupations in the country? Is it not a fact that the White population, cannot supply more than 2 million, at the highest, of these people? That leaves 3 million people to be supplied within 25 years from the ranks of our Brown and Black people. Where are these people to come from? Do you realize, Sir, that if these people are aged 40 in the year 2000 they are already 15 years old now? Where are the technical schools, where are the universities, where are the technical colleges? Sir, these things have to be done and they have to be done urgently. We cannot conceal the sense of urgency which we feel is required to deal with this situation, because if we do not deal with it we are going to join the Third World. We will slip back. These things have to be done. These social, economic and political adjustments will have to be made. I have said that the people who will be 40 years old doing these jobs, the economically active people in our country by the year 2000, are already 15 years old. Yet we find a total lack of urgency. We have heard replies from the hon. gentlemen from the frontbenches. Sir, it was like listening to a row of extinct or semi-extinct volcanoes.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was advised, on this of all occasions, to move a motion of no confidence in this Government, and consequently in me. In doing so he demonstrated that neither he nor his advisers seem to have any knowledge of the realities of South African politics today. While elementary courtesy requires me to confine myself to the motion of no confidence, I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will himself concede that neither the needs nor the realities of today really require one to pay any attention to it. When the Leader of the Opposition introduces a motion of no confidence at this particular juncture, something to which I shall return, what should be taken into consideration? <span class="col_375-376" refersTo="page_0203"/>What should be taken into consideration is the feeling of people outside this House. I make so bold as to say&#x2014;and I am standing here, because the responsibility is mine, as a profoundly grateful person&#x2014;that it is not only the Nationalists, not only the elderly people outside, but the vast majority of our people, young and old, and in particular the young ones in these days, who have appreciation and respect for and confidence in the way in which this Government is directing South Africa&#x2019;s affairs. In addition it is not only our people, Sir. I think the hon. the Leader must be as aware of this as I am, for even people who normally supported him, even people who would normally perhaps vote for him again tomorrow, or the day after, or when an election is held, have confidence in the way in which matters are being handled today.</p>

<p>Since the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has laid a charge of no confidence against me, you will pardon me if I speak very frankly to him on this occasion. If the hon. Leader is not being informed as to what the feeling outside is, then I consider it my duty to tell him: My opinion&#x2014; this is what I have experienced&#x2014;is that the people outside are not angry with you. The people outside are not saying ugly things about you. But do you know what the people are saying? They are saying that you cannot look ahead because you have: to keep glancing over your shoulder. They are saying that you cannot look ahead and you cannot adopt a standpoint because you first have to glance over your left shoulder and then over your right shoulder. They say that you have lost your political personality in that process, and I think there is substance in that charge. They do not despise you, but what is happening to you &#x2014;and this is the worst thing that can happen to a politician in South Africa and, for that matter, in any country&#x2014;is that they are ignoring you. The hon. Leader has, I make so bold as to say this, demonstrated with this motion and the way in which he introduced it that he has lost contact with the realities of South African and world politics. This is the reality with which I and all of us in this House this afternoon are faced. The hon. the Leader began with a motion of no confidence in me, and ended with a crisis of confidence in himself. I think it is fitting to say, when one has to summarize the political situation in this House today as a politician who is interested in it, that the dilemma of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is that the left-wingers do not know where they stand with him, while the right-wingers are equally ignorant of where they stand with him. Consequently he cannot lead. Under those circumstances&#x2014;I am simply asking this now as one politician to another&#x2014;can he blame clever back-benchers, or rather, people who think that they are clever, in his ranks if they play the old, old game of asking: &#x201C;Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of us all?&#x201D; That is what the hon. member for Randburg did. The wrong face appeared in the mirror. This brings me&#x2014;I think this is also fitting&#x2014;to the hon. member for Yeoville to whom one of necessity wishes to put certain questions in this regard.</p>

<p>Before I come to the questions which I want to put to the hon. member for Yeoville, there is another little matter I first want to raise. The hon. member had a great deal to say when he came to this House last year. He had hardly taken his seat when he had almost taken over this House. At that stage the hon. member was an authority on everything, and he acted the prophet. He was still prophesying on 17 October last year when he addressed a meeting in Johannesburg and said the following with reference to the party which I lead, the National Party. His words are given in quotation marks here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;A break in the National party is coming soon, much sooner than most people think and South Africa&#x2019;s political situation will change overnight.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I believe that it changed yesterday evening, and that we will probably hear about it again at a later stage today. Do you know, Sir, and have you ever noticed&#x2014;you have been sitting here for years, and you have the experience&#x2014;that every time the United Party or its Press has up to now predicted that there will be a crisis in the ranks of the National Party, a split occurs in the United Party? This has become axiomatic in the ranks of the National Party. So much for the hon. member as a prophet.</p>

<p>But now a few questions to the hon. member, as a politician. The hon. member spoke piously yesterday, but in those pious words of his an ultimatum was being offered to his colleagues, an ultimatum was being offered to his leader. The hon. member intimated his support of the hon. member for Randburg. One appreciates this, and it is a good thing, but did the hon. <span class="col_377-378" refersTo="page_0204"/>member consider that his colleagues had, after a very long hearing, according to the Press and according to all other indications, found the hon. member for Randburg guilty of the worst crime of which a politician can be found guilty, namely disloyalty. There is no greater crime which any member of this Parliament can commit against his leader than that of disloyalty. I want to tell the hon. member for Yeoville that not only was the hon. member for Randburg found guilty by his colleagues of disloyalty, but, in the words of the Chief Whip of the Opposition, of &#x201C;the grossest disloyalty&#x201D;. For the sake of us all as politicians in this House, and for the sake of our status&#x2014; for this concerns us&#x2014;the hon. member for Yeoville must tell us whether he agrees with this finding that what the hon. member for Randburg had committed was the grossest disloyalty.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It was a fine and a good thing for the hon. member to have affirmed his personal friendship, but he must reply to us on a few other questions. Did the hon. member for Yeoville know what the hon. member for Randburg was engaged in doing? We know that the hon. member for Randburg is not unaccompanied. He is accompanied by certain persons. He is accompanied by the hon. member for Sandton and the hon. member for Bryanston. I read that the hon. member for Bryanston said at a report back meeting that he would &#x201C;tear me limb from limb&#x201D; during this session of Parliament. I got a fright when I read this for it is a terrible thing if a person wants to tear one apart in this way, the more so because he did not say whether he was going to do this with his bare hands or with his teeth. No, the hon. member is not unaccompanied. He is accompanied by those hon. members whom I have mentioned. He is the advance scout of the hon. member for Yeoville. Rather sluggardly behind him follows the hon. member for Edenvale, and a little way further behind them sits the hon. member for Bezuidenhout with a telescope, looking to see what progress is being made. That is the reality as I see it now from the outside. However, I am now asking the hon. member for Yeoville&#x2014;and I think it is incumbent on him to furnish us, or the Press at a subsequent opportunity, with a reply&#x2014;whether he knew what the hon. member for Randburg was engaged in doing. If he says he did not know, I am entitled to put another question to him: If he had known would he have stopped him? I am putting this question because it is equally important to measure integrity in future.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has allowed an opportunity, such as is seldom granted to a Leader of the Opposition, to pass. The hon. the Leader should have made use of this motion to strike a blow for South Africa. He could have struck a blow for South Africa and in that way a blow for himself and for his party, for the spirit which is prevailing in South Africa today&#x2014;among the Whites as well as among the Black people, the Coloureds and the Indians&#x2014; is that no opportunity of doing something for South Africa should be allowed to go unutilized in these days, because the climate for doing so has never before been so favourable. I am aware of this because I am occupied with it day after day. But do you know, Sir, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is the only discordant note in the entire array of persons and bodies! While there is confidence and appreciation among others, the only discordant note is sounded by my friend on the opposite side of the House, because he is telling the world that whatever the Government is doing and whatever the appreciation he has for that in his way, the Government is nevertheless not a government which is deserving of confidence at this stage of our history. Surely this is not the time for petty disparagement; surely this is not the time for suspicion-mongering and the scoring of debating points. The times in which we are living make it imperative that we present a united front to the outside world. In spite of our political divisions, the division into National Party and United Party, and in spite of the division within the United Party, we could all still on this occasion have presented a united front to the outside world. It is the endeavour of this Government and it is my endeavour&#x2014;you have been hearing me say this from the first day I held this office&#x2014;to commit ourselves to normalizing relations with all non-communist countries Hon. members have heard me say that I will go out of my way, particularly to normalize relations in Africa and more particularly to do so in Southern Africa. Hon. members are aware of the <span class="col_379-380" refersTo="page_0205"/>attempts which have been made. Hon. members will recall that to a lesser extent these met with success, and hon. members will recall that to a greater extent perhaps these met with failure, but this did not cause this side of the House to flag in its zeal to normalize those relations. In addition, I committed myself, and this Government committed itself, to placing relations in South Africa on a sound basis. On the basis of the reproaches which have been levelled at us, let us now consider the position of South Africa in the outside world. There are certain things which one has to place on record and has to accept as facts.</p>

<p>The first is that there is at present more contact with leaders of peoples in Africa and in the outside world than ever before. It is true that the outward movement, which was mooted many years ago, did fail at times. Hon. members will recall how the hon. member for Bezuidenhout rubbed his hands together from sheer satisfaction as a result of those failures. There was a time &#x2014;I said it here in this House&#x2014;when the climate was against it and we had to wait for the psychological moment to move forward specifically and prominently with this matter again. A second fact which we have to place on record is that today there are more responsible leaders in the world than ever before who are prepared to listen to South Africa&#x2019;s case. What is more, there is today a greater understanding of South Africa and its problems than there has probably been in many decades. There are various reasons which may be advanced as to why this is so. Firstly, there was the financial and economic crisis in the monetary world; there was the energy crisis and all the misery which it brought in its wake; and there was the food crisis with all the endless misery which it caused for peoples throughout the world. All this contributed to placing South Africa in its true perspective. Secondly, there was in addition the situation of uncertain peace, and the unbridled violence which occurred in other parts of the world. Thirdly, the appreciation of the unlawful actions against South Africa and of the futile vendetta that had been waged against South Africa in the U.N., led to South Africa being seen in a better perspective than had been the case for many years. Fourthly, the initiative on South Africa is part to help create a situation of peace, relaxation of tension and cooperation in Southern Africa, has made an exceptional contribution in these times. In the fifth place there was the growing realization, a realization which was also in part a recognition, that in spite of standpoints which had previously been adopted, more and more leaders were asking themselves &#x2014;and at this stage I am not putting it any higher than this&#x2014;whether there was not perhaps another solution to South Africa&#x2019;s complex problems than those they had considered in the past. In other words, I am aware that more and more leaders throughout the world are asking themselves whether separate development, unlike their former opinions, is not the solution to the problems of a country such as South Africa. In the sixth place it is clear to me that the successful way in which the Government has been able, by word and deed, to bring home the integrity of our standpoint and our policy to our critics, has to a growing extent contributed to our success. In the seventh place&#x2014;I think that on this point even the hon. member for Von Brandis will agree with me&#x2014;the stability and the fundamental soundness of South Africa in all kinds of spheres, in contrast to what is happening in the rest of the world, has stood South Africa in very good stead. In the eighth place the calibre of our people and the quality of our products, our integrity in the field of commerce and science &#x2014;for this I want to express my gratitude to all our people&#x2014;has made an exceptional contribution in this regard. Our faith in our cause and in our calling&#x2014;I was pleased to hear the same sentiments expressed in English by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when he said: &#x201C;We have a destiny in this part of the world&#x201D;&#x2014;has had a great deal to do with our ability to maintain the position we are maintaining today. Because I have experienced this so frequently, I must also say here that we have recently received generously of the grace of the Lord in preserving this nation and country. It is remarkable how much good has been born out of evil at this time. When people thought they were doing us an injury, they were actually doing us a favour. Depriving South Africa of its rights at the U.N. not only illustrated this visibly to the world, but the world finally admitted that an injustice had been done to South Africa all these years. Recently this has come to the fore very prominently. However, another aspect was also brought to the fore, namely the futility of the U.N. while it continues on this course.</p>

<p>This brings me to the charge levelled by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition at the actions of my colleagues and officials and myself in regard to South Africa and <span class="col_381-382" refersTo="page_0206"/>its image in the outside world. This also brings me to the conclusions which are drawn for personal purposes from speeches which are made, without those speeches being set in their true perspective. Sir, in this debate you have heard what interpretation has been attached elsewhere, in the outside world, to the speech made by our ambassador to the U.N., the former member for Wonderboom, Mr. Pik Botha, and how it was in fact noised abroad that we had renounced our policy, and that we had in fact adopted a new policy. It was said even by a newspaper such as the <i>Financial Mail</i> that we had misled the world with the speech which Mr. Botha made. When it suits hon. members they try to present Mr. Botha&#x2019;s standpoint, which he stated on behalf of this side of the House and which I and every member on this side, without exception, fully endorse, as a new note which we sounded merely for the purposes of window-dressing at the U.N., and claim that we do not mean it and that we have no intention either of doing what is foreshadowed in it. In this way, for example, I had supposedly announced a new policy at Nigel. Sir, let us set the speech made by Mr. Botha in its true perspective. I wonder whether the hon. members who have already discussed this matter, ever went to the elementary trouble of reading that speech. I want to quote what he said. Far from shying away from the policy of this Government, far from announcing a new policy, the premise and the basis of his speech was the policy of separate development of this party and this Government. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The divisions which exist in South Africa today thus came about naturally &#x2026;</block>

<p>This was after he had furnished a historical survey&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The divisions which exist in South Africa today thus came about naturally &#x2026; historically through sociological affinities and not as a result of any ideology. We believe that the objective of self-determination for all our peoples will not be best achieved by attempting to force all of them into an artificial unity. Too often the world has seen the tragic consequences of attempts to force unity upon two or more divergent peoples, and we see it still today. A policy such as ours which is designed to avoid disaster, to eliminate friction and confrontation between different peoples, to eliminate domination of one group by another and to give to every man his due, can surely not be said to run counter to civilized concepts of human dignities and freedoms. Our policy is not based on any concepts of superiority or inferiority, but on the historical fact that different peoples differ in their loyalties, cultures, outlooks and modes of life and that they wish to retain them.</block>

<p>He then continued. Sir, this is all the hon. members quote, and even then they do not quote it in full. He then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do have discriminatory practices and we do have discriminatory laws.</block>

<p>At that moment when he was speaking, Mr. Speaker, we were in the process of repealing some of that legislation in this House, a process which we did in fact complete&#x2014; old laws from Natal, the Transvaal, the Cape and the Free State, which had been standing on our Statute Book since the previous century. He stated a fact, and he was stating a fact which each one of us have also on occasion stated. He then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is precisely because of this that the greatest misunderstandings occur and our motives are misrepresented. But that discrimination must not be equated with racialism.</block>

<p>For this is the charge which is being levelled at us there, i.e. that of race hatred. His reply to this was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we have that discrimination, it is not because the Whites in South Africa have any herrenvolk complex. We are not better than the Black people; we are not cleverer than they are; what we can achieve, so can they. Those laws and practices are a part of the historical evolution of our country. They were introduced to avoid friction and to promote and to protect the interests and the development of every group, not only those of the Whites. But I want to state here today very clearly and categorically: My Government does not condone discrimination purely on the grounds of race or colour.</block>

<p>This what Mr. Botha said and this is the standpoint of this side of the House, the standpoint which we have been stating over the years and to which I shall return at <span class="col_383-384" refersTo="page_0207"/>a later stage. Mr. Botha was not only stating the standpoint of the Government there; he was also stating the precise standpoint which the hon. the Leader of the House, who has a great deal to do with those matters, adopted. He was stating the precise standpoint adopted and stated by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the hon. the Minister of Information, both Ministries which deal primarily with those matters.</p>

<p>We are not shying away from our policy of separate development, and I now want to tell hon. members here that in all the talks I had with leaders of other peoples and nations, and I have had a great many in the eight years I have been sitting here, and particularly last year, I have never tried to run away from separate development. On the contrary. I find my justification in separate development and I believe &#x2014;otherwise I would be wasting my time and would no longer be standing here&#x2014; that we can bring home an understanding of separate development to peoples and nations if we are in fact granted the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>When we say that we are moving away from discrimination, we are not for one moment saying this because discrimination is inherent in or is or was part of our policy. It is not only since today that we have been saying that. Only yesterday you heard from the hon. member for Brits that my worthy predecessor had said, in season and out, that when we are dealing, as Mr. Botha also said, with historical discrimination on many levels, we should do something to get away from it, and the only way, as I see it&#x2014;and I really do believe in this&#x2014;is by means of the policy of separate development, otherwise we will never be able to get away from it. And if hon. members now tell me that as far as I am concerned it is a new concept which has been forced upon us now by circumstances, then I should like to refer you, Sir, to a speech which I made on 10 March 1973 at Kroonstad, in the presence of the then M.P. for Kroonstad, Mr. Schlebusch. I said the following, referring to the National Party and its actions for the future (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our programme of action must be seen over three decades. The first decade was the decade of apartheid when we had to separate what had been allowed over the years to intermingle.</block>

<p>And it goes without saying, Sir, and I spelt it out there, that we often had to take very negative action during that decade to achieve the goal which we set ourselves, and we had to achieve that goal if we wanted peace here in South Africa. I said that that was the first decade, and then I went on to say that after that decade had passed, the decade arrived in which the emphasis did not fall in the first place on apartheid but on separate development, and more specifically on the development which there has to be for the separate peoples, and in that process we created governments, gave people status, gave Coloured people chances and opportunities which were not possible under any other policy. I went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have heard me saying, and I am saying this again in the Free State today: I believe in separate development. I believe in the retention and the protection of the identity of the Whites, not because I think it is better than that of the Blacks &#x2026;</block>

<p>I then to the best of my knowledge substantiated my reasons for believing in that. I then came to the third decade, the decade with which we are now occupied. In this regard I said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And now, my friends, we have entered the third decade of our policy. We have imparted status to peoples, separate peoples, we have given them governments. We have given them people to be in charge of those governments, and I invite those people to my office and I discuss matters with them. I discuss matters with them as one man to another. I discuss matters with them as equals because they are the leaders of their nations and I am the leader of my nation. I respect them as the leaders of their peoples and I speak to them very frankly and I tell them: Look, I am not prepared&#x2014;and we must understand one another very clearly &#x2014;to give you a say over my people, not today, nor tomorrow either. But I will not have a say over you for all time either. You must lead your own people, and we are now in the era, the third decade, in which we must face up to the multinationalism of our policy, for out of it certain consequences are going to arise. Certain consequences have already arisen from it in the field of sport, and certain consequences will arise from it in every other sphere, and I shall face those consequences <span class="col_385-386" refersTo="page_0208"/>squarely, in the knowledge that my policy is aimed at that, and that the cornerstone of my policy is that I wish to preserve the identity of the Whites, that I also wish to preserve the sovereignty of the Whites over themselves at all times. If this is the case, then I am prepared&#x2014;and Dr. Verwoerd foreshadowed this in his time&#x2014;to face the consequences of multi-nationalism squarely.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I laid the foundation for this third phase outside and in this House. I did not simply&#x2014;and this is an accusation which is frequently levelled at us&#x2014;sit down and devise the policy in regard to this third phase for the Blacks, the Coloured and the Indians without consulting them in regard to it. I laid the foundation with the Whites in the first place, and I made the general propaganda which was necessary. But what is more, Sir, I constantly took my place around the conference table, together with the various leaders, to consider these matters with them, to give them a say in these matters, to see what we could do to make it easier for us all to stabilize peace and sound relations in South Africa. I am very grateful to be able to tell you today that the recent discussions which I had with Black, Coloured and Indian leaders were the most fruitful I have ever conducted with them. I believe, Sir, that they were fruitful for those of us who are sitting in this House, and they were also fruitful for them. I can report with satisfaction not only that those discussions were fruitful, but also that with few exceptions they were conducted in a particularly responsible manner. I do not want to shy away from that, for this is the point which hon. members, and particularly the hon. member for Green Point, do not always understand very clearly. I conducted talks with these people on the basis of and within the framework of the policy of the National Party. If hon. members want their policy and their principles to be discussed with these leaders, they must first come into power; then they will have every opportunity to apply their policy in practice. But in the meantime it is the policy of this side of the House which is under discussion. Can you imagine, Sir, if we were now to do what hon. members opposite are requesting, namely that we convene a conference involving everyone, including the Opposition&#x2014;of whatever nature and party this may be&#x2014;to discuss relations in South Africa, what would happen then? Surely it would result in the greatest chaos one has ever had in South Africa. What is more, it would not only result in chaos, but would also be an admission to the outside world of political bankruptcy, for we would in that way then be telling the world that the people in South Africa have no policy. I do not know how matters stand with hon. members opposite&#x2014;one is usually more familiar with one&#x2019;s own affairs than an outside observer&#x2014;but my party has a policy and it is on the basis and within the framework of that policy that I am seeking the solution for South Africa and its problems.</p>

<p>It is true that requests were put to me during those talks to which I had to reply with an immediate &#x201C;no&#x201D;. For example, if I am asked at such talks for representation in this Parliament, I tell the leaders concerned&#x2014;and they know that this is my standpoint&#x2014;what the policy of the National Party on representation in this House is. If they discuss federation with me, I tell them: &#x201C;You are knocking at the wrong door; you must wait until my friend is in power and then discuss federation with him&#x201D;. If they discuss freehold with me, I tell them what the policy of my party is and that I regret that I am unable to do what they are asking, but that I shall consider other ways and means, ways to which my colleague, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has already referred and to which I shall also return at a later stage.</p>

<p>I also want to place it on record again here today that I do not for one moment want to say that all the leaders with whom we held talks were necessarily in agreement with me, or that we are always in agreement on all the matters we discuss. But, Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful to be able to tell you today, for in terms of the position which I hold I am accountable to you, that Black, Coloured and Indian leaders have appreciation for the standpoint of the Government, even though they do are necessarily in agreement with it. Not only do they have appreciation for it, but I am grateful to be able to tell you that in spite of differences which exist and in spite of standpoints which they will adopt in future which may run counter to the policy of my party and my Government, there is acceptance on the part of the responsible leaders of the position as I have now sketched it here.</p>

<p><span class="col_387-388" refersTo="page_0209"/>I am convinced, and I must report this to you, that despite the actions of certain agitators, we are entering a period of peace and order in this decade. It goes without saying that when one discusses these matters, one has a very wide field to cover and one cannot do so in a short space of time here. But my Vote still has to come up for discussion; we could then examine many of these aspects further. Nevertheless I do think that we could place a few facts in this regard on record.</p>

<p>The first is that the homeland policy and the eventual independence of homelands is an accomplished fact, and that no one can stop it. I am convinced, in spite of what they themselves may say, that even those homeland leaders who have at this moment not yet decided when they want to become independent, will all accept independence. This is historically inevitable; they cannot escape it. I now want to place a second fact on record, and tell the hon. member for Houghton that she can do her best to persuade them otherwise, but she will not succeed with the Black people of South Africa. They will demand independence from their leaders. There is no doubt in my mind about this. What has also emerged&#x2014;and this hon. members must bear in mind when they discuss the question of the urban Bantu&#x2014;is that these homeland leaders never dissociated themselves from their people in the cities, not in any talks which I conducted with them, and pre-eminently not at the latest talks which my colleague and I conducted with them. On the contrary. Not only did they recognize those people, they also claimed them to be their people who are working and living in our cities, even if it has been for many generations. There is no dispute or friction between us on that standpoint. A third fact which is worthwhile placing on record on this occasion is that on no occasion when I discussed matters with the homeland leaders did they ask for separate representation for the urban Bantu in this Parliament. On no occasion when my colleague and I were with them, did this standpoint emerge. They accept that the future of the urban Bantu is situated in the homelands to which they owe their allegiance.</p>

<p>What do the urban Bantu themselves say?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is interesting that the hon. member should ask me this question now. On one occasion the hon. the Minister and I held talks for three days with the urban Bantu of various residential areas. We discussed everything. They had the opportunity to complain about everything. They were able to pose any questions. But not on any occasion did one of them ask for representation in this Parliament. Not one of them asked for that. I can well imagine that there will perhaps be some of them who will come forward with such an idea after they have spoken to some hon. members, particularly to the hon. member for Durban Point. However, it is wrong to say that those people entertain such a desire. They see their political future among their own people. It must be borne in mind that these talks were convened at their request to discuss only the urban Bantu. They discussed commerce, home ownership and freedom of movement with us.</p>

<p>I now want to report on this so that it can be understood what we are dealing with. In particular they discussed influx control with us. There was not a single argument which hon. members on the opposite side of the House, not a single argument which the hon. members of the Progressive Party, have ever enumerated, which the homeland leaders did not advance in respect of influx control. There was a great deal of criticism on their part of how the measures are being applied, and criticism concerning the question of whether there should be any measures at all. I listened to them, and not only I. The Department of Bantu Administration and Development in the person of my colleague in particular, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, listened to the arguments of these people. There was substance in a great deal of what these people said, with the result that I told them that we should first identify the problem, and that having identified the problem, and decided that there is in fact a problem, we could discuss a solution to it. They associated influx control with discrimination, and I had to convince them that it is not discrimination. I told them that the problem was not only South Africa&#x2019;s problem, but that it was also the problem of Lusaka, Nairobi, in fact of every city in Africa. If hon. members had read <i>The Argus</i> of two or three evenings ago, they would have seen what a problem Lusaka now has in this regard, how they have to pick up the people to convey them to the rural areas because there are no more opportunities for them in the city. I am telling <span class="col_389-390" refersTo="page_0210"/>this House what I told them. I want to inquire of you whether this was not put in a fair manner. I told them that my problem was that there might be 10 000 work opportunities in a given area. Suppose 30 000 Black people arrived who wished to avail themselves of those 10 000 work opportunities. I asked them whether this was a problem, yes or no. Naturally the homeland leaders told me that this was a problem. We then said that since we all admitted that this was a problem, we should give thought to how we could solve the problem. I told them that since we agreed on the problem and they criticized my way of solving it and said that it was not working well enough and had all kinds of faults, we should give thought to how that problem should be solved to the satisfaction of all. I told them that I believed that the only way of doing this was to appoint three of their number who would, in consultation with the proper officials of the department, go into the entire matter and produce a better method of solving that problem. In other words, we did not dictate to them what they should do, but created for them the opportunity of finding for themselves the solution to a problem affecting their people. I have to report to this House that only one homeland leader, i.e. Chief Buthelezi, said that he was not prepared to co-operate in this regard because, so he said, this was a White man&#x2019;s law and he had not had a part in the making of that law. For that reason, he said, he was not prepared to co-operate in that regard. I am very grateful to be able to inform this House that the other seven homeland leaders adopted the standpoint that they accepted the invitation with thanks, and that they would co-operate with the department and would try to find a solution to this matter. I am mentioning this to hon. members on the one hand as an example of the attitude of the homeland leaders, and on the other I am presenting this to illustrate how we are, in the third phase, seeking a solution with these people and not for these people, and how we wish to place more and greater responsibility on the shoulders of leaders and peoples themselves, instead of doing everything for them. You can take it from me, Sir, that this is the procedure we shall adopt in future.</p>

<p>I come now to the Coloureds and the Indians. On previous occasions I have stated, in general, that what applies to the Coloureds, also applies to the Indians. We discussed the question of political representation in this House. I told them frankly, and they did not take offence at hearing it from me: &#x201C;That is my party&#x2019;s policy and I am unable to negotiate with you outside my party&#x2019;s policy.&#x201D; You will recall, Sir, that it was no less a person than myself who said years ago in this House when we did away with the Coloured representation&#x2014;and I accept full responsibility for that&#x2014;here: &#x201C;We are going to be faced with a dilemma in this connection in future; we are going to create Parliaments for the Coloureds and the Indians and we are going to be faced with the dilemma that sovereign Parliaments cannot exist side by side in the same country.&#x201D; That is a dilemma. That is the dilemma to which I had to find an answer. Once again it was not a question of only I having considered the matter, found an answer and told the Coloured and Indian leaders: &#x201C;There is the answer, take it or leave it.&#x201D; Unhurriedly I sat down with them around a conference table and, in a calm and responsible manner&#x2014;there were particularly responsible discussions on this question-discussed this matter with the leaders concerned.</p>

<p>I now want to state certain facts in that regard. This Government is not trying to shy away from that dilemma, nor shall we ever do so. On the contrary. We are facing it squarely. However, I want to say that not all forms of separation, whether imposed by law or not, are necessarily discriminatory or humiliating. This we must understand very clearly. My most important witness in this connection is my friend, the hon. member for Durban Point. Who am I to want a better witness than him? The hon. member is a &#x201C;star witness&#x201D; for me, for in the course of this debate I asked him a question. When hon. members opposite accuse us of discrimination, it depends on what one means. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana advanced a valid argument in this connection. To be specific, it depends on one&#x2019;s attitude and on the meaning one attaches to the word. The law compels White children to go to a certain school and the Coloured children to go to their school. The same applies to the Indians and the Bantu. Surely the United Party are not going to tell me that they believe in discrimination of that detestable kind. They are with me, then, in endorsing it. I do not know whether the hon. member for Bezuidenhout always endorses it. I doubt it, and my doubt is justified. However, I do know that the hon. member for Durban <span class="col_391-392" refersTo="page_0211"/>Point endorses it because he told me so across the floor of the House.</p>

<p>Yes, but they do not have a free choice. They are forced to do so by the law. The hon. members opposite accept this as their policy, too, because they would not repeal it if they were to come into power. They have already told us so. The same applies to residential areas. They believe in it, and it takes place in terms of the law. In other words, it is surely unsound to argue, taking their own standpoint into account, that enforced and statutory separation is immoral and wrong. Why, then, do they accuse us before the outside world while endorsing it themselves? What is more, why do they accuse us before the outside world while they bask in the glory of what we are doing in practice in this regard?</p>

<p>One will have to deal with these matters whatever policy one follows in South Africa. However, the principle which we must consider and decide on, and on which we must obtain clarity, is that not every form of enforced separation is necessarily humiliating or discriminatory in the bad sense of the word, or abhorrent. I want to state as my considered opinion&#x2014;I am not just talking loosely to hon. members now; it is in a considered way that I talk to other nations and people&#x2014;that all nations and people have the inherent right to separate themselves from other nations and people at times if they so choose.</p>

<p>I come now to the dilemma I foresaw with regard to the various Parliaments.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to say, as I said to the Indian and Coloured leaders when they raised this issue with me and said that they want meaningful political power in South Africa, that they had every right not only to ask that from me but also, in fact, to demand it from me and that I would have no quarrel with them whatsoever when they say that to me. I concede straightaway that they have the right to meaningful powers and meaningful right to co-responsibility in decision-making as far as it also affects them. I am not going to argue with anybody about this.</p>

<p>I am slowly getting a little tired of that argument. Does the hon. member realize what it implies? It is the greatest motion of no confidence he can move in himself, for what is the hon. member again saying now by implication, something which the hon. member for Newton Park is so fond of saying? He is saying that we have taken over their policy. But we have been growing over the years and last year we grew even further, but the party on the opposite side has retrogressed. If we have supposedly grown with their policy and they were the first to see and to make the policy, do hon. members know what this implies?&#x2014;That the voting public think that as people the hon. members are so weak that they are not to be trusted with that policy! [Interjections.] After all, this is the only deduction I can make, that the voting public say yes, the policy of the U.P. is a sound policy but, good gracious, do not give it to a U.P. man <span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0212"/>to implement; he will make a mess of it. [Interjections.] I do not think I will get that reproach from the hon. member again; I think that era has passed and that phase has ended.</p>

<p>I identified the dilemma and placed it in the lap of the Coloured leaders. Surely the hon. members can recall this. I told the leaders that they had to help me solve that dilemma. What is more, I told them that they had to find the solution to it. They then came forward with the idea of a liaison committee. My hon. friend must admit that the liaison committee idea worked effectively and was productive of a tremendous amount of good for the Coloureds. Hon. members will also remember that I said that, I, as a realistic politician, knew that it would not last for ever and that a time would come when we would have to reconsider it. Sir, we have discussed the matter, and the time has come for us to reconsider it.</p>

<p>We considered this matter as adults, and I ask any unprejudiced man sitting in this House to suggest a better solution to me. It serves no purpose to argue with me, on this occasion, about whether, it is right or wrong that Coloureds and Indians are not represented in this Parliament. That is a matter on which the voters gave a decision, and it is the policy of this party. Sir, we then discussed the matter and I want to tell you how I argued with them. You saw the reactions in the Press, Sir. I said to them: &#x201C;I can give you representation in Parliament if it is the policy of my party, but it is not the policy of my party.&#x201D; It so happened that when we came to the discussion of this matter, we had just finished discussing housing, and I then said this to them: &#x201C;With reference to the case of housing, while we are now discussing &#x2018;meaningful political rights&#x2019;, if you have representation in this Parliament, then according to the policy of all parties, a few of you will come and sit here; you will sit here in the back benches of Parliament; housing will then come up for discussion and it will then appear from the Estimates that R100 million is available for housing. What are your rights as members? It is your right to criticize it; to criticize it to the extent to which you are afforded opportunities to speak in this House on this matter.&#x201D; But, Sir, surely hon. members know as well as I do that an amount in these Estimates has never been changed, not in all the years the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has been sitting here, and he has been sitting here for five years longer than I have. I then said to them: &#x201C;That amount will remain as it is. So if you speak of &#x2018;meaningful power&#x2019; in respect of housing, this is what representation in this Parliament will bring you, i.e. you will be able to criticize the amounts here&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But those are the facts. [Interjection.] No, Sir, I am not even attacking the Leader of the Opposition on this particular matter let alone the parliamentary system. The fact of the matter Sir, is simply that development has brought this about. In years gone by all these matters were decided on in Parliament. In the early days Parliament not only decided that R100 million had to be made available for housing, to mention an example; it indicated where it had to be spent, how it had to be spent and for whose benefit it had to be spent. But, Sir, surely modern governments no longer function in this manner, and with the advent of cabinet government and the cabinet system, what am I offering the Coloureds? And now people outside can judge for themselves where meaningful power does or does not lie. What am I offering them? I am offering them representation in a Cabinet Council, for it is in that Cabinet Council that the amount is initiated. In other words, I am giving them a say at the source where it is decided whether it should be R100 million or R120 million. I am giving them the opportunity to state the case of the housing needs of their people at the highest level, in the intimacy of a round table meeting, where the Coloured person can state the needs of his people at the highest level. But if he is not satisfied with the amount, what else am I offering him? I am offering <span class="col_395-396" refersTo="page_0213"/>him his own council, where he will be afforded many more opportunities to speak than he would be in this Parliament, where, if he has complaints, he will be able to air these far more effectively than he would be able to do in this Parliament. In other words, when it comes to criticism, I am giving him many more opportunities to criticize than he would otherwise have had. But I am going even further than that. Any hon. member in this House may criticize; it is his right, but he does not have any say where the amount is spent.</p>

The hon. member has interrupted me now, Sir, I am giving them the opportunity to obtain a right to have representation at the very end, at the point where the money is spent, so that, if there should be complaints that it is quite in order that Parliament has voted R100 million, but that the Whites have obtained too much of that amount and that the Coloureds and the Indians have a far greater need and have obtained too little, I am giving them the opportunity, at that point, to raise a complaint around a conference table, to discuss it there and to be co-responsible for and be instrumental in deciding how that money should be spent. And what is more, is they do not obtain satisfaction there, the matter is put into the pipeline again and they can come back to the Cabinet Council and say that things are not going smoothly, that they are still being discriminated against or that they are not getting their due. Then we can investigate the mater and discuss it.</p>

<p>My hon. friend, who is an authority on everything, ought to know that according to the British Cabinet system, which works very effectively, voting never takes place in a Cabinet. Never in the history of Cabinet government has voting taken place in a Cabinet. On another occasion I should like to give him a lecture on Cabinet government. There are quite a number of interesting things I shall be able to communicate to him, for he will never be able to learn about them from personal experience. Therefore, I say that I am giving him a say at the point where the amount originates; I am giving him the right to criticize it along the way and I am giving him the right to be co-responsible in making a decision about where the amount should eventually be spent. Now I am asking any hon. member: If this is not a fairer way and if this is not more meaningful than anything which has been suggested before by anyone on that side of the House or elsewhere, then I should very much like to know what is. But what is more, in spite of the fact that the Coloureds and the Indians say their ideal is to have representation here, I can tell you that they were very pleased with these standpoints, with this system, which they support, and that it is going to have results that will be greatly to their benefit. There are various spheres, too many to enumerate now, in which we shall apply this. But I also told them, and I must report it to you here, that in the implementation of the policy which I held out to them at Kroonstad, we will give them representation on various boards and councils, and I told the hon. member for Green Point that I am now engaged in compiling that list. They will, for example, obtain representation <span class="col_397-398" refersTo="page_0214"/>on the Economic Advisory Council, one of the highest bodies in South Africa. They will obtain representation in those places where it will be of most value to them&#x2014;such as the Wage Board, the Apprenticeship Board, the Unemployment Insurance Board, to mention only a few, which are intimately bound up with the way of life and the existence of these people. If these are not meaningful political rights, then I do not know what meaningful political rights are. But, Sir, we have not only given them status. We have given them superior amenities and have held out the prospect of superior amenities, and I foresee that much that is beneficial will result from this co-operation between the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians. We shall reap those benefits, not only in this country, but abroad as well.</p>

<p>This brings me to the climate of opinion abroad. I have already, I think, told you that we have a more favourable climate of opinion towards South Africa today than ever before. The main object of this Government is the normalization of our relations with the world, with Africa and, from the nature of the case, with Southern Africa. It is here that the question of South West Africa and the question of Rhodesia play a particularly important role. But I should like to say this: Even if these negotiations in respect of Rhodesia should fail and even if we should not arrive at an understanding in respect of South West Africa&#x2014;and may Heaven forbid that either of these things should happen&#x2014;I still believe that relations between Africa and our country will never be the same again, for in the meantime we have built up understandings and bridges in other spheres which will remain in existence and will be of significance.</p>

<p>Sir, I think a better understanding of South Africa has developed in the world and in Africa. Firstly, there has been a clear acceptance that we are of Africa. It follows from that that we on our part take Africa into account. But the other side of the coin is that Africa takes us into account. Secondly, we are not a minority group here in South Africa and when we are some times referred to as a minority regime, as President Kaunda recently referred to us, I reject this with all the emphasis at my command, for it is simply not true. We are a people of Africa in our own right and in our own country, and no one can deprive us of that right and that country. We do not interfere, nor do we permit anyone to interfere in our affairs. We shall not attack anyone, but we will most certainly remain prepared to repulse any rash attack on us, and we shall do so with a large measure of success. We, just like the other African States, are seeking understanding and peace, but, like them, not at any price. Although we do not owe anyone anything we will render assistance to the best of our ability. Like them, we are also interested in the development, the order and stability of all states, particularly, from the nature of the case, that of our neighbouring states.</p>

<p>A question which is generally asked and in which each one of us, whatever party we support, is intensely interested, is the following: Can we find a solution for the South West African issue? Can a solution be found in Rhodesia? I have already said, may Heaven forbid that the attempts which are being made in Rhodesia in particular fail.</p>

<p>I am dealing, firstly, with South West Africa. One&#x2019;s problem is, of course, made infinitely more difficult by the fact that people who have little or no knowledge of it are meddling in this matter. One of these people is my friend, the hon. member for Sea Point, who felt himself called upon to go to South West Africa. If he had gone there as an observer, I would have welcomed it, for then, I believe, he could have learnt something. However, the hon. member went as an authority and returned as an even greater authority. On his return he naturally went to the <i>Cape Times,</i> which reported as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Referring to his informal talks with Whites in the city, Mr. Eglin said that they were troubled most by the sharp turnabout in South African policy on South West Africa in the past 18 months. This policy now was that South West Africans should decide their own future and self-determination.</block>

<p>What are the facts? It so happens that I was involved in this. In the <i>South African Survey</i> of 1967, many years ago, we wrote as follows on this same question (page 49)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To embark on speculation as to what the ultimate future political pattern will be, that is, whether and to what extent there may be amalgamations or unions of some kind, federations, commonwealths or common market arrangements, etc., <span class="col_399-400" refersTo="page_0215"/>the peoples themselves will ultimately decide. Meanwhile, South Africa&#x2019;s task and solemn duty is to help the diverse peoples of the Territory advance economically, socially and politically to the stage where they themselves will be able to decide their own future.</block>

<p>However, the hon. member now says that the policy which the people now find shocking is that &#x201C;South West Africans will decide their own future and self-determination&#x201D;. Surely this is absurd. Does the hon. member not realize that he is not only creating confusion but also a lack of confidence within South West Africa itself, whereas what is necessary at the moment is confidence? Confidence among the Whites that they will not have to give up their possessions there, confidence that they will be able to make investments there and that, just as South Africa will progress, South West Africa will also progress and will share in this prosperity in South Africa and Southern Africa which the National Party has brought about over the years and will perpetuate.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Since that standpoint was expressed, we have had the manifesto in regard to this election.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I myself advocated this at one meeting after another. I am sorry that the hon. member did not come and put questions to me about it, for then he might have learnt something. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told me that we would have to find a solution to this problem rapidly, but he did not state the crux of the problem. I am sorry he did not do so and I would appreciate it if he would come back to the matter in his reply to this debate and say whether he agrees or disagrees with me on this. In all my discussions with all the individuals and leaders, Black and White, I adopted the standpoint that&#x2014;as I expressed it in English&#x2014;&#x201C;the people will decide their own future&#x201D;. My standpoint is that neither South Africa nor the U.N. will dictate to those people what their standpoint should be. They and they alone will determine that standpoint. But what is the standpoint of the U.N.? This is something to which the hon. the Leader did not refer. The standpoint of the U.N., and that of our enemies in the world, is that South West Africa does not belong to the peoples of South West Africa, but to Sam Mujoma.</p>

<p>He is the only power, he and Swapo which cannot muster 2 000 supporters in South West Africa, which does not even have that many members. Sam Mujoma is the person who finds favour at the U.N. and is recognized as the leader. It is to him that South West Africa must be surrendered. Now I do not want to be irresponsible, but I want to state the policy of this Government very clearly. Let the world issue as many ultimatums to us as it likes, let there be as many threats as the world is able to make, but South West Africa will not be surrendered to Sam Mujoma and Swapo, not as long as this Government is sitting here. The peoples of South West Africa will decide their future themselves. Because of the nature of the case, I cannot take the discussion any further than that.</p>

<p>I come now to Rhodesia. I am grateful to be able to report, and I am making haste to conclude, that I as the responsible person, together with all my colleagues who sit here, tried to create an atmosphere, and we were successful, within which the parties concerned could discuss their problems and find a solution to their problems. In this connection, there has obviously been frequent contact with Rhodesia in many spheres. When the psychological moment arrived, however, we made contact with Zambia, and Tanzania and Botswana came into it as well. In spite of all which has been said and done in the past, this afternoon I must place on record my impression that Zambia and the other parties are eager, just as are South Africa and Rhodesia, to find a solution and that they have made an honest contribution in this connection. Likewise, since reproaches have constantly been hurled at the Rhodesian Government of Mr. Smith, I must report it here as a fact that the Rhodesian Government has shown a realism and a responsibility which must be appreciated by everyone who is interested in Southern Africa. A solution to the Rhodesian issue Can be found in Rhodesia and in Rhodesia alone.</p>

<p>Because I was concerned with the problem on dozens of occasions I want to state as Clearly as possible that a solution cannot come from one side only; a solution in Rhodesia must come from both sides, from the Whites as well as from the Blacks. There is no solution which can come from one side only. I am not speaking only on my own behalf now. I am speaking on behalf <span class="col_401-402" refersTo="page_0216"/>of everyone when I say that we are not seeking surrender, but a solution. It is only when one approaches it in that spirit that one can hope and pray that there will be success.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to state again very clearly that we are not interfering in Rhodesia&#x2019;s internal affairs. We are not exerting pressure and we are not giving any orders, and as a proud people they will obviously not take orders from us. But I believe that if there is mutual goodwill, a solution can be found in Rhodesia, but because I have attended many talks in this connection, I can place it on record as my conviction that I believe that the chances of finding a solution are minimal if violence does not cease. Violence must cease as a precondition for success. I believe also that no prior demands must be made. There must be no preconditions for deliberations, because if that happens, as I know the climate, the chances of finding a solution are slender. I believe there must be no prescriptions and no outside interference. Whether it is South Africa, or Zambia or Great Britain&#x2014;outside interference in connection with this matter will be fatal because it is a delicate and a complicated matter. Meeting upon meeting has been held on this matter at Cape Town, Pretoria, Salisbury and Lusaka, and I think that it is only the people who sat around the conference table who will have any conception of how delicate this issue really is.</p>

<p>Because the matter is such a delicate one, hon. members will be surprised at the influence newspaper articles, written here in South Africa, have had on deliberations in the past and the influence they will have on future talks. Therefore I consider it my duty once again to make an appeal to newspapers and speakers who discuss this matter, to speak and write about it with the greatest circumspection. I want to state very clearly that no newspaper&#x2014;it does not matter which&#x2014;speaks on behalf of the Government in this matter. I also want to state clearly that the Government does not make use of newspapers to put out feelers. If I want to put out feelers, I shall do so myself; I shall not ask newspapers to do so on my behalf.</p>

<p>I believe that we must do everything in our power to create a climate and to make it possible for the parties concerned to settle matters around a conference table. It is with pride and with gratitude that I can tell you that South Africa has played its part in this connection. I cannot mention names now&#x2014;there will come a time when I will in fact be able to do so&#x2014;but officials from South Africa have worn themselves out in connection with this matter, in a way which has compelled my greatest admiration. They will know who they are and I want to convey my thanks and appreciation to them. I myself have lost no time in devoting myself to this matter. Because it was so delicate and in order to keep out of the hands of the Press &#x2014;because one does not know how irresponsible people are going to deal with the matter&#x2014;we had to arrange our talks in such a way that they could not have any idea that we are engaged in them.</p>

<p>I travelled down to Durban where I met the Indian Council. I had lunch there that afternoon. After lunch I returned to Pretoria to hold talks on this matter with the Black people, and these talks continued until 12 o&#x2019;clock that night. We had to select the most impossible times to do the work in this connection, but we did it in the knowledge and in the hope that a better dispensation for Southern Africa would result from it. If hon. members were to ask me what we can do in this connection, I should say that the most important thing we can do, is to keep out of this matter and because it has so many facets, to leave it to the people who are working on it from day to day.</p>

<p>I want to tell this House that we have already achieved success and we are grateful for the success which has been achieved. We have gained the goodwill of Black leaders in Zambia and elsewhere and I think that we shall retain that goodwill. We want to retain that goodwill because it is necessary for Southern Africa in future, because the alternative, to which reference has already been made, is there if things go wrong. Because it will, after all, be my responsibility, and because I must live with my conscience, I want to say in conclusion to this House today&#x2014; and it does not make any difference to me how much political propaganda is made from it at by-elections or on other occasions&#x2014;that I, for my part, consider it my duty to work day after day with the object of trying to bring about understanding and peace in Southern Africa. I am grateful that I have been able to make contacts in Africa in the past, and I shall continue <span class="col_403-404" refersTo="page_0217"/>to try and make such contacts, because our future demands it of us.</p>

<p>Obviously I cannot tell hon. members that we shall succeed in this attempt. On the contrary. I have always intimated that we should take the possibility of failure into consideration. If it fails, the alternative is there, but then I can say to the young people of South Africa and to hon. members on the opposite side and also on my side of the House: &#x201C;Here I stand; I did everything in my power to ward off this day.&#x201D; I shall devote myself to this, and to this, I believe, each of us should devote himself in these days. Because this is the case, I move this amendment to the motion of my friend opposite, although this was not my custom in previous years&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House&#x2014;</block>

<li>(2) furthermore notes with appreciation what the Government has done and intends doing in this field&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>I am not placing hon. members in the difficult situation of voting for a motion of confidence in me. If they had had that confidence in me, they would have joined my party. Therefore I am taking into account the fact that they are seated opposite me. But at this point of time in history I have the right to approach every hon. member opposite and say to him: &#x201C;Look, my friend, we must now create good relations for the future&#x201D; and &#x201C;My friend, we have attained a certain goal; we have already made progress; join us now in signifying, with us, your assent to that progress, and let us make further progress on that road&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in looking back at this debate over the last week, I think I can say that it has been a most interesting debate because this has been one of the occasions when there was, for a change, something for which we could sincerely thank the Prime Minister and congratulate him, namely his initiatives in Africa, the assurances which his ambassador gave at the United Nations and his efforts for peace in Southern Africa. I congratulated the hon. the Prime Minister on what he had done. And yet, today, this hon. gentleman was most resentful that I had not given him more fulsome congratulations.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But it is the wrong note as usual.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>It is very much the right note. It is the wrong memory on the part of the hon. the Prime Minister. Sir, I say quite definitely that we accept and appreciate what has been done, but the hon. the Prime Minister must not expect me to clap hands and evince confidence in him when I feel that what has been done is only a beginning and is only the first step in the achievement of results. What we have seen so far, in all honesty, is nothing more nor less than an invitation to do business, a putting of the goods in the window, so to speak. It will have achieved certainly not all that is to be hoped unless those goods are sold. The shopkeeper does not get rich unless the customer buys and flourishing commerce is not established unless trade and dealing takes place. The trouble is that I do not believe, and this side of the House does not believe, that the hon. the Prime Minister has the right sort of goods to put in that <span class="col_405-406" refersTo="page_0218"/>shop window, the right sort of goods to clinch a deal in respect of Southern Africa. The right sort of goods to clinch a deal in Southern Africa is a change in his internal policies.</p>

<p>We charge the Government with being timid in its approach to Africa, and remaining timid even now. There is an absence of vision; there is an absence of big thinking. The response from speakers on the other side was predictable. It was beamed not at the task ahead, but at lulling the voters into believing that the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development could meet the demands of the situation at home and abroad, that the future of White South Africa was safe only in their hands and that the rate and the nature of change was securely under control.</p>

<p>As emerged from speech after speech on our side of the House, this self-delusion on the part of the Government was totally divorced from the facts of the situation. I thought we had a masterly exposition from the hon. member for Hillbrow of how population and economic growth only over the next 10 years would automatically so affect the social and political pattern in this country that Government policies would cease to be relevant, and of how the presence of more than 10 million additional urban Blacks, many of them doing skilled and technical work, would change the whole social structure in the so-called White areas. These will be people earning good salaries, people who will change the whole social set-up and make nonsense of the political set-up as it exists at the present time if they are still totally excluded from the decision-making process within the Republic of South Africa. In advancing those arguments hon. members opposite failed to think back what the situation was 10 years ago here in South Africa. Let me remind hon. gentlemen what it was like 10 years ago.</p>

<p>The Government had an over-my-dead-body stand in respect of job reservation. The Government was still firmly wedded to the magical year of 1978 when the flow of Blacks to the towns would be reversed. Cricket teams were not allowed into this country because there was one non-White face amongst the players; there were no Blacks on any Government advisory boards; there were no consultations of a multi-racial kind at Government level. And now, Sir, what has happened 10 years later? Job reservation is virtually scrapped; the Government is on the verge of recognizing the permanence of the urban Bantu; multi-racial sport has become a commonplace; Nationalist members of Parliament are mixing with non-Whites at a social level, as opposed to their attitude in the past. It is accepted that the Nico Malan theatre is open to all races and many other theatres are following suit; apartheid notices are even coming down in Government buildings, and the Government Press is loud in its praise of what it calls &#x201C;verligtheid&#x201D;. The Pretoria municipality has even followed the example of the Johannesburg municipality in dismantling apartheid in some of its municipal areas. These things were not Government policy; they are the result of the facts of life in South Africa, of increasing racial inter-dependence, of increasing sophistication and earning capacity of Black and Brown people, and they have left an indelible mark on Government attitudes in this country. But, Sir, these facts still go largely unrecognized as a permanent influence by the Government; they are still burying their head in the sand like an ostrich when we ask them to consider the future of South Africa over the next 10 years. You know, Mr. Speaker, hon. members opposite have every reason to believe in the foresight of the United Party and its ability to predict the future. Everything the Government has done in these changes, virtually every one of its grand initiatives, has been advanced from this side of the House.</p>

All these things, Mr. Speaker, were asked for by this side of the House and were foretold by us, but when we ask these gentlemen to look into the future, they think they are the only people who can see round the corner. There is even a softening of attitude in respect of the use of amenities by Whites and non-Whites.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentleman says, &#x201C;So what?&#x201D; I remember the look on his face the first time I pleaded in this House for a restaurant in Cape Town that should be open for people of different races.</p>

<p>Sir, what did I ask for in my motion before the House? In essence it was a plain statement of fact. It was a statement that detente, the easing of tensions between the peoples of Southern Africa, was only the first step towards the real goal, and the real goal is fruitful co-operation in areas of mutual interest in Southern Africa. What is our contention, Sir? Our contention is that unless this Government takes steps to produce evidence of that co-operation in concrete terms, then we have not yet achieved anything. So far there is little evidence of the Government taking imaginative action in fields that are going to produce practical results, or even that such action is under consideration. That is our criticism of the Government. That is my difficulty with this motion. I must approve what the Government intends doing. What does it intend doing, Sir? Have you heard? For almost every proposal we made from this side of the House, there was some excuse for not being able to accept it.</p>

<p>Sir, we went further. We said that if the Government hoped to achieve successful detente in Southern Africa, then it was dependent upon achieving detente at home. It was dependent upon the Government achieving racial harmony at home. What do we mean by racial harmony? Acting in such a way that everybody living in this country, whether White, Black or Brown, will believe that this country of ours offers them the greatest opportunity for living out their lives in happiness and security. I believe this Government has failed lamentably to create those conditions. I have repeatedly warned that the greatest area of vulnerability lies in the alienation of people of colour consequent upon the policies of this Government, because of the discriminatory treatment that is meted out to them. Sir, I am afraid that this type of discrimination is unavoidable under the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. You see, Sir, the Government cannot begin to make meaningful change in race relations in this country. It cannot begin to consider other practical and realistic ways of accommodating problems which that policy leaves unresolved unless it is prepared to look at changes in that policy.</p>

<p>I refer here just to one thing, namely ensuring a decent way of life for the urban Blacks. The hon. the Prime Minister has told us this afternoon of his negotiations with the homelands leaders and he has told us that the homeland leaders regard the urban Blacks as their people; they do not want the bond with them to be broken. But. Sir, what he did not tell us is what we on this side of the House know the urban Blacks are thinking about the situation. We have had consultations with many of them, and many of them are utterly dissatisfied with political rights in the homelands. But I go further. Many of them say: &#x201C;Look, political rights in the homelands we are not going to argue about at this stage, but what we want are civic rights where we live.&#x201D; Those civic rights include the right to run their own affairs and to have home ownership in those townships. <span class="col_409-410" refersTo="page_0220"/>But what does the hon. the Prime Minister tell them? That that is not part of his policy. I pointed out in my opening speech something to which nobody on that side of the House has replied, that if they want to improve race relations in South Africa, why not start by removing the discriminatory practices against the urban Black woman, since this is women&#x2019;s year?</p>

<p>I had no reply and the hon. the Deputy Minister had a chance to speak. He spoke after me; he cannot go on like this.</p>

<p>What about welfare facilities, what about job opportunities, what about equal pay for equal work? All these matters were raised and we had no reaction from that side of the House. When it comes to détente at home, what about the position in respect of the Indians and the Coloured people? The hon. the Prime Minister has been telling us of his discussions with them, he has been telling us of the possibility of Cabinet committees, but what say have those people in the Parliament which decides their destiny? It is not Government policy, says the Prime Minister. That is why we have proposed a federal solution in this House time and time again. The hon. the Prime Minister says if they sat here, they would have no say in how much money was voted, because he has never seen a sum of money voted that has been changed by this House. Is the position not that in a federal Parliament they would have a say in the federal assembly where the money was voted and that they would have control of the money voted in their legislative assembly where they go through the work which is necessary in that regard? That is one of the reasons why we have proposed a federal solution, because it gives a say to all groups in this country within that federal formula. There is machinery for a step-by-step installation of that system in consultation with all communities under the regulation and guidance of this Parliament as it develops.</p>

<p>What has been the treatment of members opposite of these proposals we have put forward? I think they fall into four categories. There have been the belittlers who tried to create an image of a United Party that not only had nothing to contribute, but whose policies were a danger to White survival in South Africa. Then we had those who tried to draw a red herring through the debate by trying to blow up troubles in the United Party. Then we had those who advanced policies differing from either ourselves or the Government. Lastly we had those who sincerely attempted to defend the policy of the Government against our criticism.</p>

<p>Let us deal with the first group, those who tried to belittle the proposals which <span class="col_411-412" refersTo="page_0221"/>we made and tried to belittle this party. Their objective was transparent. They are the propaganda mouthpieces. They aimed to keep their old scare-tactics alive. However, let me tell you that they are lamentably out of date even if it is through no fault of their own, even if they are the victims of their own indoctrination through the years and the indoctrination in their schools and their newspapers and the Broadcasting Corporation. This approach of the Nationalist Party of &#x201C;over my dead body we will have change&#x201D; is one which the Government for a quarter of a century has cultivated amongst its own people and supporters, but it is out of date and they are becoming a millstone around the neck of the hon. the Prime Minister, because they are the cause of the rigidity in policy and the difficulties which we have had in the last 25 years during which they have been in power. It is this indoctrination, that sort of attitude, that has led members like the hon. member for Durban Point to estimate that there must be 37 or 38 members on that side of the House who are not going to support the Prime Minister in the changes that he wants to make and the new policies which he wants to adopt. [Interjections.] The hon. members ask me where is my proof. Look at the division in their ranks, the conflicting statements about South West Africa. Look at their reactions to the opening of the Nico Malan Theatre. Look at their attitude in respect of the opening of parks to non-Whites in Pretoria. May I read them a little extract from an article not in an English-language paper, not in a paper which supports this side of the House, but in <i>Die Vaderland,</i> one of their newspapers (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<p>When I ask myself what the situation is, I am going to examine it against the background of the possibility of attaining peace in Southern Africa. What do we have? We have the contribution of those speakers who attempted to distract the attention of the House by having a field-day over the troubles of the United Party. The hon. the Prime Minister was not guiltless in that regard. Let me tell him that, having wasted the time of the House, when he is finished with them, he is still faced with the problems of South Africa. But since he has raised them I am going to deal with certain of those issues. The hon. the Prime Minister has raised the question of the caucus decision which was taken two days ago and other speakers in this House have also raised it. That was a decision taken for disciplinary reasons for gross disloyalty and the most severe penalty the caucus could impose was imposed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately what the hon. member for Yeoville said seems to have been the source of a great deal of confusion if one is to read what is reported in the Press. One headline this morning was: &#x201C;Schwarz defies caucus over sacking&#x2014;there was no question of disloyalty by Enthoven&#x201D;. When did the hon. member for Yeoville say that?

<p>I have confirmed that with him and that was what he meant. He meant that there was no question of disloyalty, on his part, to the party to which he belonged or to his elected leader.

I hope he will be very careful of what he says in future.</p>

<p>One of the proposals that I made was that steps should be taken and a foundation laid for the development of closer relationships in what I call Capricorn Africa. I made those proposals in some detail and they were replied to, I think, only by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The hon. gentleman had a number of things to say about my speech.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking of the speech. I go further. He said that I had spoken of &#x201C;a few miserable signs of success&#x201D;. That phrase is not in my Hansard. He also suggested that I had created the impression that South Africa was accountable to the United Nations as far as domestic matters were concerned. I specifically stated, however, that that was not so. I said that it was an implied condition of détente in Africa that certain things be done, but I said I was sure that no conditions were laid down for the use of that veto at the United Nations Organization. Now, the hon. gentleman was being an apologist. He dealt first of all with the question of migrant labour and the possibility of our having a charter for migrant labour, White as well as Black, throughout Southern Africa. What did he do? He countered with a number of individual inter-state agreements which are pretty well known, even to me, which offer no protection whatsoever to the White migrant, and which do not affect the position of the Black migrant in any state except South Africa. At the pace at which this Government moves we are going to be years and years away from a charter which is of general application throughout the states of Southern Africa, and which will give satisfactory status to the migrant labourer whatever his colour and in whatever state he works. That is what we want to see developing. The hon. the Minister gives no indication that he will work or strive for it; all he says is that he has these agreements.</p>

<p>As far as minorities are concerned, Black as well as White, he merely points to the difficulties of domestic jurisdiction which, of course, we know all about; He seems to have no constructive ideas. Our idea is a much more imaginative concept. There should be an acceptance of a convention of human rights in Southern Africa, in which the rights of minorities, Black as well as White, will be guaranteed by inter-state agreements mutually throughout the area. It seems to me as if the hon. gentleman does not distinguish, when we talk of internal interference, between freely negotiated agreements between sovereign states and an attempt to interfere in a state from outside, otherwise than by freely negotiated agreements.</p>

<p>A test of his sincerity is this Sarccus that he talks about. It is a regional agreement; it deals with soil conservation. He told us that the former chairman said that they discussed policy regularly. Is that interference in each other&#x2019;s internal affairs? Surely we could have something of that kind in respect of minorities. This is something that should be discussed by politicians at the highest level and not by soil conservationists alone.</p>

<p>I spoke about inter-state transport and communication. Once again the hon. the Minister spoke of various agreements and of co-operation at technical level. The sort of planning that I envisage, the sort of cooperation that I envisage, is not something that the engineers and the Railways can be talking about. It should be discussed at the highest level by the representatives of the States concerned. When we come to think of those agreements, the hon. member for Durban Point produced one of those agreements and what did we find? A few two-pence ha&#x2019;penny clauses which do not give any sort of suggestion of co-operation on a grand scale by people who can grasp the whole vision of a transport and communications network planned for the development of the whole area. We spoke of a co-ordinated transport system and I reminded the hon. gentleman of what had happened at the conference there in Pretoria nearly 40 years ago, of the problems of land-locked countries, of the necessity of such a system to stimulate commerce and to stimulate interdependence. So what have we got? I do not want to deal with each of these matters in turn, but I must say something more about two of them.</p>

<p><span class="col_417-418" refersTo="page_0224"/>One was the question of mutual economic and technical aid. What happened? The hon. gentleman fell back on the B.L.S. customs agreement.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<p>Why not?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, why not? It was merely a start. What about the other countries in Africa? The hon. gentleman knows that there was a stage when we were all under one administration and even in the monetary agreement which took place for the B.L.S. countries, I got the impression that South Africa was dragging her feet and that it was more or less forced on us by the other countries. The hon. the Minister speaks of the possibility of an economic bloc in Southern Africa, but why does the hon. gentleman not get moving? He must recognize that the economy of Southern Africa is indivisible. That is the point; that is where we are losing out at the present time. The hon. the Minister talks proudly of trade worth R700 million with Africa. Surely that is a foundation on which to build. Why not a regional industrial development agency as we suggested? There is no reason for not accepting this suggestion.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of energy resources, it seems to me that this is an opportunity not to be missed. African states are nearly all in desperate trouble about their fuel resources. Oil is playing up hell &#x2014;if I may say so, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;with their balance of payments position. The greatest single cause which has led to détente in Africa has been the oil shortage and the difficulties that have been experienced in respect of the balance of payments. This is the cause of their deficits and this is why they are wanting to talk. The problem of replacing oil as a source of energy has become so important that elsewhere individual countries, groups of countries and regions are getting together to try and protect themselves. Why is South Africa, which is the leading country in this region, not itself taking an initiative of this kind? The hon. the Minister talks of the tremendous amount of capital that will have to be spent and of the purchases South Africa may have to make in the beginning to keep these things going. However, this concerns the replacement of energy sources and not the creation of vast new supplies or making provision for a vast new consumption. It concerns the replacement of energy sources because of the cost of oil. It seems to me that this affords us an opportunity that is not to be missed. May I say, in passing, that I did not propose at this stage that there should be co-operation in respect of nuclear power in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>There is a last point; it concerns the question of strategic planning. It seems that there is a lack of a comprehensive view of all that is talked about, a lack of a grand strategy or a vision on the part of the Government as to what can be achieved here in Southern Africa. Sir, imagine it, the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Information treat the whole idea as though it were appeasement. I would have thought that binding people to you by stronger bonds should not be regarded as appeasement. Binding people to you by stronger bonds is common sense, not appeasement. That is what I am pleading for. It requires adaptation and courage. What is lacking at the present time, is a grand strategic design for peace and prosperity in a wide regional area here in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>We dealt also with the question of South West Africa. I made it perfectly clear that I believed that a rapid solution of this problem could have a double-pronged effect. It could help to achieve détente in Africa and there is no doubt whatever that it would have an effect on our relations with those other countries. If we got détente, it would secure the position of South West Africa in the area. However, I have had no replies to what I feel is the shortcoming at the present time and that is that South Africa is still the administering power in South West Africa. It seems to me that it is abdicating its responsibility and its international commitments by not having control over the manner, the means and the pace of achieving the agreed objectives in South West Africa. What have we heard from the hon. the Minister of Information, the hon. the Minister of Community Development and others? They are still going <span class="col_419-420" refersTo="page_0225"/>around to find out who represents the various race groups. This is an occasion where speed is necessary. It seems to me that this is where the Government is falling down. There are going to be interminable delays because of the state of development of the people concerned, the lack of facilities and the size of the Territory, and unless there is Government guidance, unless something is done to get this off the ground, I have no doubt whatever that we are going to take far longer than the period of much less than eight years of the ten years originally forecast, which is the period the hon. the Minister spoke about. I have had no reply from the hon. the Prime Minister as to what role the United Party in South West Africa is going to be allowed to play in these deliberations. I referred to the fact that the hon. the Minister had spoken in Geneva of the recognition of political parties in this process. Apart from the Nationalist Party, the United Party in South West Africa is probably the most important party in the Territory. But we have from him a refusal to put a federal suggestion before any meeting. They say that we can discuss it with them but we cannot argue it and it has been suggested that we should not argue it with the non-White peoples in South West Africa. I think that this is a tragedy; I think that this is a breach of what the hon. the Minister suggested at Geneva. I think that this is a matter which merits the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister himself.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman asked me what my attitude was in respect of the U.N. and Swapo. Need he ask this? The United Party has always stood by South West Africa and its peoples and will continue to do so. They are the people to be consulted and they are the people who will decide.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of strengthening the position of South Africa itself. We have said that détente in Africa depends on détente at home. The hon. the Prime Minister has dealt at length with the speech made by his ambassador at U.N. because we regard the removal of discrimination as being so very important in getting détente at home. The hon. gentleman has taken the line that all his ambassador undertook was that discrimination would be removed within the policy of separate development. However, I am afraid that if it is to be removed within the policy of separate development then, I do not have much hope for the end of discrimination. Part of the policy of separate development is that the Coloureds will never have a sovereign Parliament; that the Indians will never have a sovereign Parliament; that we will go on discriminating against people on the grounds of the colour of their skin alone. We will discriminate against them hurtfully and continue to do so under the policy of separate development. The story that all discrimination will disappear when there is independence of the homelands, is a story that can no longer be sold to the public and to the Black man in South Africa today. They do not accept it.</p>

<p>What do we mean by discrimination? I think that this is important because when the hon. the Prime Minister talks of discrimination it is quite clear that he and I seem to see things in a different light. He says that it is not discrimination; he says there is what he calls &#x201C;differentiation&#x201D;. I wonder if we can agree in regard to the meaning of discrimination. I believe it is largely an academic exercise for us to talk about it.</p>

<p>In his own country. Then, Sir, it should have <span class="col_421-422" refersTo="page_0226"/>been even more pertinent. I ask what we mean in this regard. I say that those at the receiving end can tell us best. To put the matter in its broadest sense, it is a sort of situation that was headlined in an Afrikaans newspaper recently. Again I wish to quote <i>Die Vaderland&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Vir hierdie soort bogtery het ons nie meer plek nie.</block>

<p>That is how that newspaper described a decision of the Department of Justice refusing eight Blacks to attend a bank staff part/ while allowing Coloured and Indian staff to attend. Can you believe it, Mr. Speaker? Sir, is that discrimination or is it differentiation? I think we have got to decide what the difference is between the two. I want to say that as far as I am concerned, differentiation is the acknowledgment of the existence of differences which nature, for instance, has decreed shall exist between people&#x2014;like between a man and a woman, between Whites, Blacks, Indians and Coloureds who can be recognized as groups. But differentiation at this stage has nothing to do with discrimination. Groups may be treated differently. Women athletes as a group do not normally compete against male athletes; that is differentiation, but it would be discrimination if women were not allowed to participate in athletics at all; it would be discrimination if they were not allowed to be members of certain clubs of which men were allowed to be members. Discrimination, Sir, is always an action, a decision, that goes against the wishes and interests of the group concerned, while differentiation could be recognized only in order to protect or further the interests of those concerned. Sir, I believe, that we have to get this meaning quite clear because if we do not, we are going to find ourselves in more and more difficulty in arguing for the things that we feel should be removed in accordance with the Government&#x2019;s policies and its undertaking. Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister has used the term &#x201C;differentiation on the grounds of colour&#x201D;. What criterion does one apply? When he was asked what this criterion was, he said: &#x201C;The test will be derived from the multi-national (veelvolkige) concept in South Africa.&#x201D; In other words, people will be differentiated in terms of their nationhood. Mr. Speaker, if they are differentiated in terms of their nationhood, then obviously all foreigners who came to South Africa should be treated in the same way. But, of course, they are not. If they are Black or Brown they are treated one way, and if they are White they are treated another way. So it has nothing to do with nationhood at all. The true criterion of differentiation as well as of discrimination remains race or colour and not nationhood, and that is the difficulty in which the hon. the Prime Minister has landed, and no attempt to call these things by different names is going to get him out of his problem. Sir, as long as we have discrimination so long are we going to have difficulties with our race relations, and we are not going to get racial co-operation until that is recognized and we have a pattern in which it can be worked. Sir, I think the appointment by the hon. the Prime Minister of members of other races to various boards shows his recognition of the fact that there are areas where the Whites should not decide alone. I think his concession to the Coloured people and the Indians, that they have a right to demand meaningful power, is an acknowledgment of that. I think the creation of a cabinet committee is also an acknowledgment of that. But the problem is that while he acknowledges it, he gives them no meaningful say. He consults them; they can advise but they have no power. Until he is prepared to give them some power in the decision-making, he is going to find that he will never get their full co-operation.</p>

That is what they would have told him. Hon. members opposite keep coming up with the suggestion that if we were to have a federal solution it would mean the sacrifice of sovereignty. Sir, there is no sacrifice of sovereignty. The whole essence of federation is that each group has control of its own affairs, and when it comes to matters of common interest there is power in the hands of all the groups concerned. Unless the hon. the Prime Minister is prepared to do something of that nature there is no argument whatever that he will not get the co-operation of these people.</p>

<p>When I look at the effect of what he is doing on the possibilities of détente in Africa, when I know what a problem discrimination is when one talks with other statesman of the world, and particularly in Africa, when I know what the problem is when one talks to the leaders of certain African states in respect of discrimination, when I know what the problem is when one talks to the homeland leaders here in South Africa on the question of their rights to some share of power, then I feel that the hon. gentleman is falling down in his efforts to bring about détente in Southern Africa. He is handicapping himself before he starts. It is like a man entering a race and carrying a big lead weight with him which prevents him going at full speed. I am afraid the position is going to remain the same as long as we have that sort of policy. Now the Prime Minister has asked for support for an amendment. He says that we support his plans for the future in Southern Africa. Sir, those plans are inadequate. There is no grand strategy, no grand plan or vision for peace and progress in Southern Africa based on mutual dependence, based on policies which have been developed, planned and built on powerful foundations. The hon. the Prime Minister knows that détente in Southern Africa will depend on his ability to achieve détente at home. While he fails to achieve détente at home, while he fails to get full co-operation at home, how can he say that we can support his plans for the future? He is tied down all the time. He is handicapped before he can start running. What undertaking have we got in respect of the removal of discrimination within the policy of separate development? What hope has he in respect of race relations? What hope has he while he denies a federal structure within which to develop? What hope has he in guiding South Africa through the socio-economic revolution which is coming and which he cannot stop, within the confines of the policy of separate development as it is applied at present? What hope has he of peaceful change in South Africa while he follows this policy to which he has got himself wedded at present? What hope has he of fulfilling that destiny in Southern Africa which both he and I believe is something which is South Africa&#x2019;s responsibility?</p>

<p>You know, Sir, when we started this afternoon we listened to the hon. member for Smithfield who said that this party is &#x201C;soos &#x2019;n hoender wat se kop afgekap is, maar dit skop nog&#x201D;. May I remind the hon. <span class="col_425-426" refersTo="page_0228"/>gentleman that this particular chicken has been kicking pretty hard for the last 36 years. What a chicken, Mr. Speaker! One would have thought that any reasonable man would come to the conclusion that it was still very much alive and kicking hard, but this Government will not face realities. They will not face realities and that is one of the main reasons for our lack of confidence in them.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>An explanatory memorandum on the Bill was tabled and I take it hon. members have found it useful. I shall consequently only deal with the clauses.</p>

<p><i>Clauses</i> 1 <i>and</i> 7:</p>

<p>The relevant provisions of the constitutions of the Bantu homelands and the proposed amendments thereto are of the same nature and for that reason I shall discuss clauses 1 and 7 simultaneously. In terms of existing arrangements, the revenue fund of a Bantu homeland government has the following sources of revenue&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>1. Income which I shall refer to as &#x201C;own revenue&#x201D;, and which consists of the following:

<ol>

<li>(a)

<ol>

<li>(i) taxes or levies payable by citizens in terms of the Bantu Taxation Act, 1969, the Bantu Trust and Land Act, 1936, and an Act of the legislative assembly;</li>

<li>(ii) taxes which, in terms of Act of Parliament or an ordinance of a province, are imposed on the incomes, profits or gains of a private company operated in the area and in which Bantu have a controlling interest;</li>

<li>(iii) estate or succession duty levied by an Act of Parliament in respect of the estate of a citizen who, at the time of his death, was ordinarily resident in the area concerned.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(b) All revenue, including licence fees, taxes, fees of office, fines, forfeitures, rents and other moneys derving from the administration of matters in respect of which the legislative assembly may make laws.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>2. An amount determined by statute and which I refer to as the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D;. This amount consists of an annual grant to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund approved by the Minister of Finance of the Republic after consultation with the Controller and Auditor-General and corresponding to the expenditure by the Government of the Republic in respect of the matters the administration of which is transferred to the Government of the area concerned, during the financial year preceding the date of the transfer, less&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) the income from existing sources which no longer accrues to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, but will accrue to the Revenue Fund;</li>

<li>(ii) the salaries, allowances, pension contributions and other benefits payable in respect of seconded officers of the Republic.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>3. An additional sum of money appropriated by Parliament for the due performance of services and duties assigned <span class="col_431-432" refersTo="page_0231"/>to the Government of the area concerned.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you and hon. members will recall that the hon. the Prime Minister announced during 1974 that, arising from discussions with homeland leaders earlier that year concerning the fair distribution of certain tax revenue, the Government has given consideration to the matter and is prepared to consider revising the existing system after further consultation wit the homeland leaders concerned. After due consideration had been given to the basis of financing, detailed proposals in writing concerning the revision of the system, were submitted to the homeland leaders concerned and, after comments had been awaited and the proposals had been accepted, the draft legislation was submitted for comment to all the relevant homeland Cabinets/Executive Councils, and agreement was obtained.</p>

<p>Arising out of the said negotiations it is now being proposed to effect certain changes to the pattern of financing, which I shall discuss now.</p>

<p>The sources of revenue which I referred to as &#x201C;own income&#x201D; are being left unchanged, but before I begin to discuss the proposed amendments in respect of the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D;, I should just like to mention briefly that although the Act empowers the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to determine, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, to what extent direct taxes will accrue to the homelands, the said Ministers have already determined that such taxes will, as a whole, be so distributed irrespective of whether the taxpayer is resident in the White area or in the homeland area.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, the basic year for the determination of the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D; is the year preceding the transfer of a particular matter to a homeland. On account of this the basic years of respective homelands differ because responsible government was assumed by the homelands on different dates. The basic year in respect of particular matters for the same homeland also differs because the responsibility for different matters was taken over on different dates after responsible government had been assumed.</p>

<p>As regards the matters which had been transferred to homelands governments or are transferred to them after 31 March 1973 and in respect of which no amount was credited to the Revenue Fund during the 1973-&#x2019;74 financial year, the basic year will still be the year preceding the transfer of the matter.</p>

<p>It is well known that the costs of services and administration are gradually rising. Since the basic year for the determination of the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D; differs, the element of increases in costs has been compensated for to a greater degree in &#x201C;statutory amounts&#x201D; in respect of the younger homeland governments than in the case of an older homeland government.</p>

<p>The aforementioned position does not mean that the one homeland government will be better off financially than the other, but it does mean that an older government is being financed to a greater degree by means of the additional appropriations than by means of the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D; which creates the impression of greater economic dependence.</p>

<p>These amendments seek to make the basic year for all existing homeland governments in respect of matters already transferred, the same, i.e. the year 1973-&#x2019;74, so that all homeland governments will be treated on a uniform basis. Of course, the result of this will be that the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D; will increase in relation to the &#x201C;additional amount&#x201D;. Existing legislation does not provide for the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D; to be increased, save through the transfer of additional matters, and this amount has in fact decreased over the years, to the extent to which increased amounts in respect of salaries and allowances of seconded officers of the Republic have been deducted, and the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D; has been reduced in relation to the additional amount.</p>

<p>The salaries and allowances of White seconded officers were taken into consideration as expenditure at the time of the determination of the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D;, but since the Act lays down that salaries and allowances have to be deducted from the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D;, this has created the erroneous impression that homeland governments have to provide for the expenditure themselves whereas it simply means that the amount was first added and subsequently deducted. To eliminate any further confusion the provision that salaries and allowances should be deducted in this way is now being deleted.</p>

<p>The method of determining the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D; is being amended further by <span class="col_433-434" refersTo="page_0232"/>providing for the &#x201C;additional amount&#x201D; credited to the relevant Revenue Fund during the financial year ended 31 March 1974 (less the amounts determined which will accrue to the Revenue Fund in terms of paragraph (iv) and (v) (customs, excise and sales duty as well as company tax)) to be added in the calculation of the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D;.</p>

<p>To be able to compensate for the increase in the costs of services, provision is also being made in the amendment for the said amounts to be adjusted by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, with due regard to factors such as, for example, the general cost structure.</p>

<p>As indicated, tax on incomes, profits or gains of private companies operated in an area and in which Bantu have the controlling interests, accrue to the Revenue Fund of a homeland. However, it is considered fair that tax on the incomes, profits or gains of all companies carrying on industrial, commercial or business undertakings in a homeland, irrespective of whether these are private companies and irrespective of whether Bantu have the controlling interest in them, should accrue to the Revenue Fund of the homeland concerned, and this is in fact being done by the amendments.</p>

<p>Homeland governments have no legislative powers over customs and excise, but since a certain part of the revenue which accrues to the Treasury is generated in the homelands through customs, excise and sales duty, it is also deemed fair and desirable that the calculated amount of such revenues should accrue to the Revenue Funds of the homelands.</p>

<p>It may just be mentioned that the amounts which are made available to homelands by means of additional appropriations are considerably more than the total revenue of the said indirect taxes generated in the homelands.</p>

<p>At present no records and facilities exist for the direct apportionment of the said indirect taxation and for that reason it is being proposed to calculate and apportion the amount on the basis of available statistics in respect of total revenue, domestic expenditure and population. The calculation will be subject to periodic redeterminations/ recalculation.</p>

<p>The Government is fully aware of the fact that although the statutory revenues of homelands will be increased considerably, it will still be necessary, for the foreseeable future, to supplement homeland revenues by means of additional appropriations. However, such additional appropriations will (in relation to the &#x201C;statutory amount&#x201D;) be less than in the past and this reflects the smaller degree to which homelands are dependent on grants from the Government of the Republic.</p>

<p><i>Clauses</i> 2, 3 <i>and</i> 4</p>

<p>Hon. members are aware of the fact that Bantu Affairs Administration Boards have been established and that the boards have taken over from local authorities certain duties in respect of the administration of Bantu in urban areas. Such boards have now also taken over the management of district labour bureaux to a large extent. The running of the aforementioned bureaux involves expenditures to the boards and it is consequently the intention to allow the revenue from district labour bureaux, which is at present being credited to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, to accrue to the body which runs and finances the bureau, i.e. the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards.</p>

<p><i>Clause 5</i></p>

<p>The present legal provisions provide for voting to take place in an election of members of a legislative council in the territory of South West Africa, therefore outside the relevant homeland as well, but they do not authorize such voting in the Republic. Due to the fact that considerable numbers of voters are in the Republic, the amendment also proposes to make voting possible in the Republic.</p>

<p><i>Clauses 6 and</i> 8</p>

<p>Just as in the case of the Transkeian Constitution, provision is also made in the constitutions of the other homelands in the Republic and South West Africa for the establishment of High Courts. When the High Court was established in the Transkei certain minor difficulties were experienced in respect of the application of certain existing Acts in the area of jurisdiction of a High Court, the pension rights of a judge of the Supreme Court of South Africa seconded to serve as Chief Justice of the High Court, the interpretation of certain terms in existing Acts in respect of the High Court and the validity of process of a High Court in the area of jurisdiction of divisions of the Supreme Court and other High Courts. These minor difficulties in respect of the Transkei were rectified during the past session and this amendment serving before the <span class="col_435-436" refersTo="page_0233"/>House now envisages similar adjustments in respect of the other homelands in the Republic and South West Africa.</p>

<p><i>Clause</i> 9</p>

<p>There is no legal authority for a Bantu Affairs Administration Board to operate a bank overdraft. This state of affairs entails that beards have to keep considerable amounts in current accounts in order to avoid operating a bank overdraft and in this way the boards lose interest could have earned on surplus money. Therefore, the amendment proposes the authorizing of bank overdraft facilities.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope the Bill has now been fully elucidated and that it will receive the general support of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for the way in which he has introduced this legislation this afternoon. I must thank him for the lengthy explanation he has given, particularly of clauses 1 and 7. But, Sir, I regret that I cannot thank him on behalf of this side of the House for any explanatory memorandum. We have had this fight in this House before, Sir. It is normal courtesy, when we have a General Law Amendment Bill such as this one, for the Government to let us have timeously, so that we will have an opportunity to study it, a White Paper setting out the provisions of the Bill and the reasons for the introduction of those provisions. This afternoon the hon. the Deputy Minister started by referring to a White Paper which we on this side of the House&#x2014;and this is the ground for my objection&#x2014;found on our desks this afternoon for the first time.</p>

I want to go further and say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that we on this side of the House were in communication with his department on Wednesday of last week, and at that stage no White Paper existed and we were advised that there was no intention of issuing such a White Paper. Sir, I begin with this protest.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister is in a privileged position. If he got his last week, I want to know why we did not get ours at the same time. Are the hon. the Minister and hon. members on that side in a privileged position?</p>

<p>Having got that off my chest, having registered my protest, let me now deal with the Bill and deal with it on its merits. This is an omnibus Bill which amends five Acts, the Transkei Constitution Act, the Bantu Labour Act, the Development of Self-government (Native Nations of South West Africa) Act, the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act and the Bantu Affairs Administration Act.</p>

<p>Sir, clauses 1 and 7 are the main clauses in the Bill and I intend dealing with them last. Clauses 2, 3 and 4 are merely administrative. They arise from the Bantu Affairs Administration Act and make provision that certain moneys which are collected, fines which are paid and bail which is entreated, should now accrue to the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards and no longer to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Sir, although we opposed the establishment of these Bantu Affairs Administration Boards, this is a logical step in the light of legislation which is in existence and which I am not permitted to criticize this afternoon, but as this is a logical extension we will not oppose those clauses. Clause 4, incidentally, also provides that in future the Department of Posts and Telecommunications will have to pay levies and charges to these Bantu administration boards in respect of their African employees. I believe this is only fair and I am very glad to see this particular provision in the Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 5, which deals with the elections held in South West Africa by the native peoples of South West Africa, we welcome particularly because it now puts them in the same position as any voter within the Republic. It was an anomaly which existed then and I sincerely hope that this puts right any hardship which was done to any South West African citizens who were at a disadvantage because they happen to be working in the Republic and were deprived of their vote in the recent elections particularly.</p>

<p>Clauses 6 and 8 we also find unobjectionable. The hon. the Deputy Minister <span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0234"/>pointed out that he had a dummy-run last year when he applied similar provisions to the High Court of the Transkei. He now intends, with these two clauses, to apply the same provisions to the high courts of the Bantu homelands in South West Africa and the other homelands in the Republic. But, Sir, the hon. the Deputy Minister has left out something here. Last year when we debated the question of whether or not this provision should be applied to the High Court of the Transkei, we asked him then which Acts he intended to apply, which Acts he contemplated would be applied and why they would be applied. He told us then that the only one he foresaw at that stage was the Attorneys, Notaries and Conveyancers Admission Act. He mentioned this afternoon the question of the service of processes of the High Court of the Transkei in other areas of the Republic and also the service of processes of other high courts in all areas of the Republic. He also mentioned that they got rid of the &#x201C;haakplekke&#x201D; and were able to iron them all out. But I should like him to fell us which Acts have in fact been applied, which regulations have in fact been applied, to the High Court of the Transkei so that we can have a much more informed debate in the Committee Stage on this particular clause. I should like to know exactly what has been applied and why they were applied. I have a note here in regard the absence of a White Paper but I have already dealt with that particular point.</p>

<p>Clause 9 is also unexceptionable. It provides that the Bantu Affairs Administration Board, should be allowed to obtain money by way of bank overdrafts. I believe that this is merely to regularize the position as it is today. I believe that there has been a conflict of interpretation in regard to the term &#x201C;any loans&#x201D; and we are not going to object to this clause. I want to say that provided the hon. the Minister keeps a strict check on the situation and that a situation does not develop where a Bantu Administration Board will exist on a permanent overdraft. I do not see that we will have objections.</p>

<p>I come now to clauses 1 and 7, which are the real meat in this Bill. It makes provision regarding the financing of the various Black Governments within the Republic by the central Government. The hon. the Deputy Minister explained at length the present sources of finance of the various homelands&#x2014;the Transkei and the other homelands within the Republic. The question does arise, however, why these provision are not made to apply now also to the homelands in South West Africa. I mention that in passing and I hope that we will get a reply from the hon. the Deputy Minister when he replies to this debate so that we can deal with the matter further in the Committee Stage. The hon. the Deputy Minister has set out at length the sources of income for the various homelands as they exist at the moment. Sir, of all those only one&#x2014;I do not think it is necessary for me to repeat them&#x2014;has been changed, and that is what he has referred to as the statutory grant, i.e. a grant which is voted by this House and which is based on a formula laid down in the Acts at the moment. I say &#x201C;Acts&#x201D; because we are dealing here with two Acts, one being the Transkei Constitution Act and the other Bantu Homelands Constitution Act.</p>

<p>The amendments proposed by the hon. the Deputy Minister, which he has set out at length&#x2014;and we have no argument with what he has said, no argument at all&#x2014; deal with this formula. They give an impression of economic independence for these Bantu homelands. The hon. the Deputy Minister, if I recollect correctly, did in fact use that phrase and said that by these amendments, which he is introducing today, it is his intention to give economic independence to the homelands. I am afraid that I must disagree with him this afternoon. This cannot be construed as economic independence for the homelands.</p>

<p>The first question which arises, and to my mind the most important question, is why no provisions have been made in his amendments, which are now before this House, for consultation with the homeland Government concerned. Why is the Minister of Finance of the homeland Government concerned not recognized in this legislation at all? Sir, I must draw your attention to sub-paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) of the new paragraph (c) of section 52(1) of the Transkei Constitution Act, which is substituted by clause 1. In subparagraph (iii), for instance, it is provided that the amount which is to be paid shall be &#x201C;as determined by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in consultation with the Minister of Finance of the Republic&#x201D;. In sub-paragraph (iv), again, we find those same words concerning the funds derived by such companies from industrial, commercial or other business undertakings carried on by them in the Transkei. The other homelands are referred to <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0235"/>in clause 7. Again in sub-paragraph (v), we have a reference to &#x201C;an amount determined from time to time by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in consultation with the Minister of Finance of the Republic&#x201D; in determining the amount to be paid by way of customs, excise and sales duties derived in the Transkei. And again the same applies to the other homelands.</p>

<p>Why is no mention made of the Minister of Finance of the Transkei in this clause and of the other homelands in the other clause? You know, Sir, that there is a difference of opinion between this side of the House and the governing party regarding how we believe South Africa should be governed. We have advocated a federal system which we believe to be the only answer for the problems which beset us in this country. You will know that, in terms of our federal system, we believe that the Minister of Finance of each constituent unit must consult with and will be consulted by the federal Minister of Finance when it comes to the amounts which shall accrue to each of those constituent units. That explains my point of view, but we find that the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration have been consulting with the leaders of these homelands. They had a big indaba here a couple of weeks ago. Statements were issued and the hon. the Prime Minister is on record as having said that he wishes to establish détente not only with outside countries, but within the Republic. How does this show the earnestness of the hon. the Prime Minister when the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration comes with legislation like this which does not acknowledge the existence of the homeland at all?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, this is not entirely different. The hon. the Deputy Minister made the interjection I expected him to make, namely that this is entirely different. Here was a golden opportunity for this Government to show its honesty and its integrity to the Black leaders, to establish its <i>bona fides</i> and to say to the Black homelands: &#x201C;We recognize you. We will consult with you. We give you a place in our law whereby you can claim as a right that economic independence which the hon. the Deputy Minister referred to.&#x201D; I want to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s words are only just words. In exactly the same way my leader, Sir De Villiers Graaff, said to the Prime Minister during the no-confidence debate: &#x201C;Stop talking and let us do something.&#x201D; That is why we had to vote against the amendment moved by the hon. the Prime Minister; because it was only words. It was nothing but words, words, words. Let us see his actions, then we can talk about voting for his amendment. Here was a golden opportunity too for action; here was a golden opportunity to show us the earnestness, the <i>bona fides,</i> of the Government, a readiness to consult with these Governments on an equal basis. But no, they funked the issue. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister has an answer to this and that there is, perhaps, a reason why these homeland Governments should not be consulted in establishing these amounts. How can they be satisfied with an amount which is provided for them in terms of legislation if they play no role in establishing it? The hon. the Deputy Minister now says: &#x201C;We give those Black Governments the right to this amount of money&#x201D;, but he does not give them the opportunity of sitting in on the consultation which will decide what that amount shall be. The hon. the Deputy Minister mentioned the question of escalating costs. The clause starts off by pegging the amount as at 31 March 1974. He then provides an escalation clause in the proviso to that paragraph which states that &#x201C;any or all of the amounts referred to in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) may be adjusted from time to time to the extent determined by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development in consultation with the Minister of Finance &#x2026;&#x201D;. This consultation does not take place with the Minister of Finance of the homeland concerned, but of the Republic. Again he fails to acknowledge the Bantu homeland Government concerned. I believe this is an oversight on the part of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I believe they should be recognized and that it should be entrenched in the law that they should be consulted and that they should have the right to help determine these amounts. I wonder if the hon. the Deputy Minister will react and tell us why it has been left out, if there is a good and sufficient reason, so that we can discuss this matter further in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>There is one other matter about which I was disappointed. If we look at the existing <span class="col_441-442" refersTo="page_0236"/>legislation, viz. the Transkei Constitution Act, we find in section 52(a)(ii) that included in the moneys which accrue to the Transkei and included in the statutory amount the hon. the Deputy Minister referred to, is the amount of any &#x201C;tax on incomes, profits or gains&#x201D; paid by &#x201C;any citizen of the Transkei who is ordinarily resident in the Transkei or by any company which is recognized as a private company&#x201D; and which trades and operates within the Transkei. So far so good. But when we look at the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act&#x2014;I refer to section 6(2)(a)(ii)&#x2014; we find that there is a difference. Whereas the Transkei can claim the income tax which is paid by its citizens&#x2014;that is, the income tax which is paid to the Republican Government&#x2014;who are resident in the Transkei, the other homeland Governments may not claim as a right the income tax which is paid to the Republican Government by their citizens who are resident in their areas. This paragraph provides that all moneys payable &#x201C;in terms of any Act of Parliament or any Ordinance imposing any tax on incomes, profits or gains &#x2026; by any company which is recognized as a private company&#x201D; and is trading in the homelands, shall be paid into the Revenue Fund of an area. There is no mention of the citizens. In other words, as I read the position, the Transkei Government can claim as part of this statutory amount which must be voted by this House, the tax which is paid by Transkei citizens, viz. income tax paid to the Republican Government, but that no other homeland Government, like KwaZulu and Ga Rankuwa, can do the same, as no provision exists in this regard. I had hoped that in this legislation the hon. the Deputy Minister would have included a provision to amend the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act to bring it into line with the Transkei Constitution Act.</p>

<p>Sir, I have registered our protest at the late arrival of the White Paper and I have mentioned to the hon. the Deputy Minister the questions which arise in our minds. I want to tell him now that we will not oppose this legislation. Unfortunately the hon. member for Houghton is not in her seat at the moment. Last year when we dealt with the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill, she read to us a homily on what to do with these omnibus Bills. She said we must oppose all of them every time, this being the attitude that she had adopted. We, however, are not opposing this this afternoon. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. member for Houghton. We shall not oppose it, though I sincerely hope that we shall hear from them what their attitude is going to be.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South had to take over the role of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana today because I think there is a counting going on somewhere. The counting is being proceeded with in view of last week&#x2019;s counting of heads which resulted in that hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South being really unable to devote time to this explanatory memorandum. The hon. member is terribly upset about this explanatory memorandum now, but this memorandum reached our benches here in the House last Thursday. If the hon. member had in any way wanted to take trouble and had been less involved with the in-fighting in his party, there would have been sufficient time for him properly to study this simple Bill before us. I should like to give the hon. member credit for being, in my opinion, far too intelligent to need a week to scrutinize this legislation. However, in the speech by the hon. member we really received the big difference and I am pleased that the hon. member pointed that out.</p>

<p>The hon. member attacked the hon. the Deputy Minister because, according to him, the Ministers of Finance of the various Bantu homeland governments are not consulted under this legislation when the statutory amount or the amount of the taxation levied indirectly or the supplementary amount is determined. The hon. member states that in terms of their federation idea those Ministers of the homeland governments would be able to consult together and decide jointly on the amount of money for the homelands. If that, then, is the case under their policy, the hon. member must now tell us whether he admits that the Bantu homelands can have a say in the finances in that way or does he mean, quite simply, that in terms of the federation which they now advocate, the Bantu will share in the budget for the whole South Africa? I think that these are two small differences in which the hon. member for Randburg himself would be interested. To us, however, it is important because we state very expressly in this legislation that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development will decide on that statutory amount, as well as on the amount that will accrue by way of <span class="col_443-444" refersTo="page_0237"/>indirect taxation and the supplementary amount that may be necessary, quite simply because a Minister of a homeland government cannot have a say in the funds of a White government. After all, we cannot allow the Minister of Finance of the Transkei, or of any homeland whatsoever, to have any say in the finances of White South Africa, i.e. the budget which this Parliament compiles. After all, we are an autonomous government with an autonomous department which will decide on that. The hon. member does not understand how these matters work. The hon. the Minister explained to the hon. member that this legislation before the House today has the approval of the Bantu homelands. It is essential that we take cognizance of the fact that this is an amendment bill. The principle of the statutory amount has already been laid down in other legislation, and there it is provided that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development will determine the amount. It has become clear over the years that in determining the figure for the statutory amount, it has not always been possible to budget so close to the correct figure as to allow it to be regarded as the total figure necessary for the administration of the Bantu homelands. The principle was then introduced that there could be a supplementary amount. This therefore, is by no means a new principle before the House today because the same appears in the old Act. Nor is it being amended now. All that is being done, is that the basis here is being changed to enable a similar basis here to be obtained for all the homeland governments. The only new concept we have in this legislation today in regard to taxation or the source of income of the Bantu homelands, concerns indirect taxation. In fact, with the acknowledgement of the fact that the homeland governments are entitled to certain taxes, we have reached an important milestone, something which may perhaps go by unnoticed today because the Opposition is not going to make an issue of it. This is an important milestone in that we are giving the homeland governments a direct interest in the indirect tax contributed by the Bantu by way of purchase tax, customs and excise duty, and so on. Seen from the National Party&#x2019;s point of view, this is a very important matter, a step forward, a step in the direction of the entire pattern towards which we should like to see the homelands developing until, eventually, they are running their own economic structure and their own finances. The Government is also displaying definite realism in this regard. It said in the past that the Bantu contributed a certain amount indirectly by way of purchase tax and so on. When these formulae are set in operation, we shall have the opportunity to see what the real amounts are which are paid by the Bantu in respect of indirect taxation in the form of purchase tax, customs and excise duty, etc. As regards customs and excise tax and taxes of this kind, we are now coming into line with the treatment which the other Bantu areas in Southern Africa, namely Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, receive from us. A customs agreement similar to that which was concluded with those countries, will be concluded. Once again this is an acknowledgment of the progress made with regard to the autonomous handling of their own finances by the homeland governments. The hon. member said that only private companies were taxable as far as the other homelands were concerned, but perhaps he simply forgot how the taxes operate at this stage. The homeland governments receive their share of the ordinary poll tax, of the ordinary tax received. In the past it was provided that private companies also paid their share of income tax which they would have had to pay to the White government, to the homeland government itself. All that is happening now, is that the whole provision is being extended. Now it is not only the poll tax and the taxes paid by private companies that are going to the homeland governments. This now covers all companies and not only private companies. All companies, therefore, will now pay tax to the homeland government.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Deputy Minister said, the formula is something new. A certain year is taken as a basic year as regards the statutory amounts, but we shall have to understand that it will not be possible for the departments concerned&#x2014;the Department of Finance, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development&#x2014;to tell us immediately what the amount is that will be levied in this way by way of indirect taxation and the extension of taxation with regard to companies other than private companies. We shall, at least first have to see that a proper list is compiled of companies doing business in the Bantu homelands. We must know what the practical situation is in the homelands. Very often the controlling company is in South Africa while the subsidiary company does business in the <span class="col_445-446" refersTo="page_0238"/>Bantu homelands. In that case it is not simply a matter relating to the levying of taxes; it will also concern the basic relationships and statutory relationships between controlling companies and subsidiary companies. We shall have to attend to these aspects. A list will have to be compiled concerning those companies, how they pay their taxes, at what rate and what the amount will be. Only then will we be able to determine what the figure will be. We must expect it to take some time, at least, before this step is implemented in the Bantu homelands. However, that this is a step in the right direction, is very clear. It will provide us with an indication of how economically viable the Bantu homelands are, viz. on the basis of the profits made by companies in the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>It is very clear that the Government&#x2019;s idea in introducing this legislation is to establish a clear pattern of financing for the Bantu homelands. In many respects this can clarify certain matters for us. On the one hand, for example, it can give the Whites in South Africa an idea of what the Bantu homelands really contribute. I say this particularly in view of those who maintain that we are always giving money to the Bantu homelands without knowing what is done with that money. On the other hand the White person in South Africa can then be put in the picture in regard to the situation there. In the past we have been unable to determine which part of the statutory amount and of the supplementary amount were really paid by the Bantu in the form of tax. In the future we shall be able to determine what the pattern is and will at least be able to determine, percentage-wise, what proportion is contributed by the Bantu themselves in the form of taxation for the development within the homeland areas. I hope that the hon. member is now clear on the whole question of companies and tax.</p>

<p>Another very important aspect which we cannot overlook is the extension of the powers of the Bantu Administration Boards. As the hon. member said, the Opposition fought the establishment of these Bantu Administration Boards, I could almost say, tooth and nail in this House. This is no different to the way it has been with all other aspects of Bantu legislation as well. As soon as it is operating properly, the Opposition says: &#x201C;Yes, we were against the Act, but since it is working well you may continue with it.&#x201D; This is merely what we usually have from the Opposition. As far as the amendment of the legislation concerning the Bantu Administration Boards is concerned, there are two matters of importance. In the first place, progressively more provision is being made to make available their own funds for the Administration Boards. Fines are transferred to them, and the levy paid to the labour bureaux now also accrues to the Bantu Administration Boards. Even the fact that an Administration Board is now authorized to have a bank overdraft indicates to us that these Bantu Administration Boards are to acquire a far greater degree of autonomy in the execution of their duties. Under this legislation these Bantu Administration Boards will be allowed to increase certain fees. In this respect we also leave it to the administration boards to determine for themselves, within the framework of the legislation, how these fees are to be adjusted to allow the board to function as an economically self-supporting board. This is being done because they are experiencing certain practical problems in urban areas, problems which are not really of any importance to us at this stage. This concession in itself gives more authority to the Bantu Administration Boards, and I believe that it will bear the necessary fruit.</p>

<p>I just want to say, with regard to the references to the High Court, that I believe that the hon. the Deputy Minister himself will indicate what legislation is involved there. In any event, I do not think it is of great importance at this stage which legislation is now involved. However, I think that it is essential for us to define the functions of the High Court at an early stage in such a way that when the High Court is really in full operation in various regions, they will be able to do their work without hindrance of any kind. The legislation concerned can then be submitted to the House by way of notice by the hon. the Deputy Minister or whoever it may be. The House could then be notified what kind of legislation was involved. The fact is that a principle is involved here; not the indication of which specific legislation is envisaged here.</p>

<p>In general we want to say that we on this side are grateful that the Opposition is not going to oppose this legislation. It is an essential piece of legislation which can mean a very great deal for the proper and expeditious flow of the administration of Bantu Affairs and particularly for the sources of finance for the homelands. However, we must draw attention to the fact that the <span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0239"/>hon. member for Umhlatuzana, who is usually the first speaker on Bantu Affairs on the Opposition side, is not in the House. We do not want to say that we trust that the counting of votes is progressing well. In fact we are a little worried because it does not matter which of the two gentlemen in connection with which this counting of votes is now taking place, comes back. The United Party&#x2019;s difficulty will always remain similar to that of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, viz. that in this session they will always be confused with regard to legislation because they will not know which side of the United Party&#x2019;s case they will have to present here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to start by telling the hon. the Deputy Minister that we on these benches have no objection to the provisions of clause 9. It is clearly a sensible decision on business grounds and should have been done some time ago. We do not have any fundamental objections either to clauses 6 and 8 whereby the State President is empowered by the principal Act to constitute a separate high court to exercise jurisdiction in any self-governing territory. The High Court of the Transkei is, of course, the first example. However, we do want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that this idea of the proliferation of these high courts gives us cause for some alarm because presumably we will end up with ten if in fact the other homelands follow the example of the Transkei, although there may be some advantage in the fact that it will give Black South Africans a greater opportunity of participating directly in the administration of justice. However, in dealing with clauses 1 and 7, we come to realize that this is a Bill of great importance since it goes straight to the heart of the policy of the Government for the future of South Africa. As such it is of great concern to all of us who live in this land, Black, White and Brown.</p>

<p>As set out in clauses 1 and 7, this Bill deals with the revenue which will accrue to the Transkei under the policy of this Government in regard to that territory as it moves towards what is termed by the Government as independence. The Transkei may be the first and it may be the last or it may simply be the forerunner of other territories such as KwaZulu and Lebowa which will follow a similar road. This, of course, is the reason for clause 7. Whatever the case may be, however, it is of cardinal importance that all South Africans should take note of and weigh carefully the consequences of this course of action as it is going to affect the lives of everyone of us who lives in South Africa. They are already being affected and they will be increasingly affected sooner or later by the success or failure of this Government&#x2019;s and this particular department&#x2019;s policy of the development of self-governing territories. It is therefore imperative that we comprehend the intentions of this Government and of the hon. the Minister so that we may come to an objective conclusion as to whether the course of action as set out in this Bill and which is the essence of it, will be in the long term interests of the majority of all the peoples living in our country.</p>

<p>Only last week the Government itself clearly implied that this should be the only criterion when it said that it wanted to move away from discrimination based upon the colour of a person&#x2019;s skin, because surely the hon. the Minister does not intend the policy of differentiation or the policy which is the essence of this legislation and the mechanism set up in clauses 1 and 7, as opposed to discrimination, if there is such a distinction, to result in a situation where everybody living in this country, whether in the Transkei, kwaZulu, Lebowa or so-called White South Africa, is going to be worse off than if clauses 1 and 7 did not come into force.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said the following on 8 February 1971 during his introduction of the Bantu Homelands Constitution Bill, which was a forerunner of the Bill which we are now discussing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This differentiation, that is, that the White nation and the various Bantu nations in South Africa will therefore each have a Government of its own in accordance with its own character and needs, is not only a natural phenomenon throughout the world but also complies with the Christian outlook on life of &#x201C;live and let live&#x201D;, which is in effect a basic principle of our policy.</block>

<p>Please note those words, Mr. Speaker, &#x201C;live and let live&#x201D;, as I will come back to them in relation to clauses 1 and 7. Then, <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0240"/>Sir, the former hon. the Minister of Finance said in his Budget speech on 14 August last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The increase in the Vote of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development of some R85 million &#x2026;</block>

<p>bringing the total figure&#x2014;I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;to the order of R465 million&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; reflects the determination of the Government to create viable &#x2026;</block>

<p>Note that word, too, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; homelands where they can evolve towards independence.</block>

<p>It seems clear, therefore, that the underlying thrust beneath clauses 1 and 7 is presumably to cover the money to be put at the disposal of the homelands, and these two Ministers respectively have been given very wide powers of discretion. Presumably, too, it is done on the assumption that if the policy of separate development, which underlies this Bill, is not just a device by which the Government hopes to try to maintain the White monopoly of political power over the vast majority of our land, there is a constant theme that the homelands and the Transkei in particular must be developed to the point where they can stand on their own two feet as viable entities.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I hope hon. members will think carefully about the implications of this. The hon. the Prime Minister has stated that he will share neither the political power nor the assets of so-called White South Africa. It must be assumed, therefore, that the Government has been telling us that they intend to create nine separate viable economies within our country, of which the Transkei is to be the first. Mr. Speaker, it simply cannot be done. Even given the great wealth of this country and the potential for further enrichment open to it, the price is too high and could not be paid, nor indeed should it be paid, as it will result in a drastically lower standard of living than could otherwise be enjoyed by all South Africans, Black, Brown and White.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister and hon. members opposite will recall the figures given in the report of the Board for the Decentralization of Industry for the year ended December 1973. Over the whole period since 1960 it has provided some 115 000 employment opportunities, 11 000 of which were for Whites, at a cost, with or without the assistance of the board, of no less than R637 million. We also know, as the hon. the Deputy Minister will know, that the total male labour force is expected to increase until some 162 000 men per annum are going to come on to the labour market, and 82,5% of that annual increase will be citizens of the homelands. Sir, the figure of the order of R465 million, which this department voted for Bantu Administration and Development last year, does not really seem to stand comparison with what would be required on the basis of the figures I have just quoted, nor does it seem other than puny when you compare it to the R3 238 million to be spent by Iscor, or the R915 million to be spent by Escom, or the R1 100 million to be spent by the Railways or the R1 050 million by Sasol.</p>

<p>Indeed, on the basis of these figures, Sir, no reasonable person can do other than doubt whether the Government is serious and genuine, even if misguided, in its intention to create the Transkei or the other homelands as viable entities, because I should not think that the discretion given to the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development are intended to cover figures of that order. As I have said before, the economic development of the Transkei, or its financial viability, which is the subject of this Bill, can only be seen as a consequence of but not as an alternative to the established growth complexes already present in our country.</p>

<p>That will occur in time, Sir, but until it does excessive expenditure&#x2014;and no figures are mentioned in this Bill&#x2014;within the Transkei will simply reduce the overall rate of growth for the citizens of the Transkei and for the citizens of the other nations and the other parts of South Africa. The hon. the Deputy Minister will know that even if it is done on a gigantic scale it is only likely to achieve circumstances where the majority of the people living in the Transkei can exist, not live, in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s term. They may exist now, as opposed to survive, but they will not live in the sense of what could be done by similar expenditure elsewhere in South Africa and on the basis that we have only one economy. Now this is not to say that the necessary educational facilities, together <span class="col_451-452" refersTo="page_0241"/>with such necessities as water, power and light, etc., should not be provided.</p>

<p>Sir, the policy of separate development and economic growth come to a head in this Bill. They stand in direct contrast, the one to the other. You can have the one or the other but you cannot have both, and sooner or later a decision will have to be reached as to which is the winner and which is the loser, and neither the hon. the Minister of Finance nor the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, even under the discretion given to them in this Bill, can change that one simple fact. Now, it is of great importance to the people who are going to live in the Transkei and who live there now to realize that. Indeed, it is important for all of us who live in our country, for it is they and we who are going to have to pay the price of a reduced standard of living and foot the bill if separate development should prove to take precedence over economic growth.</p>

<p>Sir, there are two other factors of the utmost significance in regard to the choice which is being presented to the people of the Transkei and which is encapsuled in this Bill. In addition to the choice between economic growth and separate development, they are going to have to regard the urban Blacks, the Black South Africans who live in our cities, in the context of the present stage of development of the South African economy as a whole and the implications thereof, since this runs counter in the most direct way possible to the general thrust of this Government&#x2019;s argument. It also impinges on this and again it is a fulcrum in so far as the Transkei is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister will be aware, you, Mr. Speaker, will be aware, and the hon. members will be aware that there have been some 10,5 million prosecutions during the tenure of this Government for offences against the pass laws or influx-control. Sir, that in itself seems to be conclusive evidence that life is preferable in the urban areas to that in the homelands. There is nothing very complicated about that either. It is not difficult to understand, as the hon. the Deputy Minister will know. It is simply that jobs and wages in the cities and in the established growth complexes such as the Witwatersrand, even though they may not be what they might be at this point in time, are a great deal better than the opportunities available elsewhere, for example in the Transkei, Lebowa or kwaZulu. That has been the case for a long time, as the Deputy Minister knows, and it is likely to continue, and increasingly so in the future. The other hon. Deputy Minister is to be commended because at least he has the courage to give public recognition to that fact. Indeed, how can it be otherwise, Sir? There is no way in which in excess of 80% of our people can be employed to the best of their ability on 13% of the land. To continue therefore to persist with the imposition of the policy of separate development as set out in this Bill for the Transkei or for the other homelands, upon the Black and Brown South Africans who are permanently settled in White South Africa, is both to ignore the realities as they now are and indeed to create new stresses and strains as between them and those who will comprise the Governments of the Transkei and the other homelands. But also, and perhaps even more important, it runs between the whole thrust of the policy of this Government, and what in practice happens in the market-place, where no such fine distinctions are known.</p>

<p>There is already irrefutable evidence of the shortage of skilled labour in our country, and the position is going to worsen and deteriorate as further growth occurs unless the artificial impediments&#x2014;and what is visualized in this Bill is one of them&#x2014; placed upon Black and Brown South Africans are removed. Even now. Mr. Speaker, if we have not actually arrived there, the point is fast being approached where there will be an absolute shortage of South African hands irrespective of colour, skilled or otherwise. In those circumstances, if we are going to enforce the measures incorporated in this Bill, we are going to ignore the opportunity of raising the standard of living of all South Africans. If we are going to take that opportunity, then all the barriers to productivity will have to come down.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, those who support the Government, those who sit on these benches, the people of the Transkei and of the other homelands can surely agree that the overriding prerequisite for growth and stability within our country is the provision of steadily and continuously rising standards of living for all of us to the greatest extent which the vast natural resources of this country, human and material, will allow. Surely no reasonable person can expect that the Black and Brown <span class="col_453-454" refersTo="page_0242"/>leaders willingly accept in a permanent way an agreement whereby they are given 13% of the land and a dismally inequitable share of the other material resources of this country. To be lasting, any contract has to be seen as equitable by both the parties concerned.</p>

<p>There is a saying about the Dutch which seems to me to be relevant to this Government and to this policy: &#x201C;They concede too little and they ask too much.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, rightly remarked that this legislation went directly to the heart of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development, and that this legislation was proof that the policy of separate development was succeeding. The hon. member intimated something else as well, and that is that the Progressive Party is dead against independence for the Bantu homelands. This we know, but the hon. member went further and said that this legislation would not eliminate discrimination, which was the stated policy of the Government. I want to say to the hon. member and his party that the very field in which one is able to discriminate the most against another person and another people, is the field of the franchise. If the policy of the National Party succeeds and these peoples become independent, then discrimination in the field of politics, of the franchise and of political self-determination will be no more. As against this, and seen in the light of the fact that the Transkei has asked for independence, his party does not want to recognize that desire of a people to become independent. They say to these people: &#x201C;You may not become independent. That is not implicit in our policy. Even if you want to become independent we shall not allow you to do so&#x201D;. Sir, where is a more blatant example of discrimination to be found? And then, Sir, we know that the matter of the qualified franchise is implicit in their policy, in terms of which 83% of the people will be able to elect 10% of the seats in this House. Is that not discrimination? And then the hon. member says that this legislation is not going to eliminate discrimination.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further and said that as a result of this legislation the homelands would not be able, <i>inter alia,</i> to be economically self-sufficient. I want to put it to that hon. member that between 1970 and 1973 the gross national product of the homelands in South Africa grew more rapidly as a whole than the gross domestic product of the Republic of South Africa. In addition I want to point out that between 1960 and 1970 the population of the Bantu homelands in South Africa increased by an average of 6,8%. Mention any state in the world to me in which the population has shown such a growth rate. As against this the Bantu population in the White part of South Africa has increased by only 1,6% per year. Is this not proof that separate development is succeeding? I want to come to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg North &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am sorry; I do not want to offend the hon. member. He may possibly be &#x201C;out&#x201D; if I say &#x201C;north&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;south&#x201D;. In view of the fact that the main speaker on the opposite side is still making sure whether he may remain here, I do not want to offend the hon. member. The hon. member said he supported this Bill, therefore clauses 1 and 7 as well. Then, however, he said he was opposed to sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) of the new section 52(l)(c) inserted by clause 1, in terms of which the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the Minister of Finance will decide about certain amounts. The hon. member, however, was not listening very well when the hon. the Deputy Minister was delivering his Second Reading speech. There are two things which the hon. member must bear in mind in connection with this matter. The first is that a basis must be found for dividing these indirect taxes and companies tax and for determining what amount is to go to the homelands. Once this basis or formula has been found, a simple arithmetical calculation is all that is required for determining how much is to go to each homeland. The important thing is that the hon. the Deputy Minister told the hon. member that this basis of calculation had been put to the various homeland governments and had been accepted by all of them. In other words, agreement has been reached as regards a basis. Let me put it to the hon. member this way: Arrangements exist between the Republic of South Africa and the former Protectorates in respect of customs and excise. A certain portion of the money collected in such taxes are paid to them on the basis of an agreed formula. If the Minister were to decide to change the customs <span class="col_455-456" refersTo="page_0243"/>and excise duties, he would not approach all those Governments first for permission to increase them. He would increase them, and on the basis of that agreement the money would still go to those Governments. And so it will be in this instance as well. In the case of the independent states this was effected on the basis of a written agreement and in the case of these people it is being effected by means of an agreement. When they become independent, these measures which are now being taken may form the basis of a customs union. That is why I say that this Bill is proof of the policy of separate development succeeding. It is taking us in the direction where, and it is laying a foundation on the basis of which we shall subsequently be able to enter into agreements with independent states. That is why this measure is a triumph for the National Party. In fact every piece of Bantu legislation which is introduced here, provides proof of the National Party succeeding in its policy. Therefore the argument raised by the hon. member does not hold water. There are examples of similar arrangements with independent states and he should simply take a look at them.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said there was a difference between the position of the Transkeian Government and those of the other homelands, in the sense that the Transkeian Constitution laid down that taxes could be levied by the Transkeian Government whereas this was not laid down in the Constitutions of the other Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>If I do not understand the hon. member correctly, it does not matter. Perhaps I have not understood him correctly. But he did say there was a difference between the Transkeian Government and its citizens and those of the other homelands because of the provisions of the various Constitutions. I want to tell the hon. member now that the Bantu Taxation Act of 1969, which is a later Act than the Transkei Constitution Act of 1963, placed that matter on the same basis. That Act provided for the abolition of income tax and for the payment by those people of Bantu tax only, which tax incorporates a component of income tax. This tax is the same for the Transkei and all the other homelands. If the hon. member will check the provisions of that Act, he will not have to wait for an answer from the hon. the Deputy Minister, but will be able to set his uneasy mind at rest immediately. I assume that in these circumstances he does not want additional factors which will make his mind even more uneasy.</p>

<p>Now, if we come back to this Bill, we find a number of reasons for the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s deciding to come to Parliament with these amendments. I refer to clauses 1 and 7, in particular, the clauses to which hon. members of both parties on the opposite side object most. There are differences in respect of the various homelands, the revenue granted to them and the manner in which this is to be done. One cannot compare the different conditions, because, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, a basis was laid down several years ago for the homelands which obtained their legislative assemblies first and took over control of certain matters. At a later stage a basis was laid down for those homelands which took over those powers later, i.e. the previous year&#x2019;s appropriation by this Parliament. This means that the statutory amount for some homelands is smaller, relatively speaking, than for those which took over responsibility later. Because there is no growth component built into the statutory amount, this legislation now puts that position to rights, in the first instance because the same year is chosen as a basis for everyone, viz. 1973-&#x2019;74. In the future, however, further responsibilities in respect of certain matters are going to be transferred to homeland governments, and provision is <span class="col_457-458" refersTo="page_0244"/>made for that in the previous year&#x2019;s appropriation by this Parliament will form the basis. Since a growth component is now being built into this statutory amount, the homelands will be placed on a more comparable basis.</p>

<p>The other very important advantage of these amendments is that the self-sufficiency of the homelands&#x2014;if one wants to call it that&#x2014;will come to the fore much more clearly than is the case at present. I want to mention an example. Proff. Städler and Van der Merwe of the University of Pretoria compiled a paper entitled (translation) <i>The share of the Bantu in the revenue of authorities in the Republic.</i> They determined what the Bantu&#x2019;s contribution more or less was in the form of indirect taxation&#x2014;customs and excises, companies tax, etc. If one uses this as a basis, one arrives at certain conclusions. If one takes the Transkei&#x2019;s own revenue under the present Act and one expresses it as a percentage of its budget, its own revenue represents approximately 23% of its budget. In other words, on these grounds one could say that the Transkei was only 23% self-sufficient. If one takes the estimates of Proff. Städler and Van der Merwe as a basis, then estimates the Transkei&#x2019;s own revenue and expresses it as a percentage of its budget, one finds that its own revenue represents 78% of its budget. Therefore a far more favourable picture will be created for the homelands by applying the formula contained in the Bill instead of the existing formulae for which the Act makes provision. It will have the advantage for them that it will create confidence in an investor who wants to invest there. It will encourage investors to invest in the homelands. A further advantage will be that, because the actual extent of the homelands&#x2019; resources will be shown, their credit standing will be improved. If a homeland government wants to negotiate a loan somewhere in the world, with a person controlling a large fund, its credit standing will be far higher than it is at the moment. This can redound to the advantage of the homeland governments and the development of the homelands only if the legislation is such as to enable them to make use of the advantages which are due to them.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the objections reaised by that hon. member are not real objections. They are old arguments we have been hearing for years in this Parliament. There are examples of similar arrangements having been made with independent States and of interstate negotiations on an equal basis. I cannot see what that hon. member&#x2019;s objection is. I believe the only reason why that hon. member objects to this legislation, is that he does not want to admit that the National Party is achieving success and that the homeland governments are succeeding in their own right and are making progress and that development is taking place in the homelands. He does not want to admit that this legislation is a measure taken of necessity in order to give recognition to the growth and to the progress taking place in the homelands.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying to that hon. member and to hon. members of the Progressive Party that the homelands, as far as I am concerned, are no longer homelands, but already the fatherlands of the Bantu peoples. Since the homeland governments desire these measures, since they agree with them and since it is necessary that the fatherlands of those peoples be developed, I am of the opinion that the time is ripe in South Africa for the Opposition parties to stop trying to retard that development, but to acknowledge it and to participate wholeheartedly with us in assisting those peoples who are in South Africa to develop their fatherlands.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to take part in the discussions to a limited extent and, in the first instance, I want to confirm what was said by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, viz. that we have no objections to the principle of this Bill. Consequently we do not intend opposing any of the clauses of this Bill. I want to give my own support to the various clauses in this Bill as well. I want to confine myself strictly to certain clauses, in fact, to the two main points which have a bearing on clauses 1 and 7 as well as to clauses 2, 3 and 4. I am of the opinion that there is no special contribution which I can make in respect of the other points and which will in any way throw new light on the matter, over and above that which has already been mentioned by other hon. speakers.</p>

<p>As far as clauses 1 and 7 are concerned, I must say at once that I assumed that we would be restricted to the contents of the Bill and that it would not have been possible for us to cover a wider field, i.e. to deal with discrimination and so on. Consequently I want to confine myself to the Bill and not go into the other details of a <span class="col_459-460" refersTo="page_0245"/>wider nature, even though the temptation is great. I want to make it quite clear that this side of the House and I myself have stated very clearly that apart from any ideologic policy which has to be followed, we believe in the economic development of the homelands, because they are in fact underdeveloped parts of our country. For that reason a special responsibility and task rests on Parliament and this Government to do everything in their power to make contributions in those areas and to give them assistance. Seen from that point of view, I can confine myself only to what is provided for in the Bill, and that is to make additional sources of revenue available to the homeland governments. We welcome this. We are in favour of all possible attempts being made for the economic development of the homelands. I want to add that our objection in the past was that not nearly enough was being done in this connection. Whether the formulas embodied in this Bill do make adequate provision for the development of these areas&#x2014;especially when their under-development is taken into account&#x2014;is a question which we can debate later. When one considers what expectations were created by the Tomlinson Commission and when one considers the disappointment which followed because the financial expenditure on the development of the homelands was not what had been expected, hon. members will be able to understand that we certainly welcome special attention being given to the economic development of the homelands. Therefore I am in favour of the basic provisions of clauses 1 and 7. In particular I welcome the fact that the tax yield derived from companies tax as well as indirect taxation is to be made available to the homeland governments. For the information of the hon. member for Lichtenburg I want to say that I am aware of the fact that the homeland governments have often made representations in this regard. Therefore I am grateful that these representations are being complied with in this Bill. I also appreciate the fact, as is evident from the Bill, that the salaries and allowances paid to officials who are seconded to the homeland governments by the Government of South Africa, will not apply as a liability in respect of these grants to the homeland government. I feel that this is a special contribution which we as Whites and this Government can make in this way to assist the homelands with their development. I also appreciate the flexibility of the provisos to clauses 1 and 7, i.e., that, in spite of the determination on the basis of the grants, the Minister may increase the amount in consequence of economic and other circumstances. It is my honest conviction&#x2014;and in this I should like to associate myself in broad outline with the hon. member for Johannesburg North&#x2014; that not nearly enough is being done in respect of the economic development of the homelands. Therefore I believe that providing this flexibility, at least, is essential. It is possible that unforeseen circumstances of major unemployment may arise in the homelands. It may so happen that there may be a considerable increase in the population, which will simply mean that the amounts made available to the homelands in terms of the clause, will just not be sufficient for maintaining even present standards of living. Therefore I welcome the flexibility of the provisos embodied in these clauses.</p>

<p>This brings me back to the point which was mentioned here by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, and that is the question of consultation with the particular Ministers of Finance of the homeland governments. In this regard my problem is that we so often make principles of things which are not principles. I think the hon. member for Schweizer Reneke in point of fact made a principle of a matter which ought not to be a principle. Surely there can be no objection to proper consultation.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Surely there can be no objection either to writing into the legislation that there will be consultation, because by doing so we are simply intimating that we wish to lay down in the legislation that we attack prime importance to consultation with these people. It does not bind the Government or Parliament. The final decision will be taken by this Parliament on the basis of Cabinet resolutions submitted to this Parliament. It seems to me there can truly be no objection to embodying in the Bill channels for consultation with the particular Ministers of the homelands. We can lose nothing by that, and I want to make a friendly appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider this both for the sake of its practical and its symbolic value. The hon. member for Schweizer Reneke motivated his statement by <span class="col_461-462" refersTo="page_0246"/>saying that this Parliament was the sovereign legislative Parliament of the Whites &#x2014;it was something more or less in this veid&#x2014;and that other people could not be given a joint say here. I think, in all humility, that that point is not relevant. A joint say in this Parliament is not what is being asked for. Proper consultation with the Ministers of the Bantu homelands is all that is being asked for. I do want to remind the hon. member for Schweizer Reneke that we learnt here from the Prime Minister himself last week that this was the very procedure that he was going to follow with representatives of the Coloured Persons Representative Council&#x2014;in other words, that he was going to make provision by means of a joint Cabinet Committee for consultation with representatives of the Executive Committee of the CRC concerning the amounts which would be made available to the Coloured Persons Representative Council for covering its expenditures. On the basis of that model, which has already been created&#x2014;the principle has already been conceded&#x2014;I just want to say that I can see no fundamental objection to our doing the same thing as far as the Bantu homelands are concerned. Therefore I want to associate myself wholeheartedly with the idea expressed here by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South. So much for clauses 1 and 7.</p>

<p>As far as clauses 2, 3 and 4 are concerned, I just want to say that I also welcome this new arrangement, this development, very warmly. I am sure I need not convince the hon. the Deputy Minister of the fact that our present labour bureau system has a multiplicity of shortcomings which hampers the proper channeling of labour, really endangers the proper utilization of labour, and imposes administrative duties and responsibilities on the employer as well as the Bantu employee which can readily be eliminated.</p>

<p>In this connection it is stated very clearly that the principle of these Bantu Affairs Administration Boards taking over the functions of the district labour bureaux, has already, so it seems to me, been accepted as administrative policy. I can but appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister to have this process expedited to the largest possible extent. I want to recommend this to the hon. the Deputy Minister and ask him whether he does not think the time has arrived for us to do away with the labour bureaux. It merely complicates matters and I can see no reason why we cannot have a labour bureau system, as far as the so-called White area is concerned, consisting of the central labour bureau or a regional labour bureau, as may be required, and in addition only district labour bureaux instead of the local labour bureaux. The hard facts are, as the hon. the Deputy Minister knows, that in addition to the central labour bureau in Pretoria, there is one regional labour bureau, 18 district labour bureaux and 37 local labour bureaux on the Witwatersrand at the moment. This is an unnecessary proliferation and in all honesty I canot see the necessity, in whatever way these labour bureaux might fit into a pattern, for continuing a system which has proved that it does not operate effectively in practice, that it is in fact unnecessary and that it causes a great deal of trouble for both the employer and the Bantu employee. I hope that this will also be the forerunner of the transformation of the labour bureau system in the Bantu homelands. I should like to mention a few cases in this connection because it links up with this.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, there are, in addition to the labour bureau for the area, 12 district labour bureaux and 63 tribal labour bureaux. This is according to my information. In Lebowa there are, in addition to the labour bureau for the area 12 district labour bureaux and 120 tribal labour bureaux. I feel that serious consideration should be given to doing away with the tribal labour bureaux and that we should rather thing in other terms in this regard. I am putting this forward as the development actually envisaged in this measure, i.e. the abolition, the possible abolition, of local labour bureaux, which already exist in the legislation, and the transfer of their functions to district labour bureaux and now for the transfer of the functions of district labour bureaux to the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards with a transfer of funds when a Bantu Affairs Administration Board administers such a district bureau, is something which I regard as being an extremely healthy development. I only hope we shall be able to continue with this process so that, by so doing, all unnecessary bother in connection with the recruitment and employment of Bantu labour may be eliminated further.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South said a short time ago: &#x201C;We now want to see deeds and not just words.&#x201D; I have often wondered how much further we would have been with the development of the homelands and how much more viable they would have been today, if that attitude had been displayed by the Opposition then; if they had, from the outset, made their contribution as well&#x2014;if they, too, had performed the resounding deed&#x2014; towards making the homelands viable. Mr. Speaker, in the context of this Bill this is important, because the more progress there is in the homelands, the more sources there are generating tax, and therefore I am not going to reproach the Opposition this afternoon, either, for the fact that last year, when the Zebediela legislation was before the House, the hon. members who have just resumed their seats&#x2014;the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South and the hon. member for Edenvale&#x2014;were not in favour of it and were conspicuous by their absence when they had an opportunity to perform a resounding deed, a deed which would resound like thunder in the interests of the homelands.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Johannesburg North said a short time ago, &#x201C;This is a Bill of great importance&#x201D;, and the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke said that we have herewith passed a new milestone. This is in fact so. This Bill is a further step in the volutionary process of the development of the Bantu peoples to full self-government and eventual independence. Let me tell the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South in passing that I, too, listened very carefully to the hon. the Deputy Minister who submitted this Bill, and nowhere did I hear him say that this Bill offers the Bantu homelands economic independence. All these years we have been stating that it is our policy that we shall give them political independence, but that there will always be inter-dependence in the economic sphere. Full self-government means that one generates one&#x2019;s own income as far as possible, and the hon. the Deputy Minister furnished us with a long table of various sources of income there would be for the Bantu nations in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the benefits of this measure are obvious. From the point of view of the Bantu peoples, these people now know where they stand and they can carry on their affairs in a planned fashion and not merely in an arbitrary fashion. In addition, this Bill now settles the argument that has been carried on for a very long time, as well as answering the reproach often levelled by the Bantu, that they contribute more to the Treasury than they receive in return. This Bill will now allow them to know where the money comes from and how much they can expect, and will enable them to work according to a plan. It will also bring about greater responsibility in the expenditure of the income, not that I thereby want to suggest in any way that things had been done in an irresponsible fashion in the past, but it is true that when I was still receiving money from my father, I spent it far less judiciously than when I earned it myself.</p>

<p>My father often reproached me for not knowing where the money came from, and as soon as I discovered where money comes from, there was far more responsibility as far as its expenditure was concerned. Separate development, Mr. Speaker, is self-development. The hon. member for Lichtenburg spoke about the self-sufficiency of the Bantu peoples which this Bill will bring about. We are teaching the people to develop their own sources of revenue. Initially this Government, the Treasury, will still impose the taxes, but it is possible to foresee that eventually they themselves will carry that responsibility, and there is probably no greater contribution that one could make to developing peoples. Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, goes the Chinese proverb, but teach him to fish and he eats every day. Then, too, the opportunity is now being created for the Bantu <span class="col_465-466" refersTo="page_0248"/>peoples to develop their own sources of revenue.</p>

<p>To mention but one, company taxation now accrues to them for the first time. When the Bantu discover that they can have more than 40% of the profits of companies for their own treasury, one can foresee that they will make a bigger contribution in order to attract more industries to their homelands and that these people will get their priorities right, namely to establish an infrastructure in those homelands in order that there may be greater prosperity. Sir, if this Bill serves only this single purpose, then we have made an enormous contribution towards a safer and a more stable future for us all.</p>

<p>In the past few years a cry has been raised here, a cry which has developed greater momentum over the years. It will yet become the cry of the seventies and the eighties: Decentralization. Now, we believe that our policy will only succeed if the homelands become viable, if smoke issues from their factory chimneys, if there are industries and companies signifying new sources of revenue as well as provision of employment and prosperity. The Opposition talks about the sharing of power. That is the cry they have raised in recent years. Sir, you will not allow me to talk about the merits of the cry of sharing of power. They have often been debated in this House before.</p>

<p>I believe that they are able to serve the interests of South Africa better and that they will in fact serve the interests of the Bantu peoples better when they want to raise this other cry, namely sharing of prosperity; if they continually come and plead in this House that we are a rich country in which all the peoples of this country share in the greater prosperity that exists; when they want to allow the Bantu share in this greater prosperity in an orderly way; when they even want to reproach this Government for not doing enough for the development of the homelands; and that we are not doing enough to develop the human potential of the Bantu to share in that greater prosperity. Sir, what this Bill tells us, is that we in this country have established, developed and refined a fiscal policy over generations and are now offering the Bantu peoples the benefits of this knowledge which we have developed over generations. A people can do no better by another people than by allowing it to enjoy the fruits of those things we have achieved for ourselves over generations. That is why we welcome this Bill and are grateful for this milestone in our history, why the Opposition also welcomes this Bill and is also, in the words of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, going to perform a deed to make those homelands viable. If we do not succeed in that, virtually insoluble social and political problems will develop for subsequent generations.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened to the arguments on both sides with great attention and I want to extend my very sincere thanks to the hon. members on my side who participated for their support. It gives me great pleasure to be able to mention that this is the first time since I have dealt with legislation in this House that I am enjoying the support of the official Opposition. I do not know whether it is the shadow of détente which has filtered through to them. Judging by their numbers here this word is not applicable to them, but to their attitude towards us. I want to thank them very much indeed for being positively attuned to this legislation, for supporting the Second Reading of the Bill. I am not quite sure what the intention of the hon. member for Johannesburg North was. He did not say whether or not he supports the legislation. He did, to a certain extent, indicate that they had no objection to the legislation, but then gave us to understand that we are, in certain respects, busy wasting our time. Nevertheless, I take it that the Progressive Party will not vote against the legislation.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to the various problems raised by hon. members.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In the first instance the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South complained very enthusiastically that they received the explanatory memorandum on their desks only today. I was surprised to hear that. I checked with the staff and they told me that this memorandum was on the desks of hon. members since Tuesday last week.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from><span class="col_467-468" refersTo="page_0249"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The only reason why the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South did not see it earlier, could be that he was too busy with the internal struggle within his own party.</p>

<p>*I regret that it happened, because, what I take exception to, is that an hon. member has cast a reflection on the staff of this House. It is, indeed, the case that this memorandum has been on hon. members desks since last Thursday. I want to advise the hon. member to be very careful with his remarks, because he did not cast a reflection on me or on my department, but on the staff of this House. Since it is now clear that he did not look at what was placed on his desk&#x2014;he was busy with other matters &#x2014;I want to advise him to apologize to the staff of the House. [Interjections.] The hon. member is indicating that he will do so and I thank him for it. I think in his own interest, it is necessary for him to do so in order to display a spirit of goodwill, not only across the floor, but also to the people who have to work hard.</p>

<p>The hon. member is having problems with clause 1 to 7 because they are not being made applicable to the Constitution Act for the Native Nations in South West Africa. I want to tell him immediately that South West Africa has a completely different dispensation. There are special laws in connection with financial arrangements as far as South West is concerned and, therefore, we cannot treat it in the same way as the constitution acts relating to the Bantu peoples in the Republic. I do not want to elaborate on that now, because the financial arrangements which apply are of a complex nature.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the difference between the Constitution Act of the Transkei and that of the other Bantu homelands as far as Bantu taxes are concerned. Actually, that is not relevant here. However, the hon. member for Lichtenburg has already replied to the hon. member&#x2019;s argument and I am, therefore, not going into it any further.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of consultation. In clause 1 there are several references to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development acting &#x201C;in consultation with&#x201D; the Minister of Finance. Now the argument is that we should also involve the Ministers of Finance of the various homelands in this. The hon. member for Edenvale even went so far as to indicate that it would be a very positive step, particularly in view of what the hon. the Prime Minister said here last week, namely that we should involve these people in the discussion of matters affecting them to an ever-increasing extent. I want to point out to hon. members that this question of consultation between the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the Minister of Finance is really concerned with the question of the finances of the Republic of South Africa, specifically the question of whether amounts are available or not. Therefore, it is an exclusively domestic matter which affects only the Republic&#x2019;s finances as such. The drawing up of a homeland&#x2019;s budget is, of course, done by the relevant government itself. Then, when it comes to the attention of this Minister, he has to make arrangements, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, for making that money available. Therefore, it is very clear that to bring a Minister or Councillor of a homeland into a discussion where you are talking about the finances of the Republic, is not entirely relevant. If one were, for example, to incorporate something like this in legislation, it might be a good display for we would then be able to say that we are not only consulting, but also laying it down by way of legislation. However, I can give hon. members the assurance that apart from the talks in which the hon. the Prime Minister is involved at the highest level, talks take place almost continuously between officials, Deputy Ministers, the Minister and these people. Should one want to bring in such an internal financial arrangement of the Government of the Republic here, which does not really concern homeland governments, I do not think it could serve any purpose. One could perhaps accept the principle that we should lay it down somewhere in an Act. However, that is how I understood the hon. member for Edenvale&#x2019;s argument, and I do not think it would have any value. Nor do I think it could serve any purpose to write it into this Bill. The question of consultation is sometimes wristed from its context and I think it has happened again this afternoon. Consultation is being brought into matters where it really does not apply. I do not think we should go so far in our enthusiasm to consult as to lose perspective as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>There is the other aspect which was raised by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South, namely the question of laws which will be applicable to the High <span class="col_469-470" refersTo="page_0250"/>Court, in the Transkei as well as in the other homelands. Last year we mentioned one to him&#x2014;I think it was the Act in respect of attorneys. I just want to tell the hon. member that no laws of this nature have as yet been made applicable. As this happens, he will simply have to talk to the department and the legal people. I have not acquainted myself with the laws which will be made applicable. I want to leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>I have now disposed of the points raised by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South. I should now like to deal briefly with the personal arguments of other members.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North came with a general argument which does not really apply directly. He put it in this way that we are dealing here with the financial arrangements of the homelands and wanted to bring to our attention that the whole set-up in South Africa, according to this point of view and the policy of his party, is that 150 000 labourers are entering the labour market annually, 80% of them from the homelands, and that most of them will work in the White areas in the Republic and that he does not, in this respect, see a future for our policy. That was the argument of that member. He said: &#x201C;You can have economic development or separate development.&#x201D; He is saying it is a choice between the two. With all due respect I want to say that we in the National Party still believe in miracles because we are realistic. We are going to do both. They are people with a limited vision, with a limited premise as far as these matters are concerned, but I can give him the assurance that the sooner we have multinational development, the sooner we shall have economic development in these homelands. We are in fact proving this. We are increasing the pace. I do not think it is relevant to this legislation to go into details on all the steps that have been taken by this Government. Nor is it necessary to go into the question of real development in the homelands in detail. The hon. member for Lichtenburg mentioned that there has in fact been a vast improvement as far as the economic activities in the homelands are concerned. The hon. member for Johannesburg North also referred to the 13% land. He stated repeatedly that if we give only 13% of the land to these people, in spite of legislation such as this where we indicate what the contribution of the homelands themselves is, and what comes from the Revenue Fund of the Republic as such, we will not be able to make any progress. I think it is a great pity that this sort of argument is being dragged in here. It gives a completely erroneous and distorted picture, and has nothing to do with the potential of the particular area. This has nothing to do with reality as such. When we talk about percentages of land, we have to institute a very thorough investigation into, firstly, the agricultural potential, and, secondly, the potential for mineral development, and we have to relate it to what we in the Republic have a shortage of, namely water. We should also investigate the homelands&#x2019; water potential and what follows from this. I must say it is a pity that the hon. member brought up the question of land here, and in that way wanted to suggest that these homelands do not have development potential. I want to tell him that in kwaZulu there is an additional development potential of more than 50 000 ha in the sugar industry alone. This justifies approximately three sugar mills. We are engaged in investigations, and I hope we shall, with the aid of the sugar industry, be able to give tremendous stimulus to economic development in that aspect alone, and&#x2014;since reference is made in this legislation to own sources of income&#x2014;that we shall be able to make tremendous progress. The question of the Transkei was mentioned here as an example. We are engaged in agricultural development there. Because the Transkei is, in the first place, an agricultural country, I hope agricultural development is going to constitute tremendous advantages in the years that lie ahead. I do not want to elaborate on this, but I do just want to tell the hon. member that the Xhosa Development Corporation has been involved in this. We visited those areas with members opposite, and I think they will agree that great progress has been made and that the exceptional agricultural potential of a country such as the Transkei could and is going to make a great contribution in future. This is all I want to say about this matter. I do not think this is the occasion to go into that aspect in detail. The hon. member for Edenvale said that in principle he had no objection to this measure. He said that he believed in the economic development of the homelands and his objection was simply that he did not think that enough was being done. He also welcomed the greater flexibility as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_471-472" refersTo="page_0251"/>In conclusion I want to thank hon. members for their contributions, which were definitely positive. Should there be any particular problems in respect of the various clauses, we could perhaps spend some time on them during the Committee Stage. However, I just want to warn hon. members that the opportunity will not present itself again to drag also the general development of the homelands into the discussion of this measure. To drag in a general discussion of the homelands during the discussion of such a measure, is perhaps not altogether correct, but on the other hand it gives hon. members the opportunity to unburden themselves of matters they wanted to discuss last week and to bring them up here. I think I have replied fully to the misgivings of hon. members and that in my reply I have not omitted anything which was seriously intended.</p>

<heading>ABORTION AND STERILIZATION BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As hon. members know, this matter has already been discussed in broad outline on the occasion of a private motion in this House. In accordance with the proposal made by my predecessor at the time, the Government was already investigating the whole question; in fact, mention was made of recommendations concerning this Bill&#x2014; a consequence of the Van Wyk Report on the Mental Disorders Act&#x2014;as well as of the Government&#x2019;s standpoints in regard to abortion and sterilization.</p>

<p>As an aid to memory I want to restate briefly the said standpoints:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) That ample opportunity be given for representations and discussion before placing legislation on the Statute Book;</li>

<li>(b) Secondly, that the present ambiguous position in this regard be rectified by means of legislation, in order&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) to protect the medical practitioner who is forced to do this; and</li>

<li>(ii) to ensure that the possibilities and procedures are clearly defined.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(c) The third standpoint was that the responsibility for the drafting and administration of the proposed legislation should be entrusted to the Department of Health.</li>

<li>(d) The fourth standpoint was that legislation in regard to sterilization should be incorporated with this.</li>

<li>(e) In addition, it was made quite clear that the Government was completely opposed to general abortion, or &#x201C;abortion on demand&#x201D;, as it is sometimes known.</li>

<li>(f) The Government also made known that it was sympathetically disposed towards the small number of cases where therapeutical abortion might be necessary, and a few examples were mentioned, such as:

<ol>

<li>(i) in the first place, where a choice has to be made between the life of the mother and that of the unborn child;</li>

<li>(ii) secondly, where continued pregnancy would constitute a serious threat to the mother&#x2019;s physical and/or mental health;</li>

<li>(iii) thirdly, in cases of rape; and</li>

<li>(iv) fourthly, in cases where serious abnormalities or handicaps may result, and also in regard to pregnancy in the case of imbeciles, and so forth.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(g) The Government&#x2019;s seventh standpoint was in regard to the procedure to be followed in cases where abortion proves to be necessary: Who is to be consulted and who is to grant consent, the procedure that is to be followed, the persons who may be empowered to authorize abortion, <span class="col_473-474" refersTo="page_0252"/>and, finally, where such operation may take place.</li>

<li>(h) The Government&#x2019;s final standpoint was that the following aspects, <i>inter alia,</i> should be clearly reflected in the legislation&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) respect for the unborn child (the foetus);</li>

<li>(ii) recognition of the Christian views and moral norms which characterize our country;</li>

<li>(iii) the fact that this does not imply condonation of illegitimate births; and, finally,</li>

<li>(iv) the fact that drastic action will be taken against abortions performed outside the legal provisions.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>Consequent upon the decisions taken by the Government at the time, a Bill was drafted and introduced. The Bill [A.B. 15&#x2014; &#x2019;73] was referred to a Select Committee which was to examine the measure and to report on it. Since the Select Committee was unable to conclude its activities in time, the Select Committee was converted into a Commission of Inquiry, whose report has already deen tabled.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to provide legally for such contingencies as may lead to or arise from pregnancies, the continuation and/or result of which could be gravely deleterious to the health of the mother, and for such instances in which it can be determined on medical grounds that the result of such pregnancy would be an irreparably seriously handicapped child. Circumscriptive legislation will also contribute favourably in alleviating the medical practitioner&#x2019;s hitherto undeniably onerous responsibility and decision in this regard, whilst endeavouring also to provide satisfactory safeguards against possible abuses.</p>

<p>Subsection (2)(a) of clause 3 prohibits the physician who issues a certificate from participating in the relevant abortion. Similarly, physicians employed by or attached to the same partnership or employer as the certifying physician are also prohibited from participating in the abortion for which a certificate has been issued.</p>

<p>I wish, however, to emphasize that this proviso will not be applicable to physicians employed by the State (as provided in subsection (2)(b)), thus ensuring that the costs involved in providing often necessary medical services for the needy do not become exorbitantly high. Should the proviso to subsection (2)(a) be applicable, the State would be forced to refer such patients to private physicians, thereby affecting the cost structure and thereby also having to experience difficulties in sparsely populated rural areas as regards the availability of physicians, since such persons often enjoy appointments in the local hospital and are thus precluded from possible operation-participation.</p>

<p>Clause 3 of the Bill provides that only a medical practitioner may procure an abortion, and then only on the grounds that the mother&#x2019;s life or physical or mental health may be seriously endangered should the pregnancy continue, or that the child to be born will be irreparably seriously handicapped, or finally that conception was the consequence of unlawful carnal intercourse, involving rape or incest or intercourse with an idiot or mentally deficient person in contravention of the immorality Act of 1957.</p>

<p>Such abortion may only be procured upon support of written certificates obtained from two other medical practitioners of separate practices, concurring with any one of the views expressed above. The medical practitioners certifying as above may not in any way participate in or assist with the ensuing operation. It is required that at least one of the two above mentioned medical practitioners be in practice for at least four years subsequent to his registration in terms of the Medical Act, and that if the mental health of the mother is considered as the reason for the abortion, the other must be a State psychiatrist. In cases of rape or incest, it is also required that the district surgeon concerned be one of the two certifying medical practitioners.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, quite apparent that the decision as to whether an abortion need be procured shall be based on medical grounds and that the control over abortions as such will rest solely with the medical profession.</p>

<p>*The provisions of clause 4 deal with the circumstances under which a sterilization may be performed on a person who is incapable <span class="col_475-476" refersTo="page_0253"/>of consenting or incompetent to consent to an operation on himself. The following requirements are set:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) that two medical practitioners must certify that such sterilization is necessary;</li>

<li>(b) that the person who may in law consent to an operation on such a person does in fact consent to it; and</li>

<li>(c) that the Minister, too, grants written authority.</li>

</ol>

<p>In addition, it is made clear that these provisions are not applicable <i>a contrario</i> to any person competent to consent to an operation on himself. Those legal aspects are not applicable here.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 5, such abortion may be procured and such sterilization may be performed only at a state-controlled institution. In addition to this, the Minister may designate another institution for such operation and may set such conditions and requirements as he may consider necessary or expedient, and he may also withdraw any such designation at any time.</p>

<p>The provisions of clause 6 deal with the authorization required before an operation may be performed in order to procure an abortion or to perform a sterilization. Briefly, the requirements are: That authorization be granted, in the case of a state-controlled institution, by the medical practitioner in charge or by a medical practitioner designated by him, and, in the case of a designated institution, by a medical practitioner designated for the purpose by the person managing such institution. The application for authorization of abortion in cases of purely medical reasons must be accompanied by a certificate issued by two medical practitioners as mentioned in clause 3, and in cases where unlawful carnal intercourse is involved, the abovementioned certificate must be accompanied by an additional certificate issued by a magistrate to the effect that, on a balance of probability, the pregnancy is in fact the result of rape or incest.</p>

<p>In the case of rape or incest, one of the two medical practitioners by whom the certificate is issued must be the district surgeon.</p>

<p>The form is also prescribed in which application is to be made in regard to cases of sterilization in respect of which the abovementioned provisions of clause 4 must necessarily be applied.</p>

<p>The medical practitioner who certifies in terms of the provisions of clause 3 that an abortion has to be procured or a sterilization has to be performed, is not precluded from granting the required authorization for the operation in the institution concerned, since he is merely fulfilling an administrative process in order to ensure that the legal requirements have been complied with.</p>

<p>Clause 7 of the Bill deals with the reporting to the Secretary for Health, by the medical practitioner who grants authority in terms of clause 6(1), of full particulars in regard to the patient concerned, the place and date of operation and, in the case of an abortion, the reason therefore, as well as full particulars in regard to the certifying medical practitioner concerned and, if applicable, of the magistrate concerned, as well as the name of the medical practitioner who has procured the abortion or performed the sterilization. If the consent of any person other than the patient was required for performing the operation, the name of such person and the capacity in which he granted his consent are also required.</p>

<p>The Secretary for Health is authorised by this clause to call upon the medical practitioner required to make the report or the medical practitioner who is to perform the operation to furnish such additional information as he may require.</p>

<p>The person in charge of an institution where an abortion is procured or the residue of a pregnancy is removed, must keep a record of the particulars prescribed by regulation in respect of any such operation, and must, when called upon to do so, make such record available to the Secretary for Health or to a person authorized thereto by him in writing, and must transmit to the Secretary at a time prescribed the information prescribed by regulation.</p>

<p>Clause 8 authorizes the Minister to make regulations concerning the form of the above mentioned application or authority, the custody and disposal of the required certificates, the particulars of the record to be kept, and generally as to any matter in respect of which he deems it necessary or expedient to make regulations in connection with the Act.</p>

<p><span class="col_477-478" refersTo="page_0254"/>Clause 9 makes provision for persons registered as medical practitioners and as nurses who may have conscientious objections to participating in such operations to withdraw from such operations, and clause 10 deals with the penalties which may be imposed if the requirements as set out above are not complied with.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the only substantial difference between this Bill and the one which was originally introduced is that the provision in regard to so-called emergencies has now been omitted. Great trouble was taken to determine whether circumstances may in fact arise under which emergency action would be justified, but according to medical evidence such conditions are completely unknown to medical science.</p>

<p>Another aspect which has been changed is the provision for abortion on the grounds of mental health conditions. In the first place, the aspect of mental health has been separated from that of physical health, and in the second place the commission has made it clear in this Bill that the danger to mental health must be one of permanent damage and that if a woman were to become mentally ill under such circumstances, such illness would be permanent. This definition ensures that not more than two mental health conditions will be regarded as grounds for abortion. In this regard I may mention schizophrenia and endogenous depression. What is more, since it is provided that a certificate on mental health conditions may only be issued by a State psychiatrist, the department will be able to ensure administratively that mental health is not abused as a reason for abortion.</p>

<p>Since I take it that hon. members already agree that for obvious religious, ethical and moral reasons abortion on demand must not be allowed, and that provision for abortion must only be made in highly exceptional circumstances, I would like to dwell on the measures which will ensure this. In respect of mental health conditions it may be mentioned that the requirement that in such cases a state psychiatrist must be one of the certifying medical practitioners means that any possible abuse in this regard will be kept in check. By the way, hon. members may find it interesting to know that the only evidence heard in favour of &#x201C;abortion on demand&#x201D; was given by an organization which, as far as can be ascertained, consists of 15 persons. According to themselves they enjoy the support of several thousand men! All other evidence condemned &#x201C;abortion on demand&#x201D; out of hand. Furthermore, the comprehensive overhead control which the Secretary for Health will be able to exercise in regard to, <i>inter alia,</i> persons who certify and who perform operations, the number of operations performed and the reasons given for the operations, will mean that it will be possible to keep the broad spectrum of abortion under strict surveillance.</p>

<p>Where indirect methods of this kind are to be used, it is my considered opinion that the measures of control in respect of these operations are adequate. If circumstances were to indicate that the proposed measures of control are not adequate, the Government would not hesitate to take steps to impose more efficient control.</p>

<p>The coming into operation of this Act will mean that uniformity has now been achieved in respect of the application of common law in regard to abortions. Quite a number of anomalies used to exist in this regard in the various provinces in the Republic, and these will be removed in consequence of this measure.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to express my sincere thanks to the members of the commission of inquiry under the chairmanship of Dr. C. V. van der Merwe, the hon. member for Fauresmith, for their unselfish service and for their dedication to their task. Their handling of this very delicate matter has been praiseworthy.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, about three years ago I had the privilege of introducing a private member&#x2019;s motion into this House asking for a Select Committee to be appointed to investigate the position of abortion in South Africa. The then Minister of Health, Dr. Carel de Wet, agreed that a Select Committee be appointed, and soon after that he appointed such a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. C. V. van der Merwe, the hon. member for Fauresmith. I want to join with the hon. the Minister in congratulating the chairman of this Select Committee, Dr. Van der Merwe, on the exceptional manner in which he conducted the workings of this Select Committee. It was a most delicate subject that we were dealing with. We had to interview very many people indeed, from all ranks of our population, and I must say that the patience and the courtesy that Dr. Van der Merwe extended to these people, and the guidance and the diligence that he displayed towards his members were outstanding. For me <span class="col_479-480" refersTo="page_0255"/>it was a great privilege to have served on this committee.</p>

<p>Now, what did we do? We produced, after hearing evidence, a Bill which is in front of us today. Every member of the Commission agreed that under the circumstances this was a first-rate Bill and that it was worthy of coming before Parliament to be discussed. We were unanimous in regard to the findings written into the Bill, and we hoped that the members of this House will vote in favour of the Bill. But it is a matter which is very delicate and we have to expect that various opinions will be expressed, not only by the members of the House, but also from people outside, after they had seen the Bill. Very many organizations came forward and gave evidence before we produced the Bill. These were most helpful indeed, but we also got a lot of criticism from people after the Bill was published. This is also very understandable. But on the whole we found that except for a very small group of persons, nobody wanted abortion on demand. Those who did want abortion on demand I think were the most vociferous, and their efforts must have taken many days, weeks or months of hard work. But to me the reasons for abortion on demand that these people gave were groundless. I could not find anything in their claims that could justifiably be introduced into the Republic. But I will come to that in a moment.</p>

<p>I want to say that I personally am going to vote for the Bill&#x2014;naturally, because I was a signatory to it. But I have said that because of the nature of the Bill, people who have varying views on this type of legislation should be allowed to express those views, whether they are on the Government benches or on this side of the House. We on this side of the House have decided to allow our members, at least those representing my party a free vote.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at the Bill to see what it sets out to do and try to determine how necessary it is to have this sort of legislation and how fair it is. Anybody voting against the Bill will be voting for the <i>status quo,</i> and the <i>status quo</i> is quite definite. In South Africa abortions are not allowed. That is the end of it. People who say that in the past they had legal abortions are not aware of what the law is because there is no such thing as a legal abortion in South Africa. What has been happening is that doctors have taken it upon themselves to do abortions when they felt it was necessary at the same time hoping that the law would be on their side. Then there are doctors and laymen who have done abortions for no other reason than to make money. If these people are punished, they must take the rap; I have no sympathy with them.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to divert; I want to come back to the Bill. Let us look at some of its provisions to establish how near these clauses, when they come into operation, will be to the present situation where certain types of abortion are performed on Medical Grounds. I have in mind the type of abortion which people say is legal. In the first instance I want to deal with the case of a woman where continued pregnancy will endanger her physical health. At the moment this is one of the things that happens. In practice what happens? Let us assume that the pregnant woman is very ill. She sends for her house doctor, who examines her. He gives as his opinion that in view of her condition she should have an abortion. Normally that doctor asks for a second opinion, the opinion of a medical specialist. The specialist gives his opinion. Although a specialist in medicine has recommended that she should have an abortion, the general practitioner would not under normal circumstances undertake to do that abortion because of her severe illness. What does he do? He gets the opinion of a third person, a gynaecologist, and asks him to perform the abortion. That is what normally happens. How does this differ from the term of the Bill? I have heard people say that it may break up the family tie between the physician and the patient. Why? If the woman insisted that her family doctor should do the operation, there is nothing to prevent him doing it. All that he will say is: &#x201C;Mrs. Smith, get the opinion of a physician, get the opinion of a gynaecologist as you would normally, come back to me with the two certificates and I shall put you into a nursing home which is designated by the Minister as being a State institution and I shall do the operation there.&#x201D; People do not like the term &#x201C;State institution&#x201D;; they ask why it should be done in a State institution. Let me settle that. The best hospitals in the country are those run by the provincial administrations and the central Government. If I had to have anything done, I would prefer going to a provincial hospital than to a private nursing home. However, there is another matter to which we shut our eyes. In the State institution there is no chance <span class="col_481-482" refersTo="page_0256"/>of a money-making racket coming into being. We will not have clinics for abortions only. These clinics will not be able to charge the earth for the use of a theatre or a bed. They will be designated State institutions which will have to charge the fee as determined by the State which is far, far lower than the lowest of any private institution. Why should I not support that? Of course I do.</p>

<p>Let us proceed to the next question. Perhaps it is the physical or the mental health of the mother that necessitates the abortion. I, for one, am not altogether satisfied with the wording of the clause dealing with this. But for a start I say that it is necessary that permanent mental illness shall be a cause. I am inclined to think, that perhaps there may be some serious mental conditions that would call for it. Permanent means for ever and ever, but what of those that are permanent today and appear to be permanent today but because of investigation and research may not be permanent tomorrow? For those cases that may occur in the future we may have to look at this clause again and see whether or not it is worthwhile amending it. Let us look at the next reason for an abortion as laid out in this Bill, i.e. a possible danger of the child being born in such a way that it will not be able to live an ordinary normal life, not even as a handicapped. We are speaking about badly deformed children, a deformity as a result of infection by some virus during the first three months of pregnancy, a virus such as German measles. If a woman came to me and said: &#x201C;Doctor, look, I had German measles last month and I am pregnant; will you please do an abortion?&#x201D;, am I not expected to do an investigation to determine whether or not she had German measles? I would do it normally. All that is necessary to establish whether or not she had German measles is to have her blood taken and examined by a pathologist. The pathologist may even come to her house to do it for her. By the examination of the blood one can tell whether or not this was the case.</p>

<p>What is the procedure then? The pathologist, who is a medical practitioner issues a certificate. I issue a certificate and she goes to a specialist to have the operation. All this talk about women having to go from one place to another and having to appear before panels of doctors before it is done, is a lot of nonsense.</p>

<p>Then we come to the position of a woman who has unfortunately been raped or who falls pregnant through incest. How many times does it happen in our lives as practitioners, that a woman will come and say: &#x201C;I am in terrible trouble; I was raped last week and I think that I may be pregnant. Will you not do something for me, please?&#x201D; There are a lot of cases like that. Some of them were raped very easily, very easily indeed [Interjections.] It is not a laughing matter. What happens to the young girl who goes out on a Saturday afternoon and by the evening thinks she is pregnant. She has to make an excuse to her parents. It is a terrible thing and I am really very sorry for these people. But what do you do? Normally the child or the adult would have to be taken to the district surgeon for an examination. It is done every day. And that is the correct thing to do. If it is a case of rape that person has to be examined by the district surgeon. He will issue a certificate, the general practitioner will issue the certificate and the specialist will do the job. This business of having to take the child in front of the magistrate or in front of this one and in front of that one and the embarrassment that it causes do not exist. In practice, is it worse than a girl going from one doctor to another to find out which one will do the abortion? Is it worse than that? No embarrassment for these people, but when it is done legally, it suddenly becomes an embarrassment. No, I think this sort of protection is necessary. We have also had the story of the ultra-liberalists who want abortion on demand because the woman is the mistress of her soul and her body. That is the opinion of a very small group in our country, I am happy to say. The majority of people are responsible, i.e. the leaders of the Churches, the leaders of the main organizations in the country, whether they be male or female. They all want care for the person who is pregnant but they are dead against this ultra-liberalization. In some quarters today it is the fashion to be ultra-liberal. It is very fashionable indeed. I have also heard it said in South Africa that preventing abortion is discrimination because the rich can go to England to have abortions carried out, while the poor have to remain here and carry the baby. The rich people have always been able to do what the poor people cannot. I do not see any outcry forthcoming because the rich travel in the Blue Train while poor people have to <span class="col_483-484" refersTo="page_0257"/>travel second class with six people in a compartment. Nobody feels sorry for them. All of a sudden, however, when it comes to abortions there is talk of discrimination. The rich can go to London but the poor cannot. Let me point out that the people in London are getting fed-up with their visitors. The nurses in the London clinics are also getting fed-up with doing abortions day after day, and so are the doctors.</p>

<p>Let us see what some people have objected to. Firstly let me mention that socioeconomic reasons are advanced as a reason for doing abortions on demand. I would like one of the persons advocating socio-economic reasons to tell me where one draws the line. Where does the means test come in? Does the woman who has three Rolls Royces find it easier or more difficult to have a baby than the woman who has to do charring? It is a funny thing that the woman who has to do charring has the baby and still manages to bring it up. There is also all this rubbish I hear about unwanted babies. Who are they unwanted by? Some of the irresponsible parents? Thank God there is a list, longer than my arm, in our country of persons waiting to adopt children. They would be only too pleased to take them. If there were such a vast number of unwanted children in our country as the result of broken marriages and all that sort of thing, why have I not heard from any orphanage or Children&#x2019;s home to say that their gates have to be closed, that they cannot take any more in? I have not heard of any homes which are refusing children, yet I have heard many people coming to me asking whether I could help them to have an adoption arranged. That is what is happening. People who want abortion on demand for convenience will find all kinds of excuses in support of why it should be done, and they are jolly good at doing that.</p>

<p>I have heard, too, about the population explosion. Any person who does an abortion with the excuse that it will help to curtail the population explosion, is either ignorant or a liar because it does not do that and I would not like that method to be used in order to curtail the population in this country. If we want to see that the population here is kept at a responsible level we will have to spend more money on education and we will have to have better outlets for family planning. This is just starting here and the hon. the Minister has at least started to get the ball rolling. I hope that this scheme which is being introduced in South Africa will grow very rapidly throughout the country. Let us teach the people how not to have babies. The people who think that by taking lives you are going to stop the population explosion are absolutely wrong; they are wrong in their thoughts and wrong in their moral outlook to life.</p>

<p>In this Bill we have a conscience clause and I am very pleased that it has been taken up in this Bill. It has been put into this Bill for specific reasons. Nobody can be forced to have an abortion even if the woman&#x2019;s life is seriously in danger. Nobody can force a woman to have an abortion even if the baby&#x2019;s life is in serious danger. By this conscience clause nobody can force a doctor or a nurse to do an abortion or to take part in an abortion operation. Whether it is for reasons of conscience or for religious reasons a person can be absolved from that responsibility. There are many people working in hospitals who are of religious beliefs which are against procuring abortions. We feel that nobody who is working in a hospital&#x2014;particularly in provincial hospitals&#x2014;should be forced to do an abortion. Such a person should always have the option of getting somebody else to do it. There is no hurry at any time&#x2014;we have gone into this matter very carefully&#x2014;of having to do an abortion in an emergency. You can wait two or three days or a week and the abortion can still be done. Once bleeding takes place and a person is taken into a hospital because of severe bleeding, it is no longer a crime to evacuate the uterus. Those are the emergencies, but it is not necessary to cover those operations in this Bill because the bleeding has started and the chances of the foetus surviving are almost negligible. Today gynaecologists spent weeks and sometimes months in order to try to save a child and to keep it from aborting, but here we get people who want abortion on demand and who say that if a woman wants to get rid of a baby she should have the right to have it taken away if she so desires. Thirty or forty abortions per day in a nursing home mean nothing to these people. There was talk about the expense that will be incurred by the present Bill. Are any abortions done free today? None of them. The charges and fees that are levied on patients today are far heavier than will be the case when this Bill is brought into effect.</p>

<p>Reference was made to the discrimination against the Black person and the Black <span class="col_485-486" refersTo="page_0258"/>back-street abortionists. I can tell hon. members that abortion on demand has not done away with back-street abortionists. Nobody in England today does an abortion free of charge; the fees are going up and up. The people in the middle and lower income groups cannot afford the high fees; they are still going to the back-street abortionists because these people cannot afford the legitimate doctors or the nursing homes. They have an abortion brought on and they end up in a free bed in a nursing home or in a hospital. That is what is happening today. Things will not change here. Do the people who talk about abortion on demand imagine that any doctor in our country is going to be so sympathetic towards a Black person as to say to her: &#x201C;My dear, I am terribly sorry, but you are pregnant; I am going to get you a bed tomorrow morning at Baragwanath hospital where I am going to do your operation free of charge, because I do not want you to go to a back-street abortionist&#x201D;. Is that going to happen? It is ridiculous! However, this Bill does allow the woman, who today is doing a septic abortion on herself, the privilege of going to a hospital and having the casualty officer refer her to a specialist so that if it is a legitimate abortion which is necessary, she can have it done in the hospital under the best possible conditions. For anybody to tell me that back-street abortionists will be done away with, is absolutely ridiculous. I should like to know where these people get their figures from. I have a document in front of me which says that approximately 200 000 illegal abortions are being done in South Africa every year. I do not know where they get these figures from or where we get the beds from to put these patients in. I just cannot understand how they get these figures. I was told the other day that only one in five or ten women report rapes. Where do they get these figures from? If a woman does not report it, how do they know that she was raped? I do not know how they work it out. I do not know what brilliant statisticians we have in this country who, without evidence, can conjure up figures from the sky. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, my time is up. I want to tell the House that I for one support the Bill, and I hope that every right-thinking person in this House today will back the hon. the Minister and all of us who are going to speak in favour of the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. V. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me to extend my hearty congratulations from my side, too, to all the members of the Committee who worked with us on this Bill before the House for their hearty co-operation. I am grateful that we were able to bring out a unanimous report. In this regard I also want to express my cordial thanks to the Opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville says that he does not know where they get those statistics according to which there are 200 000 cases of abortion every year. Perhaps, Dr. Fisher, it was also a prejudiced Pegasus investigation.</p>

<p>When one is engaged in an investigation concerning a Bill of this kind, there are two groups of persons who are intensely and intimately affected. The first comprises the women who may require abortion, and the second comprises the doctors entrusted with the care of these people&#x2014;in other words, the doctors whose duty it would be to carry out these operations if they were to be carried out.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary for us to tell this House&#x2014;as has already been indicated in a report before the House&#x2014;that we received 60 memoranda, apart from the large number of people who came before us in person to give evidence. Of these 60 memoranda, in addition to the many people who came and gave evidence before us, there was only one person who gave evidence and submitted a memorandum who wanted abortion on demand. She also submitted a petition signed by people who wanted the same. As against that there were 59 memoranda plus the evidence of innumerable people in which grave objections against it were expressed. In addition, other petitions were submitted to us with far more names on them than on the petition submitted by the woman and which also noted grave objections to this. The preponderance of evidence, therefore, left this commission no option but to decide that the people of this country do not want abortion on demand. Faithful to the principles of my party in this democratic land of ours, I have no choice but to do what the voters of this country expect me to do. We therefore had no option but to decide that the total preponderance of evidence and of opinion in this country was wholly opposed to abortion on demand.</p>

<p>I now come to the second group of people intimately concerned with this matter. <span class="col_487-488" refersTo="page_0259"/>I refer here to the medical practitioners. Of the medical practitioners who gave evidence before us&#x2014;some of them spoke on behalf of the Gynaecological Association and others on behalf of the Medical Association of South Africa; in other words, they were supposed to be speaking on behalf of their colleagues&#x2014;one could not find a single one who was prepared to perform an abortion. This is a matter that is very easily lost sight of, viz. that whereas it is said that it is the individual right of a woman to decide about her own body, it is also the right of every doctor to decide what he wants or does not want to do.</p>

<p>A great deal of fuss was made on all sides about the fact that only men were appointed to this Commission of Inquiry. Originally this commission was a Select Committee of this Parliament and the only woman who could possibly have been appointed to it was at that stage a member on the other side of the House who was no longer in the House. The United Party did not exercise that right and at that stage the Progressive Party was not yet entitled to an appointment to that Select Committee. It was, therefore, impossible &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while those two hon. members settle that point, I want to say that I want to be honest. We on this side of the House did not ask the hon. member for Houghton. We did not need her. Those were the circumstances and that was the evidence submitted to us. The Commission went out of its way to gather evidence from as wide a spectrum as possible, but we experienced the same thing in connection with the submission of evidence among all races&#x2014;a general opposition to abortion on demand. An open invitation was addressed to people to come and give evidence. The Commission went out of its way to invite Coloured medical practitioners to come and give evidence and some of them did so. The Commission also invited Indian medical practitioners, but they did not come; they intimated that they were satisfied with the proposed legislation as printed. In addition, Bantu medical practitioners were contacted, as well as, through Bantu Administration, the homeland leaders, and all of them without exception intimated that they were entirely satisfied with the moral code as well as with the Bill as printed. That still did not satisfy us, and because we received no assistance from that side, we issued a special invitation to the medical director of the Kalafong hospital, as well as the professor at the head of the gynaecological department at Baragwanath. We received no evidence from those people either which compelled us to change our opinion in any way. Sir, we went out of our way to obtain evidence from women. Most of them subsequently thought fit, possibly because of the publicity, rather to go to the newspapers and raise their objections there. Only representatives of the Nursing Association and the Nursing Council appeared before the Commission, and those women provided us with the clearest evidence possible that they were unequivocally opposed to abortion on demand. That, then, Sir, was the situation which this committee came to face, and the committee therefore had no alternative, not that it did not seek alternatives. I think the committee was grateful to be able to come to the conclusion it did unanimously.</p>

<p>Sir, a few interesting things have come to my notice since then. Besides this evidence we gathered and which was received chiefly from the Nursing Association, an extract from a report of the Academy of Legal Medicine recently came to my notice. During a meeting of the International Academy of Legal Medicine and Social Medicine, held on 28 September 1973, the following was once again confirmed, and I find this significant, coming as it does from this eminent international body&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The purpose of medicine is in fact that of protecting the life from the moment of conception to that of the death. Women have the right to be placed in the condition to choose between procreating or not procreating, but such right must be exerted before conceiving by the use of contraceptives, not after conceiving by resorting to abortion.</block>

<p>Sir, I think this pronouncement by the Academy of Legal Medicine is an exceptional pronouncement.</p>

<p><span class="col_489-490" refersTo="page_0260"/>I have here in my hand a letter I received from the chairman of the Gynaecological Association. He has a few objections to the proposed Act He would have preferred separate Acts for sterilization and for abortion. Some members of the commission felt the same, but the legal draftsmen and the legal advisers we had, did not deem this necessary. The chairman of the Gynaecological Association had a few objections to the short title of the Bill. He considered that the short title of the Bill should read &#x201C;Bill on Abortion and Sterilization of Persons Unable to Consent&#x201D;, but this could not be fitted in either, because in the Act there was also another pronouncement concerning sterilization which would not have fitted in with such a title, and therefore it was decided that the short title would remain unchanged. But apart from those minor matters, the chairman of the Gynaecological Association wrote to me as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I must really thank you and congratulate you on having been able to compile a Bill which, in my opinion, is so much better than any passed in any country in the world in the past five years. It does credit to our Parliament and also to the views of our people, and I can only express the hope that the attitude displayed in this Bill will remain the attitude of our people for many years.</block>

<p>That comes from the chairman of the Gynaecological Association. Sir, it is perhaps necessary to refer to some other points. For example, certain objections were raised in certain quarters concerning all the records which doctors would now be obliged to keep. I think that this is a matter that is being wrested entirely out of context. In any respectable institution where illnesses are treated or operations performed, at least at every provincial hospital, records of every operation, however small, performed in those theatres have, in any event, been kept all these years. All that this legislation now states is that the Secretary for Health will be entitled to prescribe how these reports must be kept, in other words, precisely the same as has been done all these years will now still be done in a proper, orderly manner.</p>

<p>There is another minor point to which reference must be made. There are many other members who will also refer to this. This is that the psychiatrist required to certify that women suffering from a mental disability which may be permanently aggravated as a result of the pregnancy, must be a state psychiatrist. The objection is that there are too few state psychiatrists, but the latest arrangements by the Department of Health, provincial administrations and universities alleviate the position considerably in that every psychiatric lecturer on the staff of a university is automatically appointed to the province as well as to the Department of Health and actually appears on the payroll of the Department of Health. The position in that regard, therefore, has been completely alleviated. Then there are people who have in mind conditions of emergency when so may doctors are required. The hon. member for Rosettenville discussed that matter in detail. According to the evidence, as the hon. the Minister has already indicated to you, it was possible to obtain repeated confirmation from the Gynaecological Association that not one of them knew of any emergency condition that could arise under this legislation. An incomplete miscarriage or an incomplete abortion in no way falls under this legislation. Such people are dealt with in the ordinary manner. Sir, it is impossible to play policeman, but, since it is possible for these records to be kept throughout the country, the records can be sent to the Department of Health. The Department of Health then programmes all these records on a computer and this computer will indicate very quickly and clearly when too many of these operations or abortions are being performed in some areas, or it will indicate that in some towns there are certain persons who are continually engaged in these things. In this way a close watch can be kept on these people by means of these records and we believe that in this way we shall be able to cause this legislation to operate properly. The legislation also satisfies the Psychiatric Association, according to a letter that they addressed to us. As far as I know, it also satisfies all other well-disposed persons and it is therefore my privilege to support it.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must say at once that the course of action to adopt at the Second Reading of this Bill is no simple matter, particularly on procedural grounds. It is the first statutory measure to legalize abortion in any form in South Africa although under common law it has generally been accepted, according to legal experts, that an abortion in order to save the mother&#x2019;s life is permissible. It would appear at first sight therefore that a Bill <span class="col_491-492" refersTo="page_0261"/>like this ought to rate the support of those members who are not in principle&#x2014;that is, for instance on religious grounds&#x2014; against abortion. However, a closer examination of the Bill reveals it to be so circumscribed as to defeat any purpose it may have had as an enabling measure. I must say that after listening to the speech of the hon. member for Rosettenville, I have no doubt whatever as to the course of action which I certainly am going to follow in this House. This is a retrogressive Bill compared to the Bill of 1973, which was referred to a Select Committee which later became a commission, and I want to say at once that I believe that in practice it may very well prove to be self-defeating. I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the <i>Abortion and Sterilization Bill</i> because, although it legalises abortion on certain highly restricted grounds, it fails to take full cognizance of the medical, humanitarian and social considerations which justify abortion.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I want to point out that, in fact, I was the first member to raise the whole question of the need for abortion reform in this House. I did so by way of questions I put in 1968 and 1969. I also raised it under the Justice Vote in 1971. In 1972 the hon. member for Rosettenville introduced a private member&#x2019;s motion asking for a parliamentary Select Committee. At that stage I said that I wanted an independent commission of inquiry headed by a judge; I did not want politicians&#x2014;men or women &#x2014;on that particular commission to handle the inquiry. I wanted a cross-section of experts, men and women, to do this: gynaecologists and obstetricians, ordinary doctors, psychiatrists, sociologists, lawyers and, of course, representatives of women&#x2019;s organizations, but whether the members of the commission representing experts, people like the doctors, psychiatrists, gynaecologists and obstetricians, were men or women was a matter of indifference to me. Instead of that we got a parliamentary Select Committee composed of ten members of Parliament, ten politicians, and every one of them a man!</p>

<p>Because I was not asked to serve on it and I was not the only woman member of Parliament in this House at the time either. The then member for Wynberg, Mrs. Catherine Taylor, was also in the House and she too, as far as I know, was not asked to serve on that Select Committee. There were also women Senators. I take the strongest exception to the fact that the Select Committee of this House did not include a single woman member of Parliament. When the Select Committee became a commission, the field was even wider. There were any number of expert women available to serve on the commission because then membership of the commission was not limited to members of this House. The State President could have appointed any woman to serve on that commission and I have no doubt that he would have done so had he been asked to do so by the major parties concerned in the appointment of the Select Committee. I want to say quite unequivocally that I think the omission of women members from this commission was a calculated insult to women perpetrated by a lot of male chauvinist people. Here was a matter about which women are most intimately concerned and it should not have been a matter of party politics. I am very glad indeed that the official Opposition has decided to have a free vote on this Bill and I sincerely hope that a number of them will vote for my amendment. I might say, on behalf of my own party, that we decided long ago that there should be a free vote as far as this measure is concerned. I do not think that the hon. the Minister or the hon. member who has just sat down, who was the chairman of the Select Committee and the commission told us whether or not the National Party was prepared to allow a free vote on a subject like abortion.</p>

<p>It is a Government measure, but so was the Liquor Amendment Bill, and that was allowed as a free vote. I put it to this House that if ever there was a measure on which a free vote should have been allowed it is a measure such as this which concerns private, religious and moral convictions. It should not have been left to party politicians to lay down the law. It should have been left <span class="col_493-494" refersTo="page_0262"/>to the individual conscience of members to decide what they were going to do.</p>

<p>I want to contrast the attitude of this House to the attitude in Britain when the Government appointed a committee to review the operation of the Abortion Act of 1967. That committee was set up in 1971 to recommend changes in law, should they be necessary, and to suggest changes in regulations should they be necessary. I want to point out the difference as far as the composition of the committee is concerned. It was composed of 16 highly qualified people. The chairman was a woman, Mrs. Justice Lane, and no less than nine other members of the committee were also women. Ten out of the 16 members of the Lane Committee were therefore women as compared to this House where no women members were appointed on the Select Committee. If they did not fancy the two women members who were here at the time, they could have appointed any number of highly qualified women from outside this House to serve on that Commission. In paragraph 9 of its report the Commission states that with due regard to the evidence obtained, all bar one who gave evidence or submitted memorandum made representation for abortion to be allowed &#x201C;in exceptional cases only&#x201D;. Both the hon. member for Rosettenville and hon. members on that side who have spoken went further than this. They stated that only one organization had given evidence in favour of abortion on demand. The commission, however, states that only one organization gave evidence asking for abortion to be allowed in anything other than exceptional cases. I want to say to this House at once that that is a complete misrepresentation of the facts, because I know of four organizations and one individual, a professor of the University of Natal, who submitted memoranda asking for abortion to be permitted under much more liberal circumstances than those allowed for in this Bill. The second misrepresentation which I believe this House has had presented to it is the fact that the commission states in paragraph 11 that it based its recommendations on principles as laid down in the Bill which it was examining&#x2014;that is the Bill of 1973&#x2014;and that, they said, made provision for abortion &#x201C;in highly exceptional cases only&#x201D;. This is completely incorrect. Indeed, if the original Bill had been before this House today, I would have had no difficulty in supporting it. It certainly did not accept the principle that abortion should only be allowed in highly exceptional circumstances. If that had been so, I wonder if members would inform me why it was found necessary for the commission to introduce a new Bill which radically altered the first Bill, if the first Bill itself had laid down the principle that abortion should only be allowed in highly exceptional circumstances. The truth is that the first Bill was much more liberal; it did not embody the principle that abortion should only be allowed in highly exceptional circumstances. It is the Bill we are considering today that embodies those principles. I regret to say that the commission has been so vigilant in trying to prevent possible abuses, that the new Bill may very well have the effect of increasing and not of decreasing the number of back-street abortions. I want to quote Judge Hiemstra in this regard. Giving judgment in the case The State v. King he said:</p>

<block name="quote">The problem of what to permit is not a simple one. If the permissible instances are too few in number, the paradoxical situation arises that limited legislation of abortion actually increases the number of criminal abortions instead of diminishing them.</block>

<p>I put it to this House that the limited way in which abortions may be procured, under this Bill we are considering today, may very well have the effect which Judge Hiemstra has warned us about. I appreciate that a situation of no-legalized abortion was the situation in South Africa, except that the common law allowed abortion in order to save the life of the mother. Whatever the hon. member for Rosettenville says, the legal expert, Prof. Strauss of Pretoria University or of Unisa, disagrees with him.</p>

<p>Yes, Unisa. He says that abortions were allowed under the common law in order to save the mother&#x2019;s life. I know it is difficult to go from a situation of no abortion whatsoever, with no statutory provisions except for those allowed in the common law which I have mentioned, to any form of abortion on demand or request in one fell swoop, even if one were in favour of it. It is impracticable at the present stage in South Africa to go from one extreme situation to another extreme situation, although I want to say at once that there is no doubt that there is a tendency <span class="col_495-496" refersTo="page_0263"/>in the modern world to move in this direction. The United States has certainly moved very far in this direction, and although the Lane Commission does not yet recommend this in England, that is the tendency in the modern world. Sooner or later&#x2014;it is always later&#x2014;South Africa will fall into line with modern international practices.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In proposing the first statutory recognition of legalized abortion in South Africa, I say that the commission has bent over backwards to satisfy a narrow-minded and highly conservative point of view as exemplified by the hon. member for Rosettenville. That is the point of view which the commission has attempted to satisfy. In so doing, it has demonstrated very little faith in the integrity of the medical profession. We have only had three medical men who have spoken on this Bill, all of them supporting it, all of them not realizing, apparently, that they have demonstrated very little confidence in the integrity of the medical profession, in contrast with the Lane Commission which said that they considered that it should properly be for the medical profession to set and enforce its own standards. I want to say that the Medical Council has set and enforced its own standards, and I wonder if the hon. Minister, the hon. member for Rosettenville and the chairman of the commission are aware that in March 1972 the S.A. Medical and Dental Council, anything but a permissive body, decided that abortion was ethically justified if it was performed for the following considerations:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) to protect the life and health of the pregnant patient; (There is nothing about &#x201C;permanent serious damage&#x201D; or any of the stuff that has been included in this Bill.)</li>

<li>(b) where there was a real danger that an abnormal child would be born and</li>

<li>(c) in cases of rape, incest, or where the woman or child was unable to understand the result of coitus.</li>

</ol>

<p>I must say that those are ethical considerations and not legal considerations, but those are nevertheless the guidelines which the medical profession lays down for its own members. I maintain that this commission has sternly&#x2014;naturally, consisting of men, why should it care&#x2014;ignored the dreadful trauma of the unmarried pregnant woman more particularly of the girl under the age of 16. This is an omission from this Bill, as opposed to the previous Bill, the 1973 Bill, that I cannot understand for one moment.</p>

<p>We find the trauma of the ignorant and foolish girl under the age of 16 who has become pregnant; the commission has totally ignored the woman&#x2019;s desire for some privacy in her predicament. She does not want to go calling in all these second, third and fourth opinions in order to gain some relief from her predicament. It is not only her own doctor who is involved. There are two other doctors involved plus the hospital superintendent, and, of course, in the case of any mental condition there has to be a State psychiatrist. The Commission has completely ignored the human drama of the unwanted child. Whatever the hon. member for Rosettenville says, there are unwanted children produced by mothers who do not want to have them, women who have had six, seven or eight children and do not want any more. The psychological consequences to that child and the physical evidence of the neglected child and the battered baby are apparent, or have hon. members never heard of battered babies? What about the dreadful death rate of Black infants from mirasmus? Have they heard about that? Do hon. members know that about 50% of infant deaths in the Ciskei are the result of this particular disease?</p>

<p>The far-reaching sociological changes associated with urbanization received absolutely no attention from this Commission, believe it or not. The facts, such as the appalling high rate of illegitimacy, in the homelands, in the urban African townships and in the urban Coloured population, were simply ignored. This high illegitimacy rate is largely, though not entirely, the result of the migrant labour system. This has &#x2026;</p>

<p>Will somebody tell me whether there is any significance in the fact that something like 25% of all the bed space in gynaecological wards throughout the country, is filled with seriously ill women being treated for the effects of self-induced or back-street abortions?</p>

<p>I do not know how many illegal abortions take place. Professor Strauss says that 100 000 illegal abortions per annum is probably an under-estimate, but no doubt the brilliant member for Rosettenville can produce figures to counter that. What, if anything, did the Commission adduce from the fact that the septic abortion unit created at the Groote Schuur Hospital has the highest bed occupancy in the hospital and the greatest patient turnover of all the wards in that hospital?</p>

<p>That is exactly the cry I heard from that hon. member three or four years ago when I introduced a private member&#x2019;s motion asking for free and compulsory education for children of all ages. &#x201C;Who is going to pay for it?&#x201D; he said, and now it has become United Party policy. I can only hope that if this is the pattern of development&#x2014;slow though it be &#x2014;of the United Party, that in three or four years&#x2019; time they will be coming to this House asking for amendments to the abortion legislation or maybe even backing the amendments which I am going to move in the Committee Stage. I wonder if they attach any importance to the fact that Baragwanath Hospital sets up two special wards every weekend to handle incomplete abortion patients. The hon. member for Rosettenville, however, says that there are no unwanted children. Does he really think that these women maul themselves because they want their babies?</p>

<p>He says that I am talking nonsense, but I am telling the hon. member for Rosettenville that two special wards are set up at Baragwanath Hospital every weekend to handle the results of self-induced abortions by African women who do not want these pregnancies.</p>

<p>That is a factor to be reckoned with. One cannot ignore these facts. It is a fact that the King Edward VIII Hospital treats 2 000 septic abortion cases each year and, equally, that Baragwanath Hospital treats 7 000 septic abortion cases annually. Did these facts weigh or did they not weigh at all with the Commission that sat on this very important issue, or were they more motivated by the opinion advanced by one of the people who gave evidence to the Select Committee, viz. Rev. Gericke, who said that &#x201C;it is taboo among Bantu and Coloureds to talk about abortion&#x201D;, and that &#x201C;for them it is not yet a practical matter&#x201D;. &#x201C;Dit is nog nie &#x2019;n aktuele saak nie,&#x201D; he said. This is just not true. The fact of the matter is that it is very much a practical issue for African and Coloured women, as any doctor treating the gynaecological and obstetrical cases in the general hospitals will tell hon. members in this House. If a committee were to sit in three or four years&#x2019; time to examine the workings of the S.A. Abortion and Sterilization Act of 1975 &#x2014;if the Bill goes through as it is presently constituted&#x2014;I doubt whether it would be able to say what the Lane Committee was able to report on the British Act, viz. that &#x201C;it has made a real contribution to the reduction of illegal abortion&#x201D;. It is much I more likely that the number of back-street <span class="col_499-500" refersTo="page_0265"/>abortions will increase unless certain amendments are adopted in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I am often told bitterly by Nationalists that it is very easy for rich people to buy their apartheid. Equally, in spite of what the hon. member for Rosettenville says, it is easy for rich women to buy their abortions. Whether or not England is sick and tired of visitors flying in to have abortions, the fact is that visitors do just that. Among the people who fly in are South African women who can afford to do this in order to have their abortions because they cannot procure them here. This measure is not going to ease that situation. On the contrary, poor women are going to find it even more difficult than they did before to procure abortions because the penalties laid down in this Bill are horrific should a doctor take any sort of pity on a woman in her predicament and assist her to get rid of an unwanted child. Not only must he show that serious physical damage is otherwise likely to affect the mother, but he must show that serious permanent damage can result if a mental case is involved. I am informed by psychiatrists that it is absolutely impossible to predict serious permanent mental damage in such cases.</p>

<p>What are the main changes I object to in this Bill, as opposed to the Bill of 1973, which I say I would have supported as a transitional measure in South Africa, to get away from the situation where there is no legal, statutory provision for abortion other than the common law provision which is generally accepted, viz. abortion in order to save a mother&#x2019;s life? I would have accepted that Bill as a sensible stage in our evolution. However, now there are the new provisions I have mentioned regarding mental health grounds for abortion. It is true that abortion solely on psychiatric grounds can lead to abuse, but the clause that requires certification by two doctors that &#x201C;the continued pregnancy creates the danger of permanent damage to the woman&#x2019;s mental health&#x201D; is, as I have said, absurd. What is more, one of the doctors issuing such a certificate has to be a State psychiatrist. First of all I want to know why the distinction was drawn between physical health and mental health. The original Bill put physical and mental health together and, indeed, they ought to be so classified. Secondly, to require a State psychiatrist to be one of the doctors is, as I have said, utterly impractical. I asked a question of the hon. the Minister when this first Bill was being sent to a Select Committee, and I was told that all in all there are 150 registered psychiatrists in the whole of South Africa. There are 28 full-time and 26 part-time psychiatrists in State employment throughout South Africa. I am referring now to the State hospitals of course. I am not now including the provincial hospitals which I understand employ about 20 full-time psychiatrists. Those that are employed, however, are mainly in the large metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>They are few and far between everywhere else in the country. I am told that there is only one single psychiatrist in the homelands or, rather, near the homelands; he is in Mafeking and not even in a homeland. There is hardly a single psychiatrist between Pretoria and the Limpopo. How is anybody needing to get an abortion on the grounds of mental health, ever to get to a psychiatrist under conditions like that, and more particularly in the case of Black people? The situation is absolutely absurd and hopelessly impractical We are told, as I say, that approximately 100 000 illegal abortions are performed in South Africa every year. That is an estimate, I would agree, but it is an estimate that Professor Strauss thinks might well be an understatement. What do people think is going to happen under these circumstances when it has been made so impossible for women to get legal assistance in their predicament? The only beneficiaries will obviously be the back-street abortionists.</p>

<p>I appreciate the Committee&#x2019;s anxiety to avoid any abuses, but the law, as it stands, is going to be self-defeating. I am not at all sure if in some ways the common law situation would not be better. Certainly, the 1973 Bill would have been much better and the Society of Psychiatrists gave that Bill their backing as, indeed, the Family Planning Association, which is one of the organizations that objected to the restrictions introduced by this Bill, did. There is the, to me, absolutely incomprehensible decision of the Committee to omit the age factor. What on earth made them do that? How many fathers sitting in this House would countenance a 14-year-old daughter of theirs who happens&#x2014;and there but by the grace of God goes anybody&#x2019;s daughter in this House&#x2014;to fall pregnant &#x2026; [Interjections.]? It could happen. Would they countenance such a child having to go through this complicated procedure before she can get any help and then it has to be, <span class="col_501-502" refersTo="page_0266"/>do not forget, on the grounds of serious physical damage to the child&#x2019;s or would-be mother&#x2019;s health or serious permanent damage if it is on mental grounds? Can you imagine this? What cruelty, what lack of humanity to do this! The first Bill allowed a child under 16 to be treated, if pregnant, on the same basis applicable in cases of rape and incest. I maintain that that is correct; that is exactly what should have been done and I am going to move an amendment at the Committee Stage putting the position right back to what it was in the 1973 Bill. I would like to see how many fathers of daughters in this House are going to have the gall to vote against an amendment like that. I think that it is an absolutely appalling provision. And then, while I am on the subject, I wonder if the House is aware of the fact that something like 20% of the case abortions treated at Groote Schuur Hospital concern girls 16 years of age and under. It is not only the occasional case. At Groote Schuur cases of incomplete abortion are brought in and the doctors complete the abortion or ordinary abortions are performed. Why is the hon. member, who is a doctor, looking so mystified? Has he not heard of this situation?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a strange thing happened here this afternoon, for according to the Order Paper the hon. member who has just resumed her seat will move on Friday, 28 February, that this House calls upon the Government to take immediate steps to remove the remaining legal disabilities of South African women. I just want to remind the hon. member for Houghton that it is the tenth of February today and not yet the 28th. I want to recall to the hon. member&#x2019;s attention a debate in this House in February 1972, when she replied to a motion by the hon. member for Rosettenville, and I want to ask the hon. member if there is anything in this Bill for which she did not specifically ask. I am going to quote from the hon. member&#x2019;s speech here on 18 February 1972. After the whole matter had been discussed, it was her turn to speak and she said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think that abortion should be legalized in cases where the mother&#x2019;s life is in danger or her physical or mental health will be affected by the continuation of the pregnancy. Secondly, it should be allowed where there is a considerable danger that the unborn child, when born, will be seriously retarded mentally, or physically deformed, such as in the case of women who have contracted German measles during pregnancy. Thirdly, it should also be allowed where pregnancy is a result of rape. I think that these are three obvious cases and I myself have made up my mind on this score.</block>

If the hon. member can tell me what she means by &#x201C;permanent&#x201D;, then we can take the matter further.

<p>Why put it in if it is not important?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is someone who has had contact with the medical profession and she knows that no medical practitioner can say whether one will die tomorrow. No medical practitioner can say that any condition will be permanent; what will happen to a patient in future is unpredictable. In medicine two times two is not always four; I can testify to that myself. Many of my colleagues said that I would die as a result of injuries sustained in an accident and I did not die. Sir, as far as this Bill is concerned there are a few basic things which we must take into account. The first is that this Bill was introduced by the hon. the Minister of Health, not by a cultural organization, not by a norms organization and not by the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions; it was introduced by the Minister of Health; that is the basis on which we must begin. We are dealing with a health aspect here, and when we speak of health then we speak in terms of people and what is best for them as far as their health is concerned, and this Bill is adapted to this. In the second place, the actions which are laid down in this Bill, are carried out by the medical profession. The medical profession is involved in the matter from beginning to end, and therefore the procedures which the medical profession have to adopt in the case of a therapeutical termination of pregnancy or of abortion to complete the action, are being laid down in this Bill.</p>

<p>In the third place, the legislation has to take the religious and moral norms of the people into consideration. I want to place on record here that apart from the fact that this is this Government&#x2019;s legislation, it was not even necessary for the National Party caucus to argue about this matter. It was not necessary to allow our members a free vote, because every Nationalist here adheres to the Christian principle that one must respect life. That is our basic tenet: You must have respect for an unborn life as well as for the life of another.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, the legislation must take into account the ethical norms which medical scientists impose on themselves, something of which we have always been proud and always will be proud, because the medical profession is the key, around which all these actions revolve. The legislation must also take into consideration that medical science is constantly developing through research and study and that we must also make provision for this for although two times two is four today it is possible that as a result of research in future years it will no longer be the case. Conditions of which we have no knowledge could subsequently develop later, and conditions which we have not yet diagnosed or defined could possibly be defined later. It is precisely for this reason that a broad spectrum is being left open by stating it only as &#x201C;serious risk&#x201D;. &#x201C;Serious risk&#x201D; is a mode of expression in connection with the life or the health of a person, because it is possible that what is today a serious risk will, in a year or two, as a result of medical developments, no longer be a serious risk. Then there is, in turn, something else which is a serious risk.</p>

<p>The legislation must, moreover, take into consideration the variety of services available. The hon. member complained violently about how, in Mafeking and the entire Bophuthatswana area, there is only one psychiatrist, but if you read the legislation carefully and are acquainted with the Mental Health Act which we have introduced, you will see that provision is now made for this. When the province and the State co-operate, you will find that there is a far wider spectrum of psychiatric services. I want to state clearly that we received no evidence of a psychiatric emergency which has to be treated immediately. All the psychiatrists testified one after the other that they cannot express an opinion before they have had a patient under continuous observation. It is not a case of extra blood which is necessary before an operation is possible. A psychiatric case is clearly defined. You can only determine whether a person is a psychiatric case by observation and by examining the case history, and in this way such a person can be prevented from telling suicide stories. Therefore provision is also made for their admission to <span class="col_505-506" refersTo="page_0268"/>such an institution for observation. And there is no emergency which necessitates not having to wait for those findings. In a week or 14 days the psychiatrist is able to say that he is convinced that it is one of those specific cases where pregnancy should be terminated. I really cannot see in what way this can cause any difficulty.</p>

<p>This legislation recognizes the unborn foetus, the person in embryo, but it also recognizes that it does not have the same right as a living person. Sir, as far as I know there are no theologians who are going to participate in the debate, but I can tell you that we read the following in Exodus 21, verses 22 to 25. That is the only place where I could find a reference to the foetus. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit departs from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman&#x2019;s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye &#x2026;</block>

<p>According to our theologians we recognize that God has given us life through his grace and that He alone can say when that life should end. Very strong evidence has been given in favour of this, but I only want to quote one piece of evidence. It comes from a group of young schoolchildren from a certain school and they give the following evidence&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have read in the newspapers and heard news bulletins that Parliament is to discuss legislation for abortion. We are of the Active Christian Life Group at school and at our weekly meeting we discussed the question of abortion. We found the final conclusion comes to this: As part of the public we are definitely against abortion. Perhaps this letter will help to prevent abortion and we hope so because that is why it was written. The future is in our hands, we are the youth and we say &#x201C;no&#x201D; to abortion.</block>

<p>It is such things which touch us. [Interjections.] We have read the legislation and we know what is provided in it. The hon. member has made out no case for any alternative; all that she has said, is: Here I come with Women&#x2019;s Lib, and off we go. That is all the hon. member said in the whole half an hour. She said that we must drop everything. It is important to say what the legislation does not entail, so that the hon. member and other people can understand it clearly. The most important object of the legislation is not to remedy social decadence and evils of the community. This legislation is not of a special nature. It is not justified to level the charge at the medical scientists that the provisions of the legislation are in conflict with he medical ethical code. I should like to read a few quotations from Dr. Roux&#x2019;s opinions on medical ethics. He wrote a whole series of articles in the Medical Journal, and on 27 May 1972 something appeared which in my opinion is very important, and in many respects it is also in complete agreement with the rest of the Hippocratic oath. This is where the ethics of a medical practitioner are of importance (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Respect for the life of a person at any cost. It must never be possible to point out the medical practitioner as the murderer. In his deepest being the physician is the absolute antipole of the murderer: He is for life.</block>

<p>That is a radical statement of medical ethics. The same doctor continues his discourse on ethics and says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of course it will be a sad day if the State passes legislation for the medical profession which is in direct conflict with its personal ethics. On the other hand, however, the doctor cannot enjoy forbidden fruit and then complain only if it is inconvenient for him.</block>

<p>Here it is pointed out that not one of us has the right, neither the State nor the community, to make the doctor the executioner of his problems. It is not right towards him and nor is it right towards the person, because he must carry out the action and the decision.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which I should also like to deal with before I come to the legislation, viz. the question of the psychological deviations which we find&#x2014;the hon. member for Houghton also referred to this&#x2014;when people, because they are pregnant, are driven so far emotionally that they threaten to commit suicide, to use drugs, etc. However, I want to ask the hon. member whether she has made any survey <span class="col_507-508" refersTo="page_0269"/>&#x2014;we speak of a Pegasus survey but she presented us with the results of another survey&#x2014;of the psychological deviations, emotional conditions, etc., which can be caused by an abortion. I want to refer to a report of a Swedish gynaecologist which was published in 1955 in a Swedish newspaper and in which he alleges that in 25% of the cases of <i>abortus provocatus</i> which had been followed up the women reproached themselves about those events. Here is an indication, even if it is only a small one, to the members of my profession. Hon. members must excuse me if I recount a personal experience now. About 10 years ago I had a woman who was over 60 years of age as a patient of mine. She was constantly ill and I could not bring about any progress with my treatment. She suffered from a neurosis; the one moment she was tense, the next moment depressed, and so it went on. Later this patient developed a fatal pathological condition. She was admitted to hospital and lay there for weeks. No medical treatment had any effect on her. One day the ward sister said to me: &#x201C;Doctor, this patient cannot die. One can see there is a struggle, a remorse in her.&#x201D; The following morning I spoke to her and she told me in a whisper: &#x201C;Doctor, I am now 60 years old; I would like to die, but 30 years ago I had my baby removed.&#x201D; That is all she said. She indicated that she had wanted to tell me this. I talked to her and called her minister. The following morning the sister told me that she had passed away quite peacefully. How much thought do we give to those people who have experienced miscarriages? Often they suffer from frustration. It was an instruction from the Dutch Reformed Church to their witnesses who appeared before the commission to communicate the following to us (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would be a good thing if the commission gave attention to the physical, psychological and spiritual after-effects which abortions have on the women on whom they are performed. According to evidence it is not only the unborn foetus which is killed, but the prejudicial effect on the life of the mother is sometimes so extensive that the authorities will be obliged to limit this practice as much as possible.</block>

<p>That is really true. I can mention more than one such case. There is one other thing which the legislation does not do. It is not the aim of this legislation to act as a basis for sensationalism. I do not want to impose silence upon anybody, for example the Press. Here we are discussing women and men because it is the year of the woman, but I have never heard or read a sensational story about a man who had his prostate gland removed. I can say quite openly that he was sterilized as well. What is the reason for these sensational reports? Is it a feeling of guilt or something of that nature? What do they achieve?</p>

<p>In addition the legislation has nothing whatsoever to do with the population increase. The hon. member for Rosettenville emphasized the point again and again, and I am grateful to him for doing so. Although we must take cognizance of the existing norms in other countries, for example America and England, it is by no means the intention of this legislation that we should be followers or mimics of any other country, in which there is moral decay. It is not necessary for South Africa to be &#x201C;with it&#x201D; because abortions are being performed on a large scale in other countries. In respect of America and England we find that 750 000 and 150 000 abortions are carried out there, respectively. Japan and the communist States do not recognize life before birth. They recognize life only after birth. The same applies to the Buddhists.</p>

<p>To return to the legislation I should like to deal briefly with a few aspects. The point which I want to mention is the question of rape. It has been stated clearly that there is a definite procedure which has to be followed. If I may, I should just like to tell a little anecdote to add a light touch to my words. A young girl arrives at a hospital and asks for help. She says to the matron: &#x201C;Oh mother, oh mother, I have been raped. Matron, please help me.&#x201D; The matron then says: &#x201C;Yes, come in my child. Walk this way. Go straight through to the kitchen. On the shelf you will find a lemon. Squeeze out the juice and drink it.&#x201D; The girl then says: &#x201C;Oh matron, will it really help me?&#x201D; And the matron says: &#x201C;Yes, it will help to remove that smile from your face.&#x201D; The hon. member for Rosettenville also referred to the fact that we must not think that every rape case is a genuine case of rape. Therefore it has been stated clearly in terms of the Act that there must be a complainant and that the case must be certified by a magistrate.</p>

<p><span class="col_509-510" refersTo="page_0270"/>Finally I want to express my feelings about the penal provision. I agree entirely that the penalties should be as heavy as possible. I am referring now to clause 10 (l)(a) where reference is made to any person &#x201C;who is not a medical practitioner and procures an abortion&#x201D;, and (b) &#x201C;any person who is a medical practitioner and procures an abortion&#x201D;. The penalties are the same in both cases. However, I feel that here we must emphasize that although the court should use its discretion, according to the case, it is the cases of abortion procured by people who are not medical practitioners which are the chief cause of the high death rate as a result of miscarriages. Those cases are also the cause of the high bed occupation figure in our hospitals. The court must take all of this into account when sentence is passed. We can speak at length about many aspects of this subject.</p>

<p>As far as the procedure is concerned, we are grateful that a circumspect way of controlling abortion has been provided. However, there is one thing this Bill does not say and that is that the Department of Health has to act as policeman or that the Department of Health has to do the work of the Medical Council. The Secretary for Health can only, where more miscarriages are reported at a certain place than at others, obtain further information; or where there are cases which are carried out according to the provisions of this legislation and in respect of which there is some uncertainty, he can obtain more information. According to the nature of the information the Secretary can convey it to the Medical Council or whoever it may concern.</p>

<p>I ask hon. members not to get carried away by the question of abortion on demand because we cannot afford that to happen here. My principle and strongest argument is that we cannot call in the medical profession as an executioner to judge and to carry out an action which is not in the interests of health.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member for Brentwood because as a commissioner and as a medical man he had a contribution to make in both directions.</p>

<p>I want to come back to certain criticisms that have been levelled at the Bill and also at the commission and the Select Committee. Remarks have been made today concerning the absence of women from the Select Committee and from the commission. Let me agree at once with the hon. member for Fauresmith that there were only two women who would have been eligible for the Select Committee. In the first place there was the ex-member for Wynberg, Mrs. Taylor. In order to put the matter into perspective, I may say that Mrs. Taylor was never a regular member of the United Party parliamentary health group as such. When the personnel for the Select Committee was considered, consideration was taken of the fact that the weight of the evidence would no doubt involve the Select Committee being changed to a commission during the recess. Under those considerations it became apparent that Mrs. Taylor would be overseas as she had arranged a lecture tour in the United States. I believe that it is in the interest of continuity that if a person is appointed to a Select Committee he should under normal circumstances continue to serve on the commission. The other person was the hon. member for Houghton. Let us get this matter clear as well. In 1962 the hon. member for Houghton announced with what I can call her customary flamboyancy that she would not be available to serve on Select Committees. She has maintained that self-imposed vow more assiduously than any novice in a seminary right up to this present year. Therefore I do not think the hon. member for Houghton can complain that she was never asked.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>If she would just let me make my speech, Mr. Speaker, I would be grateful. I let her make hers without interrupting here. I would like to suggest to her that many of the changes were brought about after due and careful consideration of the evidence which the Select Committee and the commission received. Some of these aspects I hope to be able to enlarge upon in the time at my disposal.</p>

<p><span class="col_511-512" refersTo="page_0271"/>I want to deal also with another criticism which was directed at this legislation. There were certain bodies that felt that insufficient time had been available for the public as a whole to consider such a vitally important matter. Let us just look at the position. The hon. member for Rosettenville introduced his private member&#x2019;s motion in February 1972. By 8 February 1973, to be precise, the Bill had been Tabled. A Select Committee was appointed on 13 February 1973 and the report of that Select Committee became available on 12 September of the same year. As you are well aware, Mr. Speaker, the Select Committee was converted into a commission which was appointed on 6 July 1973 as per the <i>Gazette.</i> The report on the work of the commission was released on 12 August 1974. The Bill now before the House was in all material respects Tabled during the last session of Parliament on 8 August, and it is only being proceeded with during this session of Parliament. Therefore I maintain that ample opportunity has been given to interested parties to consider this Bill and to report either to the Select Committee or the commission or, if necessary, to Parliament or its members.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the question of consultation. The hon. member for Faure-smith referred to the fact that there were 60 memoranda received. From my own research I find that there were 27 witnesses, delegates or bodies who gave oral evidence. That makes a total of 87 who either appeared before the commission or submitted memoranda. A break-down in terms of my research shows that the medical section was made up of approximately 25 representations, and in the medical section I include both nursing organizations. I do not include these under the women&#x2019;s organizations. I regard them as medical for the purposes of my survey. Under religious bodies and individuals there were 26. The number of women either represented by organizations or as individuals amounted to 14 excluding the nursing profession. Government departments and the provinces were represented in nine cases. The legal aspect was put forward by four different witnesses, social work was dealt with by six witnesses, economic aspects by one witness, the South African Indian Council submitted a memorandum and, finally, there was a memorandum prepared and submitted by Prof. Cope who is in charge of the Department of Bantu Languages at the University of Natal. In the memorandum he stated that he submitted it in his personal capacity. Further, I would draw attention to paragraph five of the report of the commission which says, &#x201C;Your commission also submitted the Bill to the Governments of the Bantu homelands in order to obtain their views on it&#x201D;. I believe that a very large majority supported the original Bill of 1973, although some with reservations, some with suggestions and some with proposed amendments. The main amendments I encountered dealt with the conscience clause which did not appear in the original Bill before the Select Committee but did appear in the final Bill submitted to this House.</p>

<p>Dealing with the question of consultation with other races, we see that the Coloureds were represented by a medical practitioner who indicated in his evidence that he favoured therapeutic abortion but was against abortion on demand. The South African Indian Council, to which I have referred, indicated in its memorandum that it did not object to therapeutic abortions but that it viewed &#x201C;the liberalization of abortion&#x201D; with trepidation.</p>

<p>I come now to the question of the Bantu. As appears in the report, the Bill was submitted for comment to all the homeland Governments and, as far as I know, none advocated abortion on demand. There is also another aspect in this regard to which I should like to refer, viz. the question of Bantu women. This is a matter which is dealt with in some detail in the memorandum of Prof. A. T. Cope of the University of Natal. He indicated that he was not a medical man. Firstly he claimed that the legislation had been drafted with only White women in mind. Secondly, he claimed that the African woman suffers acute mental anxiety on account of unwanted pregnancy and thirdly, in relation to the question of mental health, he stated that there were no psychiatrists in the rural areas. I believe that this is a very valid point. He also said that the lack of fluency in Bantu languages would also present difficulty in relation to obtaining the opinion of a psychiatrist. He also emphasized the fact, which is perfectly true, that there are no Bantu psychiatrists. Prof. Cope concluded by stating that he favoured controlled termination of pregnancy. This, as I understand it, is abortion on request.</p>

<p>I come now to the Abortion Reform Action Group in Durban. As far as I am aware, this group is headed by Mrs. June <span class="col_513-514" refersTo="page_0272"/>Cope. In the first instance I wish to refer to an informal meeting I had with one of the representatives of this organization and two African women. One of these African women was a nursing sister and the other was a family planning counsellor. From them I gathered that the relaxation of abortion procedures could be along the lines of abortion on request up to three months because they regarded this as being ancilliary to family planning. There were two factors which emerged from my discussions with these individuals. One was that abortion is not a Zulu tradition and the other was that the Zulu religion did not specifically object to abortion.</p>

<p>In order to be perfectly fair, I feel that I must also put the case of the Abortion Law Reform League. My colleague, the hon. member for Rosettenville, interrogated the representative of this organization who appeared before the Select Committee. This evidence is recorded in the report of the Select Committee, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">231. <i>Dr. E. L. Fisher.]</i> Mrs. Maister, what is your membership?&#x2014;<i>(Mrs. Maister.)</i> We do not have an actual membership. The position is this: We cannot spend our time writing out lists; we feel that we should rather spend our time in practical ways like writing articles.</block>

<block name="quote">232. <i>Dr. E. L. Fisher.]</i> Of how many members does the actual group consist? <i>&#x2014;(Mrs. Maister)</i> About eight women. But 17 women in the Transvaal wrote to me, and I also sent them material.</block>

<block name="quote">233. <i>Dr. E. L. Fisher.]</i> Do you have any connection with a family planning unit?&#x2014;<i>(Mrs. Maister.)</i> No.</block>

<block name="quote">234. <i>Dr. E. L. Fisher.]</i> Is your sole object to give publicity to abortion on demand?&#x2014;<i>(Mrs. Maister.)</i> Yes.</block>

<p>This was the representative of the Abortion Law Reform League.</p>

<p>I want to return now to the alternative suggested by other people who gave evidence in so far as the Bantu themselves are concerned. In this regard I want to refer to the evidence of Dr. G. H. Roux, the Medical Superintendent of Saulspoort Hospital, a hospital with 450 beds catering, as I understand it, for 250 000 Tswanas. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek dink dit is hoog tyd dat &#x2019;n wet soos hierdie sy verskyning op die Wetboek maak.</block>

<p>If I may, I also want to refer, in regard to this same question of the Bantu, to the evidence given by Prof. Lavery of the Baragwanath Hospital. I am sure that nobody will deny that this man speaks with authority. His evidence forms part of the evidence recorded by the Commission. Prof Lavery said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Abortion at Baragwanath is possibly the second major complaint that we have to deal with.</block>

<p>He indicated that the average number of this type of case was 14 per day. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eighty per cent of these were illegal and of those 80%, 40% were septic.</block>

<p>He added that in the latest year for which he had statistics, 1972, 26 of these women died in hospital. This is how Professor Lavery continues: &#x201C;In all the years that I have been at Baragwanath hospital we have never, to the best of my knowledge, had a request for a termination of pregnancy.&#x201D; Professor Lavery went on in his evidence to indicate that there were over 1&#x00BD; million souls in Soweto. He indicated that he was totally against abortion on demand. He said that there were many reasons and he quoted what he regarded as the most potent. He said: &#x201C;We would be running an abortion mill at Baragwanath at the cost of patients who are ill.&#x201D; This is something which we cannot disregard. He went on to say that he did not know the answer. I quote again: &#x201C;But I want you to know that, as far as the Bantu is concerned, this would be an absolutely fatal move on the part of the Government to authorize for the non-White abortion on demand.&#x201D; Professor Lavery was also of the opinion that liberalized abortion laws would not prevent back-street abortions. He said this: &#x201C;Unless you advocate abortion on demand. &#x2026;&#x201D;. He continued by indicating that, as far as that was concerned, &#x201C;&#x2026; it would be a disaster in his hospital&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I want to deal with the evidence of the women&#x2019;s organizations, because this has been a matter of a fair amount of publicity. I have referred to the fact that the Abortion Reform Action Group gave evidence and I have tried to put their membership and activities into <span class="col_515-516" refersTo="page_0273"/>perspective. But amongst the other women or women&#x2019;s groups which gave evidence &#x2014;and as far as I can see there were 13&#x2014; were such bodies as the National Council of the Catholic Women&#x2019;s League, the National Council of Women of South Africa, the Oranje-vrouevereniging, the South African Abortion Law Reform League, which is affiliated or acts jointly with the Action group, the South African Federation of Business and Professional Women, the Suid-Afrikaanse Vrouefederasie, a private individual, the Family Planning Association&#x2014;the Southern Transvaal branch whose evidence was based on personal observation by one of the staff, I believe, or one of the advisers&#x2014;the Natalse Christelike Vrouevereniging and the Catholic Women&#x2019;s League. According to my examination of the evidence, I find that eight of these bodies or individuals support the Bill. Three of them support abortion on demand. Those supporting abortion on demand were the Abortion Law Reform League, the Abortion Reform Action Group, one individual woman and the representative of the Family Planning Association of the Transvaal, who offered a personal opinion.</p>

<p>Let us examine the position or the situation in so far as those women who appear to me to have supported the Bill are concerned. I firstly mention the South African National Council of Women. I would regard that body as being representative, to a large extent, of the opinion of the women of South Africa. It is a body, I am told, with over 1 500 members with 30 odd branches distributed throughout the towns and drops of South Africa. They have, in addition, 560 affiliated societies. I am not suggesting for one moment that these affiliated societies would all subscribe to the strong memorandum of the National Council. As I understand the position, they were completely opposed to abortion on demand, and I gather that they favour the provisions of this Bill. Sir, the next one is the South African Federation of Business and Professional Women, an organization which I believe is held in high esteem. Then we have the Suid-Afrikaanse Vrouefederasie, and I would say this is a very powerful and influential body with many members. There is also the NCVV in Natal, the Oranje-vrouevereniging and the National Council of the Catholic Women&#x2019;s League. So I feel that taking into consideration the weight of the evidence, as the commission did, we were right in forming the conclusion which we did.</p>

<p>Then I would like to deal with the religious aspect. Here again my research showed and I mentioned that there was a number of churches involved. As far as oral evidence is concerned, the Dutch Reformed Church appeared before the commission, but there were 26 other bodies, or individuals representing churches or religious bodies, which submitted memoranda. Among these were the Greek Orthodox Church, the Apostolic Church, the Baptist Union, the Roman Catholics, the Church of England in South Africa, the Lutheran Church, the Full Gospel Church, the NGK and the NHK and then, in the form of a joint memorandum, the Church of the Province known as the Anglican Church, of which I am a member, the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church and the United Congregational Churches, which submitted their opinions. Their opinion was received in a joint memorandum by the commissioners on 7 April 1973. Now, at this moment of time I believe that the Church of the Province has not finalized its attitude to this particular Bill. There is a further commission sitting and the results are not known. But I, as a member of that church, believe that the terms of the Bill would not be unrepresentative of the opinion of the Church of the Province. I want to refer, however, to their brief two-page memorandum which they submitted to the Select Committee. Paragraph 1 on page 2 states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in view of the inadequate period of time given to medical, legal and ecclesiastical bodies to make their submissions on the Bill to the Select Committee, the final work of the Select Committee be deferred to enable it to receive as much evidence as possible before the Bill is sent back to the House of Assembly.</block>

<p>It refers to the &#x201C;inadequate period of time&#x201D;. I believe that it is a matter for regret that with virtually three years, of publicity and with full information available, the four churches involved could not submit their considered opinion in greater detail before this Bill was debated in Parliament. I say this because I believe that those four denominations represent a very large number of adherents in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then I want to come to the question of the public reaction. The Abortion Law Reform League claims, as I understand it, that there is extensive support for abortion on demand, but what is the other side of <span class="col_517-518" refersTo="page_0274"/>this picture? There are many well-intentioned people who have been giving parliamentarians a very busy time and who have been causing them anxiety because they are appealing to members of Parliament to &#x201C;strongly oppose this Bill&#x201D;. The reason given by these people&#x2014;and I have one of their petitions in front of me&#x2014;is that they are opposed to legal abortion in South Africa and &#x201C;are horrified that the South African Government can join the trend in Europe and America in allowing the wholesale murder of innocent babies who have not even had the chance of survival&#x201D;. I suggest that the phrasing of that particular paragraph which appears in the petition is unfortunate and extravagant. I suggest that many of the signatories to this document&#x2014;and possibly they did it in good faith&#x2014;have not read the Bill itself, nor have they read the report of the commission. I want to place my attitude on record because I was asked by these bodies to vote against this Bill. I am in favour of this Bill. I support the Bill for five reasons. Firstly because, in my opinion, it will eliminate the unsatisfactory situation existing at present, the contradictory legal position; it will provide the medical profession with strictly limited control and discretionary powers; it will not permit abortion on demand, and it will provide the Department of Health with the means to observe any activities directed at evasion of the terms and conditions laid down; and, lastly, it will provide severe sentences for anyone convicted of performing illegal abortions. Those are my reasons and&#x2014;I state them for record purposes.</p>

<p>A lot has been mentioned on the question of statistics and that they could in many cases be of very doubtful significance because it is so difficult to gather complete statistics on a delicate matter of this nature. However, according to official statistics which were issued by the Department of Statistics in reply to my question it would appear that during the ten years 1962 to 1972 there were in all 792 prosecutions on account of illegal abortions. Of those 792 prosecutions 325 convictions were effected. Actually, I think they represent a fairly accurate proportion of the population groups in South Africa: Whites 50, Coloureds 36, Asiatics 13 and Bantu 226.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which I wish to bring before the House briefly, namely the social welfare agencies&#x2019; views on abortion. I should like to quote briefly from C. B. J. Callaghan who in 1970 wrote <i>Abortion-.</i></p>

<p><i>Law, Choice and Morality</i> in which he said <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Permissive and moderate systems also result in a public health problem, although of a subtler kind and neither of the magnitude nor seriousness of that resulting from widespread illegal abortions. In the permissive systems of East Europe and Japan and in the mixed systems of Scandinavia and Great Britain, medical services are adequate, but the large number of abortions each year puts an extra strain on them and also diverts attention from other health needs in the population. Repeated abortions and the increasing number of abortions among young and childless women risk damanging sequelae and represent some degree of threat to female health generally &#x2026;</block>

<p>If one takes that particular opinion into consideration, I believe we have to come to the logical conclusion that South Africa could not claim that the medical services could cope with abortion on demand as is suggested by some people. Neither could we afford to divert medical attention from the health needs of the population as they exist in South Africa at this moment in time.</p>

<p>There are other considerations. Although my time has nearly expired, I should like to refer briefly to authentic comment and evidence on the effect after an abortion on further pregnancy. A woman who has had an abortion is regarded in many instances as a high-risk patient when she falls pregnant again. The opinion is clear that induced abortion plays an important role in the development of a subsequent child and figures show that abortion leads to an increase in the number of premature births.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which I believe we have to take into consideration, namely what is called &#x201C;the effect of abortion on subsequent marriage&#x201D; and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A man is more likely to have a sterile wife or a stillborn or premature or defective child if he marries a girl who has had an induced abortion.</block>

<p>I believe that these are factors which we who were members of the Select Committee and subsequently members of the commission, had to take into consideration. I believe that any of the tightening which took place in various provisions of the Bill of 1973 <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Bill of 1974 and this particular Bill was brought about in the <span class="col_519-520" refersTo="page_0275"/>main by the consideration of the evidence given by responsible medical opinion, and here I refer to the psychiatrists, the gynaecologists, the Medical Council, the Medical Association, the Nursing Council, the Nursing Association and many religious bodies as well.</p>

<p>It is for that reason that I, as a member of the commission, am fully in favour of the provisions of this Bill. I believe that if there have to be amendments as the situation evolves, they must come with time. But at this moment in time the vast majority of South Africans who gave evidence see this Bill as the most logical starting point.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill deals mainly with two matters, namely abortion and sterilization. The hon. member for Berea devoted most of his time to the commission. I did not serve on the commission, but I enjoyed his speech. I think that it was a good speech. His speech convinced me that I am right in adopting the same attitude to this Bill as he did. I have two things in common with the hon. member for Houghton. The one is that I did not serve on the commission and the other is that we both like and love women. It is for this reason that I would rather not follow the hon. member for Berea, but would like to refer to a few things the hon. member for Houghton said.</p>

<p>This subject of abortion is pregnant with problems, with pitfalls and with extreme differences of opinion. I think the local Press substantiated this by their reactions to the provisions of this Bill, especially by their reactions to an article in the Press by a former Cabinet Minister&#x2019;s wife. I do not want to go into this question of the Press article any further, Mr. Speaker, but I think that at this time of the evening you will allow me to read one comment which appeared as a result of this article.</p>

<p>*This newspaper tried to find out from male and female friends and relations what they thought of the article written by this lady. One of the daughters said: &#x201C;My mother has no female friends, only relations.&#x201D; She is a Van der Merwe. The article concluded as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of Mrs. Waring&#x2019;s friends in Cape Town was surprised to hear that she had written such an article. &#x201C;Good heavens, I knew about her face lift, but not her abortion.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I think these remarks perhaps give one a better insight why this article drew so much attention.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Being a medical practitioner and a specimen of the male sex, I cannot share, or should I rather say I cannot enjoy Joyce&#x2019;s joys by telling or rather selling you the stories about my personal experiences with abortion.</p>

<p>*Therefore I leave that matter there. I may perhaps just add that although the women are taking us rather severely to task because no women served on this commission, they should in this Women&#x2019;s Year, perhaps not be too severe on us men. With permission, I am quite convinced that if women alone were responsible for pregnancies, we would certainly have had much more of a debacle than we have now. Therefore they could also show us a little gratitude. That is, if you understand what I mean.</p>

<p>I said that this question of abortion is pregnant with problems, and is characterized by extreme standpoints. These extreme standpoints are, on the one hand, the standpoint of abortion on demand, which is an extreme standpoint, while one has, on the other hand, the standpoint of people who want to allow no abortions whatsoever, which is the other extreme. In world literature and in the great dialogue about abortion taking place in the world today, one finds reasonably strong support for both these extreme standpoints. This is a balanced Bill which does not satisfy any of these extreme standpoints. Consequently one will find a large percentage of people in the world, perhaps not such a large percentage in South Africa, who will not agree with this Bill. It does not satisfy the extremists and therefore one will perhaps find a large percentage not supporting it.</p>

<p>The question of abortion has many facets. It has medical aspects, moral aspects, religious aspects, scientific aspects, and so on. In my speech I should like to refer to some of these aspects. I have already said that I support the Bill, and this is not because I belong to the National Party caucus; I believe that this is the right Bill.</p>

<p>Certain arguments are being advanced in favour of unrestricted or liberal legislation, the so-called unrestricted abortions. Arguments are being advanced in the world in favour of the other extreme, as I have mentioned. What arguments are being advanced <span class="col_521-522" refersTo="page_0276"/>in favour of this abortion on demand? There is the population explosion which certain speakers referred to, the food shortage and the harmful effects of illegal abortions. The death rate as a result of illegal abortions is approximately 100 or more per 100 000, while in the case of legal abortions it is approximately two in 100 000. The death rate in respect of legal abortions is also much lower than in the case of normal births.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Another argument used is that the individual should have the right to decide for himself. The American Supreme Court declared on 22 January 1973 that a mother should have the absolute and deciding right to determine whether she wants to carry and deliver a baby.</p>

<p>*Up to that stage only four states in America allowed abortion reasonably freely and liberally. Since that stage when this decision was taken by the Supreme Court, it is now being allowed throughout America</p>

<p>&#x2020;Another argument used is to limit the number of unwanted children. The hon. member for Rosettenville dealt with this by more or less saying &#x201C;You make them and I will take them&#x201D;. I think that deals with the argument of limiting the number of unwanted children.</p>

<p>*Today there is a general liberalization in many parts of the world. The hon. Leader of the Opposition told me that when he came to this House for the first time wearing a light suit without a waistcoat, he was called in and reprimanded by Mr. Speaker. The hon. member for Geduld who is wearing a white double-breasted suit, is today regarded as being very well-dressed. Therefore there is a general liberalization in the world and this also has an effect on world legislation.</p>

<p>The bond between State and Church is no longer as strong as it used to be in earlier years. France has had legislation since 1920 in which it is laid down that abortion may only be permitted in cases of incest and rape. Towards the end of last year France, which is to a large extent a Catholic country, liberalized the Act, for the very reason that no such strong ties exist between the State and the Church any more.</p>

<p>As a result of all these factors and others, we have a certain position prevailing in the world today as far as abortions are concerned. According to a survey conducted by a group of learned people, all the particulars of which I have here&#x2014;however, time does not allow me to supply all the references&#x2014;55 million abortions took place in the world in 1971; this number includes legal and illegal abortions. This must be an important matter if 55 million women in the world were involved in it during one year.</p>
