<p>Clause 4 (contd.):</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I think the hon. member for Durban North will agree with me that after the explanation which was given to him in connection with his amendment by the hon. member for Vereeniging, it is hardly necessary for me to add anything. I think the hon. member for Vereeniging stated the case quite effectively and I could only repeat what he said. The hon. member for Durban North referred in his argument to subsection (6). I think that we have now decided here that the references to subsection (8) and the other subsections are really unnecessary. I just want to indicate that when the new Criminal Procedure Bill is introduced, which we hope will be next year, that subsection will not appear in the existing section 239. I think that the hon. member will then be more satisfied.</p>

<p>Sir, I also want to say by way of general explanation that this subsection has been inserted to give the public more protection than they have at the moment in respect of traffic offences. Before the conditions and requirements in respect of a measuring instrument are announced in terms of the proposed measures, the manufacturer of the instrument will have to lay it before the superintendent of weights and measures. The superintendent, in consultation with the C.S.I.R. and the SABS, will subject the instrument to tests and lay down the standards which the instrument must comply with. The superintendent of weights and measures will then inform the Department of Justice as to the conditions and requirements which the instrument will have to comply with to maintain the standards which have been laid down. It is these conditions and requirements and not the standards which the Minister will announce, and these entail (a) the particular way and the circumstances in which the instrument must be used and (b) the periodical inspection and testing of the instrument. The affidavit referred to in section 239(5A)(b) will accordingly have to be accompanied by a certificate issued by the superintendent of weights and measures which will indicate when the instrument was last tested. The National Road Safety Council, the Department of Commerce, and the Road Research Institute of the C.S.I.R. are satisfied, after consultation with the Department of Justice, that this is the best way to get rid of problems which presently arise with the furnishing of evidence, to ensure the reliability of the instruments and to eliminate the unreliable instruments. This procedure has this important advantage that a member of the public can satisfy himself that the manner and the circumstances in which the instrument was used, for example when he was caught in a speedtrap, correspond with the conditions and the requirements as to <span class="col_3295-3296" refersTo="page_0061"/>how the instrument has to be used. It can also be easily ascertained whether the instrument was subjected to the proposed tests. In the present circumstances, a member of the public is often left completely in the dark about the use of instruments and he cannot refute evidence which is adduced. When the provisions of this clause are not used, the usual method of furnishing evidence can still be followed. Of course, at this stage no reference can be made to specific instruments which will satisfy the requirements mentioned, since stand ards will only be laid down to this end after this legislation has been passed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think there is any point in continuing the argument as to whether or not the new subsection will be subject to the provisions of subsection (6) of the main section of the Act, namely that the magistrate should have the discretion to call the person who made the affidavit to give evidence <i>viva voce</i> and be cross-examined, especially as this power is exercised usually on the application of the accused who otherwise has no way in which he can test the accuracy of the instrument which trapped him on the road. We do not agree with the interpretation of the hon. member for Vereeniging and that adopted by the hon. the Minister, and for those reasons we will vote in favour of our amendments Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5 which I moved last night.</p>

<p>The other thing I would like to say to the hon. the Minister is that so far as the testing by the SABS is concerned we quite agree that this is obviously something which has to be done. This is obviously one of the conditions that will be laid down, but it has already been said&#x2014;as there is much authority for it. I do not wish to waste the Committee&#x2019;s time by referring to it all that the instrument should be tested on the day. It should be known that on the day itself, the day on which the trap was sprung, on which he went through the trap, this instrument was in fact working properly. But in Dawson&#x2019;s case the full Bench of the Natal Provincial Division said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Counsel for the State submitted somewhat half-heartedly that any instrument such as the gatsometer in question which bore upon it the imprint of reliability implicit in the stamp of testing by the S.A. Buro of Standards should be accepted by the court. I am quite unable to accept this. The stamp itself is no proof acceptable to the court. If the accuracy of the mechanism is challenged the State must prove by means of human testimony the reliability and the court would be abdicating its function if it were merely to accept that an instrument at one time tested by the SABS, would inevitably and indeterminately thereafter be accurate.</block>

<p>I think, Sir, this sums up the attitude we have and the reason why we have moved the second amendment which I moved last night. I do not think we can take the matter further than that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I should just like to deal with this aspect very briefly in conclusion. I want to tell the hon. member for Durban North that I think he is anticipating the whole thing. He has now referred to a case which dealt with the gatsometer, but it has not yet been decided that this will be one of the instruments which will be used. The position is that our department will test the various instruments in co-operation with the other departments concerned to establish which instrument gives us the very best result. If it subsequently appears from a court case, or in any other way, that even after we have taken the trouble of testing an instrument periodically, that instrument must also be tested on the day on which it is used then the necessary amendment will be made. The intention at the moment is not that it should be tested by traffic officials. We are thinking in terms of an instrument which will be tested periodically by the scientists and the intention is to select instruments which can maintain their accuracy for a certain time, and this will also be tested by the scientists; and then there will still be instructions as to how that specific instrument must be used. This will provide an additional assurance that on the day on which it is used, if it is used in the prescribed manner, it will provide the degree of satisfaction which we can reasonably expect to get in circumstances, such as these.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 7 is a repetition of all the new provisions which are in clause 3, viz. 17 new substantive provisions in the equivalent of the Criminal Procedure Act in South West Africa. The provisions are identical, our attitude towards them is identical, our attitude towards the amendments of the hon. member for Houghton on the Order Paper is identical, her amendments are identical and it seems having had our debate and having made the decisions we have made in respect of the identical matters, it will serve no purpose to argue these again at this stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in view of the fact that these amendments have been fully canvassed during the discussions on clause 3 it is not our intention to move these amendments again. We do this to save time. Nevertheless, for the record, we would just like to say that we still totally disagree with the hon. the Minister and that we would like to see these being incorporated in the Bill.</p>

<heading>COLOURED PERSONS REPRESENTATIVE COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured,_rehoboth_and_nama_relations">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED, REHOBOTH AND NAMA RELATIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The last occasion on which the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, 1964, was amended, was in 1972. On that occasion <span class="col_3299-3300" refersTo="page_0063"/>it was said that this was not an Act one would want to tamper with unnecessarily, but that it was in fact necessary, in the light of experience that had been acquired, to supplement this Act from time to time to ensure that there was no hitch in the smooth functioning of both the Council as well its administrative machinery. I repeat that as long as this side of the House is in office, we shall continue to tie up any loose threads there may be in the Act in order to adapt it to any circumstances which may arise, and to modernize it into a Constitution embodying all aspects of the Council&#x2019;s existence.</p>

<p>In 1972 it was found necessary, as far as the financial matters of the Council were concerned, to insert the subsection (2A), referred to in the present Bill, in the Act. Section 22 of the said Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the preparation of estimates of expenditure of the Council by its executive and the submission of these estimates to the Minister for appropriation by Parliament of a lump sum to be applied by the Council by resolution. However, it was found necessary to make provision for steps to be taken by the Minister if the Council and its executive were to fail, for some unforeseen reason or other, to make moneys available by resolution for the services specified in the estimates&#x2014;hence the subsection (2A) referred to. The only motive for that legislation was the necessity to ensure that the necessary funds would at all times be available for the continuation of the existing services for which the Council is responsible.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, it has subsequently come to our attention that there is a deficiency even in that statutory provision. If the executive should for example refuse to prepare draft estimates and to submit such estimates to the Minister in the prescribed manner, no other statutory provision exists at present for obtaining funds from the central Government for the purposes of the administrative organization of the Council, viz. the Administration of Coloured Affairs. Owing to lack of funds the said Administration will then be unable in practice to proceed with its functions, with resultant appalling hardships for the Coloured population.</p>

<p>But the problem is in fact a twofold one, and consequently there is another aspect as well, which has been settled with the Government law advisers. When the executive does in fact submit the said draft estimates to the Minister in the first place, but, after the moneys have been appropriated by Parliament, refuses or fails, for its own reasons&#x2014;for example, in protest against reductions in the requested moneys&#x2014;to submit the estimates in the prescribed manner to the Council to be made available by resolution, the Council as such cannot, according to legal opinion, be regarded as having had the opportunity to make moneys available, in other words that the prescribed procedure had been complied with. Recourse cannot then be had to subsection (2A) for the purpose of making moneys available, for this section provides that if the Council initially and the executive subsequently&#x2014;in that sequence&#x2014;fails to make moneys available, the Minister may do so on behalf of the Council. Again the Administration of Coloured Affairs will be financially embarrassed, for there will be no legal sanction for funds for the services it has to render.</p>

<p>The abovementioned possible problematical situations relate only to the provision of funds, but there are other matters as well&#x2014;for example, failure to exercise powers which have been delegated, authority which has been granted and duties which have been imposed, which could paralyse effective administration. In the spheres of education, social welfare and pensions for Coloureds in particular, dereliction of duty and obstruction on the part of the Council and/or the executive could have alarming consequences. Mr. Speaker, the implications of this are obvious, and it is probably not necessary for me to spell out to hon. members here the possible consequences for those Coloureds, for example, who are dependent for their livelihood on the funds of this Council. In the opinion of everyone who is very closely involved in this matter and who has the progress and welfare of the Coloureds in all spheres&#x2014; not only the political sphere&#x2014;at heart, complete justification exists for providing that the Coloured community shall not suffer as a result of the non-performance of duties in terms of this legislation. Because misgivings have been expressed that the object may be to take over the CRC in its enterity and therefore even exercise legislative powers, I am willing to move an amendment in the Committee Stage which ensures that legislative power is not granted to the Minister. Coloured politics, seen within a developing political structure, are not always easily predictable, but it is the declared object of certain parties to destroy the CRC. <span class="col_3301-3302" refersTo="page_0064"/>These people accord no recognition to the good things which the Coloured population of this country have obtained since the establishment of this Council, and possibly do not realize the chaos, particularly when Parliament is in recess, which impulsive action on an administrative level could cause. To prevent such chaos, it has been suggested, and this has the support of this side of the House, that provision should not only be made for possible problems with regard to the making available of funds, but that a wider provision be substituted for the said subsection (2A) in the Act with a view to obtaining certainty with regard to all possible contingencies which could interfere with the administrative functions and duties of the Council. In reality, clause 2 of the Bill under discussion is therefore intended as an entrenchment and an assurance of the continued existence of the administrative functions of the Council.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to point out that statutory provision to avoid possible administrative chaos is nothing new when one is dealing with a developing political structure and when future actions cannot be predicted with certainty. In 1963, for example, a provision was inserted in the Transkei Constitution Act (Act 48 of 1963) under the heading &#x201C;Executive powers, authorities and functions to vest temporarily in Minister&#x201D;. The provision reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All such executive powers, authorities and functions as are necessary to be executed in terms of this Act for bringing this Act into operation and, if necessary, for ensuring the continuation of the administration and government in the Transkei in terms of this Act, may be exercised or performed by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</block>

<p>The principle involved in the Bill under discussion is therefore not a new one at all, and since the general welfare and progress of the Coloured population of our country is at stake here, I trust that hon. members will also consider it in this light.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened with close attention to the reasons advanced by the hon. the Minister for the amendments which he is introducing this afternoon. I must say that I find those reasons most unsatisfactory. I find them unsatisfactory because in his own speech he said that the decision taken, the view expressed, in 1972 was that there should be no fiddling about with this institution unless experience showed it to be necessary. What experience has he had to show that this legislation has become necessary&#x003F; Has the council ever refused to vote supply&#x003F; Has the executive ever yet refused to carry out its functions&#x003F; What reason does the hon. gentleman have <span class="col_3303-3304" refersTo="page_0065"/>for coming forward and saying that the general principle which, he is adopting, is that changes should only be made in the light of experience, while he advances no experience to support these changes&#x003F; Secondly, the hon. gentleman spoke of their refusal to prepare estimates, of the executive refusing to place estimates before the council and the withholding of delegated powers. But these things have never happened. What is the hon. gentleman so afraid of&#x003F; When he came to this House in 1972 with changes, he was able to say that he had had discussions with the executive at the time, that he was bringing those changes because of those discussions and consultations and that those changes carried the imprint of the executive concerned. He has not mentioned anything this afternoon about consultation with the executive. Perhaps he will tell me across the floor of the House whether there has been any consultation with the existing executive&#x003F;</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Has there been any consultation with the leaders of the party which now has a majority in the CRC&#x003F; A strong point of the hon. the Minister in the debate of 1972 was precisely that he had consulted with the executive council and that he came to the House for changes with their goodwill. But there has been no mention of consultation this afternoon. I cannot imagine for one moment that he would have failed to mention it had there been consultation and had he got their goodwill and support.</p>

<p>What is the hon. gentleman worried about&#x003F; He tells us that the things he mentioned may happen. Well, one knows there has been an election and that there has been a change of the party in power in the CRC. But the old executive is still in office and will remain in office until the CRC meets, a new executive is elected and a new chairman is appointed by the State President. He has lots of time; there is no immediate danger of things breaking down. He has an executive he has been working with for some time. Why cannot he delay the introduction of this Bill&#x003F; Why cannot he adjourn this debate to give him an opportunity to discuss this matter with the party which is now going to assume power in the CRC&#x003F; He knows very well what the feelings of the Coloured people are at the present time. He knows how this Bill is being regarded; he is hoping to soften the impact by saying he is not going to exercise the legislative powers of the CRC, limited though they are. In any event, no Bill is introduced without the consent of the Minister. However, he is sugaring the pill in this regard. I think that this is a most unsatisfactory situation indeed.</p>

<p>He has sought to justify his position by saying that in section 71 of the Transkei Constitution Act executive powers, authorities and functions vest temporarily in the Minister in the certain circumstances. This Act was also mentioned by the hon. the Leader of the House when he spoke to the motion for leave to introduce this Bill. I have taken the trouble to have a good look at it. The text is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All such executive powers, &#x2026; for bringing this Act into operation and, if necessary, for ensuring the continuation of the administration and government in the Transkei in terms of this Act, may be exercised or performed by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development.</block>

<p>This is not the full quotation as I have omitted certain words. I do not believe the words that I have omitted alter the meaning; they merely give effect to what the meaning should be. The wording of the heading of this section is: &#x201C;Executive powers, authorities and functions to vest temporarily in Minister&#x201D;. The interesting thing about this section is that it refers to all &#x201C;such&#x201D; executive powers, etc. I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the word &#x201C;such&#x201D;. It seems to me that this reference is obviously to the previous section in the Act, section 70. It seems to me too that this provision deals with the transition period between this Government&#x2019;s handing over power and that power being assumed by the legislative assembly. It is intended to deal with any breakdown during that transition period. That is completely different from the sort of thing envisaged by the hon. gentlemen at the present time. What he is doing now is to remove the discretion from the council, from the executive and from the chairman to act or not to act. He is deciding whether or not they should act. [Interjections.] Even if they do not act the way he wants them to act, there is nothing he can do except <span class="col_3305-3306" refersTo="page_0066"/>by way of a subsequent veto. However, if they do not act then he can act for them. This is a totally different principle and my submission is that the Transkei Constitution Act is no example to be followed in any event and that this specific provision does not cover the circumstances which the hon. the Minister is trying to cover at the present time.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious, of course, what has been worrying the hon. the Minister. What has been worrying him has been the threat by one of the parties in the recent election for the CRC to close down that Council. The hon. the Minister did not say this; he skated around it and spoke about the present situation in politics among the Coloured people. He knows very well that that is what is at the back of his mind. I do not believe for one moment that he is dealing only with theoretical possibilities. He introduced this legislation on the very day that the election took place because he saw the way things were going and he panicked. Now he is trying to limit this debate to the best of his ability because he is trying to meet the charges that can be brought against him. I want to suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that if there is a failure to act, if there is an attempt to wreck the CRC, to close it down, then the correct sanction lies with the voters who elected the people who try to close down that CRC. If the attitude amongst these people is such that they are carrying out the wishes of the voters, then the hon. the Minister has got to face up to the fact that this is the end of the road for the Coloured Representative Council. He has got to face up to the fact that it has been rejected by the electorate and that there are people coming into power who, if his reading is correct, are not going to co-operate in respect of this matter.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Then, Sir, the system has failed and the hon. gentleman has to look to alternatives. Sir, I see no other reason for this measure, except that in the past the Minister was in the position that the executive co-operated, but he feared a hostile majority in the council. That is why he introduced the legislation in 1972. He could come here and say that he claimed support from the executive for what he was doing because they, too, feared a hostile majority in the council. But this time, Sir, he comes, without consultation with the present executive, without consultation with the people who are going to take over power in the Coloured Representative Council and he asks for these additional powers. The problem in the past, as you know, Sir, was that the chairman was nominated by the State President and still is&#x2014;he is not elected by the council&#x2014;and that the executive was elected by the council, but it could not be removed from office otherwise than by a two-thirds majority. That meant that if there was a changed majority in the council, unless it could get a two-thirds majority, it could not remove the executive from office, and you would then have an executive in office which did not have the confidence of the council. Sir, that is the position that the hon. the Minister was seeking to deal with in 1972. Now he is in the position that he may have a hostile executive and a hostile council. What is he going to do about that&#x003F; Sir, let us ask ourselves what the powers, the functions and the duties are which he is seeking to take over. Mr. Speaker, have you looked at them&#x003F; I wonder if hon. members know how wide those powers and functions are which he is seeking to take over under this Bill. He is seeking to take over all the powers of the executive, i.e. the management of finance and to authorize expenditure by warrant, and the duties of the chairman. Then he is seeking to take over all the functions of the executive, i.e. to exercise the functions of the council except the making of laws, when the council is not in session, and to deal with local government with education, with community welfare and pensions, with the rural areas and with other matters referred to them by the State President and to prepare the estimates of expenditure for submission to the Minister. Sir, he is taking over all the functions of the council except the legislative functions, that is, to serve as a link between the Government and the Coloured population, to acquire and dispose of property, to establish pension schemes for their servants. Imagine it, Sir, these are the functions which the hon. gentleman is seeking to take over. He is seeking in certain circumstances to become the chairman, with the full powers of the chairman; to become the executive, with the full powers of the executive, and to become the Coloured Representative Council itself, excepting only the power to legislate, and only he knows how limited <span class="col_3307-3308" refersTo="page_0067"/>that is because Bills introduced require his approval before they are introduced. Do you know, Sir, this is not self-determination for the Coloured people any more; this is a return to naked baasskap. That is what this means. It is a return to naked baasskap. Unless they do what he wants them to do, he is going to take over and he is going to run the whole business. But, Sir, it seems to me that the very fact that he introduces this legislation, acknowledges the complete breakdown and failure of the system. Sir, it is evidence of a lack of faith, probably a mutual lack of faith, lack of faith by him in the Coloured people and lack of faith by the Coloured people in him and his Government. And this, Sir, is the group which should be nearest to us in South Africa. But what is so interesting is that it is not just finance that is worrying this Minister. He protests in vain that it is just finance that worries him, because there is an alternative he could have adopted. You know, Sir, if a Provincial Council were to refuse to vote money and refuse to pay its servants or to pay out pensions and things of that kind, the Minister could apply for a special State President&#x2019;s warrant to take over the expenditure and apply to Parliament for approval in due course. That was put to the hon. the Minister in 1972. He did not deny that he had this power. He did not deny that it could be done; he just said it was an unsatisfactory method of doing it. Why&#x003F; I wonder what has caused this situation to arise, because I do not think that any of us accept that this Bill has been introduced for purely technical reasons. I think what has caused this to arise is that there is clear evidence that the Coloured people have totally rejected Government policy in so far as this Council is concerned. I think that is a disaster of the first magnitude and the extent of that disaster is shown by the majority in the election results. I do not believe this has been caused by internal conflicts or procedural difficulties alone, though heaven knows they have been frustrating enough. I believe that this is the culmination of the deterioration of relations between the Coloured community and the White people in South Africa, or rather between the Coloured people and this Government and not between the Coloured people and all the White people. The Coloured people who lie closest to our conscience have been disillusioned and have been alienated by this Government. Sir, you have ruled quite rightly that one cannot go into the whole history of this dispute, but I do believe that it is right that I should draw attention to the fact that this Coloured Representative Council as it exists today has had a most unfortunate history. One cannot help thinking back of the promise given by Dr. Verwoerd in the 1960s that the Coloured people within 10 years would have their own Prime Minister and would have control over their own affairs. It was never suggested that the Coloured Representative Council was to be in lieu of representation in this House. But, Sir, representation in this House was removed and this is no alternative and the Coloured people know it because no amount of amending, no amount of changes in the legislation by the Government, can put this situation right. I am afraid. Sir, that we have come to the end of the road of this policy and the Government has to answer to the country as to why it has failed.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I do not believe, as I have said, that it has failed because of prejudice. There were a lot of Coloured people who wanted to make this system work. There are a lot of Coloured people who still want to make the system work, but they have found themselves with a toothless tiger, and why&#x003F; Because in 1969 when one party had the biggest number of supporters in the council, the Government nominated defeated candidates and people in opposition so as to ensure that an opposition party, not having the majority in the council among the elected representatives, should rule the Coloured people, and the resentment and bitterness caused at that time is, I believe, the cause of the election results we have just had. You see, Sir, the system has cardinal weaknesses and the whole position of the council has been so frustrating. Motion after motion gets referred to the Cabinet. Either there are very long delays or very little happens. It is powerless to combat the most serious grievances which the Coloured people have concerning the Population Registration Act, concerning the Group Areas Act, concerning the shortage of housing, concerning the disparity in wages. It has no powers in those matters. Its Budget is presented&#x2014;and this is their complaint&#x2014;often without proper previous consultation. There are many other complaints. It was a Mr. Tom Swartz, nominated by the State President as chairman of the council, who circulated a memorandum of his complaints. It was not a Mr. Sonny Leon, Leader of the Labour Party Opposition. It was the <span class="col_3309-3310" refersTo="page_0068"/>Government&#x2019;s appointee who complained and gave reasons as to why it was that the council system was breaking down. The Government did nothing to defuse it. They have delayed too long in making the council wholly elected, amongst other things. Now, Sir, how are they going to make it work&#x003F; Are they going to make it work by the introduction of this amendment&#x003F; I wonder if the hon. the Minister really thinks that if he has lost the goodwill of the Coloured people to this extent, by introducing this amendment and taking these powers he is going to make this system work. Mr. Speaker, I wonder if he does not realize that if this system does not function, there is going to be a vacuum; and this amendment will not fill that vacuum. It will be filled&#x2014;because nature abhors a vacuum&#x2014; by other developments through which the Coloured people will seek to realize their hopes and their aspirations. But the danger exists that the methods they use may become unconstitutional through the frustrations that have arisen.</p>

<p>All my information is that the mood among the Coloured people is becoming ugly indeed and that they regard this whole business as nothing more than another example of discrimination on the grounds of the colour of their skin. We have stated our alternatives before. Our federal plan has been before the House. Quite rightly, Sir, it is not open for discussion at this time. But, Sir, it is an alternative, a very realistic alternative, one which we believe would work. But what alternatives are there within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x003F; If they persist in this unitary system, then I believe the only alternatives they have are to return to direct representation in this House or, alternatively&#x2014;and it is a bad alternative&#x2014;to nominate Coloureds to represent Coloureds as nominated Senators in the Senate for their knowledge of Coloured affairs.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think there are some obvious steps in regard to the council itself that the Government should take. I do not believe it is going to make this system work by further emasculating the council, because that is what this legislation is doing. I believe that they have a chance of getting co-operation if there is proper consultation and if meaningful powers are given to this council, and given to it rapidly. I believe they must expedite the date when it becomes completely elected. I believe they must introduce machinery to ensure that the executive is totally responsible to a majority in the council and not to a two-thirds majority. I believe the council must be given taxing powers. I believe there must be liaison with Parliament and not just with the Executive through a liaison or Cabinet Committee as indicated at the present time. I believe the situation is so serious that there should be a request for an immediate interim report from the Theron Commission. It is quite dear that the proposed Cabinet Committee has had little if any effect on the electorate and that it is not acceptable to them.</p>

<p>I wonder if the hon. the Minister has considered that the introduction of this Bill on the very day on which the election was taking place has been and will be seen as a deliberate act of provocation by this Government in respect of the Coloured people, a slap in the face for them. This <span class="col_3311-3312" refersTo="page_0069"/>is an act which can have the most serious repercussions, because the Coloured people are not an isolated group; they are very much, an integral part of our interlocking racial structure. What happens to them affects other groups in South Africa and the whole population of the country. This sort of thing could lead to a common rejection of the Government&#x2019;s race policies. There is already trouble with the urban Bantu. The homeland leaders do not want to take independence. If they make common cause it will be this Minister who will have created not a local squall but a gale that can storm all over the country.</p>

<p>I have pleaded before in this House for a new deal for the Coloured people which would make this sort of legislation unnecessary. I pleaded that in order to obtain their trust and confidence it was essential not to make dispositions for them, but to make dispositions with them. Secondly, I said that it would not be accepted that discrimination based on the assumption of inherent and persistent inequalities based on racial differences were acceptable. I warned before that an election held on the basis on which the last election was held, would solve absolutely nothing at all, and that because of its inherent weaknesses the council would remain unworkable and unacceptable I believe only unequivocal acceptance by the Government that social and economic discrimination must be removed, and a new dispensation, would give us an opportunity of having harmonious relations.</p>

<p>What can the Government do&#x003F; I have asked the question before. The Government has alternative constitutional methods. But in practical terms, what should it do in respect of this Bill&#x003F; I believe the statesmanlike thing, the right thing, would be for the Minister to agree to the adjournment of this debate for him to consult with the majority party which is going to take over power in the CRC. I believe that would be the statesmanlike thing to do and I feel sure that if that were done, despite the election propaganda, a compromise and understanding could be reached which could result in the more harmonious functioning of this piece of constitutional machinery, however bad it is. I believe that the Government should accept that in making its nominations under the Act&#x2014;it has the power to make 20 nominations&#x2014;it should have regard to the will of the electorate and not do what it did last time, namely to nominate entirely opposition members in the council. The hon. the Minister nods his head and I hope that means that there is agreement in this regard. I believe that if this debate were adjourned and if it could stand over for discussion to take place, an accommodation could be reached and that an assurance could be obtained that efforts would be made by the majority party to make this system work even if it is used as a platform to try to advance claims of another kind. I am in a stronger position than the hon. the Minister because I have consulted and have talked to the gentlemen concerned. I have talked to them quite considerably and I believe that what I am suggesting and asking is something which is well worth exploration. I warned once before that we, at the present time, may be dealing with the last generation of negotiators amongst the Coloured people in South Africa. The younger people do not think any more as some of the older people do, those in our age group. They do not want to negotiate. We may be dealing with the last generation of negotiators. Time is not on the Government&#x2019;s side and time is not on the side of the White people in South Africa. I wonder if the hon. the Minister has considered, before he introduced this legislation, what the effect of this Bill is going to be on the outside world. Has he considered what effect it will have on the people of the Western world who are supporting South Africa&#x003F; I wonder if he realized how those people react to a Government which tells a people that while it gives them certain powers, if those powers are not exercised and if the people do not do what the Government thinks they ought to be doing, the Government will resume control and take over the whole system itself. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister has considered what effect this could have on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attempts to achieve detente in Southern Africa. Has the hon. the Minister realized what an amendment of this kind, a resumption of power, a return to naked baasskap, could mean outside South Africa&#x003F; I think the hon. the Minister knows that nothing short of full citizenship, on one basis or another, is going to satisfy the Coloured people. I think he must also realize that this Bill is the final manifestation of the breakdown of Government policy and the clearest indication that Government policy cannot accommodate the legitimate aspirations and hopes of the Coloured people. I feel that if the hon. the Minister is not prepared to consider the possibility of adjourning this <span class="col_3313-3314" refersTo="page_0070"/>debate, there is only one amendment I can move, and that is&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a long time since I have heard a leader of a party talking so much political nonsense as the Leader of the Opposition talked here this afternoon. At the end of his speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition intimated that he was in consultation with the leaders of the Labour Party, the majority party after the recent CRC election. He intimated that he now knew exactly what was going on there. The result of the CRC election that has just been held is that the Labour Party has won an outright majority, not only in regard to elected members, but also in regard to the overall membership of the CRC.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. F. TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>There is nothing in that election to console either the United Party, or him as its leader. I shall tell him why. On more than one occasion, if I can believe my ears, the leader of the Labour Party has stated that he regards himself and his party as the true opposition in South Africa. In other words, he does differ with the Government as regards his policy, but he definitely holds the gentlemen in the parties opposite in the greatest contempt. Consequently there is nothing in the outcome of this election to console hon. members opposite. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked why the hon. the Minister&#x2014;in the light of the experience to which he referred&#x2014; came up with this legislation, and he even asked this question quite seriously. This is the question of a true Rip van Winkle, because anyone who has watched the developments in the CRC over the past few years knows exactly why the hon. the Minister has come up with this legislation. It is the Government, and specifically of the Minister to whom this portfolio has been entrusted, to provide for all circumstances and for all possible events by means of legislation. Since the CRC plays a very important role in regard to the administration of the Coloured population it is the Minister&#x2019;s duty and responsibility to ensure that the necessary statutory powers exist to ensure that that administration does not collapse. Now it is pointless to come and tell us today that this is an inferior body. The fact remains that the CRC already fulfils a very important function and that this Council has already been built up into a body which occupies an important place in our domestic affairs, particularly as far as the Coloured population is concerned. It is pointless to demolish the CRC because it already exists. If the leaders of the party with the greatest number of elected representatives in that Council say from time to time that they are going to destroy that Council, that they are going to break it down, that they are going to prevent it from carrying out its functions, or when they boycott the opening ceremony of that House&#x2014;in spite of the fact that prominent people perform that ceremony&#x2014;and when they boycott important decisions and debates in the House, the question whether these people intend to continue with that attitude still remains. For that reason, responsible Coloured leaders have placed a question mark over the whole situation, because they know what they have been doing, the responsibilities they have already carried and the duties they have already had to perform. They simply could not see the interests of the Coloured population being properly served in that way. The hon. the Minister and the Government, would be failing in their duty if, in these circumstances, they failed to spot those problems, take cognizance of them and, with the aid of his legal advisers, make provision for them.</p>

If hon. members read the newspapers, they will have seen that it was the English Press itself which intimated that there had been a change of attitude among the leaders of the Labour Party. It has been said this weekend that there is a new approach and now they are intimating that it seems as if these people are not going to <span class="col_3315-3316" refersTo="page_0071"/>adopt the course which we had foreseen they would and which certain people tried to talk them into. Part of the problem is that there are certain people, certain bodies, certain members on that side of the House and certain newspapers that have tried to talk these people into the destruction of the CRC. [Interjections.] The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said this during the First Reading and the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party said it. Since the hon. member has repeated it two or three times today, I want to say that they are in fact disappointed because they did not succeed in talking these people into continuing to take the line that they would destroy the CRC.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to reply to a question. Consequently I want to tell hon. members opposite that their assumptions are incorrect. Let us take a brief look at the outcome of the recent election. It will interest hon. members to know what the percentage poll was in the Cape Peninsula where the majority of Coloureds are living. The people here are close to the polling booths, read the newspapers and are well-informed. In fact, they are probably the most informed group, together with the Coloured groups in Port Elizabeth, Durban, etc. In Tafelberg the percentage poll was 26,7%, in Strandfontein it was 18.48%, in Liesbeek 12%, in Heideveld 20,5% and in Kasselsvlei 31%.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is one answer. Another answer is perhaps that they say they do not like the CRC. [Interjections.] After the Coloureds, in these times of political awareness, have been urged and led for months to come and, particularly by means of an emotional cry from which the anti-White feeling among the Labour Party was not entirely lacking, the percentage polls were only 26%, 18%, 12%, 20%, etc. That is why I want to say that the Leaders of the Labour Party did not succeed in instilling in the people their idea of confrontation. I want to add that that result tells me that many responsible Coloureds in the Western Province and throughout the country said: &#x201C;Politics is important but it is not as important to us as it is to the United Party and the Progressive Party who need our votes.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If only such a small percentage of people vote in the Cape Peninsula, then this tells me something else. These people are telling us in this way that there are other needs which are even more important to them than an election. The things that weigh heavily upon them every day are, for example, the elementary requirements of education opportunities, schools for their children, proper housing, floodwater drainage for their streets, etc. I am not saying that the overall attitudes of the Coloured population are shortly going to swing in favour of the Federal Party or some other party. As a population group the Coloureds are fully entitled to establish their parties. What is more, their Council has been established on a democratic basis. Therefore the various parties will win and lose elections as the Coloured population may decide at the polling booths. However what we and the leaders of the Labour Party too, must bear in mind&#x2014;and they realize this because their attitude shows it&#x2014;is that they are now in a position in which they will achieve absolutely nothing by means of negative action, a boycott or destructive action. That is why the leader of the Labour Party is now prepared to say that his confrontation means something else. He is now telling the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Progressive Party: &#x201C;You understood me incorrectly. You told the world that I was aiming at violent confrontation. To me, confrontation means dialogue with the Government.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Surely hon. members know that legislation introduced in Parliament on a specific day has not been prepared that same morning. I think the Executive advised the hon. the Minister that they were going to lose the election. I take it that as responsible people, they could have advised that. If they had advised that and said that the leaders of the Labour Party had a negative attitude and would therefore try to create a dispensation in which chaos would prevail and which would render it impossible to continue with the administration, then it was the duty of the Government to make the necessary provision for this eventuality. If the leaders of the Labour Party were now to say: &#x201C;We are prepared to sit around a table and we are prepared to discuss matters in a responsible way,&#x201D; then we should welcome it. That is nothing new and Mr. Leon need not ask that nor claim it. The hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister have repeatedly offered that. The Coloured leaders have been invited repeatedly and have, on one occasion, attended talks, if I am not mistaken. However, in the past year there were many more occasions than the single one at which they spoke. I can say without fear of contradiction that the doors of the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister will be open for them to come and discuss their problems.</p>

<p>However, what the Leader of the Opposition is trying to make us believe about this situation, does not exist. The hon. the Minister did not introduce this legislation because he realized which way the wind was blowing on election day. Any statement of that kind is political nonsense. The hon. member is a responsible person who ought to know that this legislation was prepared weeks or even months ago. It was introduced on that day so that it could not have an effect on the election and so as not to antagonize the people in advance. Hon. members who know something about the working of Parliament ought to know that that is so. For this reason I want to tell the hon. members that their prophecies and their attitude are absolutely hollow. What they have predicted, does not happen. I think that it is a matter of concern to them today to have this debate continue because the Coloured leaders&#x2014;and the leaders of the Labour Party, too&#x2014;are now telling us: &#x201C;We realize that we have now had an election and that we have won, but we, too, have responsibilities to carry out.&#x201D; They are looking forward to it and the Leader of the Labour Party has said that he demands to be nominated as the chairman of the Executive.</p>

<block name="quote">As elected leader of the Coloured community it is only right that he should be appointed chairman of the Executive of the CRC, Mr. Leon said. His party is to request an interview with the Prime Minister, Mr. B. J. Vorster, to discuss the future of his people and to demand that he, as the elected leader, be appointed chairman of the Executive.</block>

<p><span class="col_3319-3320" refersTo="page_0073"/>In my opinion, Mr. Leon has every right to ask that. It is not for me to say what the hon. the Minister or the hon. the Prime Minister or the Government is going to do, but in my opinion Mr. Leon has every right to ask that. But the disappointment for that side of the House lies in the fact that Mr. Leon now states that he is prepared to serve as chairman of the Executive, whereas they were triumphantly saying, &#x201C;We have reached the end of the road.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party said that, and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition repeated it. They were looking forward to it, and now Mr. Leon of the Labour Party asks the Government to appoint him as chairman of the Executive. In other words he is saying: &#x201C;Here I am; I have won the election. Forget about the propaganda I employed; it was a political election. I used those things which were to my benefit and I won, but now I am prepared to serve.&#x201D; Sir, that is where we stand. But even though the leader of the Labour Party is now entirely willing to accept his responsibility&#x2014;and we welcome that&#x2014;then I still say that since the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s legal advisers have told him that there is a deficiency in the Act, in that there are no statutory powers providing for the introduction and implementation of a budget if such a situation were to arise, it is his responsibility to ensure that that statutory basis should exist at all times, whatever may happen and whenever it may happen. I say that that is entirely correct. Sir, whereas hon. members opposite have been making such an attempt to play politics with this situation, I want to tell them a few things: I find it very striking that these days the attitude of hon. members opposite has been very negative and that they actually wanted a collapse of the Coloured Persons Representative Council. When I look back, and when I look into the future, then I see that that party&#x2019;s policy makes no contribution towards really putting the Coloured population on its own two feet. I want to put this question to them: what is their objection to the principle forming part of the policy of the National Party, that the Coloured population should be put in a position to govern itself&#x003F;</p>

<p>The entire group areas pattern also provides for this; that will be the result of this. It is a pattern that is developing to an increasing extent, and we therefore foresee that whether it be the Labour Party that is governing or whether it be the Federal Party in power in the CRC, the Coloureds will accept their responsibility to an increasing extent. I have already indicated this to you, Sir, on the basis of the evidence of the leaders of the Labour Party. If we are to tell them anything, then it is not, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition states, that the CRC and this dispensation has collapsed and that this is the end of the road. On the contrary. Then we must convey another message to them. Then we must tell them: We accept your right to put in power whichever party you may elect. But what is more, we must tell them that they must not only practise politics, that that is not the only facet of life, but that it is also their responsibility to look at the questions and the problems of the Coloured population and to solve them themselves. Sir, let us just take a look at this one cardinal question, the question of a too rapid population increase among the Coloureds. This affects the entire infrastructure. It affects education, because schools have to be provided for those people. It affects the provision of housing, and all those things. Within 15 years&#x2014;that is the lifetime of a generation in the Coloured population&#x2014; the 15-year old is already beginning to multiply. After all, we know this. This is a problem for the Coloured population if they want to uplift the standard of living of their people. Then they must say: Let us discuss this and let us work towards family planning and a decent standard of living; let us assist our people in overcoming these things. I say that these are basic matters and if we start there, then as far as education is concerned, we shall have fewer schools, having to work two shifts per day, and in some schools, as much as three shifts.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat, tried to score a few petty political points from the remarks made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, but added nothing significant himself to the many unconvincing introductory arguments advanced by the hon. the Minister. The hon. member, as well as the hon. the Minister, said that we have here an administration which they presume will collapse or come to a standstill one of these days, but there is no question of their reconsidering or reviewing that system. Their solution for this problem is simply that the White Government should take over that system. He also referred to the low percentage of Coloured persons who had voted in the Cape, especially in the urban areas of Cape Town&#x2014;approximately 20% or even less. He said a likely reason for this was that these people are not politically aware. Sir, it is precisely because they are politically aware that they will have nothing to do with a system which brands them as second-rate citizens. They will have nothing to do with such a system and the CRC is the embodiment of that stamp which has been placed on them. [Interjections.] The hon. member said the Leader of the Opposition was talking nonsense when he said that because this legislation was introduced on the day of the election, the Government knew beforehand what the result of the election was going to be. He says this is nonsense. I just want to say to the hon. member that to introduce this legislation on that day was not political nonsense, but political fraud towards the Coloured voters of the Cape, because while they were voting, the constitution of that council was changed behind their backs by the White Parliament. Therefore, this legislation, even if amendments were to be effected later on, is still not acceptable to us in these benches.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The amendment referred to by the Minister has made it less bad, because it has limited the area of control of the Minister. The Bill is nevertheless unacceptable. <span class="col_3323-3324" refersTo="page_0075"/>The whole problem arises from the inability or the unwillingness of this Government to face up to the failure of their policy. Hon. members opposite keep on stressing administrative problems, and saying that the administrative situation might fall apart. But it is not an administrative problem. This is the result of a political problem. It is the result of the hon. members on the other side of the House trying to force a policy upon the Coloured people which they have rejected. They have rejected it in an open election which was conducted on the terms stated by the Government. Now the Government, instead of accepting the verdict of the election conducted in terms of Government policy, is running away from the verdict of the Coloured people. It is not a question of an administrative problem. The issue at the moment is a political failure. This Bill must be seen not as an administrative measure, but as a political measure flowing from the failure of Government policy.</p>

<p>We in these benches opposed the introduction of this Bill last week. Our suspicion at that stage were that this was going to be a thoroughly bad Bill Having seen the Bill, let me say to the hon. the Minister that our worst suspicions have been confirmed, for the Bill, if anything, is worse than its original introductory title would indicate. I believe that the Bill, to say the least, is cynical for what it does and for the occasion on which it was introduced. It is dictatorial. But what is perhaps more important at this stage, it reflects a complete insensitivity towards the attitudes and feelings of the Coloured people who voted in the election. The only aspect which the hon. the Minister left vague in giving notice of the Bill, and which may have, subject to some further information contained in the Bill, been a partially redeeming feature, was that the original motion to introduce referred to the taking over of power &#x201C;in certain circumstances&#x201D;. We now find that these &#x201C;certain circumstances&#x201D; relate to powers which the hon. the Minister will decide whether he should take over. It will be his own decision and in his own discretion that he will decide whether he will exercise these tremendous powers. The hon. Minister of Indian Affairs and of Tourism said that there might be some reason of which we are not aware. This reason has not become apparent now that we have the full text of the Bill. When the Coloured people refuse to make the system operate, this hon. Minister will still take over the system and ram it down their throats. That is what this Bill is about. If there is a failure on their part to operate the system, the White Parliament will take over. The hon. the Minister is now in the position that he will become the sole administering authority over the lives of 2&#x00BC; million Coloured people, and he is going to be the sole arbiter or judge as to whether he should assume these powers. It is in his discretion to do so if, for whatever reasons, they have failed to exercise these duties.</p>

<p>Both in introducing this Bill and during the short debate of last week, reference was made on the Government side to the fact that it was necessary to keep certain services running. In this connection I can only refer to section 22, subsections (2) and (2A). Not only is provision made for money which has been appropriated to continue to be administered, but there is also provision in subsection (2A) for any service which had been included in a previous Budget to continue to operate under the edict of the Minister. So he already has the power to continue to operate services where there was provision for such service in any previous Budget or appropriation. He therefore has adequate powers, and indeed more than adequate powers, to deal with an immediate administrative problem which might arise. The hon. the Minister shakes his head. He knows that his problem is not an administrative one. He knows that his problem is the collapse of a system. It is the collapse of the CRC as an instrument of Government fashioned by the National Party and the Government.</p>

<p>Before continuing with the details of this Bill, I must refer very briefly to the debate of the other day and in particular to a comment which was made by the hon. member for Durban Point who indicated that the Progressive Party and others who opposed the introduction of this Bill had by their opposition forfeited their right to speak at the Second Reading. In view of the statement by that hon. member I think that it is necessary to record that there is a long list of Bills&#x2014;some 12 of them&#x2014;dating back to 1958 until 1968, all of which were opposed by the hon. member&#x2019;s party at the First Reading and in all of which the hon. members on that side of the House participated at Second Reading. In particular, in the case of the Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act of 1968, which was opposed at First Reading, of 12 speakers who spoke for the United Party, one of <span class="col_3325-3326" refersTo="page_0076"/>them was the hon. member for Durban Point himself.</p>

<p>Apart from this Bill being a thoroughly bad piece of legislation, it is, if passed, in our opinion going to do tremendous harm to the already strained relations which exist between the Coloured and the White communities. What is more, at a time when the Western world and many states in Africa are looking hopefully and even expectantly for some signs that the Government is going to implement its commitment to get rid of race discrimination, for those people who have listened to Mr. Pik Botha or to the hon. the Prime Minister, it will be a shattering disappointment that a Bill of this type should have been introduced. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was correct. It is undoubtedly going to embarrass our friends in the Western world; it is undoubtedly going to play into the hands of the enemies of South Africa and I believe it could do serious damage to the whole d&#x00E9;tente operation in which our Government is at present engaged. I believe it is ironic that on the very day that this Bill was introduced, the hon. member for Pretoria Central was telling the Juridicial Union of Stellenbosch University that certain important sections in relation to the Lusaka Manifesto, previously rejected by the Government, were now becoming acceptable to the Nationalist Party. On that very day he was reading out extracts of that manifesto which relate closely to this Bill and he said the following: &#x201C;We, the National Party, believe with the Lusaka Manifesto that all men have the right and duty to participate as equal members in the society and in their own Government. We do not accept that any individual or group has the right to govern over any other group of sane adults without their consent&#x201D;. On the same day that the hon. member made that statement, this hon. Minister was introducing a Bill into this House where a single individual of one race group, in terms of the Government&#x2019;s race categories, was going to take over the administration and the government of two and a quarter million people in South Africa. This Bill is in essence a discriminatory piece of legislation. It is no use talking about removing discrimination in the peripheral fields. What we and this Government must do is to remove discrimination in the important fields, namely the administration of government in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite clear that whether the Government had advance notice of the possible outcome of the CRC election, the Government was clearly anticipating that the result of that election could well be that the CRC, or the executive of that council, or the chairman of its executive, would cease to function effectively. It must have anticipated this, for if it did not anticipate it, there could be no reason for having introduced this Bill. The fact is that it introduced this Bill while voting was taking place and so it must have realized that the Federal Party, which had been ruling for the past four years with the help of 20 members nominated by the Government, were going to lose that election. Secondly, and what is perhaps more important, the Government must have interpreted the anticipated result of the election as a vote of no-confidence by the Coloured people in the CRC. It must have sensed that this was what the election was about. Hon. members on the other side realized that the key issue in that election was whether the CRC should be considered as an effective means of providing the Coloured people with political expression or not. I believe the onus was on the Government to consult with the chairman and with the executive of the CRC prior to taking any steps to legislate in matters affecting that council. The Minister has not replied in specific terms to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to indicate whether he did get that advice and whether it was the advice of the executive committee of the CRC that apartheid was going to be condemned by the Coloured people on 19 March and that the CRC was going to be rejected by the Coloured people or not. When one takes into account the very small number of votes cast for the Federal Party, which was the only party at that stage openly supporting the system of separate representation and separate political institutions, in spite of the fact that in recent years it has come out against race discrimination, when one realizes that the Federal Party obtained less than 16% of the votes, when one realizes the very few votes it obtained <span class="col_3327-3328" refersTo="page_0077"/>in the important Cape urban areas, when one realizes what a large number of voters stayed away from the polls in the areas of relatively high sophistication as far as the Coloured people are concerned, one is forced to realize that the election on the 19th of this month was a massive indictment of the Government&#x2019;s policy. It was a rejection of the policy of apartheid as applied by this Government and it was a vote specifically directed against the continuation of the CRC. Whatever this Government may think of the CRC, I believe that the Coloured people themselves see the CRC as a symbol of their rejection by the White man in South Africa. They see it was a symbol of the second-class citizenship which the Government confers on them. Whether the Government likes it or not, they see that institution as a symbol of the baasskap which is implicit in the political system which the Government is attempting to force on the Coloured people. This is how they see the CRC. This is what the election was all about. It was a rejection of separate development, or parallel development as the Government would call it, it was a rejection of the baasskap which is inherent in the system which has been applied over the years. One can look at the manifestoes of Labour Party candidates. It was not, as the hon. member for Piketberg suggested, a campaign of people saying that the voting should be anti-White. It was a campaign of people saying that the voting should be anti-apartheid. I think the hon. member should realize that there is a vast difference between being anti-White and being antiapartheid. I would hope that there are many Whites who are anti-apartheid without turning against their own community. I have before me the manifesto of a successful candidate, Mr. Adams, issued in the Kasselsvlei constituency. The key points he made in his manifesto are the following:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) That all South Africans have an equal and rightful share in all councils of the land;</li>

<li>(b) That all persons be regarded as full citizens with the immediate removal of barriers stopping advancement.</li>

<p>Let us get rid of anything which denies the dignity of the individual South African. The manifesto continues as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(c) The systematic abolition of the CRC and the introduction of one Parliament for all the people of the Republic.</li>

</ol>

<p>This is the manifesto of the candidate who defeated the acting chairman of the executive of the CRC. This is the trend, this is the attitude and this is the way the Coloured people voted. They were not voting for a lot of highly complicated political formulae amongst various parties. They were voting for and against apartheid. They were voting for first-class citizenship for themselves and for the other people of the Black communities of South Africa. What has been demonstrated already in the short introduction we have had to this debate, is that this Government seems to be unable to understand the needs of the Coloured people even at this time. They still talk of administrative failures. Does the Minister not realize that there has been a total rejection of apartheid by the Coloured people in this election&#x003F; Does he not realize that they do not want the CRC to be built up and strengthened&#x003F; On this point I disagree with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. They want the CRC to be phased out. They do not want to improve the CRC so that it can apply apartheid on them with greater comfort. They want the CRC to be phased out so that they can be recognized as full citizens of the country in which they live and to which they belong. This Bill which is before the House is a negation of the very essence of the parliamentary or representative system of government, because it tells the Coloured people that they will either accept our terms of governing themselves or we will govern over them. They must accept our terms or nothing at all. This is a repudiation of the undertakings which were given by the leaders of the National Party, that more and more rights were going to be given to the Coloured people, because implicit in this Bill is the taking away rather than the extension of political rights. This Bill says that if &#x201C;the chairman of the executive, the executive or the council fails, for whatever reason, to exercise&#x201D; their powers, the Minister may exercise those powers. I must abide by the ruling from the Chair that one cannot go into the history of the Coloured representation in this House; so I shall confine myself to the history of Coloured representation <span class="col_3329-3330" refersTo="page_0078"/>in the CRC&#x2014;with which this Bill is dealing and on which the last Coloured Council election was fought. When one looks at the history of the political rights of the Coloureds or the taking away of these rights since this council was first introduced, one finds that every step that has been taken by this Government&#x2014;no matter what the motive of the Minister might have been, no matter what the well intended motive of the ex-Chief Whip might have been&#x2014;was in defiance of the wishes of the Coloured people. Almost every step that they took was in defiance of the wishes of the Coloured people, and this was bitterly resented by the Coloured people because it did not express their desires, their wishes or their views. Almost every step which was taken resulted in more resentment, more frustration and more alienation&#x2014;not just between the Government and the Coloured people, but also between the Coloured people and the wider White community. When this council was first constituted prior to 1969, at the time of the first election, we had a Coloured council with extremely limited powers operating under the supervision and control of an all-White Parliament. At the very first election of that Coloured council the party with a minority of seats&#x2014;though on the aggragate it drew the majority of votes&#x2014;was assisted in governing by the appointment of 13 out of the 20 candidates who were rejected at that election. The Government could have found other candidates and other people, but they actually went to the defeated candidates and even made one of these defeated candidates the chairman of the executive.</p>

<p>Well, then I can only go back to the position the hon. the Minister dealt with and that is that in 1972 the Government came to this House to amend the Act in order to provide for certain powers to appropriate money and to dissolve the council without the council itself requesting it. Each one of the acts of the Government over the past few years in relation to the CRC has added to the growing alienation between the Coloured people and the White community. What is being done in this Bill is in direct conflict with what the Prime Minister said would happen. The Prime Minister has said: &#x201C;The entire Parliament can take pride that now for the first time in history substantial powers have in fact been conferred on the Coloureds.&#x201D; In the motion of censure in 1970, the hon. the Prime Minister said that the Coloureds appreciated that institution and the powers that they had received, that they would appreciate the powers and the privileges they had been granted. If one looks at the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speeches or at the speeches of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Relations, one finds the announcement time and time again that the Coloured people are happy and are starting to accept the system. So, I can well understand the shock to this Government when it dawned on them a few weeks before the election that the Coloured people did not like the system, that they rejected apartheid and the CRC as an instrument of their political rights.</p>

<p>The question is: Where do we go from here&#x003F; Where does this Government go from here&#x003F; Are they prepared to review their policy&#x003F; Are they prepared to re-examine the whole question of the CRC&#x003F; Are they prepared to say that although they have meant well, they have made a mistake&#x003F; Are they prepared to say that they will accept the &#x201C;volkswil&#x201D; of the Coloured people as far as their own institutions are concerned&#x003F; What the Government is saying with this measure is: &#x201C;If you do not accept the council on the terms that we dictate to you, we are going to take it over and run it ourselves.&#x201D; It is not saying that it is prepared to review the situation; it is saying: &#x201C;If you are not prepared to accept apartheid on our terms, we shall impose it on you; if you are not prepared to help us make the CRC work, we shall make it work for you.&#x201D; I believe that the philosophy of &#x201C;what we shall do to you&#x201D; is quite untenable in South Africa in 1975. It is this philosophy that is going to lead South Africa to conflict. What we want is a philosophy of reconciliation and negotiation and not one of strong-arm and dictatorial methods to force underprivileged communities to accept the dictates <span class="col_3331-3332" refersTo="page_0079"/>of this Government. I believe that at this moment in time it is important for all of us not to underestimate the importance of the decision of the Coloured people in South Africa last Wednesday. I believe that that decision was a momentous one with far-reaching implications for all race communities in South Africa. I believe that this Government and, with it, White South Africa, must crash through the emotional race barrier which it has erected in front of itself and accept the immutable fact that, in the absence of viable homelands where the Coloureds could, if they so wished, exercise the rights of self-determination and full citizenship, there is only one alternative and that is that they must share sovereignty and citizenship as they share the country with us.</p>

<p>That means direct representation in the sovereign Parliament which rules over the shared South Africa. It means representation in whatever sovereign Parliament there is on the same basis as Whites and on the same basis as any other citizens who have common citizenship in a shared South Africa. We are not arguing that the road towards that goal will be short or that there will be no difficulties, but I believe that, instead of introducing dictatorial, negative, conflict-orientated measures such as the hon. the Minister has introduced today, the Government should take a first small step in the other direction. Let it admit that it is wrong and that it does not have a moral, philosophical, ethical or realistic basis on which to build the future in respect of the political rights of the Coloured people. The Government should take the first step towards saying: &#x201C;In the absence of an alternative, we will face up to full citizenship and to the sharing of power between all the people who live in the shared South Africa.&#x201D; I hope the hon. the Prime Minister will take the first step, which should be a frank, man-to-man meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr. Sonny Leon, the elected majority leader in the CRC.</p>

I believe it should be a frank man-to-man meeting between people who have an equal stake in and an equal concern for the future of South Africa. Secondly, I believe the hon. the Prime Minister should say without any further delay that he accepts the verdict of the Coloured people. I believe he should say he accepts the verdict of the Coloured people. Whatever his views might be in regard to what is good for the Coloured people, he should accept the fact that the Coloured people have without any equivocation rejected his system and rejected the CRC. He must say that he is prepared to reconsider, to re-examine and, if necessary, to scrap this system in order to try to find common ground between himself and the Coloured people.</p>

<p>Finally, as a result of the election on the 19th of this month, I believe that the hon. the Prime Minister must abandon his commitment to a Whites only sovereign Parliament for the shared parts of South Africa. I believe he must abandon this commitment because it does not make sense. It does not make sense to say that we believe in a Whites only sovereign Parliament when its subjects are Black and Brown and White. For a shared South Africa he must abandon the concept of a Whites only Parliament. When he negotiates with the Coloured people, he must say what the executive council of the Nationalist Party said in South West Africa: We will go to the negotiating table and be prepared to explore all alternatives. We are not going to the negotiating table with an irrevocable commitment to any aspects of our policy. The hon. member for Yeoville and myself questioned the hon. the Prime Minister last year on what his attitude would be should the Theron Commission recommend a shared Parliament in South Africa, but the hon. the Prime Minister ran away from the question. The hon. the Prime Minister hid behind the Theron Commission and said that it was National Party policy at that moment to have a sovereign White Parliament. That policy was made by the Nationalist Party congress. I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister to say that in in the special circumstances he is prepared to go to his congress and to give it a lead. He should say to them that, whatever the past has been, as far as the future is concerned we are going to work and negotiate together, Black, White and Brown people, for a common and a shared Parliament in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can understand that the hon. member for Sea Point must be a very disappointed man. That is why he has gone searching around in the past and why he has been a prophet of doom this afternoon. On 18 October the hon. member said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since then the CRC has virtually ceased to exist.</block>

<p>That was on 18 October last year. Since then we have had a session of the CRC and we have just had an election of this same Council. Consequently this Council still exists. Now that hon. member comes here this afternoon and poses as an authority on politics. He tells us that he knows why the Coloureds did not vote for this Council. He maintains that they did not vote for this Council because it was supposedly a second-rate body. Does he want to maintain that the Coloureds who did vote for this Council are inferior&#x003F; Does he want to maintain that they voted for this Council although it was a second-rate body&#x003F; Does he want to maintain that those people who stood as candidates for election to this Council, stood for election to a second-rate body&#x003F; Is this not a charge he is making against the Coloureds this afternoon&#x003F; Is he not saying these things to the discredit of these people&#x003F; The hon. member went further and accused us of political fraud. That hon. member must kindly refrain from judging us by his standards.</p>

<p>I want to contend this afternoon that many Coloureds did not vote in the recent election because they were more concerned about their unfavourable socio-economic conditions, conditions which we are continually attending to and which we shall eliminate. The hon. member also said that this legislation was not an administrative measure, but a political measure. Does the hon. member not want to remove his political spectacles for once in his life so that he, too, may see things clearly, as they are and in their correct perspective&#x003F; The hon. member levelled the accusation that the hon. the Minister was now going to take over. Where in this legislation did he read that&#x003F; Where in the policy of this party did the hon. member read that the hon. the Minister is going to take over, that the hon. the Minister is now going to govern 2&#x00BC; million Coloureds&#x003F; The hon. member went further. He levelled the scandalous accusation that we on this side of the House are depriving people of rights. I want to tell the hon. member that what the hon. the Prime Minister said during the no-confidence debate in this House, will be carried out. He will honour his undertaking and this side of the House will carry it out. The Bill before this House alters nothing whatsoever in the speech by the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants to know where we are going. We have a definite course that we are following. That course has often been stated. While following that course we shall make the necessary adjustments and <span class="col_3335-3336" refersTo="page_0081"/>we shall follow that course together. I, in turn, should like to ask the hon. member where he is going. I can very well understand that hon. members opposite say that we have come to the end of the road, because that is what the United Party and the other parties on that side would very much like to have occur. But I want to tell them that the CRC will still be there and we shall still be following this course long after the United Party&#x2014;let alone the Progressive Party&#x2014;has gone to its grave.</p>

We do not want to interfere in the activities of the CRC; we do not want to interfere in the politics of the Coloureds, but if a Government is worth its salt&#x2014; and this Government wants to be that&#x2014;then it has to ensure that there will be progress, and in particular, continuation of essential services. Sir, those essential services must be provided in respect of 2&#x00BC; million people and this Government will not allow chaos to develop in South Africa. That is why what we have here is purely an administrative measure which does not give the hon. the Minister any other power. This Bill does not make the Minister the leader of the CRC.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>I am not afraid, but I shall tell the hon. member what could happen and that is what we are afraid of. Sir, on 31 March 1974, more than 20 000 teachers were employed at schools for Coloured children. What would happen if there were an administrative strike, if things were to go wrong on the administrative level and if these people did not receive their salaries&#x003F; Would that hon. member be satisfied to work without a salary for three or four months&#x003F; What about all the appointments and the recommendations that have to be made in those schools&#x003F; It is the duty of this Government, as far as the education and training of children is concerned, to see to it that that work will continue. Sir, we have come up with this Bill because what is at issue here is the interests of over 600 000 Coloured schoolchildren. We cannot allow these schools to be closed for a time; this could happen, and that is why this sound measure is being adopted in the interests of the Coloured school children. It is the right of this Government to ensure that Coloured education will continue. Sir, take the field of social welfare and pensions. During the financial year ended 31 July 1974 there were 108 000 Coloureds who were receiving pensions; these included old age pensions, pensions for the blind, pensions for war veterans and the disability grant. During that financial year R27&#x00BD; million was paid out to these people. Do hon. members opposite, who are so concerned about pensions when the Budget of the Central Government, the Railway Budget and the Post Office Budget are before the House, want these 108 000 pensioners not to receive their pensions for three or, four months&#x003F; Do they realize What terrible chaos would ensue and the extreme distress these people would be caused&#x003F; Sir, this party and this Government stand for order. It is at the helm of affairs and it has to ensure that order is maintained in South Africa. We shall not allow administrative disorder, which could have serious consequences, to develop. It is the duty of this Government to do so. Sir, this Bill is essential because it concerns the interests and the welfare of people. Hon. members opposite are so vociferous about human rights, and when people are involved in this way, then they say that we are committing political fraud. Sir, are we committing political fraud when we ensure that the necessary administrative steps are taken in the interests of people&#x003F; Is that political fraud&#x003F; No, we are here to assist people and to ensure that their continued survival is assured. The hon. members clutch at the time of introduction of the Bill and accuse us of supposedly having committed political fraud. How can one commit political fraud on the day of the election if one introduces a measure at 2 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon&#x003F; Most of those people had already been to the polling booths and others were at their places of employment. A report of this nature does not get to all the voters <span class="col_3337-3338" refersTo="page_0082"/>so quickly. This was done precisely because we did not want to influence the parties, precisely because we did not want to influence the voters. [Interjections.] If this had been done a week or two before the time, then it would have had an impact. If we had done it subsequently, hon. members could have said that we were doing it to prejudice a party. But on election day&#x003F; No, I do not believe that argument, nor do I believe that the Labour Party or the Federal Party will agree with hon. members. A political party that is strong and worth its salt is not so easily influenced. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It has been contended that we have come to the end of the road. We have not come to the end of the road or to the end of the policy of the National Party. That policy is merely developing and I am very grateful towards the leader of the Labour Party for having spoken like a responsible leader over the weekend. I wish hon. members would go and learn from that leader. Like a responsible leader, he stated: &#x201C;I have made myself eligible for election to the CRC; we are proceeding and I am willing to talk.&#x201D; That leader is fully entitled to do so. That party is fully entitled to put its standpoint. The policy of the National Party can be taken further by means of dialogue. It is not the policy of the National Party that has changed. This Bill does not change our policy. You know our policy. It has been very clearly stated through the years, and our policy is not to give the Coloureds representation in this Parliament, but to give them their own representative council which will be developed in the course of time. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>This afternoon hon. members are employing the argument that so many voters voted for the CRC during the recent election and that they rejected the policy of the National Party. Now I want to tell the hon. members that they must take into account the 50,7% of the votes cast on 24 April last year which put this Government in power and put it here to carry out this policy. Do hon. members want that to be cancelled out&#x003F;</p>

I accept that we have not yet followed this road to its end and that we have a great deal of work to do along that road in the future. It will be possible to make progress along that road if there is a greater degree of goodwill between White and Brown in South Africa. But then we must not disturb those relationships; we must instil and cultivate that goodwill among our people. If I am to confine myself to the Western Cape, here where we are living together, here where the greater majority of the Coloureds live, then I see outstanding possibilities for this region. I see its challenges, I see its development &#x2026;</p>

I want to make an appeal that we should follow this road together and co-operate in the interests of South Africa.

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Oudtshoorn made two statements. Firstly he made the statement that people are more concerned about socio-economic matters than about politics. In reply to this I want to say at once that he does not understand why people are interested in politics. People are interested in politics precisely in order to obtain socio-economic rights. One of the reasons why the Coloured people are interested in politics is that they have to contend with socio-economic problems in their daily life. The second point he made was that in his opinion this legislation is necessary because children have to continue going to school and because the teachers must continue to receive their salaries. What is very important and interesting is that if we look back to 2 June 1972, when the Coloured Representative Council Act was amended, giving certain powers to the Government to do certain things, we find that precisely the same statement was made then. I want to quote from Hansard, 1972, column 8801. The hon. member who was speaking was the then hon. member for Malmesbury, a certain Mr. Van Staden. He said that the legislation was necessary for the following reason&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thus they can prevent the Budget from going through. What is the result&#x003F;&#x2014;the teachers cannot be paid &#x2026;</block>

<block name="quote">Mrs. C. D. Taylor: Rubbish!</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. J. W. Van Staden: The people who must obtain pensions, cannot be paid; the aged, widows and orphans cannot be paid.</block>

<p>&#x2020;At that time then a law was introduced to achieve that purpose and now it is said that this Bill has to be introduced to achieve the identical purpose. The hon. member is obviously quite wrong in alleging that that is why this Bill is required on this occasion.</p>

<p>I think the most significant part of this debate today is a matter which nobody has as yet mentioned, viz. that we here as Whites, elected by Whites to a White Parliament, are debating the future of the Coloured people while not a single representative of the Coloured people sits here with us in order to participate in this debate. This is what will strike the Coloured people; this is what will strike all people of colour in South, Africa; this is what will strike the people in Africa as a whole; this is what will be discussed in the world &#x2014;that we here as Whites take it upon ourselves solely to debate the future of the Coloured people of South Africa while they have no part in the decision-making process which, in fact, is taking place here.</p>

<p>I think the legislation before us needs to be tested as to whether the powers which the Minister seeks are either required by him or are desirable for him to have and should be given to him in the form in which he has asked for them. Let us go back a little and have a look at the history of the CRC and its elections. When the Labour Party, in which the hon. member for Oudtshoorn now says he has every confidence and in which the hon. member for Piketberg who spoke a few minutes before appears to have no confidence at all, won the election it was frustrated of its victory by the nominations that were made by the hon. the Minister at the time. We have now had another election and the Government now speaks of confidence in the Labour Party. Why&#x003F; Because now it does not matter how many people they nominate, the Labour Party has a majority in the CRC. <span class="col_3341-3342" refersTo="page_0084"/>The Labour Party has now obtained an absolute majority irrespective of what nominations can be made. What does that express as far as the will of the Coloured people is concerned&#x003F; In the first place, let us look back on the registration of voters. Less than half of the Coloured people came to be registered as voters. Let us look at the election itself. Less than half the people bothered to come and vote in this election. If we look at those who voted, less than a quarter million, there were over 150 000 who voted for the labour party which obtained a mandate from their people. The Nationalist Party has often spoken in this House about the mandates which they have obtained and what they must carry out in this House. But what mandate did the Labour Party obtain in the last election&#x003F; In the first place, it obtained a mandate to oppose apartheid or separate development. In the second place, it obtained a mandate to obtain for its own people the rights of citizenship in the land they were born in and the land in which they grew up. They obtained a mandate from their own people that they should obtain representation in the highest legislative body of this country, namely this Parliament. I believe that is the view of the Coloured people as a whole and this is their approach to what their political position in South Africa should be.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the Nationalist Party and its alleged mandates. Have they in fact a mandate for the type of separate development that they are applying&#x003F; I want to say here again today to the hon. the Minister that if he has confidence in the fact that the White people of South Africa believe as he does that he should get this sort of power and that he should keep the Coloured people out of this Parliament, he should in fact go to the people and hold a referendum. He will then be surprised, because the White people will in fact support the Coloured people being in this Parliament. I challenge him to bold such a referendum, because the result of that referendum will show that the attitude of the Whites is not as verkramp as the attitude of the hon. members who sit on that side of the House. But let us take Nationalist Party policy and let us seek to analyse it logically. Firstly, the CRC is part of their policy. If it is part of their policy they must accept that particular council irrespective of who is in power in that council. If the Coloured people are, in accordance with their dictates, entitled to run their own affairs, the Nationalist Party must accept that they must do what they get a mandate to do and what they think is right should be done. It is only to their voters that they must in fact give an account. The Nationalist Party must accept what is done in the CRC irrespective of whether they like what is done there or not. That is the major lesson they must learn if their own policy is to be applied. But there is a tremendous difference between the image of Nationalist policy and the reality of Nationalist policy. Let me give the House an example. The hon. the Prime Minister has claimed repeatedly in this House and outside that the Coloured people are entitled to exercise their own sovereignty. In fact, the hon. member for Piketberg said only a few minutes ago &#x201C;What have you against Coloureds ruling themselves&#x003F;&#x201D; But what does exercising your own sovereignty mean&#x003F; Let me tell hon. members what it means in the words of the hon. the Minister who is in charge of this Bill. In his language it means &#x201C;Die Regering is die finale outoriteit ten opsigte van die Kleurlingbevolking&#x201D;. Is that not baaskap&#x003F; How can he say that people are ruling themselves, are entitled to rule themselves and are entitled to have sovereignty over themselves when he is on record as saying, not years ago, but a matter of a couple of days ago, that &#x201C;Die Regering is die finale outoriteit ten opsigte van die Kleurlingbevolking&#x201D;&#x003F; That does not mean that they are to have sovereignty or that they are entitled to govern themselves. This is not anything except pure and simple Blanke-baasskap as we have always known it from 1948 onwards.</p>

<p>I should like to hear the hon. the Minister on the subject of the promise that was given to the Coloured people by the late Dr. Verwoerd in 1961 and which was echoed again by the present Prime Minister. This 10-year period seems to be a very long one, or else it seems we are employing a new calendar, because something seems to be going amiss in this regard. One thing has been made very clear by this piece of legislation and the election result with which this piece of legislation is very clearly connected, and that is that separate development as Nationalist Party policy is not a system which can now be said to be applied with the consent of the Coloured people. It is clearly being applied against the overall will of the Coloured people as such.</p>

<p>The issue of consultation has been raised, and I pertinently want to raise the <span class="col_3343-3344" refersTo="page_0085"/>issue again. Did the hon. the Minister hold consultations&#x003F; If he did hold consultations, with whom did he do so&#x003F; Did he consult with the leaders of the labour Party&#x003F; Did he consult with people who have now been elected in this election in order to find out what their views on this matter are&#x003F; Did he ask them whether it was necessary to have this legislation&#x003F; The hon. member for Oudtshoorn, who spoke just a moment ago, said that he has every confidence in the Labour Party. If there is every confidence in the Labour Party, why then this piece of legislation&#x003F; There is a reason for this legislation. It is a very clear reason which the hon. the Minister and the Coloured people know, and which we in this House know whether we like it or not, and that is that the Coloured people of South Africa do not, in fact, want the present CRC. They do not want it in this form. They want representation in this House, they want to be regarded as citizens of this country, they want to have the rights of citizens of this country, they want the right to vote and they want to be able to sit in this particular House. But with great respect, what is wrong with an attitude which now states: &#x201C;We will use the platform which a system of which we disapprove has given to us in order to advocate the abolition of that system and the creation of something which is more meaningful and more real and which respects our rights as citizens in the country of our birth&#x201D;&#x003F; Members on the other side have said that if Mr. Leon wants to come and talk he is welcome to do so. Is dialogue enough, however&#x003F; Is it enough just to talk&#x003F; Is paternalism enough&#x003F; Is tokenism enough&#x003F; Are we not reaching a stage where participation is required and where dialogue and talk must lead to something, where there must be action as a result of this talk&#x003F; It is not enough to say that people should sit down and talk when nothing happens as a result of all the talk.</p>

<p>There is a further question I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. A number of people have to be nominated to the council. He has said, if he has been correctly reported, that he does not intend to nominate only people who are against the Labour Party. Let me ask him, however, whether he intends to consult the majority party as to who should be nominated to this council. Does he intend, in fact, to have a system of proportional nomination so that the balance in the council is not changed, or does he intend to go against the express will of the Coloured people and irrespective of any tokenism decide to nominate in a fashion which will change the voting pattern if not the control in that council&#x003F; I think that he owes this House an answer to that. The second matter was &#x2014;and it was put a little earlier by the hon. member for Piketberg in another form&#x2014; that the leader of the Labour Party had asked to be chairman of the Executive Committee. I think that he needs to tell us whether he believes that the party which is in control, should have all the seats on the Executive Committee including the chairmanship. Take for example a much lower and less important body, even though it is important in the context. The Nationalist Party adopted an attitude in Johannesburg where they said that they wanted the whole of a management committee to belong to one party.</p>

<p>It is not sour grapes; it will be sweet wine in two years&#x2019; time.</p>

<p>With respect, why do you not answer now whether you believe that in fact an executive committee is similar to a Cabinet and should have that appointment in that context&#x003F; Let me ask a further question: If there are meetings in regard to the future constitutional development of the Coloured people and the CRC is not accepted as the correct vehicle for this, has the Government a sufficiently open mind to negotiate on a basis that an alternative means will be found for the Coloured people&#x003F; One thing is clear and that is that you now have two conflicting mandates. You have the alleged mandate of the Nationalist Party, which is a White electorate mandate, and you have the mandate of the Labour Party which is a Coloured people&#x2019;s mandate. Those two conflict in respect to what the future of the Coloured people should be. If you believe in self-determination, which the Nationalist Party speakers talk about, then it is the will of the Coloured people which should determine their future and they should be taken into account, not merely the decision and the mandate which the Nationalist Party has obtained.</p>

<p>I want to put another question to the hon. the Minister. <span class="col_3345-3346" refersTo="page_0086"/>What does he think is the effect of this piece of legislation on public opinion in regard to South Africa overseas and on public opinion in Africa&#x003F; I shall tell you what the opinion will be. The opinion will be that here you have separate development which is the show-piece of the Nationalist Party, where an election has been held and where the leader of the party which has been elected is refused a passport to leave his own country and to come back on it. That is the system that you have and now when that party gets into power, then you pass legislation so that you can exercise all the powers of that legislative body. Do you want to hold this up to the world as the show-piece to show how South Africa is going to solve the relationship problem between races in South Africa&#x003F; I want to ask you how this will be seen by the people of South Africa. The South African people as such will see this as an example of the frustrations which people have and of the frustrations of people under the system of separate development. Above all, they will see that in the final result it is always the White Parliament which has the final say. To use the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own words, he is the final authority, this Parliament is the final authority. So much for believing that there was going to be a degree of real self-determination under the system of separate development! What should be done&#x003F; I would like to suggest a number of things to the hon. the Minister today.</p>

<p>I think that if he wants to show his goodwill and he does not want to appoint a proportionate number of members of the Labour Party as nominated members, why does he not seek power to abolish the nominated members altogether and to make this a fully elected body&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>It is very easy. If you do not know how to do it, it means that, one section has to be deleted from the Act, viz. part of section 1. It is very simple. You simply delete it. It is the easiest thing to do.</p>

<p>The second point is that after having done that, it is quite clear that he should offer the chairmanship of that council to the leader of the party which holds the majority in that council. The third thing that he should do is that he should sit down with the leaders of the majority party and review the powers of the CRC so as to make it a more meaningful body&#x2014;to give it more teeth, as has been suggested. The fourth thing which I think should be done, is that the socio-economic uplift of the Coloured people should be accelerated. We should have some immediate action in this regard and in fact should expidite the steps that need to be taken. The fifth thing that needs to be done is that a constitutional conference should be called in order to consider the entire position of the relationship between the Coloured people and the remaining people in South Africa so as to determine the future of the Coloured people. That can only be done at a proper constitutional conference; it cannot merely be done through casual discussions which take place.</p>

<p>May I just for a moment turn to the wording of the Bill itself&#x003F; If we look at the proposed new section 22A, we see that it says: &#x201C;If the Minister is satisfied that the chairman of the executive &#x2026; etc.&#x201D;. That means that he is the final arbiter; he can decide whether he is satisfied or not. In the old legislation it had to be a matter of fact as to whether the budget had or had not been passed. Now it is for the Minister to decide whether or not he is satisfied that a person has been doing his particular job properly. The Minister may merely be dissatisfied with the manner in which the job is performed. He will still be able to exercise his powers in that connection. The Bill also says that the Minister may authorize other persons to exercise that power. In other words, he may take away the powers of the council, of the executive and of the chairman at his own whim depending on whether he is satisfied or not. He can then either exercise these powers himself or, alternatively, decide to give these powers to someone else. If this is not a potential weapon for the destruction of the whole edifice of separate development in regard to the Coloured people, I do not know what in fact is.</p>

<p>We have considered very carefully what we believe our attitude to this piece of legislation should be. Whereas in the normal course of events we would have no hesitation in voting for a proposal that this Bill be read this day six months, we feel that this legislation represents so serious a blow to race relations in South Africa and to South Africa&#x2019;s international image that <span class="col_3347-3348" refersTo="page_0087"/>we would like to place this on record. Consequently, I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to pass the Second Reading of the <i>Coloured Persons Representative Council Amendment Bill</i> on the ground that its passing will represent a serious blow to race relations and to South Africa&#x2019;s international image.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while listening to the hon. member for Yeoville, I was reminded of the note written by an English clergyman in the margin of his sermon. The note read: &#x201C;Yell like anything, argument very weak.&#x201D; [Interjections.] There is another word that rhymes with that, but I shall leave it to the hon. member to find it for himself. The hon. member made quite a number of statements here. For example, he said that he wanted a referendum on this matter. I do not know whether he wants everyone to take part in it. I do not know whether he wants to include Capt. Buthelezi&#x2019;s people in his referendum as well. However, if he wants to have a referendum of the White voters of South Africa, then surely he ought to know that the White voters have repeatedly expressed themselves, with vigour and deep conviction, in regard to this very point, as one of the points of policy in the politics of South Africa, viz. on separate development and representation, a separate Parliament for the Coloureds. Surely we have expressed ourselves on that score. It is because he reminded me of that that I, again, remind him of what occurred in history. The hon. member states that we are debating on the future of the Coloureds in their absence. However, the point is that the hon. member wants the Coloureds to come and sit here and have a say, not only in regard to their own affairs. They must also be able to debate on the future and the interests of the White man. It is in this regard that the National Party states: &#x201C;That will be the day! We exclude that.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member must not speak so loudly. He has more voice than content.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the views and the self-determination of the Coloureds. However, the members of his party do not want to give the Coloureds the chance to arrive at the formulation of any views their own, or to give expression in their own way to their own views and self-determination. The hon. member always wants to confuse the whole issue. That is what the hon. member over there in the back bench wants. This side of the House states that the orderly way in South Africa is for the White man to be given the opportunity, and to remain in a position, to run his own affairs and, while we are in power and exercise control, to create for these people the opportunity of arriving at their own definition of who they are, what they want and where they want to go. That is our approach and the voters have given this party a mandate to carry it out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point said that the Coloureds saw the CRC as a symbol of rejection by the Whites. Why did he make a statement like that&#x003F; Does the existence of separate schools for those people, where they have 20 000 Coloured teachers of their own, constitute rejection by the Whites&#x003F; The hon. member should not talk so loudly. He is a man who objects to a mixed swimming bath in his own constituency. Is that not rejection of, discrimination against and an insult of these people&#x003F; In this way one&#x2019;s own remarks and arguments can catch up with one, catch one and destroy one.

<p>Oh, is the swimming bath open now&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member said that the election outcome was a rejection of apartheid. Is it also a rejection of separate schools for Coloureds&#x003F; Is it a rejection of the fact that these people find a spiritual home in their own churches among their own members with their own clergymen&#x003F; This is a way of life and is organized at various levels in social and religious life where the fact that what one has here is a community that distinguishes itself from the Whites and from the various Black peoples, finds expression. They see their political future in a particular way and in a particular direction. <span class="col_3349-3350" refersTo="page_0088"/>It is in respect of that direction, in which its political self-determination can find expression, that we are debating with each other and it is in regard to that that we on this side of the House say that we are not prepared to enter a debate in which other peoples debate together on the future of the White man and on his right to self-determination. We are not prepared to do that.</p>

<p>The hon. members have failed to see the entire background and reason for this legislation. As the hon. member for Piketberg indicated, the fact of the matter is that we are dealing here with certain statements by the leaders of the Labour Party through the years. For example, there have been the threats to destroy the CRC. They are on record. Only this morning they appeared on the front pages of certain newspapers. Even after the leader of the Labour Party had intimated that he was prepared to conduct a discussion, to conduct dialogue with the Prime Minister, he said in the same breath that he accepted the CRC, but only as a medium to destroy itself, viz. from within. In this way one comes across the dilemma in the Labour Party&#x2019;s approach. On the one hand they realize that if they do what they said they were going to do during the election campaing, viz. destroy the CRC, they would have to resign their seats, and an election would have to be held all over again. But there is still a degree of responsibility to the extent that they realize that they have been put in power by their voters and they are now prepared to conduct a discussion with the Prime Minister. It does not matter whether they agree with him; they are at least prepared to conduct dialogue with him, and when that happens, then we are on our way because what will happen then will be precisely what those hon. members hold out as a prospect. I think it was the hon. member for Yeoville who said that we should have to speak to each other as man to man. As I say, what would happen then would be precisely what those hon. members hold out as a prospect, because then it would be a case of a man coming to talk, in his own right and on behalf of his people, to a man who, in his own right, represents and expresses and interprets the interests of his people; then it is man to man. The leader of the Labour Party is now having himself elected as leader of the CRC; he is changing his threat and is now accepting the CRC as an instrument to destroy the CRC. Even in the most recent statements by the leader of that party there is a contradiction, and it is as a result of that very contradiction, and the threat that is still inherent in his statements now that he has declared himself to be prepared to serve as leader of the CRC, that the Government feels that it wants to place it beyond all doubt that chaos will not develop in the administration, that hardship will not be caused to people concerned with this and that is the reason for this legislation as introduced by the hon. the Minister. Sir, the dilemma of the leader of the Labour Party is that he is rejecting a Coloured grouping and organization that belongs to the Coloureds alone. He wants to run away from his own people, but at the same time he wants to be the mouthpiece of those people when he comes to talk to the leader of the White man. This is the dilemma he faces and he will be unable to escape it unless he accepts the responsibility that has now been placed on him and by virtue of that responsibility, discusses matters with the authoritative body on this side in order to interpret the interests and the opinions of his people.</p>

<p>Surely, Mr. Speaker, it is very clear what this Bill does not envisage. It in no way envisages contesting the outcome of the election. If hon. members opposite were afraid that we would contest the outcome of the election, then we just want to say that that is not our intention and that that does not form part of our policy. An election took place; the Labour members were elected in a majority and we accept that as the verdict of the Coloured electorate. The Labour Party won the election; it was the Coloured voters who elected Coloureds as their representatives. I think it would be in the interests of good relations in South Africa if everyone were to accept that in this election, Coloured voters elected Coloureds as their representatives to run their affairs and, if necessary, to engage in discussion with this Parliament.</p>

<p>A second matter, Sir, which this Bill does not envisage is taking over the legislative powers of the legally elected members of the CRC, and that the hon. the Minister stated very clearly in his speech. We by no means intend to do what those hon. members want to impute to us, namely that we ourselves now want to wring the neck of separate development. To hon. members opposite who are so terribly afraid that our image abroad would suffer as a result, <span class="col_3351-3352" refersTo="page_0089"/>I want to state that it is our very intention and striving that separate development should succeed, and that is why we want these legally elected members of the CRC to accept their responsibility and to carry out their duties in the interests of the people who elected them&#x2014;their own people. We have no desire to do the CRC&#x2019;s work for it, nor do we covet the crown that will be placed on the heads of those people when they themselves discharge their responsibility on behalf of their own people.</p>

<p>Nor, Sir, is it in any way the intention to regulate Coloured politics from this Parliament. Hon. members opposite raised a tremendous hue and cry about this as if we wanted to regulate Coloured politics from this side. On the contrary, it is when, owing to certain threats, Coloured politics is in danger of coming to grief within their own sphere, that we have to see to it that the essential things are maintained, as the hon. members for Oudtshoorn and Piketberg indicated here. If there were any question of our wanting to regulate Coloured politics from this Parliament, then we just want to say two things, and one is that this is by no means the policy of the National Party; on the contrary, the policy of this party is specifically that action be taken to promote self-determination both in politics and consistently at the social level of each of the various population groups in South Africa. We do not want to regulate from top to bottom. It is precisely our aim to lead these people towards self-determination, and if hon. members say that that has not happened yet, then I just want to say that Rome was not built in a day. If those hon. members had helped us, if they had not acted as stumbling blocks and hindrances in this regard, then I am convinced that the Coloureds would by this time have been much further along the road to self-determination, and that includes political self-determination.</p>

<p>But there is a second reason thy we do not do this, and that is that we are fully aware of how white and pink liberals in South Africa are rejected by the politically aware non-Whites. They are rejected, and one of the best examples of this is the interference of Nusas and others with Saso. Those non-Whie students simply turned their backs on them because those people are not accepted as guardians or as saviours in a political situation. We are aware of this rejection, and that is why we do not regulate from this side. Nor is it by any means the intention to make it difficult for the Labour Party to govern. On the contrary. It is our very aim that there should be government. That is our approach. We do not want to govern for them. What we want is that there should be government, and if people are totally unwilling to perform the basic functions of government, then, in the interests of those people, we must take certain steps to prevent harm being done, to prevent chaos and disruption.</p>

<p>That is the reason for this legislation. What, then, do we in fact envisage&#x003F; It has been said repeatedly, and I am therefore just repeating this statement, that this legislation is being introduced for the sake of the welfare of the Coloured population so that, in the event of there being disruption, in the light of the threats that have been uttered, the basic work may go on and the interests of certain groups among the Coloured population will not suffer.</p>

<p>What we want is that the autonomy of the self-determination of the Coloured people should be further extended. We want it to be extended, whereas hon. members opposite have always dangled a carrot under their noses and said: &#x201C;You can come here and you can have a joint say, not only in regard to your own interests, but also in regard to the interests of the White man.&#x201D; That is where we draw the line and say that this will not happen. We are not going to implement a sharing of power; we are not going to allow the self-determination of the White man to be subjected to co-determination by other population groups in South Africa. We want the Coloured leaders to take the credit for this and compel the respect of their own people; we want them to realize fully that we do not regard them as an appendage to any people, not of the Black people&#x2014;and I say this to Mr. Adam Small&#x2014;nor of the White people. We do not regard them in any way as an appendage, but as people in their own right, a community in its own right, with, its own leaders who may interpret those rights for them and put those rights to the Government that still governs them. [Interjections.] I say that we want the autonomy and self-determination of the Coloureds to be extended. It is unnecessary to point out that the legislation passed by this Government, the establishment <span class="col_3353-3354" refersTo="page_0090"/>of the Coloured Persons Representative Council, has afforded the Coloured people this very opportunity of producing leaders, of producing its own mouthpieces, people capable of interpreting the interests, the rights and the freedoms, the claims, demands and even the grievances, too, of those people. They can come with their grievances. Our people also had many grievances. This may perhaps be a negative expression of one&#x2019;s self-awareness, but it is nevertheless an expression of one&#x2019;s self-awareness and it is one way in which one exercises one&#x2019;s self-determination, by interpreting one&#x2019;s claims and designating one&#x2019;s leaders for that purpose. Sir, we want their own administration, which has been built up and which is manned by Coloureds to a very important degree, to escape damage. That is the reason for this legislation. Apart from the teachers, numbering about 20 000, there are also about 3 000 officials in the employ of that administration, and those people serve the interests of their own people. Does the hon. member want this to come to a standstill until such time as the Coloureds have representation in this Parliament&#x003F;</p>

<p>I shall abide by your ruling, Mr. Speaker. The matter of the utilization of funds has also been mentioned already, but there is still the matter of local management. Do hon. members want local management, which falls under the jurisdiction of the CRC, to come to a standstill until such time as the Coloureds have representation in this Parliament&#x003F; Must the Coloureds&#x2019; own university be done away with, and must the Coloured rector who was appointed and who is the pride of those people, to be retired and the students distributed among all the other universities&#x003F;</p>

<p>What we envisage is the prevention of chaos, disruption and hardship. I do not want to expand on this any further, because this argument has already been advanced. If there should be chaos, disruption or hardship, then we shall act in the interests of South Africa, because it is in the interests of South Africa, of everyone in South Africa, that there should be orderly administration of Coloured affairs, too. It is in the interests of good relations between Whites and Coloureds, and between Coloureds and the Black peoples, that there should be a Coloured community practising self-determination and that its own people should accept it and serve it and administer it.</p>

<p>Any community needs its inner driving force and urge for development to be mobilized for the benefit of its own people. What we want to ensure by means of this legislation, is that the efforts made and the opportunities created for Coloureds to administer their own people will not be frustrated but that the inner driving force and urge for development of the Coloured people should be so directed as to be to the benefit and welfare of their own people.</p>

<p>No people can be uplifted by another people if it does not contribute its own share and provide its own leaders, and if its own people do not accept it as theirs. A people cannot develop as a people if it does not accept responsibility for its own welfare and progress, if it does not make its own history, and if it does not want to clear its own road to the future. No people compels the respect of other peoples if it does not have self-respect, if it runs away from itself, if it evades major responsibilities or if it has no appreciation of its own distinguishing characteristics. These are things which we demand for ourselves and they are things which we assume of the other groups in South Africa as well.</p>

<p>Even though it is true that the Federal Party advocates a programme that corresponds to a greater extent with the views of this side of the House and that it lost the election, the fact of the matter is that the Labour Party has come to power. We want to tell those people that we trust that they will display the ability to act in the interests of their own people. Actually we are paying them a compliment by telling them that we refuse to see them as an appendage of any other group in South Africa, but as people in their own right, as a community progressing towards an increasing degree of self-determination. We ask them, then, to use the opportunity of their own parliament in their progress towards that self-determination.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is not much which the hon. member for Waterberg has said to which I want to reply.

The hon. member would have been correct if this Parliament <span class="col_3355-3356" refersTo="page_0091"/>had occupied itself exclusively with, the affairs of the Whites. However, this is not and will never be the case.</p>

<p>That will never be the case, and therefore the hon. member is extremely unreasonable when he demands participation in this Parliament for the White man only. When it comes to the Coloureds, he goes further and does not even want to give them the right to say what they want for themselves. He takes it amiss of the Labour Party for saying that they do not want the CRC. In other words, the hon. member wants to claim a full say for himself as a White, but when the Coloureds express their will and say that they want a different dispensation and not the CRC, that is not good enough either. Even then he steps in and says that as far as that is concerned, too, the will of the Whites must apply. Then he talks of self-determination!</p>

<p>I actually want to come back to the hon. member for Piketberg and a few standpoints which he adopted. The hon. member for Piketberg accused the hon. the Leader of the Opposition of talking nonsense. Let me say at once that I think that was an undignified statement and that I am not going to enter the debate at that level. However, I take the strongest exception to the statement of the hon. member for Piketberg that we are &#x201C;talking people into&#x201D; the destruction of the CRC. Where is the evidence for something like that&#x003F; Our attitude has always been that we are not prepared to force anything onto any population group that it does not want. Whatever a Government does, it will never succeed if it does not do so with the approval of the people for whom it is intended. What is the truth, in reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s accusation, an accusation for which he is unable to advance any evidence&#x003F; It is and always has been the standpoint of this side of the House&#x2014;in fact, it is a part of our declared policy&#x2014;that as long as the Coloureds want it, they can have a Coloured Persons Council. It is written into the principles of the party for all to see. However, we say at the same time that such a Coloured Persons Representative Council must also be linked to representation in this Parliament. The hon. member for Piketberg went on to say that the result of the election was no consolation for the United Party and that the Labour Party had no sympathy for the United Party. But what has that to do with our standpoint here&#x003F; It is not of cardinal interest to us, when we consider a Bill and adopt a standpoint in this House, whether the Labour Party or another party is sympathetic towards us. We have only one basic premise, viz. what is best for the future of South Africa. We base our judgment on that. We do not seek party-political advantage, because we cannot get it. The Labour Party does not vote for us and cause us to win seats, Nor can they do so. When we judge a Bill, we judge it strictly according to what we think is in the interests not only of the White man, but also in the interests of the people who are involved in it, and also in the interests of South Africa as a whole.</p>

<p>The Bill which we have before us, is obviously an emergency measure. The misfortune is that the emergency is not among the Coloureds or in the CRC, which is affected by this Bill. There is no evidence that they asked for it, and the hon. the Minister could not even produce evidence that the outgoing executive of the CRC asked for it either. The emergency is not among the Coloureds. The emergency in connection with this Bill is in the Government. The measure is a direct result of the fact that in the handling of Coloured Affairs, the Government is not seeking to carry out the will of the Coloured community, but its own will. The hon. the Minister tried to explain to us what the motive behind this Bill is, He presented his speech very quickly, but I did manage to make at least a few notes of his explanations of why this Bill is before the House. He expressed the fear&#x2014;one must presume that he was referring here to the Labour Party&#x2014; that there could be a refusal to submit the estimates to the CRC in the prescribed manner. He spoke of problematical situations which could arise and of the possible refusal by the CRC to carry out instructions issued by the Government. He complained that there were people among the Coloureds who do not want to give recognition to the good things which the Government have done for the Coloureds, He went further and said he was afraid there would be people who would deliberately cause administrative chaos. Other members who spoke after him, spoke of boycotts. The hon. member for Waterberg even tried to conjure up the spectre of the CRC causing the Coloured university to cease functioning. The Coloured university does not fall <span class="col_3357-3358" refersTo="page_0092"/>under the CRC at all. However, I shall leave the matter at that. I want to ask the hon. the Minister in the first place where his evidence is for the reasons which he advanced for the introduction of this Bill. The hon. the Minister has admitted, through the reasons he has furnished, that there is a spirit of resistance to the present CRC. This fear which the hon. the Minister has, cannot be separated from the fact that the Labour Party has just won the election. If he fears that there is resistance, ought the hon. the Minister not to look for its origin and for the actual core of this resistance&#x003F; Otherwise he cannot judge whether his motives are correct or not. Since 1948, the Government has unceasingly followed a policy of confrontation with the Coloureds. The hon. member for Oudtshoorn and the hon. member for Piketberg said the Labour Party is following a policy of confrontation. In reality it is the Government which has unceasingly followed a policy of confrontation with the Coloureds. This is not the time to go into the long history of this confrontation. Nor do I want to do so. However, we are all aware of its salient features. First there was the protracted confrontation with the Coloureds on their Parliamentary and provincial franchise. There was the persistant confrontation with the apartheid measures which the Government has introduced over the years.</p>

<p>Let us come now to the CRC elections. The confrontation on the franchise was followed, in 1968, by legislation which completely abolished Coloured representation in this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am only following up the arguments which were raised on the other side. In 1969, we had the election for the new CRC. The Labour Party won with a great majority. However, the next thing they knew, the Government had once again decided on confrontation. The Government packed the Council with members of the minority party and handed the whole administration of the council over to the losing party. Is that not confrontation&#x003F; Last week the second election of this Coloured Persons Representative Council took place, and this time the result was even more decisively in favour of the Labour Party than in the past. What do we find now&#x003F; The results were hardly out when the Government decided on a further piece of confrontation, viz. the legislation which is now before us and in which, in fact, the chairman and members of the executive management and the council as a whole are being told &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; that if they do not manage their own affairs as the Government says they must, the Government will simply do so for them. That is what this legislation means. The hon. the Minister takes powers over everything into his own hands. He excludes legislation, but it is meaningless to exclude legislation, because the CRC cannot introduce an iota of legislation without the permission of the hon. the Minister. That power the hon. the Minister already has. However, he is taking total power over the functions of the CRC into his hands. Members on that side must therefore not speak of self-determination again. If this is the sort of legislation which the Government wants to introduce, there can be no question of self-determination in respect of Coloureds over Coloureds. The spirit of this Bill is that it is the will of the White which also applies in respect of the Coloured community. If this legislation is passed and implemented, we shall arrive at the final farce that the CRC is a Brown doll on the lap of a White ventriloquist. This side of the House cannot accept this under any circumstances. Then it will not in fact be the Labour Party, but the hon. the Minister and the Government which is destroying the CRC. The hon. the Minister asks in all innocence what we must do if the CRC were to refuse to fulfil its functions. Other hon. speakers have asked what we must do if the CRC were to fail to pay the salary cheques of Coloured teachers, pensioners and officials.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The problem has not yet arisen. I want to add at once that the hon. the Minister already has powers in that regard. But the problem has not arisen yet and it is unlikely that it ever <span class="col_3359-3360" refersTo="page_0093"/>will. Not one leader of a Coloured party has ever indicated that he intends to go so far as not to pay a Coloured teacher his salary. What Coloured leader has said that&#x003F; No executive of the CRC can go so far as to accept their own salaries as of members of the executive while they refuse to pay their officials, salaries. I want to go further by saying that it is not within the power of any party in the CRC, whether it be the Labour Party or not, to destroy the CRC. It can do nothing more than express the will of the Coloured community. But suppose what the hon. the Minister fears were to happen. The hon. the Minister should then ask himself what gave rise to this, and how the Government can remove the immediate causes. Is it the Coloureds who are being unreasonable, or is it the Government that is being unreasonable&#x003F; Does the unreasonableness not perhaps lie with the Government&#x003F; All the Coloured parties, both the Labour Party and the Federal Party, are opposed to the Government&#x2019;s policy and demand representation in the highest body in the country, where the laws are made which affect them just as much as the Whites. In other words, they are asking nothing more than recognition of citizenship. Is there anyone here who will say that that is unreasonable&#x003F; If anyone says that that request or that demand is unreasonable, he does not know what the word &#x201C;unreasonable&#x201D; means. The possibility of resistance which the hon. the Minister gives as motive for the introduction of this Bill, is not really aimed against the CRC as such. I am convinced that the majority of of the Coloureds are not opposed to the CRC as such as an interim step on the road of political progress. What they do object to, is that the Government regards the CRC as the terminal point of their political progress, while we all know&#x2014;in spite of what the hon. member for Waterberg tried to say&#x2014;that the CRC, at its best, will never become more than a pseudo-Parliament with extremely limited functions and will never be able to meet the needs of full citizenship. Our advice to the Government is that it must think of alternatives. I want to give them the advice that they should take the facts of the present situation squarely into consideration and that this matter they should act as a Government of South Africa and not as a Government for the National Party. Their policy of confrontation must make place for a policy of accommodation. The hon. Leader of the Opposition was quite correct when he told the hon. the Minister that if he withdraws the legislation or withholds it, it will help to create a spirit of trust in the present situation. A spirit of trust is a prerequisite for the handling of the situation which has now arisen. After all, the Government must concede that it can make as many laws or devise as many plans as it pleases, but that in the end no system will work if it does not have the co-operation and the approval of the Coloureds. It is of cardinal importance. It will not be successful unless they get the co-operation of the Coloureds. I want to predict that this measure will not be the last one either&#x2014;but in the long run people cannot be forced to accept what they do not want. Therefore I want to say to the hon. the Minister in the second place that, since the Labour Party won the election decisively, he ought to appoint the leader of that party as chairman of the executive. In addition, he ought to hand over the administration of the CRC to the Labour Party, which is the majority party. As recently happened again in the case of the Johannesburg city council, it has always been the standpoint of that side of the House that the majority party should govern. If the hon. the Minister does not do so in this case as well, he could be accused of applying double standards.</p>

<p>As far as the appointments in the CRC are concerned, I want to say that there is only one principle according to which it can be done, viz. on a proportional basis, i.e. <i>pro rata.</i></p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a question of prescribing to them; that is their standpoint already. The Federal Party is relentless in its adherence to that standpoint, and the votes which that party polled, are also in favour of representation in Parliament. The entire Coloured community stands for that This is something which the Government will never be able to escape from. I believe that our people today are mature enough to allow this. If the Government disputes this, they can put it to the test. It will improve the relations between White and Brown immediately and also strike a powerful blow for the attainment of the ideal of d&#x00E9;tente in Africa.</p>

<p>I want to conclude with a last thought. On 21 February 1657, the first freehold grants were issued to Whites in the Cape. In other words it is now 318 years ago that the first Whites in South Africa became free citizens in this country. But in the political field, the Coloured is still servant and subordinate, and if this Bill is passed he is even more of a subordinate and servant ever before. Then we are back to the position of complete baaskap. Therefore I believe that, instead of the hon. the Minister proceeding with this Bill, it is time the Coloureds in South Africa are declared free citizens and that a political place be created for them which will meet the requirements of full citizenship.</p>

<speech by="#palm">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Sneaker, you will probably not allow me to cover as wide a field as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, but I shall nevertheless try to reply to a few statements which he made. Right at the outset I want to say that it is remarkable how the various opposition parties, therefore even the bits and pieces as the hon. member for Durban Point calls them, played to the gallery this afternoon and were in fact bidding against one another to see to what extent they could satisfy certain people who are seated there. It was remarkable that even the hon. member for Sea Point, whose party does not even have a policy as far as the Coloureds are concerned, waxed eloquent in regard to the policy of this side of the House. During the Second Reading debate on the Part Appropriation Bill the Leader of the Progressive Party was asked what their policy in respect of the qualified franchise was. The hon. the Prime Minister then commented that they had no cornerstone, for the one person had said that that was no longer a policy while another had said that they were still considering how to apply it.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and say that it is a great pity that this hon. member has again this afternoon displayed such a lack of patriotism towards the Whites in South, Africa. He spoke of self-determination for the Coloureds. I think that if there has ever been a party which has helped these Coloureds along the road to self-determination then it is this Government party, of which I have the honour to be a member. When he speaks of self-determination, I want to ask him whether the Whites in South Africa do not also have the right to determine their own destiny. He said that we were trying to force something upon the Coloureds which they did not want. Should we then as Whites in this country be satisfied to have things forced upon us which we do not want&#x003F;</p>

<p>I think it has been convincingly explained that this legislation before us is no emergency measure. I do not want to discuss that aspect any further. However, I do want to say this: There is one accepted fact in this country, which has been proved over the years, and that is that South Africa is a multi-national country and not a multi-racial country. We have also frequently said that the Government is helping these people to help themselves. That is why the hon. the Prime Minister came here only las year with the sterling idea of a Cabinet council and a say in statutory bodies. I maintain that we cannot get away from the fact that South Africa is a country of separate peoples. South Africa is a country in which we have separate administrative institutions for each people. We now have a party which has been elected to the CRC as a majority party. They have a majority of votes. We are not unhappy at the fact that the Labour Party has won the election [Interjections.] On the contrary. They have regularly been invited by the hon. the Minister to discuss matters with the Government, and they have refused; we are now looking forward to the day when Mr. Leon will come to discuss matters with the hon. the Prime Minister. He will come, and I want to tell you at this juncture that Mr. Sonny Leon is going to <span class="col_3363-3364" refersTo="page_0095"/>adopt a very responsible standpoint when he discusses matters with the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I defer to your ruling. It has been said that the CRC is useless. It has been said that the CRC has no role to play. This legislation before us is not intended to deprive the CRC of any authority or to reduce the legislative power of the CRC. Let us admit at once that there are many bodies&#x2014;and representatives of some of them are sitting in this House&#x2014;which hope and pray that disintegration will in fact take place. If it were to happen that there are bodies which were to refuse to act in terms of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act the Minister will then be able to take action.</p>

<p>Sir, in whose interest is this Pill&#x003F; This Bill is in the interests of South Africa as a whole, not only in the interests of the Coloureds who are administred by the CRC. This Bill is in the interests of South Africa as a whole, for there is one thing we must guard against and which we must make it our task to ensure does not happen, and that is that conditions of chaos do not arise in our internal relations. There are people. Sir, who said that Mr. Leon of the Labour Party should confront the Government and that he should refuse to keep the machinery of the CRC oiled and to operate it. Fortunately the hon. gentleman has indicated that he is willing to co-operate. Mr. Speaker, you have tied me down a little with your ruling. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said: &#x201C;There will be no confrontation: who says that these people in the CRC will not co-operate&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, when I am rearing my child, I do not wait until he has reached the age of majority before I teach him discipline in life. He must go through the evolutionary process of growth before he comes of age. We admit that we are moving along a course of evolutionary growth, political and otherwise and for that reason I say that this Bill before this House was not introduced because we think that conditions will arise tomorrow or the day after under which the CRC will not be able to operate. This Bill is simply a precautionary measure, just as any parent, in educating his child adopts precautionary measures to ensure that one day, when that child has to stand on his own feet, when he is of age, he will be able to do so firmly and live a responsible life. This Bill is there to ensure that if irresponsible action is taken, no harm will come to the machine of this organization.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to conclude by saying that a great deal of propaganda has been made against this legislation, that a great deal has been written about this legislation, and that a great deal of blood has been sucked out of this legislation. We have had quite a number of political bats who have sucked blood from this legislation, people who have tried to cast suspicion on it, people who have tried to tell the Coloureds: &#x201C;Do you see, the Whites are not to be trusted; the Whites are playing you false.&#x201D; What we are doing here this afternoon is simply to make administrative arrangements so that if things go wrong, the Minister will have the power to ensure that the administration of the CRC continues as it has to. Sir, the Government wants to and the Government will ensure that there is orderly administration in the CRC. The Government wants to and the Government will give the Labour Party an opportunity to accept and exercise the responsibility of a majority party. I am confident that there will be sufficiently balanced and positive thinking on the part of many of our Coloured leaders to cause them to refrain from allowing that what has already been achieve through the machinery of the CRC to be broken down and demolished as a result of negativism.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Worcester has spoken in general platitudes concerning this Bill. Every single thing that he said was in fact an argument against the passing of this Bill. One of his arguments was that if you do not support this Bill and if these powers are not given to the Minister, there will be a feeling amongst the Coloured people that the White people have no faith and no confidence. He then went on to deal with the question of South Africa being what he called a &#x201C;veelvolkige land&#x201D; and not a &#x201C;veelrassige land&#x201D;. Sir, what relevance does that have&#x003F; Whether you say this country is multi-national or multi-racial, it does not matter, because in both of those terms you acknowledge that the Coloured people are a &#x201C;volk&#x201D; or a &#x201C;nasie&#x201D;, or whatever you <span class="col_3365-3366" refersTo="page_0096"/>want to call them, within the Republic of South Africa. So long as they are within the Republic of South Africa you have to give them a real stake and a real share in the responsibility and power within the country. And where is there a homeland for these people if they are a separate &#x201C;volk&#x201D;&#x003F; If they had a homeland, one might be able to justify some of what that hon. member said, but this Bill is about more than that. This Bill is about basic, simple democracy, and so long as this Government, while pretending that it has a goal and a policy which are aimed in any way towards accomodating the people of South Africa, and in terms of which the Coloured people are admitted to be a permanent part of South Africa, introduces this kind of legislation, the chances of achieving any kind of accommodation are absolutely nil. But we are talking about basic democracy. This is what the Bill is supposed to be about, what the Act is supposed to be about. In terms of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, democracy is supposed to be being given to the Coloured people. How is it that the hon. the Minister comes here today and presents a Bill like this in the circumstances in which he did&#x003F; The CRC by itself has failed to produce any meaningful answers to the legitimate aspirations of the Coloured people. It has completely failed. If that were not so, then the Federal Party would have been re-elected, because it was the Federal Party which got the support it did in the last election on the basis that it was a party which was prepared to follow Government policy and was prepared to use the CRC for that purpose, and it failed to deliver the goods. That is one of the reasons why we find today that the Federal Party suffered a monumental defeat. They lost votes as compared with the votes cast last time. The Labour Party gained enormously on the votes which were cast last time. The other factor was that there was an enormous amount, a huge proportion, of the voters who abstained from voting because such was their lack of confidence in the CRC as that CRC was being administered. What the hon. the Minister is in effect saying in this Bill is this: &#x201C;This CRC can work only if we have a party in power in that CRC with certain principles. Once you get a party with different principles, it cannot work, and I must take over the powers in every respect, in respect of the council, in respect of the executive, and in respect of the chairman of the executive.&#x201D; Sir, the whole operation is a panic operation. It is like saying &#x201C;boo&#x201D; to a goose and you see them all flying. What happens is that Sonny Leon says &#x201C;boo&#x201D; and the hon. the Minister scatters in a panic like a chicken with its head chopped off.</p>

<p>The Minister is the one who is being irresponsible. I am not sure that this Government is not in fact being reckless in respect of race relations in introducing this Bill at this stage. The hon. member for Piketberg&#x2014;I am sorry that he is not here&#x2014;attacked the Coloured Labour Party and Sonny Leon and all the things that they said, but they won the election. They are now entitled to be the government. Despite that the hon. the Minister brings the Bill here without having had any consultation with the party that is entitled to be the government in the CRC. The hon. member for Piketberg as well on the same refrain says that the Nationalist Government wants the Coloureds to govern themselves in all matters that concern them. That is their objective. Nevertheless they are afraid that the Coloured people about whom he spoke will boycott the only constitutional instrument which this Government is prepared to give them. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he thinks that the CRC is going to have any chance of working or whether he thinks that he is not going to use the powers that he wants to take in this Bill all the time unless he squares up to what the hon. member for Worcester said and what the hon. member for Piketberg said, and that is to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Coloured people and to recognize them as South African citizens who have a right to a voice and a sharing in the determination of those matters which concern the Coloured people in a central government body, whatever that might be. The hon. the Minister must face up to the fact that you cannot have two sovereign Parliaments within one country. You cannot have a Coloured sovereign Parliament and a White sovereign Parliament in one country.</p>

He has not told us why he did not consult the Labour Party and no one else has bothered to tell us why.

Dialogue is more important than anything else at the moment in our country and in Capricorn Africa.

<p>Yes, but what I want to say is that dialogue not only involves good faith, but dialogue in South Africa is in fact necessary to provide good faith and trust in one another&#x2019;s objectives, that is to say the objectives of the White people, the Coloured people, the Indian people and the African people. That is its object. Indeed, it is the Government&#x2019;s duty to provide this goodwill between the race groups through dialogue. If one cannot achieve this with the Coloured people in South Africa, with whom can one achieve it&#x003F; If the Government cannot achieve it with the Coloured people, with what other race group can the Government achieve dialogue, let alone accord&#x003F; The hon. the Minister, in introducing this Bill, has probably prevented himself and the Government from having the necessary dialogue which will lead to some solution based upon accord on both sides. In introducing this Bill the hon. the Minister is in danger of destroying&#x2014;and if it is passed will destroy&#x2014;the very purpose of the Act it seeks to amend. The very purpose of the Act this Bill seeks to amend is that the Coloured people should themselves administer and legislate in respect of their own affairs.

<p>Furthermore, in two paragraphs this Bill will do more damage to race relations than anything I can think of that has been introduced by this Government in the last few years. An unnecessary deliberate act at this stage will do untold damage to race relations. What it is going to do, and this is the problem, is that it is going to undermine any trust there is in White people. I very much regret to say that the Coloureds, Blacks and indeed some Indians regard the White people as one and they regard the Government as representing the White people. It is going to produce a lack of trust which this Government is going to feel in many other fields, not only in the field of Coloured relations, but also in the field of Indian relations and Black relations. At a time when we have an executive committee which was elected by a Federal Party majority in the CRC, we hear nothing from the hon. the Minister, when introducing a Bill like this, to say that he is going to attempt to call the CRC together as soon as possible so that a new executive, which has the confidence of the council, can be appointed. The Minister goes ahead before any executive committee has been elected and he is doing nothing to speed up matters; he is walking straight into this thing, not even knowing what might happen at that council meeting. This adds to the insult and the farce of this Government&#x2019;s attitude. In the meantime the executive committee, elected by a now defunct CRC has, in fact, in terms of the Act, the power to carry on the functions of the CRC while it is not sitting. For how much longer must this go on&#x003F; Is the hon. gentleman going to call an early meeting of the CRC so that the whole question can be resolved&#x003F; No, there is no indication of this. The situation gets worse, however. <span class="col_3369-3370" refersTo="page_0098"/>The Act applies to South African citizens. One of the qualifications to vote, apart from being a Coloured person, is South African citizenship. If the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude towards South African citizens, which the Act acknowledges them to be, is going to be the attitude embodied in this Bill, I do not think the hon. the Minister can expect anyone to believe anything he says about the Government&#x2019;s intentions in the field of race relations with regard to Coloured people, least of all the Coloured people. This is the whole problem. There is an absolute failure and inability on the part of the Government to grasp the essence of the problem, and the essence of this problem is that we are all citizens in one country. We must be sharing this country by some or other formula. There must not be a dishing out of powers, as is done in terms of this Act. The Coloured people must not be told to do only what one wants them to do. Unless there can be fuller participation, when the destinies of all of us are to be determined, there will never be any progress in the field of race relations with the Coloureds. My hon. leader has said that a federal system is what we would like, but if the Government does not adopt it, it is going to be obliged to provide representation in that place which determines the destiny of the Coloured people. That has its dangers in Parliament. The federal system, however, avoids all those dangers. If the hon. the Minister will not face up to that problems, however he is never going to achieve anything through the CRC alone. The Bill gives the hon. the Minister the power to exercise or perform any power, function or duty conferred or imposed by the Act on the council, the executive or the chairman of the executive. One would like to ask him what powers he has in mind that he wants. He already has the power to appropriate moneys. The amendment of 1972 provided that if the council would not appropriate certain money, the Minister could do so. The matter could then be dealt with by the executive. In anticipation of some event then occurring, the Government stated that if the executive did not appropriate the money and allocate it, the Minister would have the power to do so. He therefore has that power now. Having that power, what powers does he now want&#x003F; He has said that administrative functions are mainly involved. If it is administrative functions that are mainly involved, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister why he is casting his net so wide. Why does he only exclude from those functions, if they are purely administrative, the function of legislation&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has said that he will move an amendment in the Committee Stage to the effect that the Bill should exclude the power to legislate so that he will be able to assume all their functions and powers excepting the power to legislate. That is a big deal. Why does this come so suddenly&#x003F; Does it not indicate that there is a sudden flurry of panic on that side of the House&#x003F; Somebody said&#x2014;unfortunately I have forgotten who it was&#x2014;that the Bill had been conceived a long time ago and that the current elections had nothing to do with it. Here, on the day that we debate the Second Reading of the Bill, the hon. the Minister suddenly says in his opening speech that he will move an amendment to exclude the legislative power. One can only assume that it was done in such a hurry that he had no time to think of that before and that that is the reason why he moves the amendment at this stage. Let met tell the hon. the Minister that, as he ought to know, the practice is that a Minister may put an amendment on the Order Paper before the Second Reading. Then the amendment is printed. He is the only one who is entilled to do so. No one else is. The Bill may then be regarded at the Second Reading as if that amendment were part of the Bill. However, this is not even happening. The amendment is not even on the Order Paper. This is an example of his panic. What about the other powers which he is going to take&#x003F; Section 20 of the principal Act deals with the general functions of the Council and liaison with the Government. Some of the functions of the council which the Government proposes to give to the hon. the Minister&#x2014; just to show hon. members how ill-conceived this Bill is and how panic-laden and fright-laden it is&#x2014;are to advise the Government upon request in regard to all matters affecting the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured people, to make recommendations to the Government in regard to all matters affecting the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured population of the Republic, to make recommendations to the Government in regard to any planning calculated, in the opinion of the council, to promote the best interests of the Coloured population and generally to serve as a link and means of <span class="col_3371-3372" refersTo="page_0099"/>contact and consultation between the Government and the Coloured population. It would be grotesque, in any event, for the hon. the Minister to have the powers to legislate on behalf of the council, but would it not be even more grotesque to have the Bill encompass provisions like the ones we have before us&#x003F; Does it not further indicate the lack of thought behind this Bill&#x003F; Does it not indicate that it is a panic measure which the hon. the Minister should give more thought to and on which he should take the advice of my hon. leader by withdrawing the Bill now or by adjourning the debate on this Bill so that he can go and think again and talk to people&#x003F; This is even more absurd and bizarre because the person whose function it is to make recommendations is the Minister himself. The situation that this amendment is going to bring about, if the hon. the Minister exercises his power, is that there will be no body representing the voice of the Coloured people when the Government wishes to consult with them. This is what the Government anticipates will happen. This body is already controlled. That is the reason why I find this whole Bill so extraordinary. I find it difficult to understand why the hon. the Minister considers it necessary at all. This CRC is supposed to get more and more powers. Ten years ago, when it was constituted, it was thought that ten years hence it would have control of almost all its own affairs. The Government has more restrictive and controlling powers over this council for the Coloured people than it has over any other representative council which was intended to be a fully and properly democratic legislative body. At this stage and in respect of this body this Bill is introduced. Do you realize, Mr. Speaker, that the State President and therefore the Government nominates the chairman of the executive committee&#x003F; The State President may remove the chairman of the executive committee at any stage. The Government nominates one-third of the members of the council. The Minister, the Secretary for Coloured Affairs or his deputy is entitled to attend and to take part in the meetings of the executive and of the council. Furthermore, no laws can be introduced without the approval of the hon. the Minister and, even if they are passed, they still require the consent of the Government which may send such a Bill back with whatever comments it wants to make. The procedure is that when the council is not in session, the executive exercises the powers. When there are not enough members of the executive to form a quorum of three, the chairman who is appointed and can be fired by the Government at any time, assumes all the powers of the executive. In other words, even at this moment one person, who can be nominated and dismissed by the Government, can carry the can or have all the power if that which the hon. the Minister fears, happens. That being so, why cannot this Bill wait&#x003F; Why is it so urgent&#x003F; Of course the Bill could wait if the hon. the Minister in fact wanted to have dialogue with the Coloured people. There is no danger at all of its collapsing. Provision has been made for the money voted by this Parliament to be properly appropriated if there is no one else to do it. Provision has been made for the Government to continue even if the executive resigns, since the Government-appointed chairman can take over. As I understand it, the quorum in respect of the council is only 20. As far as that is concerned, I have no doubt that when the nominations have been made, consideration will be given to having a quorum of 20 Federal Party people. No reason has been advanced why this Bill cannot wait until proper consultation has taken place. There is every reason to believe that, even if the very worst happened, the situation could be contained as the hon. the Minister and other members, who have spoken, have pointed out. The introduction of this Bill is a clumsy, capricious action on the part of this Government, an action which can only do race relations, our international image, our good sense and our own <i>bona fides</i> in respect of race relations the utmost harm.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while I sat listening to the hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, my thoughts went far back over a period of 20 years and more in this House. It has been said repeatedly here this afternoon that the introduction of this Bill means the &#x201C;collapse&#x201D; of the Government&#x2019;s policy, that we have reached a deadlock. I still remember well, when we established separate universities&#x2014; I just want to refer to that&#x2014;that there was also talk of a &#x201C;collapse&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am trying to arrive at a confrontation with them. The language which they use, is known to us. We know the words &#x201C;collapse&#x201D; and &#x201C;ineenstorting&#x201D;, which they used in this debate.</p>

<p>What are we dealing with here&#x003F; We are dealing with a Bill which has to do with an institution in our country. There are no two ways about it. We are dealing here with a political institution for a certain population group. It is a political institution which was created by a Government which has a specific policy. [Interjections.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>This policy of the Government cannot be changed unless there is a change of Government. Let us get back to earth. This institution, the CRC, will not cease to exist before the National Party ceases to govern. That is the first point which I want to make, and there are no two ways about it.</p>

<p>If I cast a prophetic gaze into the future and consider the possibility of the Opposition coming into power one day to dismantle the CRC, I see no horizon. There will no longer be any horizon, because according to the present political tendency in our country, or projections which one could make for the future, there is no sign which indicates that the CRC can ever cease to exist as a political institution in service of the Coloured population. Look at how the hon. members are seated on the opposite side of the House&#x2014;there are three groups! Two of them had hardly come together than, according to the latest information, they began to fight.</p>

<p>In the second place we are dealing here with entrenching legislation. This legislation is an attempt to entrench this institution against possible erosion, undermining or obstruction in the execution of its functions. For this reason I call this legislation an attempt at entrenchment. The Government has a mandate to implement its policy, and this particular political institution is based on the Government&#x2019;s policy construction. This institution has been established in terms of its policy and a mandate which it received, and when the Government has a suspicion that that institution may be assailed, the Government has a duty to entrench the interests, identity and autonomy of that institution. Therefore, this is an entrenching Bill.</p>

<p>In the third place the lifetime of the CRC&#x2014;and this they must hear&#x2014;will be the same as the lifetime of the National Party. When I say this, I mean that the National Party will look after this institution in the period of its existence, which will be a long one according to all reasonable political projections, just as it has looked after the other institutions which it has established in the interests of other population groups. We have established universities and educational institutions in spite of vehement opposition from that side of the House. If at that time we had conceded and listened to the arguments which came from that side, none of the Black universities, nor the University of the Western Cape would have existed. At that time they were called &#x201C;tribal institutions&#x201D;. They were also called &#x201C;bush institutions&#x201D;. The same road will be followed with this political institution, the CRC. They can say what they like, and Mr. Sonny Leon can say what he likes, but he cannot do what he likes, because there is a democratic system in this country in terms of which the Government and the hon. Opposition took part in the election. Whatever might happen, the CRC will execute its functions. Not only will it execute its functions, it will grow and flourish just like the other institutions which were created and developed by the National Party until it is far above the criticism which was levelled at it in the initial stages from the Opposition side. So, too, the CRC will grow out of this morass of criticism into which the Opposition has dragged it today in this debate.</p>

<p>Therefore the first point is that the lifetime of the CRC will be at least as long as the rule of the National Party. I do not know what is going to happen in 10 years&#x2019; time. One who is on a road of development, and a creative party, such as the National Party can give no assurance that the CRC will always remain static and in the same political constitutional mould as that in which it is now cast. What I do say, is that as long as the National Party governs, there will be a CRC. Whether or not it will command a greater dispensation of powers in another form on the road of development, or will develop into other canalized power formations, it will continue to exist in the basic concept of the CRC of today and as a political institution <span class="col_3375-3376" refersTo="page_0101"/>which will satisfy and serve the political interests of the Coloureds. It will continue to exist as such. That is the first point, and the first phase of its development.</p>

<p>The second phase I have in fact mentioned already. It does not matter whether the Labour Party is in power and nor does it matter whether the Federal Party is going to take over, but of one thing I am positively certain and that is that it will not be possible to halt development. The National Party, which is the creator of this institution, will not be able to halt that development. I am not even mentioning the Opposition. In our inability to stop any further development, we shall also be burdened with a responsibility. Which responsibility is that&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes I shall listen to what you say. In the course of its development, the CRC will bring about greater and closer co-operation between White and Brown in South Africa. That I predict today and therefore I am prepared to entrench its existence. After all, I am not a politician for nothing. I have an ideal and a projection which I make and therefore I am here in Parliament. Therefore I am a politician and I fight for that in which I believe. However much the CRC has been criticized and however halting the progress it makes and however helplessly incapable it may be and appear to be, I believe, as a member of Parliament, as a man who loves my country and as a man who, just like others, wants to see the correct relations developing from the complicated structure of our population, that this institution is worthy of entrenchment. In the third place, I believe that the CRC is the beginning and a contemporary of a totally new political concept which was born after the Second World War, and therefore I want to entrench it. That is why I believe in this Bill and that is why I support it because it is actually a Bill which makes the necessary provision should any interference take place in respect of this institution. And this concept&#x2014;and this the Opposition has clearly stated by implication today; it runs like a thread through all their arguments&#x2014;is the concept of political identity which is actually implicitly built into this CRC, a political identity which must grow together with the development of this CRC among the Coloured community. Sir, political identity is valid and is possible within the concept of the National Party&#x2019;s policy in respect of the Coloureds. There is no country in the world which has political autonomy. I do not say the Coloureds should reach political autonomy. They cannot. We Whites are not even politically autonomous. The mighty America is not even politically autonomous.</p>

<p>Therefore the CRC is worthy of entrenchment because, in the normal development which it will undergo as an institution, it will also give impetus and form to the development of a political concept which makes it possible for the Coloured to find a place for themselves within the framework of the National Party policy as political people with a political identity without their becoming politically autonomous or economically autonomous. It is for this reason that I support this legislation whole-heartedly.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Carletonville is an example to a young politician like myself, and I would like to say right away that I find his idealism, after having been in politics for such a long time, infectious and something to be lauded. I am sure that being an honest politician he would not deny Opposition members their idealism, and if that idealism differs from his own then this is enough ground for political debate. He links his own idealism to the concept of a political identity of a particular group, and I think this is one of the fundamental dilemmas that we are confronted with in a Bill of this nature, namely that this group itself <span class="col_3377-3378" refersTo="page_0102"/>has a very small role to play in the formation of the identity that the Government has in mind for it.</p>

<p>But I do not want to get involved in general arguments, Sir. I should like to turn to some very specific questions that I should like to pose to the hon. the Minister. I should like to pay particular attention to three pieces of legislation, the Transkei Constitution Act of 1963, the Coloured Representative Council Act of 1964 and the present Bill before us. In terms of these three pieces of legislation I should like to pose very specific questions to the hon. the Minister. I hope you will bear with me, Mr. Speaker, if I do so in the language which has predominated on that side of the House when referring to this Bill and to the Coloured population. It is the language&#x2014;I do not mean it derogatorily&#x2014;of political paternalism. The members for Waterberg, Piketberg, Oudtshoorn and Worcester and also the hon. member for Carletonville just a short while ago used the language of political paternalism when they defended the Bill. They referred to the Coloured population as a group of people in our society &#x201C;on the road towards political maturity&#x201D;. They referred to their responsibility in this development as &#x201C;that of emancipating them&#x201D;. They referred to them as &#x201C;children&#x201D;. One hon. member on my left said that they were &#x201C;political children who have to be protected, have to be led on the way to political maturity&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>Why don&#x2019;t you use the word &#x201C;guardianship&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>I am quite happy to do so, because that word is part of the language of political paternalism in any case. It infers that some person accepts political responsibility for the political future of another group and creates institutions by means of which the other group presumably will eventually reach maturity. I think this is the whole tenor of the discussion by hon. members on that side of the House.</p>

<p>When one uses a phrase like &#x201C;political emancipation&#x201D; or &#x201C;political maturity&#x201D; it can only mean one thing both historically and technically, viz. that the group to which it refers will eventually have full political autonomy, that it will eventually be in a position to decide completely independently on its own affairs and that it will be able to govern itself as an independent unit. I am sorry that the hon. member for Carletonville is not present at the moment, because I should have liked to ask him where he envisages the Coloured people will be located in a physical sense when this happens.</p>

<p>Having said this, I pose this question: What kind of instruments, what kind of institutions does the Government use in order to lead the Coloured people to political maturity&#x003F; Of course, it uses the CRC which is in a sense in terms of the Government&#x2019;s policy the symbol of the degree of maturity, of the degree of autonomy that the Coloured people at this particular time in their history enjoy as a political entity in South Africa. This institution, viewed in the light of the paternalistic attitude towards the Coloureds&#x2014;or guardianship attitude as the former Chief Whip prefers&#x2014;will then presumably reflect the confidence which the Government has at present in the Coloured population as a group, the confidence the Government has in the maturity of the Coloureds on their road to development. It will also reflect the confidence which the Government has in its own policy of political paternalism towards the Coloureds. It will demonstrate to the Government how its town policy is unfolding in this regard. In the language of paternalism the CRC reflects the trust that the father has in his child and in the developmental potential of his child as well as in its own child-rearing practices. It is from this perspective that I think we must look at this Bill. We must also look at the institution which is being affected by the introduction of the Bill.</p>

<p>When we look at the Coloured Representative Council Act of 1964, two things immediately become obvious and these are the questions I should like to pose the hon. the Minister. The first is that the executive powers of this institution are severely circumscribed in terms of section 17. This has been said often enough before and I shall not go into it in detail. The Minister can appoint and dismiss the chairman of the executive of the council in bis own discretion. In terms of section 17(6)(a) certain powers are given to the council powers in respect of finance, local government, pensions, etc. However, in terms of section 22(2A) which is to be deleted if the Bill is enacted, the Minister can in any case, if he wants to, appropriate funds in order to see that these functions are fulfilled. Therefore we can see that from an executive point of view it is highly unlikely that this institution which is supposed to lead the Coloured <span class="col_3379-3380" refersTo="page_0103"/>to a situation of political maturity can take any executive action that would be in conflict with or contrary to the desires of the Minister or this Parliament. In addition&#x2014; this to me is an interesting situation&#x2014;we find in the Coloured Representative Council Act of 1964 that in a sense this institution has no independent legislative authority whatsoever, if we look at section 21(2) and section 23(1) we find that no Bill can be passed in that institution without the approval of this House and in particular the State President. Even if a Bill is proposed there it needs the approval of the Minister beforehand. I would like to ask the Minister, because he mentioned the possibility of an amendment to the Bill he is introducing today, what the significance is of withdrawing the particular provision in this Bill which states that he may exercise legislative powers as well. What independent legislative powers does this institution have in any case&#x003F; I am quite prepared to concede if I have made a mistake. I have studied the Act very carefully and as far as I can see the CRC has no autonomous independent legislative functions or powers in any case. It is dependent in the last analysis on this Parliament for any Bill that passes through that council and, in the last analysis, on the State President, because he has to give his assent to any Bill that is proposed in the CRC. Therefore, to come back to the language of paternalism one could say that the CRC is in a sense a present that a father gives to a child. Let us say it is a toy car that has all the trappings and the pretence of a real motor-car, but it does not have an engine. It has two little pedals the child can pedal if he wants to, with great exertion, and, with the handing over of the present&#x2014;the introduction of this Bill&#x2014;the father, or the Minister, tells the child: &#x201C;Whenever you are naughty I am going to take those pedals away and I am going to play with this car.&#x201D; This Bill says in effect that for whatever reason &#x2026; [Interjections.] I am just using the language hon. members have been using right throughout this debate when referring to the Coloured population as political minors. If one looks at the present constitution of the CRC there is no other way of describing the Government&#x2019;s attitude to the Coloureds than as regarding them as political minors. I do not mean this in an insulting sense, I am using the phrase the hon. ex-Chief Whip used. The Government is the guardian of the Coloureds. One is only the guardian of someone who is a minor. One is not the guardian of someone who is an adult. The Coloured is a political minor in terms of the policy of the present Government. This means, if one looks at the way the CRC is presently constituted, that they are political minors. But with the introduction of this Bill we go a little further. They are no longer political minors, but are now, in a sense, confined to a political orphanage. This Bill appropriates their powers and gives these powers to the Minister. The limited powers the CRC had in any case are now appropriated for the Minister. The Minister, as the representative of this Government&#x2014;again using the language of paternalism or guardianship of the ex-Chief Whip&#x2014;is saying: &#x201C;We do not care how much you scream and shout, we do not care how you try to enforce your demands. We will determine as long as we are in power how you will use that institution, what laws will pass through that institution and what executive decisions you will take in that institution, and you can like it or lump it.&#x201D; This was also very forcibly stated by the hon. member for Carletonville. This is exactly the language that has been used by hon. members on the other side of the House and I am not saying anything new. [Interjections.] It has been used by every speaker on the other side and that is why I say it is the language of political paternalism. So much for the language of paternalism.</p>

<p>What is the motivation for this Bill&#x003F; Here again I want to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions. The hon. the Leader of the House castigated the Opposition for kicking up such a fuss about this particular Bill. He said that in the Transkei Constitution Act of 1963 there was a similar provision and asked why the Opposition should get so excited about it now. My first reaction is to say: &#x201C;So what&#x003F;&#x201D; Two wrongs do not make a right. One does not justify a mistake by recounting how many times one has made it in the past. But having looked at the Transkei Constitution Act, I am not sure that the particular reference the hon. the Minister referred to, namely section 71, is in fact comparable to the present Bill we have before us. If one <span class="col_3381-3382" refersTo="page_0104"/>looks at section 71, it is clear that this provision was introduced into the Transkei Constitution Act in an attempt to cope with the transition period. It states that power from this House has to pass to a new political institution and that the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development can, under such circumstances, assume such powers as are necessary in order to ensure that this new institution can function. In other words, I say that if the hon. the Minister refers to that particular section, as he has done, in justification of this Bill, I find myself a bit puzzled. I am puzzled because this Bill is not so much concerned with a transition period. This Bill is doing exactly the opposite. It is transferring power back to this House and is not coping with a period of transition to a new situation by instituting a new political body. If the hon. the Minister would consider looking at section 17 of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act, he will see there, I think, a provision with much closer similarity to section 71 of the Transkei Constitution Act. Section 17(8) of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act in fact states, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As from the date referred to in section 1(1) and until the constitution of an executive, the Minister shall, through such persons as he may deem fit, perform the functions and duties assigned to the executive by this Act.</block>

<p>I would argue, and I would like to know what the hon. the Minister thinks about this, that section 17(8) of the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act bears a greater similarity to section 71 of the Transkei Constitution Act in the sense that it tries to cope with a transition period.</p>

<p>Yes. The only difference is this particular phrase, &#x201C;and if necessary for ensuring the continuation of the administration and government &#x2026;&#x201D; I think that is the main difference. [Interjections.] I am glad the hon. the Minister concedes as much. However, why was it not introduced in the first instance when the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act was formulated in 1964, because the Transkei Constitution Act was formulated in 1963 and was available&#x003F; In that particular Bill, which is now an Act, it was clear at that stage that they were anticipating a transition period. I would now like to know from the hon. the Minister why this provision was not introduced in the first place and why it is necessary now. I say this irrespective of the merits of such a provision in an Act. I am saying that it seems to me that if he cannot explain why this particular provision was not in the original constitution of the CRC, then his motivation that it has now suddenly become necessary because of the concern about the administrative problems confronting the Government does not hold water.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>At the outset of this, my first Budget Speech, it is fitting for me to pay homage to my predecessor, Dr. Diederichs, who held this portfolio for eight years and who has now been elected to the highest office in this land. As Minister of Finance Dr. Diederichs distinguished himself particularly as a formidable champion of gold overseas, where he promoted the interests of South Africa with great dignity, conviction and success. His achievements in the field of domestic fiscal policy were, however, equally remarkable. He upheld the traditional South African financial conservatism, but also introduced important improvements to our fiscal structure in order to adjust our financial system to the requirements of the modern economy. The words of Confucius from whose works he loved to quote, are also applicable to him:</p>

<block name="quote">Only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under Heaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge &#x2014;only he is fitted to exercise rule.</block>

<p>It will be my endeavour to continue building on this firm foundation, with due regard to the fast-changing circumstances in South Africa and in the world.</p>

<p><i>General Economic Conditions</i></p>

<p>The Budgets of 1973 and 1974 gave particular emphasis to the promotion of economic growth. That this aim has been amply achieved is clear from the fact that the real gross domestic product increased during 1974 by no less than 7,2 per cent. The real gross national product, which takes into account the improvement in the terms of trade (due particularly to the increased gold price), rose by approximately 10 per cent. For South Africa 1974 was thus without doubt an exceptionally good growth year. Over the past two years the real national product per head of the population has risen at an average rate of 7 per cent per annum, which is an indication of the substantial rise in the standard of living of all sections of our population.</p>

<p>The rise in investment was a noteworthy characteristic of our economic growth in 1974. Gross as well as net real fixed investment rose by 8,5 per cent&#x2014;more than twice as fast as during 1973. In the case of private manufacturing the increase in gross real fixed investment during 1974 amounted to 22 per cent and the real fixed capital stock rose by 6,4 per cent. There was also an appreciable increase in investment in inventories. Private consumption expenditure, in contrast, rose relatively slowly, i.e. by 5,2 per cent at constant prices. The growth of the economy was consequently mainly an investment and export rather than a consumption-led upswing, which points to a healthy situation for our future development.</p>

<p>Another encouraging sign was the appreciable increase in gross domestic saving, namely by about R1 023 million to a level of more than 26 per cent of the gross domestic product.</p>

<p>Most sectors of the economy shared in this rapid growth. In the case of agriculture, thanks to favourable weather conditions, 1974 was a particularly good year, and the total gross income of farmers rose by 29 per cent. Only in the case of the wool and karakul farmers was the gross income below that of 1973.</p>

<p>The physical volume of gold produced declined by 11,2 per cent mainly as a result of the mining of lower grade ore, but the average gold price on the private market rose by 66 per cent. Excluding gold, the volume of mining production over the first ten months of 1974 was approximately 12,5 per cent higher than during the corresponding period of 1973.</p>

<p>In the case of manufacturing, 1974 in general also turned out to be a good year, and the physical volume of manufacturing output rose by approximately 6 per cent. The rise occurred mainly, however, during the first half and production has since levelled off.</p>

<p>The building industry has also levelled off during 1974, but the construction industry <span class="col_3385-3386" refersTo="page_0106"/>maintained a relatively high rate of growth.</p>

<p>In commerce 1974 saw a rise of 6,8 per cent in the volume of retail sales and 9,9 per cent in the volume of wholesale sales. In contrast with the position abroad, where in many countries there is talk of a crisis in the motor industry, the number of new motor vehicles sold in the Republic in 1974 remained practically constant; in comparison with 1973 there was a decline of only 0,1 per cent.</p>

<p>Although for the year 1974 as a whole a strong boom was experienced in the South African economy, this boom started to level off during the second half of the year. I have already referred to this tendency in manufacturing output and similar tendencies are reflected in several other economic indicators, such as the value of building plans passed, the volume of wholesale and retail sales and the volume of imports. The number of registered unemployed persons rose slightly after August 1974, but is still very low. The levelling off should in fact be seen as a temporary phase of consolidation after the attainment of a cyclical peak&#x2014;a normal phenomenon which is to be welcomed from more than one point of view, because it brings with it a lessening of the financial and other stresses built up in the economy during the boom.</p>

<p>As is the case in most countries, inflation in South Africa remains an unsatisfactory characteristic of the economic situation. The average seasonally adjusted consumer price index was 11,6 per cent higher in 1974 than in 1973. The high prices of imported goods undoubtedly played a major role in our inflation, as indicated by the large rise of 27,7 per cent between December 1973 and December 1974 in the seasonally adjusted wholesale price index of imported goods, compared with a rise of 16,9 per cent in the index of goods produced in South Africa.</p>

<p>As against these rates of inflation the average salaries and wages per employee in the non-agricultural sectors during the first nine months of 1974 were 15 per cent above those prevailing during the corresponding period of 1973. After allowing for price increases the real increase in average wages and salaries per employee in all the population groups during the same period amounted to 4 per cent; in the case of non-white employees the rise was 9,2 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Balance of Payments</i></p>

<p>During a boom period it is normal for imports to increase considerably, and the sharp rise in the price of oil and certain other imported goods intensified this trend. The value of exports, however, has also risen appreciably, mainly due to the higher average price levels current on international commodity markets. Substantial increases have been registered in the export of maize, sugar, diamonds and base metals. In addition the value of the net gold output rose by approximately 45 per cent to R2 565 million. The net result was a deficit of R836 million on the current account of the balance of payments, which amounted, however, to only 3,7 per cent of the gross domestic product. This is low compared with similar periods of rapid growth in the past.</p>

<p>The current deficit was largely covered by a net inflow of foreign capital amounting to about R741 million, of which about R598 million went to the private sector and R143 million to the central government and banking sector.</p>

<p>The annual data disguise a remarkable change in the trend of the main components of the balance of payments, which is connected with the changing trends in the domestic economy. Thus, for example, the value of imports rose at a slower rate from the third quarter, and during the second half of 1974 the volume in fact declined. The substantial inflow of capital occurred mainly in the second half of the year, principally due to the narrowing of the gap between local and overseas rates of interest and a decline in the availability of domestic bank credit.</p>

<p>After allowing for certain valuation adjustments the total gold and other foreign reserves declined during 1974 by only R67 million to a level of R909 million at the end of the year. If the gold component had been valued throughout at market price, total reserves over the year would in fact have shown a rise of about R960 million. During January and February 1975 the gold and other foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank rose by a further R18 million.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that in June 1974 we embarked on a policy of controlled floating of the value of the rand. <span class="col_3387-3388" refersTo="page_0107"/>Since then the rate of exchange of the rand has been adjusted nine times&#x2014;thrice in a downward direction and six times upwards. The effective rate of exchange of the rand <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> a weighted average of other currencies is now minimally lower than in June 1974, mainly due to the weakening of the rate of exchange of the US dollar compared with other currencies. It is, however, approximately the same as it was before the sterling devaluation of November 1967, and the rand can today undoubtedly be regarded as a strong currency.</p>

<p><i>Monetary Situation</i></p>

<p>The rapid rise in the growth rate of the economy in 1974 created exceptional stresses and problems for the banking sector. The demand for bank credit rose tremendously, but on the other hand the monetary authorities were forced, on account of the inception of demand inflation and the appreciable outflow of capital, to apply a more conservative monetary policy from the first half of 1974. The liquid asset requirements were, it is true, not increased but the large expansion of bank credit itself created liquidity problems for the banks and forced them to limit the expansion. Moreover, rates of interest were allowed to rise in accordance with market trends, which brought them more closely into line with interest rates abroad. This policy yielded good results and contributed to reducing excessive domestic demand and also to encouraging a substantial inflow of capital in the last months of 1974.</p>

<p>The moderately conservative policy of the authorities has, however, not prevented the amount of money and near-money from rising by 22% during 1974 (compared with 23% in 1973), nor the increase in bank credit to the private sector by R1 101 million.</p>

<p>With the cooling down of the economy during the past months the financial stresses have already been largely relieved. Despite a temporary tightening during the first weeks of March, conditions in the money market have generally become easier, the banks are finding themselves in a much more comfortable position and short-term rates have declined appreciably.</p>

<p>In the capital market conditions have also eased in recent months, as reflected in the moderate decline in long-term rates of interest. This falling trend has undoubtedly contributed to the notable success of the latest issues of Government stocks.</p>

<p>In line with many other countries the stock exchange (apart from gold mining shares) experienced a relatively poor year in respect of turnover as well as share prices. In contrast to this, the index of prices of gold mining shares rose by 69% over the year.</p>

<p>The flow of funds to building societies, though still substantial, was nevertheless lower in 1974 than during the previous year. This gave rise to more difficult conditions in the bond and fixed property market, which was reflected in turn in the easier conditions prevailing in the building industry. My Department remains constantly in close contact with the building societies in this connection.</p>

<p><i>Economic Prospects</i></p>

<p>An open economy such as that of South Africa must, of course, be influenced by conditions prevailing abroad. Here the picture does not appear to be favourable and many of our trading partners are suffering from a combination of recession, inflation and balance of payments disequilibrium. Nevertheless South Africa has thus far withstood the influence of these unfavourable factors quite well, and thanks to factors such as the high level of capital expenditure in the public sector and the expected further increase in non-gold mining activities, we can look forward to a year of reasonably stable growth. Due to the present cooling down of the economy and also because the prospects for agriculture, though favourable, clearly will not equal the record levels attained in 1974, the real growth rate in 1975 will be lower than the exceptionally high rate of the previous year. However, unless external factors exercise a much stronger unfavourable influence than can be foreseen at present, our economic growth rate should nevertheless still be relatively high, and we may even look forward to a new upswing towards the end of 1975.</p>

<p>As far as inflation is concerned it is fairly generally expected that the rate of price increases abroad will abate somewhat during 1975, mainly due to the reduction in excess demand and because it is not expected that the price of oil will again show such a large increase as it did during 1973-&#x2019;74. There does exist a danger, however, that in their understandable zeal to counter <span class="col_3389-3390" refersTo="page_0108"/>the present recession by means of stimulatory monetary and fiscal measures, the most important industrial powers could unleash a new wave of inflation.</p>

<p>The factors which could reduce the rate of inflation abroad, could also assist in holding back price increases in South Africa. Should the prices of our imports indeed fall or, at least, rise at a slower rate, it will assist us appreciably in our fight against inflation. Furthermore we may hope that food prices, which rose in 1974 by 18,4 per cent, will increase at a slower rate this year. There are therefore reasonable grounds for hoping that our rate of inflation will reach a turning point in the coming months.</p>

<p>South Africa&#x2019;s balance of payments prospects appear promising at present. As our economy finds itself temporarily in a consolidation phase, imports are not expected to show much more of a rise. At the same time the high price of gold should give rise to a further increase in the value of th;e net gold output. Despite the possible unfavourable effect of the world recession on certain of our exports, the deficit on current account will thus probably be relatively moderate in 1975, and this deficit could easily be covered by a reasonable inflow of foreign capital.</p>

<p><i>Conclusions for Economic Policy</i></p>

<p>I have indicated that the South African economy is at present experiencing a phase of slower growth, coupled with a rate of inflation, which though moderate by present day world standards, is nevertheless unsatisfactory. The decline in the growth rate should, however, be regarded as a normal phenomenon after a boom period which will result in an easing of certain stresses and strains in the economy and provide a breathing space for consolidation after the strong upswing of the past year. As far as State action is concerned, inflation is at present a more important problem. In order to choose suitable remedies against this malady we must analyse the causes of this affliction further.</p>

<p>Excessive monetary demand has indeed been in the past the main cause of inflation in South Africa, as it was in fact in the world as a whole. In these circumstances a restrictive monetary and fiscal policy is essential. Partly due to the conservative financial policy pursued last year, however, excess demand is not at present a problem. This is indicated by the general cooling down of the economy as well as by the more specific indicators such as the increase in unemployment (even though it is still slight), the slower rate of growth in real private consumption expenditure and the fall in the average level of the seasonally-adjusted utilization of manufacturing capacity, which declined from a peak of 91 per cent in February 1974 to approximately 88 per cent in November 1974. It is significant that industrialists attribute the increase in unused capacity mainly to insufficient demand.</p>

<p>The present inflation in South Africa should rather be seen as the cumulative result of a whole series of factors which asserted their influence over a period of years, including the rise in import prices, autonomous &#x201C;wage-push&#x201D; and other &#x201C;cost-push&#x201D; factors such as higher food prices, the appreciable rise in the wages of the lower-paid unskilled workers without, in many cases, a corresponding rise in their productivity, and finally the built-in expectations of further inflation.</p>

<p>In these circumstances an excessively restrictive fiscal and monetary policy will not help much in tempering the rate of inflation. It could rather intensify the present tendency of the economy to slow down and allow it to continue for too long, at the expense of our real economic growth and prosperity. The question in fact is the extent to which fiscal and monetary policy should be harnessed to stimulate actively total expenditure and activity as part and parcel of a positive anti-cyclical economic policy.</p>

<p>In this regard it is important to point out that the short-term policy of the monetary authorities has already been adjusted, since the fourth quarter of 1974, to the changing cyclical trend and has been made considerably more expansive. The liquid asset and cash reserve requirements of banking institutions have not been reduced, it is true, but the monetary authorities have indeed, as a matter of policy:</p>

<block name="quote">firstly, permitted the rate of increase in the quantity of money and near-money to rise appreciably to an annual rate of 43 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1974, mainly due to an exceptionally large increase in the net claims of the banking sector on the public sector;</block>

<block name="quote">secondly, permitted the liquidity of the banking institutions to rise appreciably, which of course substantially increased their ability to extend credit; and</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3391-3392" refersTo="page_0109"/>thirdly, permitted the money market (subject to temporary fluctuations) to become appreciably easier and short-term rates of interest to decline substantially.</block>

<p>These tendencies were not countered by the monetary authorities, for example, through an increase in the liquid asset requirements or by open market sales of Government stock, but were accepted as a desirable relaxation in the light of the cooling down of the economy. The present indications too are that, apart from seasonal shifts in funds, these broad monetary tendencies will still continue for some time to come.</p>

<p>In considering budgetary policy we should thus take account not only of the changing cyclical trends but also of the adjustments in monetary policy which have already taken place. It is clear that we also have to look ahead to the year 1976, when the next economic upswing will most probably already be on its way.</p>

<p>My conclusion is that the present Budget should, notwithstanding the inflation, be moderately stimulatory. The qualification &#x201C;moderately&#x201D;, however, is important, as otherwise we might in 1976 again find ourselves in a situation of demand inflation and balance of payments disequilibrium.</p>

<p>The fact that a strict fiscal and monetary policy is not, in today&#x2019;s conditions, the proper remedy against inflation, does not mean that the Government can do nothing and in fact does nothing about the problem. Several measures, as recommended by the Standing Committee on Inflation, have already been announced by the hon. the Prime Minister last week, and my colleague the Minister of Economic Affairs will now implement these measures. Once again, however, I want to stress very strongly the basic premise of the Advisory Committee, namely that inflation is a matter not only for the authorities or for this or that group in the community, but for everyone&#x2014;employers and employees, the Government and the private sector, producers and consumers.</p>

<p><i>The Financial Year 1974-&#x2019;75</i></p>

<p>The Government Accounts for the financial year ending 31 March 1975 are expected to show the following results.</p>

<p>Expenditure on Revenue Account is estimated at R4 328 million, which is R40 million or less than 1 per cent in excess of the original figure. The increase is mainly due to additional provision for Provincial subsidies as a result of higher salaries and prices. At R4 522 million the estimated revenue is also very close to the original figure of R4 544 million. Inland Revenue is expected to collect R43 million less than the original estimate, mainly due to lower receipts in respect of income tax from gold mines (R20 million), other companies (R15 million), and individuals (R15 million), but on the other hand customs duties are expected to net an additional R36 million. The expected surplus for the financial year is then R194 million.</p>

<p>The accumulated surpluses of previous years on Revenue Account amount to R248 million, that is, after providing for deficits on the Loan and South West Africa Accounts for 1973-&#x2019;74, for certain payments to the Reserve Bank and for a transfer of R6 million to the Loan Fund for Economic Co-operation as explained in the previous Budget. In the 1974 Budget Speech the prospect was held out that an amount of R200 million would be transferred to the Stabilization Account, but for reasons which will subsequently become clear this transfer will now no longer take place. The total balance on Revenue Account on 31 March 1975 is then estimated at R442 million.</p>

<p>On Loan Account expenditure is expected to amount to R1 208 million, which is R38 million less than the original figure. The reduction is due to the fact that the Department of Posts and Telecommunications will draw much less in loan funds than the amount provided for in the Budget. Due to the favourable conditions prevailing in the South African capital market internal loans netted R252 million more than originally estimated. I have consequently decided to raise fewer foreign loans (namely R212 million instead of R334 million). The Loan Account is then expected to close the financial year with a deficit of R189 million.</p>

<p>Due to slightly lower receipts and higher expenditure than originally expected, the South West Africa Account shows an estimated deficit of R22 million.</p>

<p>If the deficits on the Loan and South West Africa Accounts are covered from the surplus on Revenue Account, and if the usual transfer of R6 million is made to the Loan Fund for Economic Co-operation, the remaining balance on Revenue Account then amounts to R225 million.</p>

<p><span class="col_3393-3394" refersTo="page_0110"/><i>The Financial Year 1975-&#x2019;76</i></p>

<p><i>Expenditure on Revenue Account</i></p>

<p>For the financial year 1975-&#x2019;76 expenditure on Revenue Account is estimated to amount to R5 023 million, which is R695 million or 16 per cent in excess of the revised figure for the current financial year.</p>

<p>Though this may appear to be a substantial increase, it may be regarded as reasonable in the light of the present rate of inflation as well as the rate of growth of the economy. I can assure the House that the provision is essential and that it could only be contained within these limits with the whole-hearted co-operation of my colleagues.</p>

<p>The most important increase relates to the Vote Defence, where an amount of R948 million is requested&#x2014;36% more than in 1974-&#x2019;75. I am sure that the whole House will cherish with me the earnest hope that the Government&#x2019;s and the Prime Minister&#x2019;s efforts at d&#x00E9;tente in Southern Africa will be successful, but until that aim is unequivocally achieved it is imperative to enable our Defence Force to defend our borders effectively. No one with understanding of the situation will suspect us of aggressive intentions, but at the same time no one should imagine that we can be attacked with impunity. In the modern world defence is unfortunately extremely expensive, but it nevertheless remains a necessity.</p>

<p>There is an appreciable increase of 22% in the provision on the Vote National Education, mainly due to the increased subsidies to Universities in terms of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into Universities under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice J. van Wyk de Vries. I am sure that this provision will be generally welcomed.</p>

<p>Furthermore there is an increase of nearly 20% on the Vote Bantu Administration and Development due to enhanced payments to the Governments of the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>Besides the amounts included in the printed estimates I should like to propose certain additional expenditures.</p>

<p><i>Social Pensions</i></p>

<p>For many years this Government has not missed an opportunity to relieve the financial burden of the social pensioners of our country. This year it is my privilege to continue this sound practice, and I have pleasure in announcing further relief for social pensioners for the following financial year.</p>

<p>It is proposed that all social pensions for Whites, including the allowances payable to settlers and to parents receiving maintenance grants, be increased by R7 per month and that the bonus payable to war pensioners be increased by a further 10 per cent.</p>

<p>In addition, it is proposed that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the allowances payable to children&#x2019;s homes and to foster parents be increased by R4 per child per month;</li>

<li>(b) maintenance grants and family allowances and allowances payable in respect of the children of settlers be increased by R1,50 per child per month;</li>

<li>(c) place of safety allowances be in-created by 50 cents per child per day with effect from 1 April 1975.</li>

</ol>

<p>The subsidies payable to homes for the aged have already been increased with effect from 1 January 1975. It is, however, proposed that these subsidies be further increased as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Group I residents: by 50 cents per resident per month;</li>

<li>(b) Group II residents: by R3 per resident per month;</li>

<li>(c) Group III residents: by R5 per resident per month;</li>

<li>(d) Group IV residents: by R7 per resident per month.</li>

</ol>

<p>It is also proposed that the subsidies payable to institutions caring for handicapped persons be increased by R3 per person per month in cases where no suitably trained staff is available, and by R5 per month in cases where suitably trained staff is available.</p>

<p>Similar but suitably adjusted concessions are also proposed in the case of the other population groups. Further steps have been taken to reduce the existing gap in the pensions and allowances payable to the various population groups&#x2014;the additional cost involved in these steps alone amounts to R21 million per annum.</p>

<p><span class="col_3395-3396" refersTo="page_0111"/>All the concessions referred to are, where appropriate, also applicable in South West Africa.</p>

<p>In order to provide the Departments concerned with the opportunity to make the necessary arrangements, all these concessions (with the exception of those applicable to the place of safety allowances) will take effect from 1 October 1975.</p>

<p>The additional cost to the Exchequer is estimated at about R58 million per annum, and for the 1975-&#x2019;76 financial year at R29 million.</p>

<p>With the announcement of these concessions social pensions have, in the case of Whites, been increased by 68 per cent during the last five years, whilst the annual expenditure involved has risen by 88 per cent or more than R63 million from R71 million to R135 million. The expenditure on social pensions for the other population groups likewise shows a remarkable increase.</p>

<p>The total amount required on Revenue Account is then R5 052 million.</p>

<p><i>Revenue</i> 1975-&#x2019;76</p>

<p>The uncertain economic prospects abroad, coupled with the substantial fluctuations characteristic of the private gold market in the recent past, make it difficult to estimate accurately Government revenue for the next financial year.</p>

<p>In view of the present cooling down of the economy I expect that the collections of customs, excise, and sales duties will not show a particularly big increase above the figure for the present financial year. I estimate these at R1026 million. However, the taxable incomes of individuals and companies in most sectors should continue to rise at a reasonable rate, and I am of the opinion that the collection of Inland Revenue can increase at a rate of approximately 13 per cent. The figure appearing in the printed estimates under the heading Inland Revenue is R4 019 million, but after further consideration I am of the opinion that a figure of R3 993 million would be a more realistic estimate. Total revenue then amounts to R5 019 million, which is R33 million less than the estimated expenditure of R5 052 million.</p>

<p>How to cover this deficit is a problem which I shall deal with after explaining the position of the Loan Account.</p>

<p>&#x2020;<i>Loan Account</i> 1975-&#x2019;76</p>

<p>Expenditure on Loan Account is estimated at R1510 million, which is R302 million or 25 per cent higher than the revised figure for the current financial year. This is indeed a substantial increase, but here again the effects of inflation and of the rapid growth of the economy must be borne in mind. It is relevant and important to note that, in real terms, the gross fixed investment of the Central Government, including the Railways Administration and the Department of Posts and Telecommunications, was actually lower in 1974 than in 1973, whereas that of the private sector increased by 13,3 per cent.</p>

<p>The greatest increase in Loan Account expenditure is in respect of the loan to the Railways Administration, for which an amount of R427 million is requested&#x2014;50 per cent more than in the current year. The importance of an efficient railways and harbours system needs no emphasis and the provision is essential to enable the Administration to meet the rapidly-growing demands of our economy.</p>

<p>A substantial increase of R30 million or 35 per cent is required for the Department of Public Works, largely for certain urgent works required for defence purposes.</p>

<p>Loans to the Provinces, mainly for the construction of schools, hospitals and roads, show an increase of R22 million.</p>

<p>An increase of R39 million or 36 per cent is requested for the Department of Bantu Administration and Development, principally for the purchase of land and the development of Bantu areas by the South African Bantu Trust.</p>

<p>On the Industries Vote an amount of R70 million is required for the purchase of additional shares in Iscor. The steep escalation of construction costs and the current difficult conditions in the overseas capital markets make it possible, however, that a substantial further amount will have to be provided. Additional share capital can also be important in order to improve Iscor&#x2019;s debt ratio. Unfortunately I am not in a position at present to inform the House of the additional amount which may be necessary. The Treasury is studying the problem in collaboration with Iscor, and Parliament will be informed of the outcome in due course.</p>

<p>In addition to the estimated expenditure of R1 510 million, an amount of R827 million <span class="col_3397-3398" refersTo="page_0112"/>is required for loan repayments and miscellaneous items&#x2014;a total of R2 337 million.</p>

<p>For the financing of this expenditure, the following amounts are estimated to be available:</p>

</table>

<p>In addition, I estimate that we can raise further loans to an amount of R180 million locally and R140 million overseas, giving a total of R2 015 million. This still leaves a shortfall of R322 million.</p>

<p>I should like to say something at this point about the impression which seems to exist in some quarters that South Africa has borrowed abroad excessively. This is, I believe, a mistaken impression. During the past two years South Africa&#x2019;s total net capital inflow averaged less than R300 million per year, which is less than 1,5 per cent of the gross domestic product, as against a post-war average of nearly three per cent. Total net interest payments on non-direct investment in 1973 (the latest available figure) amounted to only R87 million. As far as the Government is concerned, its total foreign debt, adjusted for changes in exchange rates, increased in 1974 from R361 million to R509 million, which is equivalent at present prices to less than three months&#x2019; gold production. Interest on external Government debt for the financial year 1974-&#x2019;75 is estimated at R40 million, or less than 1 per cent of total State revenue. Clearly South Africa is in an incomparably more favourable position, as regards foreign debt, than most oil-importing countries, which have had to borrow very large amounts in order to finance their balance of payments deficits.</p>

<p><i>South West Africa Account</i> 1975-&#x2019;76</p>

<p>Expenditure on the South West Africa Account for the next financial year is estimated at R113 million, or 20 per cent above the figure for the current year. Revenue, after deduction of the statutory transfer to the Territorial Fund, is estimated at R77 million, leaving a deficit of R36 million. As is customary, provision will be made in the 1976-&#x2019;77 financial year to meet this shortfall.</p>

<p><i>Combination of Revenue and Loan Accounts</i></p>

<p>As already announced, it is the intention as from the 1976-77 financial year to combine the Revenue and Loan Accounts. This will, I believe, give a more meaningful picture of the State&#x2019;s finances than the present somewhat arbitrary division between the two accounts.</p>

<p>For the 1975-&#x2019;76 financial year, the significant figure is the combined shortfall at this point of R355 million of Revenue and Loan Accounts, for which provision has to be made.</p>

<p>Although I said earlier that the present economic situation demands a moderately expansionary budget, it is clear that a deficit of this magnitude should not, in present circumstances, be finanaced entirely from potentially inflationary sources.</p>

<p>There can therefore be no question of general deductions in taxation. On the contrary, I shall reluctantly have to seek some additional revenue. Before doing so, however, there are certain concessions which I wish to announce.</p>

<p><i>Tax Concessions</i></p>

<p>It is sometimes argued that all fixed rebates, exemptions, etc., in the tax laws should be adjusted upwards to take account of inflation. I have not heard the same arguments being advanced for the upward adjustment of the numerous specific customs and excise duties, stamp duties and other imposts in our tax system under similar conditions. In any case, this is a counsel of perfection. For many reasons, revenue even in a time of inflation does not always keep pace with expenditure, and in the circumstances of the present Budget such a general adjustment of rebates clearly cannot be considered. There are, however, a few cases where such adjustment is, in my view, justifiable.</p>

<p><i>Aged Persons</i></p>

<p>The first concession relates to the special income tax abatement for persons over 60. At present such persons are entitled to an <span class="col_3399-3400" refersTo="page_0113"/>abatement of R400, which is reduced by R2 for every R10 by which the taxpayer&#x2019;s income exceeds R5 000. I think that some further relief to old persons, whose incomes are often fixed in money terms, is justified, and I propose that the abatement be increased to R600. This will have the effect that a person over 60 will only become liable for income tax when his income exceeds R1 800 per annum for married and R1 300 for unmarried persons (instead of R1 600 and R1 100 respectively as at present), and the benefit will only disappear when a taxpayer&#x2019;s income reaches R14 000 for a married person or R13 000 for a single person. By way of example, the benefit of the abatement to a married person over 60 with an income of R7 000 per annum will now be R92. The loss of revenue in 1975-&#x2019;76 is estimated at R2,3 million.</p>

<p><i>Retirement Benefits</i></p>

<p>For similar reasons I should like to propose some relief in the tax treatment of certain retirement benefits. A lump sum payment by an employer to an employee on the latter&#x2019;s retirement is, on certain conditions, exempted from income tax up to an amount of R9 000. I propose that this exemption limit be raised to R12 000.</p>

<p>Likewise, I propose that the maximum tax-exempt lump sum benefit paid from a pension, provident or retirement annuity fund be raised from R30 000 to R40 000.</p>

<p>The loss of revenue from these two concessions in 1975-&#x2019;76 is expected to be R2,3 million.</p>

<p><i>Contributions to Pension and Retirement Annuity Funds</i></p>

<p>A taxpayer contributing to a pension fund is allowed to deduct his contributions, up to a maximum of R1 250 per annum, from his taxable income. In the case of a retirement annuity fund the maximum deduction is R2 500. In view of the need to make adequate provision for old age, and in order to encourage saving, I think an increase in the maximum deductions to R1 500 and R3 000 respectively is justified. The cost to the Exchequer will be R1,3 million per annum.</p>

<p><i>Estate Duty</i></p>

<p>While I cannot consider a general reduction in Estate Duty at the present time, I think that some increase in the deductions allowed in respect of investment in Government stock and the proceeds of life insurance policies is called for. This should also help to encourage saving. I therefore propose that the maximum deduction for this purpose be increased from R50 000 to R70 000, of which not more than R35 000 may be from the proceeds of insurance policies. The effect of this is that the estate of a man with a wife and three children need not become liable for estate duty until the net value of the estate, including Government stock and insurance policy proceeds, exceeds R195 000. The loss to the Exchequer is estimated at R3 million in a full financial year and R1 million in 1975-76.</p>

<p><i>Married Women</i></p>

<p>At present a deduction of R600 is allowed from the earnings of a married woman for the purpose of determining the husband&#x2019;s taxable income (in which the wife&#x2019;s income is included).</p>

<p>At the risk of being suspected of male chauvinism I would say that this deduction has, in my view, some unsound aspects and creates anomalies in the taxation of families with similar incomes. I believe that a more intensive study of the whole problem of the taxation of the income of married women is called for as there are many facets to be considered. The Department of Inland Revenue, in co-operation with, the Standing Commission on Taxation, will therefore inquire into the problem in greater depth.</p>

<p>In this Year of the Woman, however, and in view of the rise in prices since the deduction was fixed at its present level in 1973, I believe that some adjustment is justified, and I therefore propose that the deduction be increased to R750. The cost to the Exchequer in 1975-76 is estimated at R4,1 million.</p>

<p><i>Housing of Employees</i></p>

<p>An employer is entitled to deduct from his income 25 per cent of any expenditure incurred by him on the erection of dwellings for persons employed by him for the purposes of his trade (other than mining or farming), subject to a maximum of R1 000 per dwelling. In view of the increase in building costs I propose that the maximum deduction per dwelling be increased to R2 500. The loss of revenue for a full financial year is estimated at R2 million, but for 1975-76 it should not exceed R0,5 million.</p>

<p><span class="col_3401-3402" refersTo="page_0114"/>Apart from the adjustment of deductions, etc., there are certain other concessions which seem to me to be desirable.</p>

<p><i>Bonuses for National Servicemen</i></p>

<p>A national serviceman who undergoes training for 18 or 24 months may receive a bonus at the end of his training ranging from R750 to R3 000. It seems a little unfair that the entire bonus, which is intended to give some recognition for the extended period of training, should all be taxed in the year in which, it is received. I propose, therefore, that for tax purposes the bonus should be deemed to be spread over the whole period of training and taxed accordingly. The loss of revenue will be small.</p>

<p><i>Purchase of Land under the Bantu Trust and Land Act</i></p>

<p>Farmers whose land is purchased by the Bantu Trust in connection with the consolidation of the Bantu homelands and who consequently are forced to sell their stock may find that their taxable incomes, and hence their tax liability, are abnormally increased in the year of sale. The same applies when there are growing plantations on the land. This abnormal tax burden may hamper farmers in recommencing their farming operations elsewhere.</p>

<p>I think it would be fair if such an abnormal accrual of income arising from the sale of a farm under the Bantu Trust and Land Act of 1936 be not included in the ordinary taxable income of the fanner (which would have the effect of increasing his rate of tax) but be taxed separately at a reduced rate. The loss of revenue should not exceed R0,3 million in 1975-&#x2019;76.</p>

<p><i>Investment Allowances</i></p>

<p>I come now to some important concessions designed to encourage investment, which is so essential for our economic future.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion lately of the effects of inflation, under traditional accounting methods, on business profits and in particular on the ability of businesses to set aside sufficient funds to replace capital assets. It is argued that depreciation allowances based on historical costs are insufficient, at a time of rapid inflation, to make adequate provision for such replacement and in effect result in the over-statement of business profits.</p>

<p>More generally, there has been an interesting debate in accounting circles on the effects of inflation on business accounts and on methods of so-called &#x201C;inflation accounting&#x201D;. It should be noted that inflation affects both sides of the profit and loss account and balance sheet and that, in some cases, the effect of the application of &#x201C;inflation accounting&#x201D; is to increase, rather than decrease, business profits.</p>

<p>It would appear, however, that there is no unanimity as yet in the accounting profession on the appropriate methods to be applied, and that it would not yet be practicable to introduce &#x201C;inflation accounting&#x201D; generally for the purpose of determining the taxable incomes of business enterprises&#x2014;nor, for that matter, the rate of return on capital invested.</p>

<p>I have asked the Standing Commission on Taxation to go into this whole matter, which obviously requires further investigation and consideration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I think it is desirable to give some assistance to business enterprises in making more adequate provision for the replacement of capital assets. The investment allowances already, in effect, make some considerable contribution to meeting increased replacement costs. These allowances amount to 15% on factory buildings and 25% on machinery in the metropolitan areas, and may be increased to 40% and 60% respectively in the economic development areas. I now propose that all these allowances be increased by 5%. This means that a manufacturer will now be permitted to write off, over the lifetime of the asset, 120% of the cost of a factory building and 130% of the cost of machinery, and in the economic development areas these percentages may be increased to 145% and 165% respectively.</p>

<p>It does not seem to be sufficiently realized that the investment allowances, initial allowances and wear-and-tear allowances together make it possible for a manufacturer to write off, in the year of acquisition, a very high percentage of the cost of new machinery and plant. In the case of a machine which is intensively used and on which an annual wear-and-tear allowance of 25% is permitted, altogether no less than 74% of the cost may be deducted from taxable income in the first year of use and, in the economic development areas, an even higher percentage.</p>

<p>The increased allowances will apply to buildings, the erection of which, is commenced, and to machinery and plant taken <span class="col_3403-3404" refersTo="page_0115"/>into use, on or after 27 March 1975. At present the allowances expire on 30 June 1978, and I propose that this date be extended to 30 June 1979.</p>

<p>The eventual cost of this concession to the Exchequer is estimated at R11 million per annum, but for 1975-&#x2019;76 the loss of revenue should not exceed R1,5 million.</p>

<p><i>Beneficiation of Minerals</i></p>

<p>The Economic Advisory Council recently transmitted to the Government a number of recommendations designed to provide special additional incentives for the local beneficiation of minerals. South Africa is exceptionally rich in mineral resources, and greater local beneficiation of these minerals can undoubtedly make an important contribution to our future economic development and balance of payments. The Government has accepted the recommendations, which, will initially be implemented for five years with the possibility of extension thereafter.</p>

<p>The various incentives will be granted selectively on the recommendation, in each individual case, of an inter-departmental committee. The tax incentives proposed are&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) an investment allowance up to a maximum of 20% of the cost of machinery and 15% of the cost of buildings in a beneficiation plant not connected with a mining company. This will be additional to the general investment allowance granted to all manufacturers; and</li>

<li>(b) a similar investment allowance in respect of the beneficiation plant of a mining company where the company undertakes advanced beneficiation. This will be additional to the 100% write-off of capital expenditure already granted to such mining companies.</li>

</ol>

<p>Furthermore, these allowances will be granted over and above any tax concessions which may be accorded under the decentralization scheme.</p>

<p>The allowances will apply to new machinery taken into use, and to buildings, the erection of which is commenced, on or after 27 March 1975. The loss of revenue may eventually be considerable, but for 1975-&#x2019;76 it will probably be small.</p>

<p><i>Undistributed Profits Tax</i></p>

<p>The primary purpose of the Undistributed Profits Tax is to ensure that a reasonable proportion of a company&#x2019;s income is distributed in the form of dividends where it can be taxed in the hands of the shareholder. In the calculation of the tax, allowance is made for the building up of a reasonable reserve by operating companies, while expenditure on plant and machinery is allowed as a deduction in arriving at the distributable income of a company.</p>

<p>Throughout the world company profits are taxed first in the hands of the company and secondly in the hands of shareholders on their dividend receipts. It is a universal problem to ensure a reasonable dividend distribution in order to obtain a fair tax yield from company and shareholder. The Department of Inland Revenue is at present engaged in an in-depth, study of company taxation but this will not be completed for some time.</p>

<p>In these circumstances I cannot at this stage accede to the requests which I have received for the abolition of this tax. In view of the need to assist companies in making adequate provision for the replacement of capital assets and for further capital development, however, I think that certain concessions are now justified. I propose, therefore, that the plough-back allowed on profits other than dividends be increased from 45% to 55%, and that, for public companies only, the plough-back on dividend receipts be increased from 25% to 35%. The first concession will, practically, relieve operating companies from the tax, while the second will give greater flexibility to public financial companies in reinvesting dividend income. A similar concession for private financial companies cannot be granted because of the danger of the use of such companies for tax avoidance.</p>

<p>The direct loss of revenue from these concessions will be small. The indirect loss, i.e. through the non-distribution of a greater percentage of profits, is difficult to estimate, but will in any case be negligible in 1975-&#x2019;76.</p>

<p>The total sacrifice of revenue from all these tax concessions which I have announced is estimated to amount to R13 million in the next financial year though substantially more than that in a full year.</p>

<p>I come now to my proposals for increased taxation, and I start with certain measures <span class="col_3405-3406" refersTo="page_0116"/>which will not directly affect the State&#x2019;s finances.</p>

<p><i>Customs and Excise Duties on Petroleum Products</i></p>

<p>Last December, in my previous capacity as Minister of Economic Affairs, it was my privilege to announce the Government&#x2019;s decision to proceed with the construction of a second and much larger oil-from-coal project, known as SASOL II. I do not need to emphasize again the strategic importance of this project and the contribution which it can make towards ensuring the security of South. Africa.</p>

<p>The cost of the project at 1974 prices is estimated at R1 021 million. In view of the many other calls on our capital resources, it is not possible to meet this cost solely from loan funds, and I think it is fair that the user of petroleum products should make a major contribution to this project.</p>

<p>The present petrol price includes a non-statutory levy of 0,275 cents per litre. I propose that this levy be abolished and that the present customs and excise duties on petrol be increased by 2 cents per litre. Increases of duty will also be imposed on other petroleum products.</p>

<p>The proceeds from these increases will accrue to the Strategic Oil Fund and legislation in this connection will be introduced shortly by my colleague the Minister of Economic Affairs. Other strategic oil projects, including the oil stockpiling programme, may also be financed from this Fund.</p>

<p>The escalating costs of road construction coupled with the effects of the various measures taken to conserve petrol have created serious problems for the National Roads Fund, which relies for its revenue on a portion of the duty on motor fuel. Despite a substantial pruning of the national roads programme, some additional financial assistance is essential. I therefore propose that the relevant duties be increased by 0,25 cents per litre, and that the proceeds of this increase be paid over to the National Roads Fund.</p>

<p>The combined effect of these proposals will be an increase of 2,25 cents per litre in the customs and excise duties on petrol, kerosene, diesel oil and residual fuel oil in cases where the full duty is now paid. In the case of kerosene, diesel oil and residual fuel oil which is at present subject to a partial rebate of duty (except where used for agricultural or forestry purposes or for public passenger bus transport services), I propose that the duty be increased by one cent per litre. In addition, I propose that an excise duty of 3,7 cents per kilogram be levied on liquid petroleum gas with a corresponding increase in the customs duty. Provision will be made for a rebate of this duty for Government use, but no other rebates are contemplated.</p>

<p>The effect of these proposals will be an increase of 1,975 cents per litre in the price of petrol, even after this increase, the price in South Africa will still be very substantially lower than that in many other countries including Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may be allowed to quote my remarks when I announced the Government&#x2019;s decision to proceed with SASOL II. I said then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The drawing upon the Strategic Oil Fund for part of the capital requirements will in due course require an increase in the existing levy on fuel by which the Strategic Oil Fund is financed. The payment of such a levy by fuel users may very reasonably, in my view, be regarded as a premium on a great national insurance policy or scheme in which millions of South Africans will participate in a crucial sense in ensuring our future welfare and security. I may say that the greater part of the aggregate capital outlay will be expended in the Republic.</block>

<p>The additional revenue from all these increased duties on petroleum products is estimated at R130 million in 1975-&#x2019;76, of which R13 million will accrue to the National Roads Fund and R117 million to the Strategic Oil Fund.</p>

<p><i>Other Customs and Excise Duties</i></p>

<p>I still have to find some additional revenue for the Exchequer, and in present circumstances I think that it is appropriate to look to the duties on liquor and tobacco, which have remained substantially unchanged (except for a minor adjustment in the duty on cigarettes) since 1971.</p>

<p><span class="col_3407-3408" refersTo="page_0117"/><i>Beer</i></p>

<p>The consumption of beer has increased considerably in recent years, and I think that this product can bear an increased tax. I propose that the duty on all beer (both imported and local) be increased by 2,4 cents per litre or about 0,9 cents per container of 375 millilitres (or per pint according to imperial measures). The retail price of beer should not rise by more than one cent per container of 375 millilitres, and I shall expect manufacturers, in fixing the increased price of beer in containers of different sizes, to give due consideration to the interests of the consumer. The estimated additional income during 1975-&#x2019;76 is about R10,8 million.</p>

<p><i>Wine</i></p>

<p>Although the consumption of wine has increased more slowly, I feel that the consumer of fortified wine and sparkling wine can also make a contribution. I propose, therefore, that the customs and excise duties on fortified and on sparkling wines be increased by 2,4 cents per litre. The duties on unfortified wine remain unchanged. The additional revenue from this source is estimated at R1,9 million.</p>

<p><i>Spirits</i></p>

<p>The consumption of spirits has also shown a notable increase during the past few years, and the consumer of brandy, gin, whisky and other potable spirits must expect to make his contribution along with the consumer of beer and wine. I propose that the customs and excise duties on spirits be increased by 33,6 cents per litre or about 0,9 cents per tot. The retail price of local and imported spirits should not rise by more than one cent per tot. The additional revenue is estimated at R27 million.</p>

<p><i>Tobacco</i></p>

<p>I think it is fair that the smoker should also make his contribution, and I propose that the stamp duty on local and imported cigarettes be increased by one cent per ten cigarettes, that on cigarette tobacco by one cent per 50 grammes and that on cigars (both local and imported) by ten cents per kilogram. The consumption of pipe tobacco has not increased to the same extent as the other products and the duty on pipe tobacco will therefore remain unchanged. The additional revenue from this source in 1975-&#x2019;76 is estimated at R22,2 million.</p>

<p><i>Cool Drinks</i></p>

<p>A rebate of the full duty is at present granted where at least 5 % of the cool drink consists of the juice of certain fruits and vegetables. In order to eliminate the cost of treating and mixing these juices and in order to grant exemption from the duty to manufacturers of pure juices, that is, those which consist, to an extent of at least 70%, of the juice of certain fruits and vegetables, I propose that an effective duty of 0,7 cents per litre be imposed on non-alcoholic beverages (undiluted or diluted with water, including carbonated water). This increase, which should not give rise to any increase in the retail price, will be implemented by means of a <i>Government Notice</i> to be published tomorrow. The estimated additional revenue from this source is R4 million.</p>

<p>All the increases in customs and excise duties, as well as the new excise duty on liquid petroleum gas, which I have announced, take effect immediately and apply to all the goods concerned that have not yet been cleared for domestic consumption.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in terms of section 58(1) of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964, I now lay upon the Table for consideration by the House, the formal taxation proposals with regard to customs and excise duties.</p>

<p>Since all the increased duties are levied at the point of import or manufacture, there is no justification for other merchants to increase immediately the prices of goods purchased at the old rates of duty. I therefore rely on such merchants to sell at the current ruling prices those stocks on which duty at the old rate was paid, and to adjust their prices only when new stocks, bearing the increased duties, are received. I fully expect that the retail prices of all goods affected by these proposals will not be raised by more than is strictly justified by the increased duties.</p>

<p>Cigarette prices are subject to price control, and merchants may not increase their prices without the consent of the Price Controller.</p>

<p>The increased customs and excise duties should yield altogether R66 million to the Revenue Account, which will then show a surplus of R21 million.</p>

<p>As our problems are largely concerned with the Loan Account, I think some additional financing for that Account is justified.</p>

<p><span class="col_3409-3410" refersTo="page_0118"/><i>Loan Levies</i></p>

<p>During the financial year 1975-&#x2019;76 the 1969 loan levy will be repaid; this amounts to R75 million, of which R26 million will accrue to companies.</p>

<p>Even when allowance is made for the effects of inflation, companies have had a very good year. In 1973-74 the index of profits in commerce rose by 51,4%, in manufacturing by 44,0%, in gold mining by 84,3% and in coal mining by 34,9%. Where our rate of company tax is lower than that in most comparable countries, I think an increase in the loan levy on companies is justified. I therefore propose that this levy be increased by 2,5% of company income tax in respect of all companies other than diamond mining companies (which already pay a higher levy than other companies). For companies other than gold and diamond mining companies, the tax plus surcharge will now be 41% and the loan levy 2% of income.</p>

<p>The additional levy is expected to yield R48 million in 1975-&#x2019;76.</p>

<p><i>Summary</i></p>

<p>As I have already mentioned, the Revenue Account, after the various tax changes, is expected to show a surplus of R21 million.</p>

<p>The shortfall of R322 million on Loan Account can then be financed as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the priorities of this Budget are clear: they are, firstly, defence, and secondly, the provision of an adequate economic infrastructure.</p>

<p>It would have been possible for the Government to have neglected its duty in these respects, and to have budgeted for a much lower level of expenditure. But this would have been irresponsible, and the country would in time have paid the price of this neglect.</p>

<p>In giving priority to expenditure on defence and on economic infrastructure, the Government has been strict in its attitude towards other forms of expenditure. This is illustrated by the fact that, if expenditure on defence, on railways and harbours, and on telecommunications is excluded (and there are, of course, many other items of infrastructure in the budget), then total expenditure on Revenue and Loan Account shows an increase of only 13%, which, in relation to the growth rate of the economy and the rate of inflation, is very low indeed.</p>

<p>I should like to refer here to one other important aspect of the economic infrastructure, namely, urban transport facilities. This has been the subject of a special inquiry by a Committee, under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Transport, Mr. J. Driessen. This Committee has submitted its report, which is at present being examined in detail by the Government. My colleague the Minister of Transport will make a further announcement in due course.</p>

<p>In the light of my conclusion that the economic situation justifies a moderately expansionary budget, I believe that the burden of increased expenditure has been fairly spread.</p>

<p>The individual taxpayer will pay slightly more for his liquor and cigarettes, but he will receive a substantial amount back in the form of loan levy repayments.</p>

<p>The user of petroleum products will pay more, as an insurance premium to safeguard our future oil supplies and to improve our national road system.</p>

<p>The company will pay, as loan levy, 1% more on its income, but will get back a substantial amount as repayment of old levies, and will also receive important tax concessions in respect of investment allowances and undistributed profits tax.</p>

<p>The Budget also provides relief, in the form of higher social pensions and income tax concessions, to older people who are often least able to cope with the burden of inflation.</p>

<p>As I explained earlier, inflation under present circumstances must be combated, not by a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, but by other means such as those outlined in the recent statement by the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2014;in particular, by the exercise of restraint by manufacturers, traders, employees and consumers.</p>

<p><span class="col_3413-3414" refersTo="page_0120"/>While certainly not restrictive, the Budget is also not unduly expansionary, as is shown by the fact that only a relatively small drawing on the Stabilization Account is envisaged.</p>

<p>In concluding, may I re-iterate my own and this Government&#x2019;s abiding faith in the system of private enterprise. &#x201C;You cannot build character and courage by taking away man&#x2019;s initiative and independence&#x201D;, said Abraham Lincoln, one of the most realistic, as well as human, of all successful democratic statesmen.</p>

<p>It was Abraham Lincoln, too, who said &#x201C;You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich; you cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong; you cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift; you cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could do for themselves.&#x201D; And, finally, in the direct context of budgetting, &#x201C;You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I cannot express my own basic philosophy in these matters better than that Mr. Speaker, I now lay upon the Table:</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House had hoped that the change of scenery which we have had this afternoon behind the Budget lectern would have been accompanied by a breath of fresh air, new thinking and new initiative. Sir, we were probably hoping for too much in that regard. Where this Budget has brought joy, it has done so in very small measure and where it has brought hurt, it has brought acute hurt.</p>

<p>I believe one has to look at the economy of South Africa with a much more critical eye than the hon. Minister did this afternoon in his review. I believe that this hon. Minister has assumed his post at a time when the South African economy is faced by situations of a more critical nature than it probably ever has been faced with since the depression of the early 1930&#x2019;s. I think that to view the present situation with any sense of complacency is a grave mistake and I did, in fact, discern a sense of complacency in the remarks made by the hon. the Minister. I do not believe that one can be complacent when inflation is running at the rate of about 15%. It is running at a rate higher than we have had for more than 50 years, higher than anything we have had since the galloping inflation that followed the First World War. We cannot be complacent when inflation is eating away at the very fabric of the economy and when there is a danger that it is eating away also at the very fabric of society.</p>

<p>We cannot be complacent when we have a growth rate which is likely to be only <span class="col_3421-3422" refersTo="page_0124"/>about 3&#x00BD;% this year. This makes an absolute mockery of the growth rate estimated in the Economic Development Programme of 6,4%. It is scarcely enough to cover the growth in our population, which means that at the growth rate envisaged for the coming year, we are unlikely to see anything more than absolutely negligible improvement in the standard of living. I find it difficult to understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s remark in his Budget speech that the growth rate will be relatively high. What will the growth rate be relative to&#x003F; Will it be relatively high in relation to the negative growth rate other countries are experiencing&#x003F; It is certainly not going to be relatively high with regard to the real requirements of our country. Can we be complacent when our main trading partners, the United Kingdom, the European Common Market, Japan and the USA all have economies which are in recession at the present time, having problems that are even greater than our own&#x003F; This is going to have an effect on our exports, particularly our exports of primary products which must be regarded as being subject to a certain degree of vulnerability. Finally, can we be complacent when we are part and parcel of an international financial and currency situation which can only be regarded as highly unstable, a situation which causes business difficulties, governmental difficulties and which is a great destroyer of confidence&#x003F;</p>

<p>I suggest that all these are critical problems facing this country. We are fortunate in having a certain counterbalance with us in that this is a country which is handsomely endowed with natural resources, such as gold, which can be used and developed to neutralize and combat and, I hope, in due course, overcome the problems to which I have referred. At the present time, however, we cannot escape the fact that we are facing these problems and that they need attention at Government level.</p>

<p>The 64 000 dollar question is whether the fiscal measures announced in this Budget will be effective in helping to solve these problems. This is the yardstick by which this Budget must be judged and by which it will be judged by this side of the House and, I think, by the country as a whole. In his speech, the hon. the Minister indicated that his priorities were, firstly, defence and, secondly, the provision of an adequate infrastructure. I would like to add three other priorities which are necessary in the present situation. We also need growth, real growth. I regard the need for real growth just as great as the need to fight inflation, something which the hon. the Minister did not seem to realize. We also need to reduce the rate of inflation as a further priority and we need to alleviate the hardships caused by inflation, particularly to those members of the population who are not in a position to cope with them themselves.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House will examine the Budget in the light of those needs, those priorities. My first impression of this Budget is that it does not go as very far as it needs to go towards solving those problems or providing for those priorities.</p>

<p>There are certain other first impressions one gains from this Budget. For instance we do welcome the fact that social pensions have been improved. I hope the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that the gap between the social pensions of White and Coloured groups is to be reduced, means in effect that the increase in absolute terms the other race groups, the Coloureds and the Africans, will get, will be greater than that granted to the Whites. We welcome some of the crumbs which have fallen from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s table. We welcome the small concessions made to the aged and we welcome the small concessions made to married women. I might say that this is hardly women&#x2019;s lib treatment in Women&#x2019;s Year. We welcome the increase in investment allowances and in the allowances under the undistributed profits tax. These will help in a small way to meet a very real problem in respect of the financing the replacement of plants at enhanced values. It will help companies and businesses to meet their liquidity problems which they are facing as a result of inflation.</p>

<p>There is one thing in this Budget we do not welcome&#x2014;the increased excise duty on petrol. This imposition is highly inflationary. Petrol is something that is used directly or indirectly by every single member of the population, so that an increase of this magnitude in the price of petrol permeates right throughout the economy and will have a cascading inflationary effect. The motorist is already paying a tremendous amount to the Government. He pays more than R70 million in ordinary excise duty; he pays something more than that to the National Roads Fund. He pays enormous sums if he lives in the Transvaal or the Orange Free State to the Railways for petrol conveyed by railways or by pipeline. He pays sales duty and he pays <span class="col_3423-3424" refersTo="page_0125"/>licence fees. We are not in favour of raising funds for capital works out of revenue to the extent to which this Government does so. We have made our position clear on numerous occasions with regard to the Franzsen Commission&#x2019;s recommendation in this regard. The second Sasol should be financed in the same way as the first Sasol, namely primarily out of loan funds. By financing it in this way, we are placing an unnecessary and severe additional inflationary imposition on the economy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Budget clearly needs a great deal of study by us before we can really debate it in full, and I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate on this Bill was adjourned last night, I was trying to emphasize that the Government was using basically two motivations for the introduction of this Bill. The first one which I mentioned was the argument that in fact this Bill could be justified because we have a similar provision in the Transkei Constitution Act of 1963. The second motivation is one of a practical nature; the hon. the Minister himself referred to this in his Second Reading speech, namely that if this particular Bill is not accepted certain administrative problems will arise with regard to the Coloured population as a whole; in other words, they will not be able to receive pensions, salaries, etc. Sir, the question I would like to put to the hon. the Minister is this: Assuming that there is this practical difficulty, why is a measure of such a far-reaching nature necessary to cope with a practical difficulty&#x003F; Is there not a host of other contingent measures that could have been adopted to cope with the problem of administering money&#x003F; Why is a Bill of such, Draconian proportions necessary&#x003F; The provisions of this Bill cover a far wider field than is necessary simply to cope with this particular administrative problem. Sir, I refer again to the kind of language that hon. members on that side use when referring to the Coloured people &#x2014;the language of paternalism. There are many ways of disciplining a child. One can just warn a child; one can perhaps send him to his room or make him do some homework, or give him a hiding with a cane. Having regard to the particular problem with which the hon. the Minister has to cope, why is it necessary to introduce a Bill of this nature to cope with what is simply an administrative problem&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to conclude by returning to what I regard as one of the most remarkable phenomena in our political life, the hon. member for Waterberg, who has the ability to conjure up a political dream world and not only to sell it to the hon. members of this House, but in fact to create the impression that he lives in that world himself and that he spends most of his time cleaning the windows of the castle in which he lives. The hon. member for Waterberg used a host of paradoxes yesterday in trying to justify this Bill. One of them was that in fact the White people of South Africa would govern themselves in this particular institution and that this Government would create institutions by means of which the other ethnic groups in South Africa could govern themselves independently. But the paradox is that in fact, in spite of the coming about of those institutions, the major decisions affecting the lives of everybody in South Africa are still taken in this institution. This is also true as far as the Coloured population is concerned. With the introduction of this Bill we have a classic example of political institutions being created which have no effective power. What will the consequence be&#x003F; The consequence will be exactly what we are seeing at the moment&#x2014;that the only purpose which these institutions can serve for the people who have access to them is simply to be used as platforms on which to confront the Government which takes all the most important decisions governing their lives That is another way of saying in the technical sense that you create platforms for demagoguery. There is no other way in which this particular programme can develop. I would say that the only way to cope with this problem, to avoid confrontation, would be in fact to decentralize power, to give more powers to these institutions. Assuming that one is working within the framework of the Government&#x2019;s <span class="col_3425-3426" refersTo="page_0126"/>policy of political paternalism, one can say: &#x201C;If this is our policy, then it would seem logical, in terms of our own assumption, that the only way in which we can cope with the problem of confrontation is in fact to decentralize power and to give more powers to these institutions&#x201D;. What we have with the introduction of this Rill is, of course, exactly the opposite. Powers are taken away, whereas the illusion is still preserved that in fact one has a political institution that is viable. If it were viable, surely this institution would not be boycotted by the Coloured people. If it could effectively change their lives, if it could create greater employment opportunities, if it could create more educational opportunities and if it could be a more effective bargaining instrument then the last thing the Coloured people would do through their elected representatives would be to boycott this institution. It would then not be necessary for the hon. the Minister to introduce a Bill of such Draconian proportions in order to cope with an administrative problem which in very real terms affects only a very small section of the Coloured population and not the vast majority of them. Admittedly it is a serious problem, the problem of salaries and pensions, but it affects a very small section of the Coloured population and they cannot see the relevance of this particular institution, the Coloured Representative Council, in their lives. They are prepared to say: We will put representatives there who will confront the Government because this institution does not serve any purpose. That is why I think that at this particular stage it is a great pity from all points of view that instead of implementing its own policy by giving more power and indicating which powers the Minister will not take away, the Government in fact introduces a Bill which states: We will take all the powers that we want if the occasion arises which makes it necessary to do so. That is why, in terms of the Government&#x2019;s own philosophy, they are admitting defeat by introducing this measure.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch had much to say in his speech about the idiom of this side of the House, which is allegedly paternalistic. He spoke of political paternalism. The hon. member went further by not only characterizing our policy as guardianship and political paternalism, but also stating as his major objection that we want to perpetuate this guardianship, this paternalism. Guardianship, so I deduced from the speech of the hon. member for Rondebosch, in certain circumstances and in the short term, could still perhaps do. The objection of that hon. member is that we want to make guardianship permanent and that we want to perpetuate our paternalism. What the hon. member actually means by that, is that we on this side of the House are dishonest in our policy, that we speak of the emancipation of the Coloureds in the political field, of their growth to political maturity and majority while what we actually want to do&#x2014;so the hon. member said&#x2014;is to expand and intensify our paternalism over these people. That is typical of the one-sided interpretation of the National Party&#x2019;s policy in respect of the Coloureds which we have heard in this debate from that side of the House. It is typical of the one-sided interpretation and the accompanying suspicion-mongering which could fatally poison White/ Brown relationships in South Africa. The hon. member for Rondebosch can differ about the method or the way in which we want to bring about the political emancipation of the Coloureds, and he can differ from our policy&#x2014;that is his right, after all &#x2014;but he cannot cast doubt on the fact that we are honest in our intention of emancipating the Coloureds politically. The honesty of the hon. the Prime Minister, of the Government in this regard, is above suspicion. However, what is not above suspicion, is the intention of members on the other side of the House with their insinuations. [Interjections.] The hon. members on that side of the House try to promote a climate of distrust which could lead to serious conflict in our delicate situation of relations in South Africa.</p>

<p>The Government recognizes the right of the Coloured population to a say and a share in the control of all the many matters which they have in common with the Whites. &#x201C;Say&#x201D; and &#x201C;share&#x201D;, that does not sound like paternalism. These are rights which this side of the House do not want to deny the Coloureds. However, the problem is how to give the Coloureds a political share in the control of common matters without running the enormous risk of this growing Brown political power becoming the decisive factor between White poles and parties. A bargaining situation of this kind has the potential to disrupt political stability and order in South Africa fundamentally, with disastrous results for everyone <span class="col_3427-3428" refersTo="page_0127"/>and in particular, for the Brown people as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rondebosch spoke of paternalism and the perpetuation of guardianship. Now I want to ask him in this particular context what the position is with their policy of qualified franchise. The hon. member is shaking his head, but is it not the most extreme form of paternalism to say to the vast majority of the Coloured population, &#x201C;Sorry friends, but we, the &#x2018;Pater&#x2019;, the White party, say that you are too immature to vote at all. You do not qualify &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>If I return to the legislation now, then this brings me to the very one-sided and almost unbelievably mischievous utterances which we have heard from that side of the House. The hon. member for Sea Point spoke yesterday of political fraud. They want to create a distorted image among the Coloureds, that the Government envisages stripping the executive committee and the CRC of all its powers even before the Labour Party has been given the opportunity to govern. The hon. member for Sea Point said in the speech he made when the Bill was introduced&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What cynicism to tell the Coloured people that they should conduct an election but behind their backs to concoct legislation to take away their powers and to replace those powers with a single White man as the authority over <i>2</i>&#x00BD; million Coloured people in South Africa.</block>

<p>The Opposition are playing a dangerous game. With such one-sided interpretations and misinterpretations, they are inciting and rousing many Brown people to something which will not be to the benefit of Brown or White in South Africa. They are sowing distrust and suspicion of the Government among the Brown people in a dubious and irresponsible way.</p>

<p>They are creating this climate purely for the sake of politicking. This climate could provoke two dangerous reactions. Among Brown people, it could inspire an irresponsible resistance and agitation which could lead to their confronting the Whites with blind demands and even with violence. Among White people, it could lead to an inaccessibility and a heartlessness, even towards the justified aspirations which exist among the Brown people. This is an attitude which is certainly not beneficial to White/Brown relations. It is futile, it creates mistrust and destroys the possibility of open discussion. This is the climate which hon. members on the opposite side are trying to create.

<p>It is this type of statement which could stir up the feelings of White and Brown to a point of high tension. Brown people could feel themselves to be encouraged by this to a relentlessness which could lead to irresponsible actions. This type of provocative speech could create a climate among the Whites where the affection&#x2014;let us admit that there is a great deal of affection towards the Coloureds among the Whites&#x2014; could change into disaffection and into a hardening of hearts. If this should happen, and may we in South Africa be spared that, many Whites, too, will be observed in the row of people who consciously or unconsciously brought about such a bloody day. There will be those Whites who have through their heartlessness injured and trod upon the dignity of God&#x2019;s Brown creations in South Africa, and who have lived as though they thought that South Africa belongs only to them, while the Brown people should not be granted any place in the sun in this lovely country. <span class="col_3429-3430" refersTo="page_0128"/>They will be there. But, in the front of that row there will be members of the Opposition party and, I suspect, members of the Progressive Party as well, people who are frustrated by their own political inability, and who therefore help with relish to stoke the fires of suspicion and distrust among Brown people, and who are in fact contributing in this way to the creation of a relentlessness and inaccessibility on the part of many Whites.</p>

<p>I do not believe that this is the spirit in which this legislation should be approached. As far as this legislation is concerned, it is the height of political irony that there are hon. members on the opposite side of the House who do not even have sufficient White support to be called politically relevant. I am referring to the Reform Party that presumes to prescribe Coloured policy to this House. Those hon. members represent such a small number of voteres that they can rightly be called politically irrelvant. They did not even get into this House under their own steam. They want to prescribe policy to this House without having a mandate from a single constituency. The hon. leader of the Reform Party, according to a report in Monday&#x2019;s <i>Transvaler,</i> immediately went to consult important leaders of the Coloured community, which I do not hold against him. Immediately after that, however, that hon. member, who obviously has a mania for publicity, issued a statement. I think we can tell that hon. member and his party that the Coloureds have their own elected leaders and that White political intermediaries are altogether superfluous. The Coloureds do not need advice from people who cannot even advise themselves.</p>

<p>This Bill does not have the mysterious and sinister intentions which members on the opposite side of this House would like to look for in it. It is, as was said repeatedly yesterday, merely a practical measure which is aimed at guaranteeing administrative continuity and stability in all circumstances. As far as White/Brown political relations are concerned, we are heading for stormy waters. When I say that we are heading for stormy waters, hon. members must not think that it is pessimism or cynicism which makes me say this: it is purely and simply realism. After all, political storms are peculiar to all politics. In such circumstances many political vessels threaten to go under. I think that the United Party is a very good example of a political vessel which has run upon the rocks. Also as far as White/Brown politics are concerned, we are heading for difficult, stormy weather. The political vessel which we on this side of the House think is most suitable for weathering those storms, is the policy which the Government is presently developing in respect of the Coloureds, viz. the policy of parallel political structures with a growing number of points of contact at different levels in order to ensure a say and a share in the control of common matters and to decide on common matters at the highest level through a joint Cabinet council.</p>

<p>This measure is a practical measure to ensure that political tension and resistance do not interrupt the essential administrative continuity. This contains an assurance for the Brown people in particular that the process on which, so many thousands of them are dependent for their livelihood, will not be sabotaged. This Government is the body and will also remain the body, also in the process by which powers are transferred to other population groups, which is responsible for ensuring the maintenance of continuity for the sake of everyone in South Africa. After all, as far as the Coloureds are concerned, we are also in a transitional phase, and this measure is necessary to serve as a prop for the evolutionary emancipation of the Coloureds in the field of politics. Therefore this Bill does not have the least intention of taking over the functions of the Executive of the CRC in any permanent way. Since we find ourselves in a transitional phase, this measure as such must also be seen as a part of the whole in that process. The hon. member for Rondebosch, who is not here at the moment, sat together with me on the benches of the theological seminary at Stellenbosch, but he has obviously forgotten the first principle of good exegisis, viz. that the text must be read in the context of the whole. This measure must also be understood in the context of the whole of the process of our policy in respect of the Coloureds.</p>

If we do what the hon. members on the opposite side have tried to do, i.e. to take this Bill out of the context of the whole, then it has a <span class="col_3431-3432" refersTo="page_0129"/>negative undertone and it may seem to be nothing but a negative measure.

<p>Of course. Hon. members on the opposite side shake their heads, but the hon. members of the Progressive Party, for example, would argue that their qualified franchise, which is, after all, a negative measure since it will result in very many people in South Africa not being able to vote at all, does not have a negative intention. Incidentally, it is something which members on this side of the House will never do, viz. to deprive people of their franchise. [Interjections.] Many Coloureds who voted in the past election will be deprived of their franchise should that party ever come into power.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill might be judged to be negative, but it does have a positive intention just as the Progressive Party will argue in respect of qualified franchise that it has a positive intention in respect of the context of the whole, that such an apparently negative measure has a positive and constructive function in the context of the whole. In the same way this side of the House can argue that our policy in respect of the Coloureds as embodied in this Bill, <i>inter alia,</i> does, on the one hand, have apparently negative moments at times, but does, on the other hand, also have positive and constructive moments. This is as a result of the fact that our problem in South Africa is not singular, but multiple and many-sided, and answers to these complicated multiple problems in South Africa often create the impression that they are riddled with contradictions. However, this only happens when the negative side is emphasized at the expense of the positive, as hon. members on that side of the House have also done in respect of the Bill. The negative aspects are taken out of context and announced to the world with, great fanfare. The National Party policy also has negative elements in respect of the Coloureds, such as this clause, for example, but at the same time it also prepares the way for the positive and the constructive. The negative, such as this Bill, is often the prop and the scaffolding which must support and make possible the positive construction which is to be erected. It might be negative to demolish an old building, but the positive and the constructive is to be found in the fact that the old building will be replaced by a better and a new building. Negative and constructive are often complementary, and the negative will eventually become superfluous and disappear, just as the props and scaffolding disappear when the new building or construction has been completed. This legislation, although it might be judged to be negative out of its context, also has a function, viz. to prepare the positive and constructive. In this regard this Bill actually belongs to the first phase of our policy. The hon. the Prime Minister has often referred to the first phase which has served to prepare the way for the next phases. It is the phase in which the different political groupings had to be accommodated within separate political structures, the phase in which the coalescene which has come about over many years, had to be cut lose often by means of apparently negative measures. However, it was necessary to bring about the positive, i.e. the construction of the peaceful co-existence of different peoples in South Africa. It is precisely due to negative measures, for example, a measure of this nature, that it is possible for us to move into the third phase of the implementation of our policy today. The third phase contains for the Coloureds not only a say and a share &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that this legislation, judged to be a negative measure in general, does also have a positive function and therefore also offers the Coloureds a greater vista, a greater political vista, a greater political power basis and a bargaining power than it would ever have had in equal competition with the Whites within the White Parliament. But to realize these possibilities and to develop them, order and responsibility have to be ensured. In order to ensure these, this Bill has been introduced and I support it sincerely.</p>

However, it is this particular legislation and other similar legislation which are giving rise to that suspicion. The hon. member said that he regarded this legislation as a transitional measure. Normally one regards a transitional phase as a step from a lower to a higher level. In other words, there is improvement or progress. However, if we compare this legislation with what already exists, we cannot recognize any step forward. What we can in fact see is that this legislation is a retrogressive step.

<p>I am prepared at the outset to concede that the Government is engaged in devising some form of constitutional development in South Africa in order to extend democratic rights and privileges to the non-White population in Southern Africa. I would, therefore, like to believe that the ultimate aim and object of this whole experiment, including what is embodied in this Bill forming as it does an integral part of the experiment, is to strengthen and secure democracy in South Africa. This, I submit, is the simple test which we must apply in our evaluation of this amending Bill. It is a very short Bill containing only three clauses. Clause 2, however, if one takes the trouble to count, consists of 13 lines. That may be very unlucky for some people. We must ask ourselves whether this 13-line clause will, in effect, bring us nearer the objective, which must surely be to secure and strengthen democracy in South Africa. Let me say at once that this clause will take us no nearer to that objective. In fact, it is making a farce of democracy, attacking and discrediting that very principle. In the constitutional development of the non-Whites, this Nationalist Government has followed the example of the great imperial or colonial powers of the past. Judging from the mistakes the Government has made, and is in fact still making with this Bill, I am forced to flatter them by saying that they are really the last imperialists left in Africa. The imperial governments had their colonies as their subordinates. In the South African context in which this Bill is a means of constitutional development, the constitutional subordinates happen to be the non-White population groups. What the Government has succeeded in doing is to thrust upon these subordinates imperialistic constitutional institutions &#x2026;</p>

<p>Wait a minute. The CRC is one example. I am not going to refer to the others. There are also the Bantu homeland legislative assemblies, etc. However, the Coloured people and their council, in imperialistic terms or in the imperialistic set-up, find themselves somewhere where the Cape Colony was in the period 1806 to 1872. This is particularly so when we compare the make-up of this council, its constitution, its function, the powers it has and the possible clash that can occur between the executive power and the legislative power. I want immediately to refer to the suggestion of the hon. the Minister that we need not fear this because he is going to move a particular amendment at a later stage which will ensure that the legislative powers are left in the hands of the CRC. However, there is an inevitable clash that must take place. Therefore, we have this close resemblance between the relationships which prevailed in, let us say, the time of the Cape Colony between the Parliament of the Cape Colony, the Governor and the source of power which in those days was the mother country, Great Britain and the particular relationship which applies to the present set-up here. We find now, of course, that the people in whom power is vested are only known by different names. They are in fact performing the same constitutional function. If we accept this amending Bill before us, we will be taking a retrogressive step as far as the constitutional development of the Coloured people is concerned. That is the reason why I am opposed to it. The hon. the Minister is known to us as the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations, but once this amending Bill has been passed, the Coloured people will justifiably be able to refer to him as Governor Van der Merwe. In actual fact that will be exactly the constitutional function he will be performing. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he should <span class="col_3435-3436" refersTo="page_0131"/>not be afraid in this regard. We had good governors and we had bad governors. We had a Rijk Tulbagh and we also had a Van Plettenberg. During the British r&#x00E9;gime we had Sir George Grey but we also had Sir Philip Edmund Woodhouse.</p>

<p>This does not come as a surprise to me. All the past imperial and colonial powers experienced this particular problem because there was a clash between the body with legislative powers and the body which had to perform the executive functions. That is when you have this particular clash in regard to financial matters. At that particular time the group of people who wanted to improve their democratic position and demanded further democracy, who demanded further progress in respect of their constitutional development&#x2014;this Bill deals with constitutional development&#x2014;discovered that there was a lack of co-operation in regard to fiscal and taxation matters. In every case this has been the lever that has been used to demand greater constitutional development. We have had plenty of examples. The best one was the American revolution in which the American people, who were in a stage of development, adopted the slogan, &#x201C;No taxation without representation&#x201D;. How did the mother country react to this threat on their part to refuse to pay taxation&#x003F; The result of this was confrontation which, as we all know, led to revolution and war. Sir, if you look at the history of the development of the Cape, you find that the Cape Colony, like the Coloureds of today, were demanding greater and more effective democratic rights.

<p>I will abide by your ruling, Sir. When the people in the Cape Colony could not get what they were demanding, which would have been the next step in their development, they demanded a representative Government. This is what the Coloured people have now been doing; they have given the impression that they will not co-operate with the Government, particularly in respect of fiscal matters, and therefore they are demanding, as the next step in their development, representation in this House. Sir, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s choice is quite clear. What has happened before in history is repeating itself here. Whoever is in power has a simple choice to make. You can either consider the views of the people concerned or you can adopt an autocratic attitude towards them. I am afraid. Sir, that the approach revealed in this Bill can only be described as an autocratic approach to this particular problem. Just as we had autocratic governors in the past, so this Bill will in fact create an autocratic Minister fulfilling the functions of this council. Sir, If you want to extend democratic and political rights and strengthen democracy, then the last thing you must do is to take a retrogressive step of this nature, and you must never make a farce of democracy. In a democracy the power of the ballot-box should at all times be paramount. If the ballot-box means nothing, then of course democracy is a farce. In 1969 democracy was discredited when a group of people, using the tools of democracy, in other words, using the ballot-box, achieved victory in the election, but before they could assume power &#x2026;</p>

But the Government did not have the insight or the imagination to utilize that opportunity to do a good job of work for South Africa. What happened instead&#x003F; Before the results of the CRC election were known, the Government, in an atmosphere of panic, rushed into this House with a Bill in order to change in a radical way the rights and the functions of that council and to provide it with other rights and other functions.</p>

<p>Just look at some of the arguments that came from the opposite side of the House in support of their attitude. In the first instance we have had the ludicrous suggestion from the opposite side of the House that it was by coincidence that this Bill was introduced on the date of the election. I should like to say that it was an indication of insensitivity on the part of the Government, insensitivity to the feelings of the Coloured people and insensitivity to their basic rights, to introduce that legislation on that day. Then we have had the situation that it was said that this Bill is merely to have the powers to pay salaries and pensions.

It is, however, our duty, on behalf of South Africa, and particularly because the Coloured people are not represented here in order to look after their own affairs, to speak on behalf of those people and call for positive measures in South Africa.

<p>Sir, I am dealing with the Bill. I want to deal with the attitude of the Coloured people to this Bill. I want to say to hon. members on the other side of the House that when one formulates a Bill of this nature, one must attempt to look at the Bill and its provisions through the eyes of the people for whom that Bill is to be passed and not look at it through one&#x2019;s own ideologically blinkered eyes. Has the Government ever tried to look at this situation from the point of view of the Coloured people&#x003F; Have they taken any step whatsoever, before or after the introduction of the Bill, to establish what the attitude of the present Coloured executive and of the elected members of the CRC is to this Bill&#x003F; Of course they have not. They come to this House with the Bill purely in terms of the requirements of their own ideology, totally unwilling to look at it from the point of view of the Coloured people. The Coloured people reject the Bill and they reject it because they see it as part and parcel of a history of raw deals which they have had from the Whites in South Africa, particularly from the Nationalist Government. The Coloured people see the Bill as a demonstration of baasskap; they do not see it as a positive measure passed to assist them in any way.</p>

<p><span class="col_3441-3442" refersTo="page_0134"/>*For the information of the hon. member for Pretoria Central I want to point out that <i>Die Transvaler</i> published a very interesting article the other day. In this article reference is made to the Government and especially to the Department of Coloured Affairs as well as the Federale Volksparty of the Coloureds. The Department of Coloured Affairs and the hon. the Minister should listen to this remark (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department of Coloured Affairs and the Federale Volksparty among the Coloured people, because they made common cause for a long time and more than disregarded the Labour Party &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2020;In the elections which, have just taken place, the first truly representative Coloured Council was elected in South Africa.

How different would it have been had the Government included in this Bill measures by which the Coloureds could have meaningful participation in the real Government of South Africa!

<p>I would like to ask a few very serious questions with regard to the effect that this legislation is going to have on the attitudes of other groups in South Africa. The effect of this legislation is not confined only to the Coloured people. The effect of this legislation goes much further. It also affects the Indian and Bantu people in South Africa. The question which may well be asked by all other groups in South Africa who face the same predicament under the Nationalist Government&#x2019;s policy, is whether this Government can be expected to take action before dialogue has taken place between a group and the Government&#x003F; Whether the Government is going to take precipitate action in the future in the constitutional development of other peoples in South Africa and whether they are going to take such actions, without discussing the intended action with them before the action is taken. If that should be the case, it would be a shocking situation and I believe that it is a question which all the other race groups in South Africa are going to ask themselves. Will this Government take action which affects their constitutional future and which affects their rights and privileges without discussing it with them before that action is taken&#x003F;</p>

<p>No, we are totally opposed to the Bill and we have said so on many occasions. It is not necessary to repeat that. Irrespective of the attitude of the Nationalist Government, irrespective of the fact that the Nationalist Government has not yet announced the <span class="col_3445-3446" refersTo="page_0136"/>chairman of the CRC, has not yet informed Mr. Leon that he will be the chairman, irrespective of the fact that Mr. Leon is now the elected leader of the Coloured people in South Africa and still does not have a passport from this Government and he and his people have to suffer that humiliation from day to day, irrespective of all the disadvantages, humiliations and problems which this Government, its Bill and its laws create for the Coloured people, we nevertheless appeal to them to use the CRC in order to advance their reasonable and justified aspirations. I believe that if that happens, the Coloureds will be able in a positive way to advance their rights and their aspirations and that it will be for the general good of South Africa as well. I believe that even the Nationalist Party, with their archaic attitudes to race relations, will not be capable of resisting reasoned pressure and reasoned debate coming from the Coloureds in a body in which they have an elected majority and in which they have a valid right to put those points. So, Mr. Speaker, we say to the Nationalists: Consult with the Coloureds now; consult with them immediately, appoint Mr. Leon as chairman of the CRC and make that announcement immediately, return his passport to him; show him the dignity and the respect that the elected leader of a people should have extended the powers of the CRC and provide for representation of their people in this Parliament. If they do that, they will have gone a long way towards solving the problems in respect of the Coloured people in South Africa. If, however, the Government does not have the imagination or the insight or the sense of responsibility to do that, then they and they alone, as the result of their own actions, must face the dire consequences which will result because of their policies and their actions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, how the hon. member had the courage, after the speech he has just made, to let the word &#x201C;imagination&#x201D; pass his lips, is beyond me. The hon. member reproached us because all the Ministers were not here to listen to him and because he had to listen to backbenchers in the course of this debate. I want to tell him that the backbenchers who spoke have been in this House a great deal longer than he has and have a far more stable political history than his. I also want to tell him that the hon. the Minister responsible for this legislation, as well as the hon. the Deputy Minister, are in fact here, while his leader, the hon. member for Yeoville, who took part in this debate, is conspicuous by his absence. I may point out, too, that the hon. leader of the party allied to his&#x2014;the Progressive Party&#x2014;who took part in the debate, is conspicuous by his absence. The Leader of the Opposition, who took part in the debate, is also conspicuous by his absence. Even the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, the self-appointed possible candidate for leadership of that party, is conspicuous by his absence. Hon. members should therefore be quiet when it comes to reproaches concerning the absence of other hon. members in this House during this debate. In the course of my speech I shall come back to the few possible arguments which may have filtered through in the course of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. The hon. member for Durban Central delivered a long speech on imperialism. He said that by means of this legislation we were now practising imperialism. With a view to the Government&#x2019;s efforts to lead these people towards self-realization and towards a meaningful right of self-determination, it is inexplicable to us on this side of the House that the Government can be accused of imperialism. And, Sir, that comes from a member from Natal, who should surely be an authority on imperialism.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I shall attempt to limit myself <i>in toto</i> to the provisions of this Bill. The valid arguments, apart from the inadmissible attempt made to discuss the Coloured policy of this side of the House, the arguments which are <i>ad idem</i> as regards the Bill before the House, amount, basically, to this; that all the opposition parties accuse us of wanting, by means of this Bill, to render even more inferior a constitutional institution, viz. the CRC, which in their opinion, is already an inferior constitutional institution. I think that that, in a nutshell, is a fair summing up of the valid arguments applicable in regard to this Bill. I want to try and reply to this allegation. I concede at once that the CRC is a constitutional body with limited powers. These limited powers have been laid down in the Act, and have also been mentioned by the hon. member for Rondebosch and, I think, by the hon. member for Durban North as well. However, there is a very great difference between an inferior body and a constitutional body with limited powers. I want to challenge the hon. member for Rondebosch, <span class="col_3447-3448" refersTo="page_0137"/>the hon. member for Durban North, and the hon. member for Durban Central, to go and tell the City Council members in their constituencies, that city councils are inferior constitutional bodies, even though they have limited powers, or that the city councillors are inferior because they are prepared to serve in such bodies. The <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> situation of the CRC is that it is a constitutional body with limited powers. The Minister has certain control functions, in that legislation has to be approved by him. That is laid down in the Act. He also had certain powers under that section in the Act which is being replaced by means of this Bill. He has now come to this Parliament and stated that these powers, in the section which we now want to replace by means of this Bill, are not adequate to deal effectively with the situation which may arise and which we wanted to prevent by means of this very section. He therefore envisages an improvement to subsection (A), which has already been debated in this House. To say now that this clause withdraws powers from the CRC, is to lose contact entirely with the factual situation. We have in the CRC a constitutional body for a specific population group which is progressing towards a goal, as we, in the course of our history, progressed towards a goal. Although there is no direct correlation, I do just want to refer to the statement made by the hon. member for Durban Central concerning imperialism. When the White nation of South Africa was in the position of having to climb the ladder by means of constitutional bodies with limited powers, it succeeded in doing so. This Government is offering the Coloured community in the CRC the opportunity to develop. The CRC is a political body in the process of evolution. It is a political body that is progressing towards a goal.</p>

<p>In the Act itself, provision has been made for the fact that from time to time an extension of the powers of this Council may take place. The Act must be read together with the speech by the hon. the Prime Minister towards the end of last year, when he offered the CRC the hand of friendship. This Bill effects no change to the powers of the CRC.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_klerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. W. DE KLERK</person>:</from>

<p>It changes nothing, because this clause incorporates a suspensive condition. This clause confers no powers on the Minister, unless certain things occur. It is only when a specific event takes place that the Minister may exercise his powers under this Bill. As long as the chairman of the executive or the Council exercises his powers, this Bill is a dead letter and is of no force and effect. The elements of refusal and omission must first be present before the Minister may step in and make this Bill applicable. Therefore, the allegation by the hon. member for Yeoville to the effect that the Minister may even act if he is dissatisfied with the way in which the chairman of the executive or the council is exercising his or its powers, is by no means correct. Does the hon. member not understand the provision&#x003F; There is one key word: &#x201C;Fail&#x201D; (Afrikaans: &#x201C;In gebreke bly&#x201D;). The chairman of the executive has first to fail, in other words he has to withdraw and state that he will no longer exercise his function, the Council has first to withdraw and state that it will no longer function as a council before the Minister may step in and apply the legislation. Until that happens, their powers are unaffected, and they continue as in the past. Until then the hand of friendship proffered to them by the Prime Minister will still be there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that we were causing confrontation by means of this Bill, and that the National Party was a party of confrontation. I see no reason for his having said anything of the kind. The powers of the CRC are unaltered. This Bill is only there to provide for a situation that may develop. In that event the Minister must ensure that there will be effective administration of Coloured affairs. This argument has already been advanced and consequently I shall not develop it further or dwell on it. Confrontation has been sought in this debate by hon. members opposite, <i>inter alia</i> by the members of the Reformist Party who offered themselves as advisers of the Coloured leaders. On the one hand, the hon. members of the Reformist Party and the Progressive Party state that this election has given the Coloured leaders a mandate, but on the other hand, they do not trust those Coloured leaders and they consider it their duty to interfere with, what the Coloured leaders do with that mandate. The mandate of 19 March 1975 was not a mandate to the Progressive Party nor was it a mandate to <span class="col_3449-3450" refersTo="page_0138"/>the Reformist Party. It was a mandate given by the Coloured voters to their own leaders.</p>

<p>This is an innocuous Bill that was well-meant, one that only provides for the prevention of chaos in the event of a specific situation arising, and which seeks to ensure that in a time of crisis, which has by no means arisen yet, there will be order and proper administration of the country. There is no confrontation inherent in such a Bill. However, confrontation is, in fact, inherent in the political smoke screen we have had from that side of the House.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that it is the task of the State&#x2014;and we are in control at the present moment&#x2014;to maintain law and order in this country. This primary task also implies orderly administration at all levels and at all times, if we had not come to light with this Bill, we should have failed to carry out this task.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, to enter into a debate of this kind at this stage with all the restrictions placed upon one and with the baying of voices on one&#x2019;s left, is very much like Daniel going into the lion&#x2019;s den. Because there are so many ex-dominies on that side I should perhaps say it is like a lion going into a den of Daniels. I want to try to revert to the seriousness of this debate rather than the kind of entertainment and fun and games we have had to witness this afternoon.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, when he spoke in the no-confidence debate during the previous session about the future of the Coloured people of South Africa, said that the statement he was going to make was probably the most important statement he was going to make. When the hon. the Minister spoke last year, he said amongst other things that he accepted that there was a terrifying responsibility on the shoulders of the Nationalist Party Government. Mr. Speaker, in the early part of this year, before this session opened, the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Coloured, Rehoboth and Nama Relations met with some of the Coloured leadership in our land, and when one reads the history of that encounter and the Press reports and the statement of the hon. the Prime Minister, it is quite clear that he, too, considers the destiny of the Coloured people as being of absolute paramount importance in South Africa. In the no-confidence debate which followed that meeting the hon. the Prime Minister said, amongst other things, in referring to the Coloured people&#x2014;</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, words of wisdom indeed, it would be a great thing if only the actions matched the words. It is against that kind of background that I want to enter into this debate today. We all know the importance of the role of the Coloured people in this country. Their role, their destiny, is such that the caucus of the Nationalist Party has again and again discussed this, and there are obviously different points of view as to the ultimate destiny of the Coloured people. That is why this Bill itself, which deals with the powers given to the Coloured people up till now, is so absolutely important to this House, to the Coloured people and to this country. This Bill affects 2&#x00BD; million people; that is why it is so important. It affects more than that; it affects the total population of South Africa, because we are in this boat together. If this boat sinks, we sink with it. If this boat sails into calmer waters, with a better future, it is to the benefit of all of us, and that is why this Bill is of such absolute importance. Therefore, Sir, whatever is contemplated in relation to the Coloured people of South Africa, whatever Bills are introduced, whatever words are spoken, must surely be done with absolute sensitivity because of the times in which we live and the effect that it is going to have on so many people. Sir, notice that leave would be sought to introduce this Bill was given at the height of the recent election for the CRC. This has already been referred to and I will not dwell upon it, except to say two things. I do not think anyone else has said this before; I am quite sure, Sir, that you will correct me if I am wrong. Mr. Sonny Leon, prior to the election, said that he wanted from his people this kind of mandate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To demonstrate beyond any doubt whatsoever that they reject apartheid in all its forms and to make it clear at the <span class="col_3451-3452" refersTo="page_0139"/>polls on Wednesday that they believe in the rights of every South African, regardless of race, colour or creed, to all the fruits of citizenship.</block>

<p>Sir, the results of this last election are very clear. In 1969 the Labour Party won 26 seats; in 1974 they won 31 seats. Let us also look at the votes cast: In 1969 the Labour Party received 135 000 odd votes, and in the election last week they received 151 000 votes. In the last election all other parties received 158 000 votes, but in the election last week they received less than 90 000 votes. In other words, the Labour Party received 62% of the votes cast. Now, Sir, at the time when this kind of election was taking place we received notice of this Bill. I want to say this is hardly taking a sensible approach. It is hardly adopting an approach which shows cognizance of just how serious the situation is in South Africa. We had for example together with this Bill the speech by the hon. the Prime Minister. The hon. member who has just sat down has said that the hon. the Prime Minister and the Nationalist Government stretched out the hand of friendship to the Coloured people. Sir, when warnings and threats are uttered before even the final votes are counted, when a Bill of this nature is introduced before the final votes have been counted, then I say, choosing my words very carefully, that one can hardly blame the Coloured people if in their perception, in their eyes, they see a hand turning into a fist. That is why it is so serious and why we have to argue so strenuously against this Bill. Sir, when the hon. the Prime Minister was at Smithfield right at the heart of the election, when the destiny, the future, of the CRC was being decided, he warned them at that time. He talked about the peace that was in South Africa and said he would not allow anyone to interfere with that peace. That is very understandable. It is however a great pity that he did not recall the words of General Hertzog, whose visit to Smithfield 50 years ago was being celebrated, when he said a long time ago, in fact in 1925 &#x2026;</p>

<p>Then we had a new argument advanced this afternoon by the hon. member for Johannesburg West, and that is quite interesting. It seems to me, if one may use an analogy, that we had from that hon. member a description of the Government&#x2019;s approach. It says: We are going to play together; we are going to have a match. But then they find they are behind in points and they blow the whistle and say: Right, now we will have a few new rules; we will tie your feet together just to make quite sure that we win. That is the kind of example we have had from the hon. member for Johannesburg West this afternoon. He actually endorses that. He says this Bill is fair and it is right because it is negative, but that it is also very constructive. This is the kind of dialectic theology one learns at Stellenbosch, Sir. He spoke of a holding together, a Karl Barth approach, but unfortunately one must also remember the words of Thomas Jefferson. If we are going to hear from Barth and others in the theological world then we must also hear from Jefferson who said that if a thing is morally wrong, it can never be politically right. That is the point, and this Bill is morally wrong. The whole action of the Government is morally wrong and therefore it can never be politically right, no matter how they try to dodge that.</p>

<p>The effects of the Bill, as has been said before, are generally speaking very widespread and I shall not deal with that again. However, let us look at the specific results of the Bill before us. In the original Act, No. 49 of 1964, we find listed in section 20 the various powers of the council. These powers will be assumed by the hon. the Minister if, at any stage, the council <span class="col_3453-3454" refersTo="page_0140"/>fails to carry them out. I think therefore that it is relevant for us to have at least another look at some of these powers because when one looks at them one realizes that the hon. the Minister becomes the council himself; in fact, he becomes the executive. When the hon. the Minister assumes these powers, he will start to enter into a conversation with himself. Once a man is accused of talking to himself, then it is very dangerous. I want to point out some of these dangers because we are concerned for the hon. the Minister. The definition of the word &#x201C;Government&#x201D; used in section 20 is that it may be construed as meaning the Minister. Section 20 provides <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council shall have the power on request to advise the Government &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x201C;Government&#x201D; means &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; as I have already pointed out&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in regard to all matters affecting the economic, social, educational and political interests of the Coloured population of the Republic.</block>

<p>This means that the hon. the Minister will have to make an appointment with himself in order to tell himself about his problems, because he, in fact, will become the council and the executive if this Bill has to be implemented in the event of the failure or breakdown of the CRC. There are many other provisions in section 20 one of which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By mediation of the Minister members of the executive shall have direct access to any Minister &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister will then have to apply to the hon. the Minister for permission to see the hon. the Minister in order that the council&#x2019;s work can continue. We can go on in this way. One of the things to which I think we should direct our attention appears in subsection (8) which refers to the salaries and allowances paid. I would say that if the hon. the Minister is going to take over all the powers in terms of the Bill and this particular subsection, then he should get an increase in salary because he is going to have to do so much more work! In fact, he will have to take over completely the work of the executive and the work of the council itself.</p>

<p>When one looks at the Bill, one has to see it in terms of the acute dilemma which faces this country&#x2014;not merely the Government, but the country and that side as well as this side of the House together with the whole population. The hon. member who spoke immediately before I did referred to this dilemma and to the mandate which the Coloured people had given the Labour Party. He also referred to the mandate which the White electorate had given the Nationalist Party. That is true. Of course we recognize that. This is a hard fact of politics and if we could change it, we would. Hopefully we will. This is the absolute dilemma which faces South Africa at this time and that is why it is so important. Right at the very crossroads you have one section of our country with one particular mandate. That mandate is very clear: Get rid of apartheid and let us have representation in Parliament. On the other hand you have the mandate of the White electorate which says: We shall continue with apartheid, separate development or whatever it might be &#x2026;</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, we heard a great deal about this. We also heard that the White people years ago had to climb the ladder. This was the expression that was used: They had to climb the ladder. However, the top of the ladder was this Parliament. What the hon. members are saying is that the Coloureds should be given a shorter ladder; or: &#x201C;Let them by all means climb the ladder but let us tie their feet together so that they cannot get up too far.&#x201D; Hon. members may also say: &#x201C;There are two ladders. The one is a long one and the other is a shorter one.&#x201D; That is why this Bill is so bad.</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, of course, I submit to your ruling and I shall come down to the lower levels. In conclusion I want to say that we have to solve this dilemma. We have a CRC and we have a Labour Party now in the majority and we are wondering what is going to happen. Because the Government tries to anticipate it, it introduces a Bill like this. There are two possible approaches to a <span class="col_3455-3456" refersTo="page_0141"/>dilemma. The one is confrontation. We have been told that we are the ones who adopt that approach, but that is nonsense. This Bill is an act of confrontation and that is the problem. The other solution is to be found in the process of negotiation. We have to negotiate and we have to say what is negotiable and what is not negotiable. That is what we are asking from this Government. The Coloured people of South Africa have been referred to as God&#x2019;s step-children and we are enforcing that by this Bill. That is why we oppose it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it will indeed demand great ability and, to use your term, great artistry to steer between the Scylla of your ruling and the Charybdis of the seriousness of this Bill and to make a contribution in the midst of the light-heartedness, so it seems to me, which sometimes borders on frivolity in respect of this measure, and the ideological labyrinth which was outlined yesterday by the hon. member for Waterberg. In an attempt to make a contribution here, I want to say immediately that I shall try to shape my arguments in another mould, viz. by appealling to the Minister to consider, even at this late stage, not continuing with the Bill, I want to say in advance that this will be the core of my argument that I hope that in this way I shall not repeat arguments, which have been used <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House.</p>

<p>When we look at a Bill of this sort, it seems to me that there are four criteria which can be applied to determine whether it should be placed on the Statute Book by this House. In the first place, we must find out whether it is essential and whether circumstances have arisen which make it essential for this sort of measure to be taken at this stage. I approach the matter from a serious point of view and I want to say that not one of us in this House can honestly say today that a situation has arisen which has made the introduction of this Bill essential. All that has been said, and I have respect for the other hon. members&#x2019; standpoint, is that a crisis situation can arise and that the hon. the Minister must therefore have the powers to deal with that situation, should it arise. It has been said repeatedly by other hon. members, and I want to say that sufficient justification has not been offered to prove the necessity for bringing a measure of this nature to the House. Many theoretical situations can arise in many areas. If each of us were to say that provision must be made for theoretical situations which might arise, this House would continually be occupying itself with things which can really be regarded as irrelevant and unimportant. Therefore I want to say that to my mind no real necessity for this Bill has been proved in this House.</p>

<p>In the second place, we must ask ourselves to what extent this measure will contribute to the proper or better performance of the functions of the CRC by the council itself. Surely it is clear that the answer to this is negative, because all that the Bill makes provision for, is for the Minister to be able to take over the functions of the executive or the council. How this will enable us to assist the executive in the better performance of its functions, is beyond my comprehension. Quite honestly, I cannot see how this can be.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>If that were to happen, the CRC would be finished in any case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, exactly, I shall come to that later. If this measure were really to be implemented, the whole council and its functions would be finished. I shall come back to that later.</p>

<p>In the third place, the question can be asked as to whether this measure helps to bring about better relations between White and non-White in South Africa. In other words, with this measure, are we creating circumstances in which there will be a greater degree of trust between the Coloured people and the Whites and in particular between the Coloured group or people, or whatever we might call them, and this House and the Government&#x003F; I want to say that without any doubt this Bill has and will have precisely the opposite effect. One can say that it does have one positive function, viz. that the hope exists that we can force those people to a degree of sobriety in this way. In other words, with this we can hold a kind of sjambok or a sword of Damocles over their heads and say to them, &#x201C;If you do not do this and that, we want to inform you that we have already made other machinery available to deal with the situation.&#x201D; I just want to say that that sort of attitude is not one which will bring about good relations between the Coloured community and the Government. For this reason, I want to say <span class="col_3457-3458" refersTo="page_0142"/>that it is really unnecessary in my opinion to continue with this measure at this stage.</p>

<p>A further requirement is that one should ask oneself whether there was proper consultation in connection with this matter. I do not want to dwell on this at any length, I just want to point out that the hon. member for Piketberg intimated that the present executive may well have been consulted. However, he did not state it as a fact. I just want to say that it seems to me that there was not proper consultation with the present executive or the new members of the CRC and definitely not with the members of the Theron Commission who are investigating this whole matter. For this reason as well, it seems to me that there is no justification for continuing with this measure.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, it is essential that we ask ourselves what the reaction of the Brown people in particular will be to this measure. That reaction must be seen against the background of the history of the CRC. Mr. Speaker, I want to respect your ruling and therefore I shall not go into details. I just want to mention five points in this connection, viz. the fact that the CRC is seen as the alternative for representation in this body; the history of the CRC in terms of the powers which it has had and the decisions which it has taken, which were often not implemented; the composition of the council and especially the question of the nominees on the council; the limited powers and functions of the council; and the fact that the Coloured &#x00E9;lite &#x2014;I think the hon. the Minister and hon. members will concede this to me&#x2014;have never accepted that council and still do not accept it, at least not to my knowledge, as well as the fact that those people did not participate in the latest election precisely because they do not accept the council and want nothing to do with, it. That is indeed my honest impression. In addition, there is the timing of the introduction of this measure, and the question of the interpretation of the election results. One thing is very clear, Mr. Speaker; however we interpret this election, whether we like it or not, it represents a massive rejection, by those Coloureds who voted, of the so-called apartheid politics.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Now the hon. member must guard against repetition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall, Mr. Speaker. Those election results also represent a rejection of the CRC as a means of achieving full political realization for the ideals and aspirations of the Coloured population. I want to add that in my honest opinion there is a tremendous degree of disillusionment, of despair, of doubt in the <i>bona fides</i> of the Whites and of bitterness among the Coloured population. That we cannot doubt and I want to say that I do believe that this sort of measure can only aggravate that bitterness and that despair.</p>

<p>Objections have been raised to our saying that should this measure be accepted, it could be seen as the failure of the Government&#x2019;s policy. It is in fact correct to say that that failure will only become apparent in practice when the measure is put into operation, because when it is put into operation, nothing will remain of this machinery which has been created by the Government in terms of its policy. But then in theory at least we must concede that in that sense this measure implies admission of the failure of the Government&#x2019;s policy, because that policy was based on two legs. The one is the creation of a Coloured body with specific functions. That body has often been called a Coloured Parliament in this House. The second leg of that policy, in the light of the policy announcements which were made last year by the hon. the Prime Minister, is the creation of a joint Cabinet committee to consult together about those interests which affect both Coloured people and Whites. If this measure were to become operative now, it would mean the end of that road. If it were to be implemented, it would mean the end of that road, because it would then mean that the CRC could function no more. It would not be able to function any longer, because its functions would be taken over by the Minister. It would also mean that that joint Cabinet committee could no longer exist or function. In that sense the implementation of this measure would mean the end of the road. We cannot deny this; there are no two ways about it.</p>

<p>Objections were made by certain members when the term &#x201C;confrontation&#x201D; was used here. Mr. Speaker, the actual confrontation will arise when this measure is implemented. I have taken note of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that he does not want to interfere with the functions of the CRC in respect of legislation. But surely the hon. the Minister knows that if he finds <span class="col_3459-3460" refersTo="page_0143"/>himself in the situation that he cannot co-operate with the executive, and he has to take over the functions of the executive, the possibility of his being able to co-operate with the CRC will not exist. In other words, it must necessarily lead to confrontation with the whole council. In this sense it is surely very clear that this measure does in fact contain the possibility of confrontation. Sir, I want to avoid confrontation; we all want to avoid it. I do not want to confront the hon. the Minister either. Therefore I want to ask once again at this stage&#x2014;and I shall come back to this &#x2014;whether the hon. the Minister and the Government cannot consider not continuing with this legislation, in spite of the discussions in this House, the standpoints which have been adopted and the contracts which have already been created. I am convinced that apart from the possibility of confrontation, this measure can only strengthen the hands of the enemies of the Coloured Representative Council. If it is our intention to convert this Council into a body which really has a function to fulfil, it is irresponsible of us to give this weapon to those people who are the very ones who condemn the council, the very ones who do not want the council. They are the only people whose hands we are strengthening. Surely that should be clear to everyone.</p>

<p>Having made my honest and serious request to the Minister, I want to ask now what the Government stands to lose if it withdraws the measure at this stage. It can only lose the possible impression of unyieldingness. I concede that it can lose the impression that once it has adopted a standpoint, it will stick to that standpoint, no matter what happens, but I want to say quite honestly that to my mind there are other and stronger reasons why this consideration ought not to apply. The Government can say it refuses to comply with this request because it is essential that the Minister must have these powers and because, if the legislation is not passed, a situation can arise which will create a vacuum in respect of the machinery for action. I do not think that argument can be used here. This House will be in session until the middle of June. The chairman and the members of the executive have not yet been appointed and that council has not yet assembled. We have had no indication yet, except for what a few of the members of the Labour Party said at public meetings during the election campaign. If the words which we use in election campaigns were to be taken literally, however, and were to be applied in this House, I do not know where we would be. I am not making any accusations. I just want to say that there is still plenty of latitude and plenty of time before a crisis situation may arise. During that period we can see how the situation develops. If it then appears that a crisis situation may arise, something which some members fear &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, then it will not be too late. There will be enough time to introduce a measure of this nature. The Government must be given time to hold consultations with this council as it has been newly constituted. I think that this action of the Government makes it impossible to create an atmosphere in which anyone will be able to act in a spirit of trust and goodwill. I do want to say&#x2014;the hon. the Minister and all of us know it&#x2014;that we shall very often be confronted with the situation on the road ahead that we shall have to talk to people who do not necessarily think as we do or as the Government does. That is unavoidable. We must not throw in the towel in advance. We must not say in advance that we are scared of talking to those people because those people have adopted certain preconceived standpoints. We shall have to talk to those people and keep on talking. We cannot talk to people if we hold the sword of Damocles above their heads. You and I as adults would object to people wanting to talk to us while they are holding a sjambok or a revolver behind their backs.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that we must give this new council a chance to act responsibly. In the light of this I want to make a serious and an honest appeal to the hon. the Minister and the Government once again. I also want to appeal to the hon. the Minister of Defence, who previously dealt with this portfolio himself. I want to appeal to them not to continue with this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member for Edenvale and the four criteria he laid down for himself in the discussion of this specific amending Bill. I do not want to reply to him in that regard. In any event, I think that attention has already been given to most of his arguments. I think, too, that <span class="col_3461-3462" refersTo="page_0144"/>when the hon. the Minister replies, he will again reply to certain of the aspects raised by the hon. member. However, I just want to make two short references to the speech by the hon. member. In the first instance, I want to refer to the hon. member&#x2019;s remark to the effect that in his opinion the atmosphere in this House was not serious enough. I just want to tell the hon. member that the longer he is a member of this House, the more he will realize that a measure of humour finds its way into serious debates, too. I do not think, therefore, that the hon. member should worry about that. I do not think that either side of the House is failing to give the necessary serious attention to this matter. I shall come back to that later on.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s second point was that this amending Bill sought confrontation. From the long history of the population issue in South Africa, the hon. member will know that this is what constitutes the difference between this side of the House and the various opposition parties, namely that we are seeking to avoid confrontation in South Africa in a different way. As far as the Coloureds are concerned, our view is that the road of non-confrontation is this very one of parallel development. That is why we on this side do not seek confrontation.</p>

<p>In this debate thus far we have heard all three of the leaders of the various opposition parties speaking and debating. I want to dwell for a moment on the leaders of the two smaller opposition parties. I want to set them apart from the hon. the Leader of the official Opposition because in my opinion, the Leader of the official Opposition, Sir de Villiers Graaff, is far, far more responsible in his debating and his handling of affairs as an opposition leader than is the Leader of the Progressive Party or the Leader of the Democratic Party. Personally I have a great deal of respect for the responsible debating of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when very sensitive and delicate matters in South Africa are at issue. I want to tell you, Sir, that personally, I am very grateful that we are given the opportunity of listening to the Progressive Party and to the newly formed Reformist Party as well, particularly in this debate, and I do not want the hon. the Leader of the Reformist Party to feel slighted if I ignore him for the moment today. In this debate he was not as important as the Leader of the Progressive Party. I want to come back to two matters stated by the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party. Yesterday he dwelt on this Bill and said: &#x201C;It is dictatorial,&#x201D; and then&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But what is perhaps more important at this stage is that it reflects a complete insensitivity towards the attitudes and the feelings of the Coloured people who have voted in this last election.</block>

<p>Sir, it is very important for us in South Africa, for me and, I think, for the party of which I am a member, too, that the discussion of relations issues in South Africa be handled with the greatest care and the greatest possible degree of responsibility. This is necessary not only as regards a debate of this kind in Southern Africa, but also throughout the world, and if there were to be a greater understanding of the problem that results from the meeting of a diversity of peoples and race groups, then it is that people should talk about these things with more circumspection and with more knowledge. I want to say that through the years I have learned to know the spirit and the attitude, the animus, in which the National Party debates this Bill as one of great understanding, not only for the Coloureds or the Whites or the other population groups, but also for the history from which it develops. This particular Bill is only a part of a long history of development that will not come to a standstill today, but which will quite possibly still be argued about throughout future history. I just want to state very clearly that whereas we are speaking here, and the rest of the world hears us, and many of these people are sitting and listening to us, the greatest responsibility and respect and appreciation and insight is displayed by the National Party when these matters are discussed, not only in public, but also in its innermost circles. I want to stress this very categorically and therewith I want to come back to a second point raised by the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party. Very early in the debate he replied to the hon. member for Piketberg. The hon. member for Piketberg was very careful not to draw inferences from the recent election of members of the CRC. He was very careful and only touched on certain things by saying that there is a possibility that they may well arise. In contrast, the Leader of the Progressive Party adopted a different attitude, and it is this that I find so disappointing in the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party, viz. that <span class="col_3463-3464" refersTo="page_0145"/>he does not always have his facts right and that, as leader of the select party of South Africa, in the highest Chamber, he often makes statements which he is unable to justify. In referring to the hon. member for Piketberg, the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party said (Hansard, 25 March 1975)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He also referred to the low percentage of Coloured persons who had voted in the Cape, especially in urban areas of Cape Town&#x2014;approximately 20% or even less. He said a likely reason for this was that these people were not politically aware.</block>

<p>Then the Leader of the Progressive Party goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, it is precisely because they are politically aware that they will have nothing to do with a system which brands them as second-rate citizens.</block>

<p>Sir, I question the scientific correctness of this statement by the hon. the Leader of the Progressive Party. He reveals no knowledge whatsoever of the election campaign of the various parties, nor has he revealed any sources indicating to us that the stay-away vote, the people who did not vote, acted in that way because they anticipated that the Minister of Coloured Affairs and the National Party would come up with this amendment to the Act. I want to say it here this evening, and the rest of the country must know it, that the Progressive Party is not a party that is capable of dealing with the population problems of South Africa in the light of scientifically correct facts. They speak from ignorance, and not only the White politicians, but also the Coloured politicians are totally unable to argue with them on that basis. When we look at this Bill, what does it tell us&#x003F; If I may say something new, then it is that if the hon. the Minister is satisfied that the chairman of the executive fails, for whatever reason, to exercise or perform any power, function or duty conferred or imposed by this Act, the Minister may exercise or perform such power, function or duty or authorize any other person to exercise or perform such power, function or duty. These words&#x2014;as the hon. member for Johannesburg West said&#x2014;concern not only the CRC or its leader, or the executive, but in fact concern the entire Coloured population. What the hon. the Minister wants to do, the powers he wants to take upon himself in the event of the necessity arising, are by no means intended to put a stop to the course of development of the political history of the Coloureds. His aim is precisely to put it at the service of the entire Coloured community. What functions can the CRC cease to carry out&#x003F; It can cease to carry out its education functions. That is very important, since as far as I know, about 1 300 people are employed in connection with education. That is more than &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#enthoven">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. E. ENTHOVEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have been debating these unlucky 13 lines for about seven hours now, and I promise not to repeat the arguments of the hon. members on this side of the House. I support their arguments, but I feel that there are in addition other important aspects which should be considered by this House. Before coming to those aspects, I should like to reply to a few of the suggestions made by the other side of the House. I will start off with the hon. member for Rissik, who has just sat down. He suggested that the low poll in this election was not an indication of the fact that the Coloured people rejected the CRC. He suggested that there might be other reasons for it. I think that if he knew a little bit about what had happened recently in the history of the Coloured political development, he would know that there are 1 million people who probably qualify to be registered as voters for the CRC, while only 400 000 of these actually registered. And it was not through neglect that the other 600 000 were not registered; it was not because they were not interested in politics. There was, however, a determined effort, an organized effort, by a well-organized group to stop people from registering. This is a fact, and I think we <span class="col_3465-3466" refersTo="page_0146"/>have got to consider it. If one takes the 400 000 odd people who did register&#x2014;I do not have the actual figures here&#x2014;one finds that only about 250 000 of those people voted, and the reasons for this are exactly the same. I think before the hon, member for Rissik makes allegations in this House, he must make sure that he has done a little bit of research himself.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sir, I would like to come to the speech of the hon. member for Johannesburg West. He made a few interesting suggestions. He impressed upon us how important it was that in these times when race relations are so sensitive in South Africa and when the whole situation between us in South Africa and the countries to the north, of us is in the balance, nothing should be done to bring about a situation of confrontation. He suggested that we on this side of the House had been acting dishonestly and he said that no finger could be pointed at either the Nationalist Party or the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of what they had done with regard to the political future of the Coloured people. I regret to say, Sir, that I cannot agree with him on this point. I think that unfortunately, as a result of the introduction of this Bill, a big question mark does hang over the role of the Nationalist Party and, unfortunately, of the hon. the Prime Minister as to their <i>bona fides</i> and their credibility in the eyes of the Coloured people. I would like to motivate this statement by referring to three important announcements which the hon. the Prime Minister made recently just before the Coloured election. I think he repeated this on a number of occasions, but what he in fact said was that the great dilemma, which had been facing separate development virtually since it was formulated by the Nationalist Party, had been solved. Sir, I think it is important that you allow me the freedom to discuss this dilemvery briefly because I think it is relevant.</p>

<p>I think the fact that so many hon. members on this side of the House have got up to speak on this Bill shows that we consider it to be a Bill which is very destructive to good race relations in South Africa. I think it is important, when one is arguing why a Bill should or should not be read a Second Time, that one must be able to motivate one&#x2019;s arguments. I give you my assurance, Mr. Speaker, that the point that I want to make is one which has not been made before; it is a new point which has to do with the credibility of the Nationalist Party and the credibility of the hon. the Prime Minister. I think if a member of this House feels that the credibility of the governing party and of the hon. the Prime Minister is in question, he ought to be able to motivate his case, because if he is unable to motivate his case he is unable to get a reply from the Government, and if hon. members on this side of the House feel that there could be some question as to the credibility of that side, then people outside of the House may hold the same view, and I do not think that that would be in the interests of the country. I appeal to you, Sir &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, the next point I want to deal with is the effect of this Bill on race relations in South Africa. The hon. member for Edenvale made the point that the introduction and the passing of this Bill would be a geat tool in the hands of the enemies of the CRC. I should like to go further and say that the introduction of the Bill is a tool in the hands of all those people, both within and outside South Africa, and not only Coloureds but Blacks and Indians as well, who wish to destroy all confidence between the White people and the other race groups in this country. I should like to motivate that statement At this particular moment in time Black politics in South Africa is going through a crisis period as well and the reason is that the moderate&#x2014;if I can use that word&#x2014;non-White leaders who have endeavoured for many years now to come to terms with the White Government of South Africa have been unable to show results to their people for the moderate stance they have taken. The militants have been feeding upon this inability of the moderate leaders to show results.

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members will not believe me, but some weeks ago I wrote the following note, which I showed to an experienced newspaperman, with reference to a certain incident in the notebook I have before me. &#x201C;A good heading will be: &#x2018;Enthoven&#x2019;t Hooft onthoof&#x2019; &#x201D;. And you have just done it, Sir. I am sorry for the hon. member who actually did not have much more to say at the end of the debate, but wanted to say it nevertheless. That has been the dilemma of the hon. Opposition in this whole debate. A debate concerning a virtually innocent piece of administrative legislation to maintain order at a lesser institution which we want to help on the road ahead, has been seized by the different factions in the opposition in order to start their in-fighting and competition in one and the same section of the electorate in that each of the factions wanted to make a case for their being the best exponents of intercession on behalf of the non-White community That is what was at stake, to the detriment of our country.</p>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. member for Edenvale that one must avoid harmful situations in debates of this nature. One must try to keep relations sound. However, what has happened&#x003F; When I look at a few of the exaggerated adjectives which were used to condemn this innocent piece of legislation, it tells a story. I begin with the hon. Leader of the Opposition who spoke of this legislation as &#x201C;naked baas-skap&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I always listen well. If the hon. member were to do the same, it would be to his benefit and he might gain more insight into what is going on.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central spoke this afternoon of &#x201C;autocratic powers&#x201D; contained in the legislation. The hon. the Leader of the small new party at the back over there also spoke of &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D;. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that with this legislation we were placing the Coloured once more in the position of subordinate and servant. So I can continue. What is the net result of utterances of this kind&#x003F; To pose before certain Coloured politicians and in this process to compete with each other as to who is best able to speak on behalf of the Coloureds. If I can give Coloured leaders advice at this stage, it is to steer clear of these people who want to use them as a rear-guard in their own infighting.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville moved an amendment yesterday in which he intimated that the legislation would be harmful externally in view of d&#x00E9;tente politics as well as internally in view of relations. I want to refute the hon. member&#x2019;s argument and tell him that this legislation can only be held up and interpreted as harmful to South Africa externally by people who are malicious, and in this House there are people who do interpret it that way. I believe that the legislation is the very proof for people abroad and also for people in Africa who are interested in orderly progress in the times in which we live, that the Government will see to it, as far as it is within its powers, that progress will take place in an orderly fashion and that the powers which want to destroy order will be halted in the proper way in the process. In so far as the hon. member for Yeoville made the statement that the legislation would create internal tension, I want to point out to him that the Government has an instruction from its voters. I want to be <span class="col_3469-3470" refersTo="page_0148"/>so presumptuous as to make the further statement that the Government has received a tacit instruction form the Coloured voters in the country to see that there is order in the country.</p>

Their people, who <span class="col_3471-3472" refersTo="page_0149"/>gave them a mandate and who elected them, also want them to use those powers.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>On the day of the election, notice was given of the introduction of this legislation. This legislation, in other words, could have no impact on the election. It is proof of the intentions of the hon. the Minister not to introduce legislation which could be dragged into the election by some party at the expense of another party. That is why notice was given on the day of the election while the details were only made available later.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other hon. members alleged that this legislation was not introduced for technical or administrative purposes only, but that it was politically motivated. But I want to say that this is far from the truth. The powers which the hon. the Minister obtains by means of this legislation, are not powers which he is going to implement immediately by proclamation; in fact, it might happen that he will never implement them.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that he hopes so. I hope so myself. If the hon. member who says that he hopes so, will further his hope by using the influence which he has among the Coloured leaders, we shall make progress. The powers which the hon. the Minister obtains by means of this legislation are what I want to call reserve powers, in other words, powers which will not be used before circumstances arise which oblige him to exercise these powers in the interests of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>The hon. members argued this way and that about the amendment of 1972 which dealt with the situation which would arise if the CRC were to refuse to make funds available. Now it has been pointed out that this legislation allows the hon. the Minister to prevent chaos from setting in in a far wider field. I should like to give this House an idea of what can happen if people who are placed in a position of control in that council do not carry out their obligations and duties. In terms of the Coloured Persons Education Act of 1963, the Minister delegated certain powers in the past&#x2014;and it can happen this way again&#x2014;to the member of the executive in charge of educational affairs&#x2014;for example, the introduction and abolition of courses at schools and everything connected therewith, in terms of section 21, financial assistance to Coloureds and students in terms of section 24, and the determination of school and boarding fees and the application of the means test for that purpose in terms of section 25. If these delegated powers cannot be exercised, the services are crippled or come to a halt. Hon. members on the opposite side made a great fuss and used many derogatory adjectives to describe this legislation.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member may believe, in his stupidity or ignorance, that those derogatory adjectives, were used correctly but also in the light of what the hon. member for Edenvale said this afternoon about relations, I can see what the hon. member is doing to relations in this country. If the Government were to neglect to take such powers to prevent a situation as has been described, who would be to blame for the consequences&#x003F; The members of the executive who did not wish to carry out their duties would not be the ones who would be blamed but this Government. The first people who would blame it would be the hon. members on the opposite side. In terms of the same Act to which I have referred, other powers may also be delegated to the executive&#x2014; for example, the establishment of part-time classes at schools or technical colleges, the granting of grants-in-aid and loans to State-aided educational institutions and related matters. If those delegated powers cannot be exercised, there will be impossible delays <span class="col_3473-3474" refersTo="page_0150"/>in this field. In terms of the regulations under this Act the hon. the Minister delegated powers to the member concerned of the executive. These related to matters such as fees at colleges and schools, grants to pupils and bursaries as well, the classification of schools, the appointments to regional councils, the appointments to advisory councils for institutions, deciding on new State-aided vocational schools, special schools, continuation classes, etc. Now I ask again: If people do not want to carry out their delegated duties for whatever reason, should the Coloured population of South Africa suffer through this in such a broad field or should the Government of the day which has to maintain order make timely provision for such an eventuality&#x003F; That reminds me of what the hon. member for Edenvale said in this connection. He asked what the Government could lose by withdrawing this Bill so that the CRC could assemble first and talks could be held with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister at this stage whether the chairman of the executive and the other members will not be nominated long before the CRC is summoned to meet so that consultations with the executive can be held before that council assembles&#x003F; Will there not, therefore, be an opportunity, long before Parliament adjourns, to see how matters stand&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The chairman and the executive will probably be appointed at a very short session of the CRC before Parliament adjourns. But when the CRC&#x2019;s ordinary session begins, this Parliament will no longer be in session. That is when problems may arise. [Interjections.] Keep quiet now. I want to assist the hon. member a little more. This legislation does not deal with a certain person or party; nor does it deal with a certain period. These are reserve powers which will be there at all times. At this moment it will probably be suitable to refer to the remark of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, that the corresponding provision in the Transkei Constitution Act was not comparable. It is indeed comparable because it is still in that Transkei Constitution Act and will be there until the Transkei becomes independent. I have not heard that the Cabinet or any person in the Transkei Government has objected to that provision in their Constitution. Since the hon. member for Edenvale asked a question, and I am replying to his question, I want to direct a word of admonition to him at the same time. He made moving pleas about relations. He spoke very eloquently. However, he made one mistake. The hon. member compared this legislation to a sjambok hanging over the Coloureds. The hon. member will know how that idea will reflect on South Africa <span class="col_3475-3476" refersTo="page_0151"/>abroad. There are English-language newspapers which spell this word &#x201C;s-j-a-m-b-o-k&#x201D; just to give it a jarring sound. I do not know with what purpose the hon. member used the word, but it is, in any case, the word which he used in connection with this legislation. Now I want to ask him nicely to leave that game which can arouse hostility against us. If he has good intentions towards South Africa, he should kindly avoid using such words. I want to give hon. members on the opposite side a look into the sort of situation which might arise if we did not have this legislation and if certain people did not want to carry out their duties. Then instructions would be given by the hon. the Minister to the executive in respect of community welfare and pensions which would involve the Childrens Act of 1960, the Aged Persons Act of 1967, the Veterans Pensions Act, the Blind Persons Act, the Disability Grants Act and the Training Centres for Coloured Cadets Act. Legislation of the CRC would also enter into the picture, viz. the Coloured Persons Rehabilitation Centres Act and the Coloured Persons Social Pensions Act, which were passed by that council last year. I could also mention further aspects which would enter into the picture. For example, there are also powers concerning local authorities which have been delegated to the executive of the CRC and which have a bearing on the ordinances of the various provinces.</p>

<p>If that hon. friend wants to listen, he will also learn something; he must just be prepared to learn and not to be too stupid. I can continue and list for the hon. members all the duties delegated to the executive in terms of the Rural Coloured areas Act, for example, i.e. decisions which have to be taken from day to day, appointments which have to be made, etc. However, all of this will be left undone if the people who have been called by their voters to perform certain duties, did not wish to do so for some reason. While I am speaking about that, the question arises as to how the so-called mandate attendant upon the results of the election of 19 March, is to be interpreted. I want to make the statement tonight that the interpretation of those results is not as simple as has been set out by some members here. In the past week, I held discussions with many eminent leaders of the Coloured community. They do not want the CRC to be crippled. They want progress to be made on the road which led to a summit in the office of the Prime Minister on 23 January and about which a statement was issued It appears to me as if hon. members on the opposite side are ignorant as far as that is concerned.</p>

Are hon. members aware that the hon. member for Yeoville, who also condemned the legislation, said, &#x201C;It is necessary to review the powers of the CRC&#x201D; and &#x201C;The CRC must get more meaningful powers&#x003F;&#x201D; That is precisely the road which we are taking and it is the road which responsible Coloured leaders want to be taken in future. The hon. member for Rondebosch, in spite of all his arguments, also made the statement, &#x201C;That the time has arrived to increase the powers of the council.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I am glad that hon. members think that way in moments of greater clarity. This brings me once again to the question why they kicked up such a row in this debate, originally and continually, and described this legislation in condemnatory terms.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, for once in my life I envy the hon. the Deputy Minister his verbosity. I do it for the very simple reason that I believe that only one equipped with this kind of &#x201C;welsprekendheid&#x201D; can react as he did to what I regard as a tissue of fantasy, a conglomeration of dubious facts and a bucket full of wishful thinking such as this House has never seen before. Under any circumstances this was an astonishing speech, but against the background of what is happening in this country at this particular moment it surpasses any kind of understanding. As an exercise in self-delusion it was totally unsurpassable.</p>

<p>I want to mention one or two examples. The hon. the Deputy Minister is obviously heading for very high places. With this kind of quality you cannot be stopped. He will get there sooner or later. Before the dinner adjournment the hon. the Deputy Minister spoke about the &#x201C;wegbly-stem&#x201D; and he made all kinds of allegations about the hon. member for Sea Point who supposedly did not check his facts before he made his statements. If the hon. the Deputy Minister had only taken the trouble to speak to Coloured leaders as I am sure the hon. member for Sea Point did, he would have found out what the reason was for this &#x201C;wegbly-stem&#x201D;. There was one terribly simple reason for this; that was their total disillusionment with the system imposed upon them. That was the reason for it. It does not matter what kind of things the Deputy Minister dreamed up. [Interjections.] The &#x201C;welsprekende&#x201D; member for Rissik also made these statements, but let us get back to the hon. &#x201C;welsprekende&#x201D; Deputy Minister. He spoke about the voters&#x2019; mandate. What was the mandate&#x003F; Let me give the hon. the Deputy Minister two pre-election statements about what the mandate was the Coloured people were voting for. The first comes from Mr. Sonny Leon. This was published in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 16 March 1975. He called upon the Coloured people of South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to demonstrate beyond any doubt whatsoever that they reject apartheid in all its forms and to make it clear at the polls on Wednesday that they believe in the right of every South African regardless of race, colour or creed to all the fruits of citizenship.</block>

<p>Does that look like apartheid&#x003F;</p>

<p>Let us look at another even more kosher source than that. Let me quote from <i>Rapport</i> of 16 March 1975. Mr. Sonny Leon, speaking to some high authority or other, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Arbeiders het in 1969 die verkiesing gewen. Ons gaan van jaar weer wen. As ons toegelaat word om weer die VKR te regeer, sal ons die Regering met ons eise vir die Kleurlinge konfronteer. As die Regering nie aan hierdie eise wil voldoen nie, sal ons sorg dat die VKR as liggaam vir altyd in die niet verdwyn.</block>

<p>That is the mandate. If the hon. the Deputy Minister has any doubts &#x2026; [Interjections.] Let me read to the hon. the Deputy Minister from tonight&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i> what the Labour Party thinks not about the election, but about this Bill. This was a statement which was issued this evening by the leaders of the Labour Party&#x2014;</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think there can be any difference of opinion on what the Coloured people think of this Bill, and we leave the matter at that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I will go on to argue, Sir, that the hon. the Deputy Minister deserves to be remembered for one reason above everything else, and that is that he argues that this Bill is not a diminution of the powers of the CRC. Can you believe it, Sir&#x003F; I believe that the <i>pi&#x00E8;ce de r&#x00E9;sistance</i> of &#x201C;Hennie in Wonderland&#x201D; is that he could not understand the fuss over &#x201C;hierdie onskuldige stukkie wetgewing&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, the Coloured people are in turmoil. They are holding emergency meetings about this situation. The Whites are upset, I can assure you. They are deeply upset and deeply distressed about this. But we are assured by the hon. the Deputy Minister that this is &#x201C;&#x2019;n onskuldige stukkie wetgewing&#x201D;. Sir, can self-delusion go any further than this; can cynicism go any further than this; can political unreality go any further than this&#x003F; &#x201C;Hierdie onskuldige stukkie wetgewing&#x201D;! I want to assure the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2014;and I am being absolutely genuine about this&#x2014;that I have had more spontaneous reaction to the introduction of this piece of legislation from my constituents in Johannesburg&#x2014;and they happen to be White&#x2014;than to any other measure that this House dealt with either last session or this session. That is a fact, Sir, I have tried to analyse these representations that thave been made to me, and I can assure the hon. the Deputy Minister and anybody else who cares to listen that these things were not instigated. These representations were made quite spontaneously to me, and whatever <i>Die Burger</i> says, and whatever paraphrases of <i>Die Burger&#x2019;s</i> leading article this morning we may get from the hon. member for Johannesburg West or the hon. the Deputy Minister, or anybody else who wishes to quote it, I believe that the White voters of this country&#x2014;those who think about these things&#x2014;fear that if this Bill becomes law, it will mean the end of the road. It will mean the end of the road of consultation and co-operation between White and Coloured people.</p>

<p>Order! That argument has been advanced several times.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I bow to your ruling, Mr. Speaker. I am trying to substantiate these telegrams that I received, but I will not pursue it. This is what White people are saying and this is why we in these benches oppose this legislation. People are reacting to this quite spontaneously and intuitively. These people who have written to us are worried. They think there is something suspicious; they think there is some monkey business going on. Whatever the intrinsic value of this piece of legislation may or may not be, whatever its defects or its positive aspects, they are afraid that if this Bill is passed it will prove disastrous to human relations in the country, and this is something which nobody in his right senses could contemplate with any kind of equanimity. I believe that it would be wrong of this House not to take note of this spontaneous public feeling. I repeat that the representations made to me were not the result of any organized opposition; I believe that there was no instigation, and as far as I can judge, these representations have come from seriously concerned individuals who think that there is something undesirable about this legislation, that there is something not quite right about it. This is a kind of gut reaction about fair dealing, and I believe that if we had any sense we would take note of this. I find it very hard&#x2014;and this will no doubt raise horse-laughs on the other side of the House&#x2014;to try to look at this legislation from the Government&#x2019;s point of view; to look at it through the Government&#x2019;s eyes. I believe that looking at it from that point of view the introduction of this legislation was in fact tactically as well as politically unwise, and I will try to show why. I want to deal very briefly with the reaction of <i>Die Burger</i> this morning, which now accuses the leaders of the Opposition groups of vying for Coloured sympathy. They talk about a &#x201C;skandalige&#x201D; attitude. This is unworthy of <i>Die Burger.</i> It could do better than that. The Deputy Minister and the hon. member for Johannesburg West spoke in similar terms about our harming relations between White and Coloured people. <span class="col_3481-3482" refersTo="page_0154"/>Sir, this is just nonsense. How can this be, when all the Opposition is doing, apart from expressing sincere and completely honest convictions on these things, is in fact to reflect the thinking of the best of Coloured leadership in this country&#x003F; How can this be &#x201C;skandalig&#x201D;&#x003F; Surely it is sheer cant and hypocrisy to pretend that the purpose of the opposition parties is to create ill-feeling between Coloureds and Whites&#x003F; For what purpose&#x003F; <i>Die Burger</i> says this morning that the Opposition parties want to exploit this situation. Sir, I see you eyeing me and I will stop quoting contemporary views. Anybody in touch with the Coloureds knows perfectly well how much bad feeling there already is between Whites and Coloureds, and nobody in his right mind wants to do anything but to improve that situation and to stop this deterioration. It is because I believe that this Bill is going to worsen infinitely the relationship between Coloured and White people that I believe that any responsible person ought to oppose it with every fibre of his being. Sir, the Coloured people do not have to be told that they have no meaningful &#x201C;seggen-skap&#x201D; in decision-making processes. They are not as simple as all this, however paternalistic the hon. the Deputy Minister or anybody else on that side may be about it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking to you and to a lot of people on the other side of the House. The Coloured people know what political cynicism is when on the day when they are voting for a vehicle of some kind or other, this Government takes power to almost emasculate certain aspects of that vehicle. Sir, they know what political cynicism is. They do not have to be told what it is. They know what baasskap is. They do not have to be told by the opposition or anybody else. But the hon. member for Johannesburg West is sad because we distrust the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s colour policy. I ask you, Sir, can cynicism, can self-delusion, go any further than this, in the face of this kind of political naivety, because this is all it is&#x003F; And this is one&#x2019;s objection to the Bill: because it has created&#x2014;intentionally or otherwise, I am not arguing that&#x2014;further ill will and it will continue to do so unless the Government changes, not its policy because we have given up hope of that happening in the foreseeable future, but its approach, its mood and its attitude. Sir, it is quite obvious now&#x2014;and I will not repeat the arguments&#x2014;that the Government&#x2019;s fear of the kind of paralysis which may have set in after the elections was grossly exaggerated. At worst the Government could have made contingency administrative plans to keep essential parts of this system going. Let us leave that as it is. Whatever its attitude to the CRC, the Government remains committed to trying to find the maximum amount of common ground with the leaders of the Coloured people. It does not matter under what framework it is doing this, but it is committed to doing so and it is because the measure before the House is going to make that task, in the framework of apartheid, to find more common ground with the Coloured people, infinitely more difficult, that I believe it is a politically disastrous measure. To begin with, it reduces the area in which the Government can manoeuvre. That is quite obvious. Instead of keeping its options open and beginning to talk in the broadest kind of framework, the Government is in future going to be circumscribed by the new situation created by this atmosphere. [Interjections] Sir, the Labour Party said, before the election, that while practically rejecting apartheid and making it clear that the present scope and functions of the CRC are no substitute for a genuine political say in the major decision-making processes of this country, they were anxious to continue to talk with the Government on the future of the Coloured people provided there was an atmosphere of give and take. But what its attitude is going to be after this Bill I hesitate to think. We know what the Labour Party&#x2019;s official attitude to this Bill is. I believe that this is going to be disastrous and I hope that there are going to be second thoughts on the part of the Government. This Bill has in fact served notice of no-confidence in the Government. In effect, it warns the Coloured leaders and the Labour Party to behave. This is punitive paternalism at its very worst. Take it or leave it&#x2014;father knows best.</p>

<p>*Willem de Klerk, who is not an unknown name in journalistic circles in South Africa, wrote about this matter in the <i>Transvaler</i> of yesterday, i.e. about the necessity for further dialogue between the Government <span class="col_3483-3484" refersTo="page_0155"/>and the leaders of the Labour Party. He said, <i>inter alia</i> [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Government and the Department of Coloured Affairs should display a suppleness and frankness by burying the old tensions and making a new start.</block>

<p>He says the Labour Party&#x2014;he hits out at both parties&#x2014;should prove that they did not win the battle only to lose the war. Then he referred to three decisions; I hope you will allow me, Sir, to quote them, since this cannot be regarded as a comment on this debate.</p>

<p>*My argument is quite simple, i.e. that this legislation is going to make the task of both sides&#x2014;and with this I mean the Coloured leaders as well as the Government&#x2014;very difficult in future, even if it is only the creation of an atmosphere of suspicion and hostility. Surely, not even the hon, the Deputy Minister can deny this.

Instead of burying the old tensions&#x2014;anyone who has any common sense would want to do this&#x2014; this Bill is going to create new tensions.

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the hon. Leader of the Opposition in his opposition to the Bill which we have before the House tonight. I think that it was the right thing for him to oppose it in the strongest possible terms available to the Opposition under these circumstances i.e. to move that the Bill be read &#x201C;this day six months.&#x201D; We had hoped that during the course of this debate, we would have been able to convince the hon. the Minister and the Government that the legislation which is before the House this evening is not in the best interest of the present situation in regard to race relations in South Africa. I still hope at this late hour that the hon. the Minister will concede that the opposition has advanced such powerful arguments against this legislation, that he agrees that it is in the best interest to withdraw the legislation. Referring to what the hon. the Deputy Minister of Coloured Relations said, i.e. &#x201C;Dit is &#x2019;n stuk onskuldige wetgewing&#x201D;, I want to say to him that he underestimates the significance of this legislation, because he is seeing it through the eyes of the Whites only. How different his attitude would be if in this hon. House tonight there was one Coloured man to put forward the way in which the Coloured people see this legislation.</p>

<p>In this situation in which we find ourselves, we, as representatives of Whites only, debate about the future of the Coloured people. Until we get a situation where we can discuss these problems together, we shall never get a really sensible and constructive debate going. I listened very carefully to the hon. the Deputy Minister. He said: &#x201C;Dit is &#x2019;n onskuldige stuk wetgewing.&#x201D; When he says that, I say that he is not judging the situation accurately. If a Coloured man were able to raise the point of view of the Coloureds, he would point out that his aspirations for the future of the CRC have been dampened by the fact that this Government has introduced this legislation at this stage. A Coloured sees it in a different way. He sees it as a man who has experienced on the receiving end the limitations which this Government&#x2019;s policy places on the Coloured people of South Africa. The Coloured man is the one who has been subjected to the disabilities which the Group Areas legislation imposes on every Coloured person in South Africa and furthermore he sees that the policy of the Government is responsible for those limitations. That is why he is taking an attitude which is against the Government&#x2019;s policy and that is why he voted for the Labour Party in the election, not necessarily because he supports it, but as measure of protest against that institution which the Government has created and which gives him his political rights such as they are. When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition moved in his amendment that this Bill should be read this day six months, I believe he was taking a statesmanlike stand. When he further suggested that this debate be adjourned to give the hon. the Minister an opportunity to reconsider the matter and to <span class="col_3485-3486" refersTo="page_0156"/>hold discussions with the newly elected leaders, he was acting wisely. I believe that not only was he acting wisely in the best interests of the Whites in South Africa, but that he was also taking a stand which is in the best interests of the Coloureds in South Africa. What is more, I believe he was expressing the views of many members on that side of the House. It may well be that he was expressing the view that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs holds, namely that the introduction of this measure was not in the best interests of the present situation. The hon. the Minister may even take courage, and I hope that he does. Many of the hon. members who have spoken on the Government side, such as the hon. member for Oudtshoorn and the hon. member for Piketberg, said in the latter part of their speeches that they believed that the elected leaders, namely the leaders of the Labour Party, were now taking the view that they were going to co-operate with the Government on this issue. It gave me the impression that they felt that if the Government was prepared to withdraw this legislation, a new atmosphere would be created, an atmosphere in which the hon, the Minister would negotiate an arrangement with which they would be satisfied and which would secure the future of the CRC. The hon. the Minister has plenty of time. We on this side of the House simply cannot understand the almost unseemly haste with which this measure has been brought before this House. This Parliament will stay in session for another two months and what is more, the present executive of the CRC are there to deal with any matters and any problems which may arise. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister has confidence in the gentlemen who are presently serving not only as leaders of the CRC, but who are serving on the executive. Does the hon. the Minister not think that before he came with this legislation it was up to him to consult with the newly elected leaders&#x003F; When he introduced the legislation which amended the Coloured Representative Council Act in 1972, he told us in this House that he had in fact consulted with the Coloureds. When he introduced this measure, no reference was made to consultation in his Second Reading speech. I am at liberty to assume that the hon. the Minister has not consulted. I should like to know on whose advice he acted. Was it his own decision&#x003F; On whose advice did he decide to bring this legislation before this House&#x003F; It was the strongest plea in the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that consultation should take place. We are amazed that, as far as we can establish, there has been no consultation whatsoever. As far as we are concerned it is cardinal that in any issues which this White Parliament has to decide on, consultation must take place at all levels with the Coloured people before such decisions are taken so that we do not place ourselves in the position of making unilateral decisions on their behalf. It seems to me that this consultation has not taken place.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to know with whom the hon. the Minister has consulted. There is another interesting point I want to mention. The hon. the Minister has appointed a commission to look into the problems affecting the Coloured people. That commission has now been operating some 18 months and it has been in contact with all levels of Coloured opinion throughout the Republic. I wonder if the hon. the Minister does not think it would have been wise, before introducing this legislation, to ask the chairman of that commission, for instance, whether she thought this legislation was in the best interests of the Coloured people and also in the best interests of the relationships between the White people and the Coloured people in South Africa. We believe that it is not in the best interests of those relationships. It is because we believe that it is not in the best interests of the future of the CRC that we have taken such a strong stand in this debate. We believe that at a time like this we should be involved in acts of faith and of common sense, acts which will lead to a greater mutual respect and understanding among all people in South Africa. I am afraid that this amending legislation we are called on to debate strikes a discordant note and above all a note of a lack of faith. What is more, I believe it displays a lamentable lack of confidence on the part of this Government in an institution of its own creation. The CRC is something the Government has created. The Government had faith in it but I believe that by introducing this legislation it is displaying a lamentable lack of confidence.</p>

<p>What are the implications of this piece of legislation, this small Bill containing three clauses&#x003F; First of all, it implies that <span class="col_3487-3488" refersTo="page_0157"/>the Government has no confidence in the political institutions it has created because on the very day when the election took place to determine who the new members of the Council would be, the hon, the Minister gave notice of this Bill in this House. I cannot accept his argument that this was planned a long time before and that he decided that this was the best time to introduce this measure. There must be some other reason and I hope that when the hon. the Minister replies to this debate he will tell us why in fact he chose that very day to give notice of this measure. What worries members on this side of the House more is that the Government is displaying a singular lack of confidence in the way the Coloured electorate in South Africa has exercised its democratic rights, because at the same moment in time when the electorate was taking decisions about its own political future in one direction, the Government came along with this Bill through which the hon. the Minister himself is conveying this message to the Coloured people: We are not interested in what you say; we are going to carry on in a way which we think is good for you. This is the message this Bill conveys to the Coloured electorate of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am not saying it affected the election, I am saying that the message which this piece of legislation conveys to the Coloured people of South Africa is: It does not matter which way you vote and what the outcome of the election will be, because we, the Government of South Africa, are going to conduct the affairs of the CRC in a manner which we think is in the best interests of the Coloured people. That is the unequivocal message that this Bill conveys. [Interjection.] I am sure I am right and the hon. the Deputy Minister knows it. He says that this is an innocent piece of legislation, but in actual fact it has far-reaching ramifications. It makes the hon. the Deputy Minister, under certain circumstances, the person who is in charge of the whole show. That is what this clause does. I want to refer to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech when he introduced this measure. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition dealt with the constitutional aspects involved and so did the hon. member for Durban North. I now want to refer to just one aspect of the Minister&#x2019;s speech when he stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ek s&#x00EA; weer dat solank hierdie kant van die Raad aan bewind is, sal daar voortgegaan word om die los drade wat in die wet nog bestaan, saam te vat, dit aan te pas by omstandighede wat na vore mag kom om dit te moderniseer tot &#x2019;n Grondwet wat alle aspekte van die raad se bestaan saamvat.</block>

<p>I do not think that was a very constructive statement at all. How much better would it not have been, at this critical stage in the CRC&#x2019;s development, when it was having its second important election, if the hon. the Minister had been able to say to the Coloured people, who are the people concerned with this situation, that as long as his side of the House was in power they would continue to build up and extend the powers of the CRC so that step by step it could become an institution worthy of serving the best interests of the Coloured people, eventually leading to their full participation, as citizens of this country, in the political life of South Africa. He would then have been coming forward with something of a constructive nature. He would have been offering the people something. He would have been offering them new hope. What did he do, however, on the very day of the election&#x003F; He introduced a measure into this House which diminishes or makes subservient the very institution they are trying to build up. This can only create a lack of confidence among the Coloured people. If the hon. the Minister had acted like a statesman, and the hon. the Deputy Minister as well, who I am sure is seeking higher honours for the future, they would have had a wonderful opportunity to enhance their position. The hon. the Minister should have done what Dr. Verwoerd did. I refer to the message which Dr. Verwoerd gave out in 1961 indicating what the future development of the Coloured people in South Africa would be. He spelt it out for the next ten years.</p>

<speech by="#kingwill">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. G. KINGWILL</person>:</from>

<p>I will not delve into the history of the measure, Mr. Speaker. The point is that at that time an undertaking was given to the Coloured people and I believe we have reached a stage where they should be given another undertaking. This hon. Deputy Minister and his Minister should be telling the Coloured people how they see the CRC developing during the next ten years. The hon. the Prime Minister gave some indications, but I believe that the years that lie ahead are important and that the hon. the Minister should be spelling out how he sees the CRC developing over the next ten years. If we had been discussing that tonight, we would have been achieving something; we would have been creating goodwill towards the Coloured people which would perhaps make them more determined to make the CRC work. But we are doing just the opposite. We are passing legislation that is making the CRC subservient to the White Parliament. That is the reason why we on this side of the House have taken the strong stand we have. I do not want to reiterate all the arguments, because I believe they have been well made and well motivated. The hon. the Minister should take note of what has been said and see if he cannot change his mind in the interests not only of the Coloured people, but in the interests of his own policy and of his own institution, the CRC, which he is trying to develop. He must no doubt be concerned, after having taken note of the statistical results of the last election, to find that 61% of the Coloured electorate voted for the Labour Party As I have said earlier, a vote for the Labour Party did not necessarily mean a vote for the policy of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>If that hon. member had the contact I have had with the Coloured people he would know it for a fact. Even the Federal Party is against the CRC. The fact is that the situation deteriorated since the first election for the CRC. At that time 48% of the total number of votes cast were cast in favour of the Labour Party. In the ensuing five years we now find that the situation has deteriorated from Governments point of view to where 61% of the electorate is voting for the Labour Party.</p>

<p>No, Sir, I wish to continue with my reply to the debate. I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central and I think I should deal with him quickly and immediately. I must say that it required some effort on my part to listen to his speech because I have heard so many of those arguments so many times over the past two days. The hon. member is a member of a very important commission and I would have thought that he had learnt something over the past 18 months. [Interjections.] Nevertheless. I still hope and trust that he will acquire the ability to stick to the points at issue when debating matters affecting the Coloured people. He should know that many of the things which we discuss in open debate concerning the Coloured people are not conducive to fostering a spirit of good race relations. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I tried to listen as carefully as I could to the speeches made by hon. members. Although many of their arguments duplicated one another, I have tried to remember all the arguments. I should like to respect each argument advanced by every member in this debate. However, I was disappointed at the spirit which radiated from the speeches made by hon. members opposite, and at the debate as it was conducted in general on the opposite side of this House. I am extremely disappointed at this for I asked a year ago, in my responsible capacity as the Minister who has to represent these people, that we should please stop using these people as a pawn to seek our own political advantage. However regrettable it may be that I have to say this again, we saw a display, after the fragmentation of the opposition parties to three, which, with, all due respect, was at times scandalous.

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Maitland knows that I will reply to his questions in a proper manner. He should sit quietly and wait until I come to them. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was so na&#x00EF;ve as to ask whether this measure was really necessary. This makes me suspect that hon. members opposite have either <span class="col_3495-3496" refersTo="page_0161"/>been strangers in Jerusalem during the past year or two, or that they know nothing of what is happening in the CRC, but are nevertheless trying to be clever about it. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made the childish remark, asked the childish question, what our expectation of chaos was based on. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was so courteous as to say that he could not be here this evening, and I appreciate this. Does he not know the history of 1974 and the years before that&#x003F; Does he not read the Press&#x003F; Sir, frequent mention has been made here of a &#x201C;collapse of policy&#x201D;. &#x201C;Collapse of policy&#x201D; is the last thing hon. members opposite should talk about. I just want to tell them that there is something infinitely worse than a collapse of policy&#x2014;which is a matter of opinion&#x2014; and that is a &#x201C;collapse of efficient administration&#x201D;. It is the duty of this Government to be realistic and to ensure that no collapse occurs on an administrative level. The Government bears the final responsibility. The Government has to take cognizance of things that happen. Last August the CRC refused to approve a budget. There is still a deficiency in the Act, and it seems to me now as though the hon. member for Rondebosch wants me to have set this straight 11 years ago, two years, incidentally, before I came to this House. There is a deficiency in that Act. In 1972 we eliminated one of the deficiencies, when the Council refused the Budget. It could then have been dealt with by the Minister, but it was dealt with by the executive. But, Sir, we have to cope with new claims and new statements and new opinions every day. Just listen to this (<i>Rapport,</i> 16 March) (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Leon rejects the Council as a useless institution.</block>

<p>And I am not even mentioning last year when internal disputes arose in the Federal Party, which was in office, and another group came into office, and it was not only the Labour Party either. In a developing political structure things of this kind happen, and the central Government has certain duties in this regard. After all, this kind of thing, this chopping and changing, simply carries on. Responsibility, however, brings less chopping and changing, and for that reason this Government will discuss the Coloureds less haphazardly and is discussing them less haphazardly then the kind of discussion we can hear on the opposite side. Hon. members opposite can say many things because they will not be called to account. Here, on the other hand, Mr. Sonny Leon has this to say (<i>The Herald,</i> 21 March 1975)&#x2014;</p>

<p>According to <i>Rapport,</i> however, they stated that they would act in a responsible manner. This was two days later. The next day, in the <i>Rand Daily Mail,</i> it again sounded a little better. The day after that, in <i>The Argus,</i> they said they would prefer not to use the CRC. But yesterday, in <i>The Cape Times,</i> they said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They call on the Government to abolish the CRC and ask for parliamentary representations; adjourn the CRC until their request has been met; stop all talks with the Government until liaison committee takes over executive; refuse to work with Administration of Coloured Affairs until a Black man has been appointed commissioner.</block>

<p>There are hundreds of Whites who are still working for these people. Do hon. members think this Government consists of children&#x003F; Should we not take cognizance of these statements&#x003F; Should we take these people at their word, or should we regard it as a joke&#x003F; Are we dealing with rational behaviour or not&#x003F;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have already said that I cannot reply to any questions. The hon. member can listen, and if he really wants to ask a question later on, I shall reply to it.</p>

<p>I want to repeat this: At this stage the Government of the Republic of South Africa is responsible for the weal and woe of all the people of South Africa. However, this need not remain the case, regardless of the ignorant allegations we have had to listen to. In this regard I am referring to the hon. member for Sea Point and others who made ignorant allegations implying that the Government wanted to deprive people of their rights; that the Government had in fact said that it would grant more rights, and so on. Can such things simply fall out of the air suddenly&#x003F; Surely that is nonsense. Nothing which the hon. the Prime <span class="col_3497-3498" refersTo="page_0162"/>Minister promised on 8 November last year will be withheld. Nothing that we have achieved with a completely lawfully constituted liaison committee&#x2014;the Labour Party did not even want to serve on the committee&#x2014;is being cancelled. On the contrary. Fourteen days ago the entire liaison committee convened and resolved that it would only be fair to wait until the new Council had first been elected, so that the new Council could commence negotiations with the Government with a view to the expansion of the Council&#x2019;s powers, and with a view to a new fiscal dispensation and other relevant aspects in our new dispensation for White interests, Coloured interests and common interests. None of this has changed. The legislation is a temporary measure and it need only remain a temporary measure.</p>

<p>Some things can remain temporary for a long time if it is necessary. It depends on the people with whom we negotiate. However, this Government remains the Government. In May the new Council commences its duties. We must understand one another very well now. In the meantime the Council is not being deprived of a single existing right. Cannot the hon. members understand that&#x003F; Are they perhaps deliberately&#x2014;or let me rather say &#x201C;calculatingly&#x201D;&#x2014;trying to cloud the entire issue&#x003F; No right is being removed. It is only when those people do not want to exercise their powers that there has to be a person who is able to do so. After all, who would feel like carrying on with the work if the persons concerned are doing it thoroughly&#x003F; All the things which the hon. member for Yeoville held out in prospect for the Coloureds or suggested should be discussed with them, can and will still be done. Nothing need be removed from that. It would be a very stupid Government, a Government which could be charged with negligence&#x2014;how delighted would the hon. members not be if they could charge us with negligence, for that is what they are waiting for, is it not&#x003F;&#x2014;if it were to allow an administration involving two million people to collapse in chaos. The 1972 amendment which entailed that financial control could be exercised, was inadequate, as we in fact discovered. There are jurists sitting here. They will know that legislation cannot be drafted and submitted within a week.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>But the legislation comprises two clauses only.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but it involves a lot of things notwithstanding the fact that it comprises two clauses only. The hon. member knows that better than I do. The hon. member knows much more than he is prepared to say at the moment. [Interjections.] It takes quite some time even to draft two clauses if they are not to be assailed legally. He knows that better than I do.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Durban North, seated next to him, said that this was a panic-stricken method. There is one little matter I now want to explain to hon. members. In July last year there was a commotion in the CRC. Hon. members all know that we had a session after July, but in November I was told that they considered that we should be able to control this matter even if these people did not compile a budget. I, who am not a jurist, was not satisfied with that. By January this year we had received a final opinion from senior jurists. They said that we would have to safeguard ourselves further, for if these people wanted to commit obstruction, they could paralyse the administration completely. I can now inform hon. members that it took two months to draft that legislation. I felt that the legislation should be ready prior to the election, and consequently the legislation was ready a few days before the election. However, if we had made the legislation public, prior to the election or at the time of the election, to people who had been engaged since October in fighting the election, it would have been an extremely irresponsible action. For that reason it was merely by chance that it was introduced at approximately the same time as the election. The hon. members can believe it or not. It makes no difference to me whether they believe it or not, but that is the position. That is what happens with legislation. I explained well enough in my Second Reading speech why the 1972 legislation was not sufficient, and why this amendment Bill was therefore necessary.</p>

<p>Personally I am sorry that the legislation had to be introduced at that juncture. Personally I also think that it did not create a good impression to introduce legislation in that regard at that time, but it was nevertheless essential. It will become law, for this Government has a greater sense of responsibility than to sit back and seek popularity by omitting to take essential <span class="col_3499-3500" refersTo="page_0163"/>action as a result of the fact that it would have to be taken at an inappropriate time. What does in fact count is whether it is essential in the best interests and for the welfare of more than 2 million people. The hon. members opposite are apparently less concerned about the lot of more than 2 million people than they are about the political aspects of such a step. All we are envisaging with this legislation is to prevent the CRC from committing administrative suicide. I received the Second Reading speech only two or three days before the Bill was read for the second time in the House. I then found that the Administrative aspect had been over-emphasized and that it could also be interpreted to mean that I was taking over legislative powers, while that is not what I had in mind at all. I said that I only wanted to ensure the administrative continuation of the functions of the Council.</p>

<p>Hon. members stated that our sole aim in introducing this legislation was to restrain the Labour Party. That may be part of the truth, but it is not the whole truth. Hon. members know that there is not much love lost between us, but even we are obliged to co-operate in this country, even though there is not always much love lost between us. It is necessary: it is in the best interests of this country. The fact remains that because this Government has established the democratic lower level of government for the Coloureds, it must also, to a large extent, take the principles of democracy into consideration whenever it takes action, although it should, if it were to become necessary to prevent certain actions on the part of that body, be able to do so. That was the point of departure in 1969, when I was not yet Minister. For that reason the majority of the candidates who were nominated were members of the Federal People&#x2019;s Party. Now I want to say that regardless of whether people understand this thoroughly&#x2014;most of the voters who voted for the hon. members on the opposite side did not know what they were voting for, otherwise they would not have been here&#x2014; the Government accepts &#x2026; [Interjections.] That is true.</p>

<p>Yes, but there people still have time to think.

I believe that they voted against apartheid, because it has been pilloried. I think that was the main idea, and I believe that hon. members will concede this. Nevertheless the Labour Party scored an outright victory at the polls, and received a mandate from the Coloured people. We concede that, and it would be unfair of the Government to keep them on the verge of a majority now. Personally I think that to govern with 31 as against 29 would merely perpetuate a situation of uncertainty among these people. If they want it, we will help them in such a way with nominations that they will at least have a working majority.</p>

<p>We are not in a position, unless we do so deliberately, to prevent this. For that reason I want to say that we will accept this factual situation reasonably and honestly, and are going to try to achieve only the best in future, and the Government is already making this its business. It depends upon whether the Labour Party wishes to co-operate, in other words whether this legislation is ever going to be used. Nevertheless hon. members who read the newspapers will have to agree with me that statements such as &#x201C;Abolish the CRC&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Do this, and do that to the Government&#x201D; are still the order of the day.</p>

<p><span class="col_3501-3502" refersTo="page_0164"/>This legislation was initiated even before those people finally came to office. And this legislation is going to be placed on the Statute Book. The Government believes that any responsible leader or party should not always interpret the instructions of its voters literally.</p>

I am certain that he has not yet done everything he promised to do. He still has a great deal to do. Therefore, the voters do not always interpret it literally. For that reason I said at the outset that these leaders, too, will not necessarily interpret the instructions of their voters literally.</p>

<p>I can give it to you if you want it. I have confidence in democracy, but I am also aware of the shortcomings of democracy. I therefore trust that those candidates who have been voted in by these people will be expected by them to act in a responsible manner. My door, and the door of the Prime Minister, will be open to them, and we shall see, in so far as it is within our means, whether we can beat a path for these two million people whom they have been called upon to represent at this stage. We are not forgetting the other members who were also elected and we are not forgetting the 20 nominated members either. It is part of any democratic political development that there should first be nominated councils, then a representative government and then a responsible government. That development is known to us all. In the initial stages all members are nominated, but subsequently all members are elected. The nominated members are specifically for those who do not vote, and in this case more than 51% did not vote. We must take those people into consideration as well. [Interjection.] The Labour Party nominated candidates in all the electoral divisions. They had the absolute maximum. Although our door is open to all these people, we cannot incur the risk of confusion arising&#x2014;and here I am back with the legislation again. If it is perfectly clear to us that certain things can happen, it is our duty to take steps. We are dealing here with a game of chess which is in progress at the moment. When I begin to receive telegrams asking for a law to be scrapped, and the telegrams all come from the same place, I know that there is a group somewhere which is exerting pressure on this legislation. I know then that there are people who are concerned about this legislation, and who want this Government to be embarrassed. There are people who are the enemies of both the Government and the Opposition.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to discuss the charge that racial friction may develop. I am certain that the Coloured voters&#x2014;and now I am still referring to the 51% who <span class="col_3503-3504" refersTo="page_0165"/>did not vote&#x2014;need not necessarily become estranged or embittered. I think this debate could have been a far easier one, for we want to safeguard the position of the pensioners, teachers, officials and welfare organizations. We do not want them to become the victims of political undercurrents. If we do not take these steps, it would be possible to accuse us of dereliction of duty and of negligence. Then we, as a Government, would not be worthy of the confidence of the voters. When the hon. member for Houghton reproached the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, she said: &#x201C;The main task of an opposition is to oppose.&#x201D; I do not agree that this is always the case, particularly not in South Africa. An Opposition can be of enormous assistance to a Government. The Opposition must oppose the Government if it thinks the Government is doing the wrong thing, but surely it cannot always be doing the wrong thing.</p>

<p>We really are not that bad. After all, we are doing so many things the Opposition said they asked us to do! Are those things wrong as well&#x003F; This Government has done more to improve race relations, particularly on the material level, than any Government has ever done. I repeat that this measure is a stabilizing measure. It is being said that we did not talk to the leaders. Surely I cannot go and talk to the Labour Party and tell them that this measure is going to be introduced. They could say that the measure might prejudice them, for, after all, they do have a mandate from their people, and they have to prevent them from committing suicide. I cannot speak to the Federal Party in advance to obtain their permission for this measure, and now I am not referring to the preparation of the legislation. This took place long before the time. If they were to associate themselves with the legislation, how would it help them politically&#x003F; Surely it is going to prejudice them completely, for surely they are not, after all, asking for this legislation. Surely they have never made mistakes of that nature. Then why do hon. members want me to go and talk to them&#x003F; Surely it is the responsibility of this Government to take action in such cases, for it is a co-ordinating responsibility, a final responsibility to ensure that matters function smoothly in the administration of one&#x2019;s country, in whatever sphere it may be. For that reason we felt that we could not place the responsibility, political or otherwise, on leaders who are engaged in an election, and that we should assume that responsibility ourselves. I have assumed the responsibility, and I am not ashamed of this. For this is one of those cases where consultation in itself is worse than no consultation and where sound commonsense is most important of all. Therefore we do not want to link these people to this legislation. I can tell hon. members that I spoke to eminent Coloured leaders, but I am not going to implicate them in this matter. They told me that they understood. Before I came to this House with this legislation, responsible Coloured leaders told me that they understood. This measure could only be temporary, or it could remain in force for a very long time, [Interjections.]</p>

The hon. the Deputy Minister explained it very well by saying that what is at issue is education, rural areas, local authorities to a lesser extent, and welfare measures. What is at issue is people who cannot help themselves and for whom we are responsible in the final stage.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The Trade Metrology Act, 1973, to which I shall subsequently refer as the principal Act, was approved during the 1973 session of Parliament. Although the Act was approved in 1973, it has not yet been put into operation. The reason for this is, on the one hand, that comprehensive regulations have to be made in terms of the Act, and, on the other hand, that the metrication programme in the commercial sector is expected to have been completed to such an extent by the end of 1975, that it is hoped that it will then be possible for the regulations which make provision for the use of both the imperial as well as the metric systems during the transition period of the metrication process, to be based exclusively on the newly introduced International System of Units, in which our own metric system is incorporated. Furthermore it has come to light that, as is the case in the private sector, there is also a need in Government departments for certain measuring instruments which they use and which will be subject to certification in terms of the principal Act, being exempted from such certification. In this connection, I want to mention as an example the pipeline metres which are used by the South African Railways and Harbours for the measuring of oils. The Railway Administration has its own effective organization to service and maintain these metres, and also to carry out the necessary tests in respect of their accuracy. Any further testing and certification of this equipment of the Railways by officials of the Division of Weights and Measures, may therefore, to my mind, be regarded as superfluous. I might also add that, before any mechanic is charged with the maintenance of the metres concerned, such mechanic has to prove his skill to the Division of Weights and Measures by means of a test.</p>

<p>Although the proposed legislation is chiefly intended to amend the provisions of the principal Act, which make provision for the exemption from certification of measuring instruments, so that it will be possible to satisfy the above-mentioned need, the opportunity is also being taken to effect certain corrections and adjustments in the principal Act, on which I shall proceed to elaborate in greater detail.</p>

<p>As the definition of &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x201D; in section 1 of the principal Act is worded at the moment, the specific definition may be interpreted in such a way that counting instruments, which effect a counting by means of gravitation, are excluded from the application of the principal Act. Since regulations in respect of the composition and certification of the kind of measuring instrument concerned have existed for many years, and since it is also undesirable that these measuring instruments will be used in trade without their being certified, it was never the intention that these kind of measuring instruments be exempted from certification in terms of the statutory provisions concerned. Any doubt which might exist in this connection, is now being removed by clause 1 of the Bill.</p>

<p>In the packing industry, with a view to the promotion of productivity, the volume measure of containers is being relied on to an increasing extent to enable the industry to pack correct amounts of goods. Therefore, it has become necessary to effect a suitable amendment to sections 12 and 13 of the principal Act so that the containers concerned will also, as envisaged in the principal Act, be subject to inspection.</p>

<p>Section 13(4) of the principal Act provides at present that any person may inspect a measuring instrument on demand in order to ascertain whether it has been certified. It has been considered advisable&#x2014; and I believe that hon. members will agree with me&#x2014;that the power concerned be limited to a buyer. The proposed insertion at the end of section 13(4), arises from the proposal, which I shall deal with later, that the provisions of section 23(1) of the principal Act be so amended that measuring instruments which are used for prescribed purposes, have to be certified, unless they have been exempted from certification in terms of the principal Act.</p>

<p>The proposed amendments of sections 12 and 13 of the principal Act, to which I have just referred, will be effected by clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 4 of the Bill makes provision for the addition of a subsection (2) to section 17 of the principal Act. This section provides that certain facts may be proved in a prosecution for an offence in terms of the <span class="col_3509-3510" refersTo="page_0168"/>principal Act by the production in court of an affidavit by an inspector. The proposed addition to section 17 will now entail that, in a prosecution for an offence in terms of the principal Act, the mere production by an inspector of an affidavit to that effect will be accepted as proof of the fact that a person had failed to give notice of the place where his measuring instruments were kept.</p>

<p>Inspectors of weights and measures are also required to carry out price control investigations. For this reason it has become increasingly essential that these inspectors should be able to visit as many dealers are possible. With a view to this, the publication in the <i>Gazette</i> of the names of places where dealers situated within 15 km of such places shall submit their measuring instruments to an inspector for certification, is being limited as far as possible.</p>

<p>This state of affairs entails that the Division of Weights and Measures must also be kept informed of all places where dealers use measuring instruments. The proposed amendment of section 19(2) of the principal Act by clause 5(b) of the Bill if aimed at making the provision of the necessary information to the said Division enforceable. The proposed insertion, by clause 5(a) of the Bill, of an additional section 19(1)(cA) to the principal Act will mean, however, that the provision in the existing legislation in terms of which dealers who conduct a business on premises which are situated more than 15 km from a place specified in a notice, do not have to produce their measuring instruments at such place for certification, is being retained.</p>

<p>According to the existing provisions of the Weights and Measures Act, 1958, an inspector may test fixed, heavy or delicate measuring instruments on the premises where they are in use. A provision was inserted in section 20 of the principal Act in terms of which an inspector may require at any time that transportable measuring instruments be shown to him at a place within five km of the place where they are used.</p>

<p>When the Trade Metrology Bill was being dealt with 1973, it was felt that the provision in question should be suitably amended in order to exempt the user from the possibility of an inspector insisting that fixed, heavy or delicate measuring instruments would also have to be produced for certification at a different place from the place where they were used. The amendment which was effected at the time to the relevant provisions of the Bill, brought about that, if the principal Act were now to be put into operation, an inspector would not have any power at all to test fixed, heavy or delicate measuring instruments on request at the place where they are used. The amendment which is now being proposed in clause 6 of the Bill, will rectify the position and will also bring the matter into line once again with the existing arrangements.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment of section 23 of the principal Act by clause 7 of the Bill, will rectify certain contradictions and obscurities which exist in the principal Act in respect of the certification of certain measuring instruments. The compulsory as-sizing by the Division of Weights and Measures of containers such as milk bottles, oil bottles and milk cans, was ceased a number of years ago because the manufacturers of these containers maintain very high standards of precision, and because the extent of the activities involved in compulsory assizement, took up a great deal of time. Instead of this, certain regulations have been made to which the manufacturers of the containers concerned have to comply. The procedure which will now be adopted, is that samples of the containers concerned will be tested at intervals, at the manufacturers&#x2019; premises in order to establish whether the specifications have in fact been met. The provision of section 23 of the principal Act, which prescribes that containers are to be certified in the same way as measuring instruments, will therefore be suitably amended to adopt it to the existing procedure.</p>

<p>As I have said already, Government departments will also be given the opportunity to apply for exemption from certification of measuring instruments if they have at their own disposal an organization which can ensure the reliable operation of their measuring instruments. The reference to section 26 in section 23 of the principal Act, which is being inserted in the above-mentioned section by clause 7 of the Bill, as well as the proposed amendment of section 26 of the principal Act by clause 8 of the Bill, will clarify this matter.</p>

<p>Further, the reference to grading and counting instruments as well as instruments which express quantity by means of a measuring unit, is being omitted from the <span class="col_3511-3512" refersTo="page_0169"/>wording of section 23 of the principal Act, because the definition of &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x201D; already includes all cases of this sort. The provision of the existing Weights and Measures Act which corresponds to section 30 of the principal Act, is limited to weighing instruments. The broad definition of &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x201D; in the provisions of the principal Act will bring about, however, that dealers, in order to comply with the requirements of section 13(4) of the principal Act, will have to keep other measuring instruments besides weighing instruments available, for example, length, surface area and volume measuring instruments. Experience has taught us, however, that buyers seldom, if ever, make use of the above-mentioned class of measuring instrument when they make their purchases. Further, section 30(2) of the principal Act requires that anyone who retails goods which have been pre-packed by him, shall keep certified measuring instruments for the use of any person dealing with him. Because such goods are often packed at a different place from that where they are sold, a dealer is obliged in the specific circumstances to keep a set of measuring instruments at both his place of packing and his place of selling in spite of the fact that it would be more convenient for the buyer to measure pre-packed goods at the place of packing if he wants to do so. In these circumstances, it is felt that the amendment of section 30(2) of the principal Act, which appears in clause 9 of the Bill, will still meet the needs of buyers, but at the same time also relieve the burden on dealers.</p>

<p>Clause 10 of the Bill contains amendments in terms of which, on the one hand, section 31 of the principal Act will be adjusted by the provision which appears in clause 7 of the Bill and in terms of which, on the other hand, provision is also being made for containers which might be considered suitable for the measuring off of a liquid in their sale in retail trade to be specified by regulation and at the same time prescribing certain requirements to which such containers shall comply.</p>

<p>Because section 23 of the principal Act, in terms of the amendment which appears in clause 7 of the Bill, will now provide that measuring instruments which are used for a prescribed purpose, such as the conclusion of a contract, may be exempted from certification or re-certification, clause 11 of the Bill contains a suitable amendment of section 38(3) of the principal Act.</p>

<p>Clause 12 of the Bill, apart from certain amendments which arise from other amendments to the principal Act, contains two important additions to the provisions of section 42 of the principal Act. In the first place the Minister will be empowered to make regulations in regard to delivery notes which are referred to in section 40 of the principal Act, as well as in regard to containers. In the second place, in order to make the implementation of the aims and objects of the principal Act more effective in practice, the Director of Trade Metrology will be empowered to grant exemption from regulations with, reference to pre-packed goods.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is perhaps no accident of history that this Bill should follow the Bill which has preceded it this evening. The short title of the principal Act is the Trade Metrology Act of 1973, and I believe at the time that this principal Act was introduced, few members were aware of what trade metrology meant. I recall that my hon. predecessor, Mr. Sonny Emdin, was at pains to indicate to this House that it meant that we were weighing up the scales of justice as far as measurements in meting out goods to the public were concerned. The whole of this evening we have been dealing with a Bill where the scales of justice in human relationships were concerned. During this evening I recalled the case where no less a statesman than President Kruger was asked to adjudicate on the division of a farm. On that particular farm there were good and bad sectors with water on the one sector, kopjes on another, vlakte on another and fertile land on yet another sector. He decided that the elder of the two brothers would divide the land whilst the younger brother would choose. In dealing with this Bill, just as we did with the Bill previously before the House, it is only right that we should realize that justice to the consuming public is the main concern of this House. We should use our wisdom in allowing those with the greatest power to divide and the populace to choose. The hon. the Minister has indicated this evening that although the Trade Metrology Act of 1973 has come into operation, it has not really been put into practice. This legislation which we have before us endeavours to set right certain discrepancies and certain anomalies. W supported the Government on the principal Act and I want to <span class="col_3513-3514" refersTo="page_0170"/>make it clear that we support the hon. the Minister on this Bill as well.</p>

<p>We made our point clear with the introduction of the principal Act and we want to repeat it that in the Trade Metrology Act we are really dealing with one of three Acts which are about to be enacted or which have been enacted already. Originally we had the Measuring Units and National Measuring Standards Act, then we had the Trade Metrology Act of 1973 which replaced the Weights and Measures Act, and we also have the Trade Practices Act which is before the House at the moment. Each of these Acts is, as it rightly should be, concerned with the welfare of the consuming public and with the welfare of the individual in South Africa. In the Trade Metrology Act we are concerned basically with weights and measurements which are used in the trade and in dealing with the consuming public. It is interesting that with metrication the whole terminology of the original Weights and Measures Act has had to be altered and was the cause for bringing into being the existing Trade Metrology Act. I want to go along with the hon. the Minister in the amendments which he has proposed to this Act in the Bill before us today, but I think that he owes it to the public that we should have clarification on certain of the amendments which he is proposing. I think that this House should realize that in the Trade Metrology Act we are dealing with an Act which validates and necessitates certain practices in the weighing of goods which are sold to the public. In the discussion on the principal Act my hon. predecessor made it quite clear that we believed that the purpose of the Act was specifically to deal with measurements in dealing with the trade and not measurements in general. Had the Act envisaged dealing with measurements in general, it would have applied to all sorts of intricate scientific scales which are far beyond the ken of the normal public.</p>

<p>Looking at this legislation, I believe I have the right to ask the hon. the Minister to indicate to this House what he means in clause 1 which amends section 1 of Act 77 of 1973. In the definition of &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x201D; he includes the words &#x201C;or a counting by means of gravitation&#x201D;. There are all manners and means of counting, counting by weight, counting by numbers and counting by scales, but when he sees fit to introduce in the definition the specific words &#x201C;a counting by means of gravitation&#x201D; I believe we have the right to inquire from him what his actual intention is. Clause 2 substitutes section 12 of Act 77 of 1973. In the new section 12 reference is made to a container. In clause 3 there are again many references to &#x201C;container&#x201D;. I would like to ask him whether we must read into the word &#x201C;container&#x201D; as it appears in the Bill the ordinary definition of &#x201C;container&#x201D; which one can find in a dictionary or whether it has any special meaning. I believe the hon. the Minister is being fair in that, having studied the working of the principal Act, he realized it was unduly onerous when applied to the trade itself as opposed to the public. There are clauses in this Bill in which he makes it clear that he is endeavouring to assist the trade by making the Act more workable.</p>

<p>I want to restate our position. We supported the principal Act and we are going to support this Bill. There are certain clauses in respect of which we shall ask elucidation in the Committee Stage, but I believe that fundamentally the hon. the Minister is being frank with this House by introducing this amending legislation in order to ensure that the Act can be implemented without undue hardship either to the consuming public or to the trade which is responsible for carrying it out. Accordingly, we shall support this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we piloted the original Trade Metrology Act through Parliament in 1973, it became very clear that we were not simply dealing with new measurements, but with a whole new system. If it had simply been new measurements, it would have been fairly simple. However, we are dealing with a completely new system, and therefore it is obvious that we are now dealing with legislation which will gradually have to be corrected according to practical experience. That is why it is necessary for us to introduce amendments so soon after the original legislation was passed.</p>

<p>Metrology is certainly a whole new system which holds a completely new concept for us who grew up and grew old with the old British system. To us the measurements 38: 22: 38 were easy to remember, but now that they have become 94: 55: 94, they are a lot more difficult.</p>

<p>These amendments are all technical corrections and for that reason, in view of the fact that we should all like to go home early tomorrow afternoon, I do not intend to give a whole explanation now of all the technical amendments which this Bill contains.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry that the hon. member for Paarl has not given us more information on the terminology, for I am a little in the dark concerning the meaning of many of these words in the trade. I think that traders themselves are a little in the dark. I really am very sorry that the hon. member for Paarl has not made use of the opportunity to give us a little more information. It seems to me very much as if the hon. member for Paarl is rather in the dark himself. Excepting that, there are a few general statements I wish to make with regard to this Bill. In the first place I want to ask why we really have to search around for terminology. I find it striking that, when we had ordinary weights and measures in the good old days, we also spoke of weights and measures, while today, because we are metricating, we do not speak of a weight any more, but of mass. I really do not know where this comes from. Why must we now speak of mass&#x003F; Every English-speaking person in the country knows what &#x201C;weight&#x201D; is. Now he is asked to learn a new word, namely &#x201C;mass&#x201D;. I most strongly object to this. The Afrikaans-speaking South African, too, must now speak of &#x201C;massa&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;gewig&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I really do not know why this is necessary.</p>

<p>The situation is very much worse when one comes to the decimal point. In the English language we have always spoken about a decimal point, and everybody throughout the world has known what a decimal point is. But now all of a sudden we have to talk about a comma. I can understand and I have no objection to the use of the word &#x201C;comma&#x201D; in Afrikaans before a fraction of a metric measure because in Afrikaans the term &#x201C;punt&#x201D; means a full stop or it could refer to the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education.</p>

<p>In English, however, when we speak of &#x201C;point&#x201D; we certainly do not mean &#x201C;full stop&#x201D;. We mean a decimal point. This is not only quite confusing but I think it is high time we got back to the kind of language we were accustomed to speak before we started all this nonsense. I believe that metrology is all very well and I am not against it, but if we have metrology and metrication, for heaven&#x2019;s sake let us keep to the words we understand. There are enough words in this Bill that we do not understand, so why must we confuse people even more by speaking about &#x201C;mass&#x201D; and &#x201C;comma&#x201D; when we mean &#x201C;weight&#x201D; and a decimal point&#x003F; I hope the hon. the Minister will take note of this because I believe that when he comes along with his next amendment he should start off by changing all this nonsense back to the sort of language we understand.</p>

<p>Sir, this very interesting piece of legislation is probably not going to take us very long to deal with. I notice that there is a great deal of public interest in it. I am worried, however, about this question of counting. Counting has to do with a new type of measurement. I agree with the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens when he says that he thinks we are entitled to know what sort of count is meant here because &#x201C;counting&#x201D; also has varying connotations. I believe that counting has been accepted in Great Britain as being a type of measurement. I do not know, however, whether we in South Africa should follow blindly what is being done in the United Kingdom. I am wondering whether we should not have another look at this word &#x201C;counting&#x201D;. I think that what we should try to do for the ordinary man who wants to do business is to make it easy for him to understand what his business is all about. When <span class="col_3517-3518" refersTo="page_0172"/>we have an instrument for measuring something, why do we not simply say that it is a measurement or something to measure with&#x003F; Let us cut out this reference to counting. I think we have had enough of words of this kind.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I should like to raise and that is the question of this presumption. I think I understand the position but I should like the hon. the Minister to explain it to me so that we can have it on record.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I should like him to spell it out. I believe that what the hon. the Minister is trying to do is to save a lot of time and trouble. He wants an inspector to be able to make an affidavit to say that Mr. A has not notified him where he keeps his measuring instruments, not his counting instruments or his container but his measuring instruments his scales and instruments of that nature. This inspector must have the right to say: &#x201C;Mr. A has not notified me, because if he had notified me I would have had a record of it. I have no record of it; therefore the court can assume that he has not notified me&#x201D;. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether that is the case. If Mr. A, who is a general dealer, is able to produce to the court a certificate of the posting of a registered postal package to the inspector together with a covering letter and a copy of the notice in which he says: &#x201C;I keep my measuring instruments at No. 5 Main Street, Grabouw&#x201D;, the mere production of this evidence on the part of the dealer will be sufficient to rebut presumption. It is by no means clear whether this is the case, but if it is not the case, I do not think we can support the Bill entirely. If this is going to be an irrebuttable presumption which can only then be rebutted by calling in the inspector and putting him under cross-examination, I can see that this legislation will need quite a lot of redrafting. I would like to be assured on this point. It is a great pity that I cannot speak more than once in a Second Reading debate and that I cannot speak after the hon. the Minister has replied to this debate, because if I am not satisfied with his explanation I can hardly move an amendment at that stage. But I am going to rely on the Minister, because I can see that I have his goodwill this evening and we appear to be on the same wavelength. I am going to rely on the hon. the Minister to satisfy me entirely on this very important point. If he can do so, I also will bless this legislation with one request only, namely&#x2014;I am going to repeat what I said before&#x2014;that we cut out all this counting, mass and comma business, and get back to the old-fashioned way in which we used to measure and to talk about decimal points.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that I can stay on the same wavelength as the hon. member for Wynberg, certainly not with the same eloquence and the same precision and the same succinct way of putting things. I would like, however, simply to raise four minor points with the hon. the Minister, one of which has already been raised by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens when he referred to the two or three last lines of clause I, which read: &#x2026;&#x201C;in connection with the measurement of any physical quantity or a counting by means of gravitation may be effected&#x201D;. I assume from the way the hon. the Minister is nodding his head that he is going to explain to us what that means. It may simply be a new and ingenious application of Newton&#x2019;s law of gravity, but certainly, as far as we are concerned, at the moment we cannot follow it.</p>

<p>Clause 3 brings into the principal Act net provisions applying to containers as well as to what was previously described as measuring instruments. In regard to clause 3(g), however, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the effect of this amendment to the principal Act is to reduce the word &#x201C;person&#x201D; to &#x201C;purchaser&#x201D;. Is he prepared simply to leave it at that or is he prepared to consider that it should be either &#x201C;a purchaser&#x201D; or, at this point in time, reading it in the context of this clause &#x201C;a person who intends to purchase&#x201D;&#x003F; There may well be circumstances where a person is a prospective purchaser as opposed to an actual purchaser whom he would like to deal with under this particular subsection.</p>

<p>When we come to clause 5 we find that certain concessions are granted in respect of measuring instruments which are situated more than a specified distance by the shortest route from a place which is specified. I refer to the new paragraph (cA) <span class="col_3519-3520" refersTo="page_0173"/>which is to be inserted after section 19(1)(c) of the Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a measuring instrument which is kept at a place situated more than 25 km by the shortest route from a place specified in the said notice;</block>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the Minister could give us an explanation on two aspects of this amendment. Firstly, I want to know what is meant by &#x201C;the shortest route&#x201D;. Secondly, I want to know why a distance of 15 km is chosen as the particular distance.</p>

<p>The last question I should like to ask the hon. the Minister refers to clause 8. Clause 8 substitutes section 26 of the principal Act and reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Any measuring instrument used by the State or any authorized person for the purpose of or in connection with &#x2026; shall be certified or rectified in accordance with this Act unless exempted from certification or recertification under this Act.</block>

<p>The question I should like to ask the hon. the Minister is why this exemption is simply on the basis of usage by the State or any authorized person and why the criteria which apply to that kind of instrument when used by other people should be ignored.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank hon. members on the opposite side of this House for their support of this legislation. If I were to do what the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens did and call to mind the previous legislation. I should like to remark that it is as well that the contributions made by hon. members on the opposite side of this House in respect of that legislation are not measurable by precise measuring instruments. If that had been the case, they would most probably have experienced problems. Some of the aspects mentioned by the hon. members, may be dealt with fruitfully in the Committee Stage, since that may probably be the more appropriate stage to do so. The hon. member for Cape Town Gardens asked me what was meant by the containers referred to in the new section 12, as substituted by clause 2. I want to tell him at once that the meaning to be attached to the word &#x201C;container&#x201D; is the meaning which is normally attached to this word. I want to point out further that clause 10 of the Bill, which amends section 31 of the principal Act, actually enables us to prescribe what containers are to be used. As regards the amendment in clause 1 to the definition of &#x201C;measuring instrument&#x201D;, the hon. member referred to the words &#x201C;a counting by means of gravitation&#x201D;. As far as I personally am concerned, this is a concept which is beyond my comprehension. I asked my learned friend from Wonderboom, who is an engineer, what he thought it meant, and he sent me the following note. I hope this will clarify the matter for hon. members: &#x201C;Weight is the synonym of the measurement of an item which is registered purely as a result of the force which is exercised upon it by the gravity of the earth. Mass concerns a specific gravity. It is a composition of the item of which the mass has to be determined and is a gravitational balance.&#x201D; If you understand this, Sir, then you are more intelligent than I am, because I do not understand it [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg also supported the legislation although he objected to certain terms. I want to tell him that the terms to which he referred are not new concepts which are being inserted by the legislation introduced by me. I want to say at once that a reaction also came from the public against certain of the terms. At the time when the legislation was introduced, in 1973, I explained, and I repeated it tonight, that this legislation was bringing us into line with the international system of units. We must also remember that basically this legislation&#x2014;as the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens correctly remarked&#x2014; actually concerns trade and that in this particular respect we trade with other countries which have the same international system of units, the SI system. When we deal with legislation which concerns trade, it is necessary, for the purposes of international trade, for us to use the same terms even though they might not be so readily acceptable in popular parlance. Women in particular do not like one refering to their weight as &#x201C;mass&#x201D;. Even the two of us, the hon. member for Wynberg and I are not getting younger or smaller in mass!</p>

<p>I have already given the hon. member for Johannesburg North an explanation in connection with clause 1. I hope he now understands what it means, because from <span class="col_3521-3522" refersTo="page_0174"/>the nature of things I still do not understand it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg drew my attention to the presumption created by clause 4. I want to say at once that he will see that the new section itself provides that that affidavit will be <i>prima facie</i> evidence only. Therefore it stands to reason that it is refutable and if the particular dealer were to bring evidence in the form which he suggested, i.e. the receipt from the post office that the notice had been sent, then, in my opinion, he would inevitably have discharged adequately the onus resting upon him. I hope the hon. member is satisfied with that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North referred to clause 8, which makes provision for the exemption from certification of measuring instruments of the State. I have already explained that the basic motivation in this regard has nothing to do with the fact that the measuring instruments are used by the State. It has to do with the fact that the administrations of the State, for example the Railways, have adequate facilities to ensure that the measuring instruments which are used are correct, accurate and true. Before their mechanicians qualify to do that certification, they first have to do a test at the Division of Weights and Measures so as to ensure that they are able to establish the accuracy of the measuring instruments. In other words, the motivation for the exemption from certification concerns the ability of departments of State to do the certification of the instruments themselves. I shall deal with any other facets or aspects in the Committee Stage.</p>
