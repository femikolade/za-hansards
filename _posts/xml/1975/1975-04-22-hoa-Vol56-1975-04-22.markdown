<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, may I have the privilege of the half hour&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is the duty of Parliament today to consider almost 20% of the Country&#x2019;s total budget for 1975-&#x2019;76. Before I come to deal with this in detail I should <span class="col_4541-4542" refersTo="page_0684"/>like to clarify just how much we are dealing with. The White Paper issued by the hon. the Minister of Defence speaks of a total expenditure of R989 million. Now, as I read the budget, it is applying R948 million from revenue and with his three items on capital expenditure, Public Works Community Development and Defence&#x2014; another R60 odd million&#x2014;it makes it R1 010 million which is before this House. I mention this because the lower figure of R989 million mentioned in the White Paper has been widely quoted. I believe though that that is an incorrect figure. Now, if you add to this the expenditure which has to be voted for the S.A. Police and for Boss, the Bureau for State Security, it means that security in South Africa is costing us in the current financial year a total of R1 200 million. That is the total amount which the taxpayer is being asked to pay, excluding Prisons and Justice.</p>

<p>It is our duty as Parliament to weigh the amount of this specific Vote, R1 010 million, against the needs of and the threats which face South Africa. We as a Opposition have always refused to give a blank cheque, blind acceptance, without considering the issues involved. So we have sought within our knowledge, which naturally is limited, to evaluate the threats and the needs for this expenditure. It is very easy to underplay or to overplay the question of security. One can underplay it by saying that if only we had spent this money on housing and education one would not need a Defence Force, or one can overplay it, as unfortunately is the tendency amongst some Government members in their public utterances, by displaying an almost blind panic and accepting at face value anything that is asked and anything that it budgeted for in regard to defence. We have sought the more difficult course of trying to separate the rational from the emotional justification for defence expenditure. We have thus tried to evaluate this increase to over a R1 000 million this year. As a party&#x2014;as we indicated in the Second Reading debate&#x2014;we accept the total amount in principle. Here, on the Vote, however, I believe we should motivate this a little further. I believe that the White Paper which was issued also attempts to do this sincerely. I think it is important that we should realize that, of the ten factors which the White Paper itself sets out in paragraph 7 as the factors determining strategy, only two factors are within the control of South Africa. The other eight factors are all factors beyond our control. In South Africa we can deal with extremists who are trying to create incidents through our Police and we can deal with efforts to incite internal unrest. For the rest, however, all the factors which the Department of Defence itself recognizes as determining their strategy, are factors beyond our control. We on this side of the House see three antidotes for the threats that face us.</p>

<p>The first of these is that of d&#x00E9;tente or dialogue, of seeking to lessen hostility towards South Africa and of seeking to end the tragic isolation of our country from those countries which should logically be our friends. I refer to those countries who, in the sphere of defence, both in the interests of their own security and from the history of our past associations should be working with us but who, today, boycott us and refuse to supply us with arms or to co-operate in any way in our joint security. D&#x00E9;tente, or dialogue, the whole process which is going on at the present moment and something which we have said we welcome and support, we hope will not only bring a lessening of tension in Southern Africa, but will bring us back into the community of Western nations where we not only belong, but where we have a part to play and where other countries need us playing that part.</p>

<p>The second antidote, as we see it, is the loyalty of all our people, loyalty which we believe can be won through removing causes of friction, this bringing about a relaxation of tension in South Africa. The third antidote to the threat against South Africa is our military preparedness.</p>

<p>*The first two of these solutions have been debated here in the House of Assembly and we have discussed them at some length. Our attitude towards dialogue and d&#x00E9;tente is well-known. It is equally well-known that we are dissatisfied, totally dissatisfied, about the second of these solutions, namely the way in which the loyalty of all our nations, all our people in South Africa, is to be won. The question we have to answer is this: Although both d&#x00E9;tente and the elimination of internal tensions are relevant to defence itself and to preparedness, are they decisive&#x003F; Are these the factors which determine the amount that South Africa should spend&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_4543-4544" refersTo="page_0685"/>&#x2020;We believe that the answer is in the negative. If d&#x00E9;tente should fail, a R1 000 million on defence is going to be chicken-feed. It is going to be chicken-feed in the new situation which will arise should we fail to find peace through dialogue and discussion. So, while they are related one cannot measure the success or failure of d&#x00E9;tente against the amount which one spends on defence.</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<p>Tell that to Jacobs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>There is no disagreement as far as we are concerned. I now come to the second antidote. If the loyalty of our people is lost, one cannot buy that loyalty with money and one cannot replace it with guns. There is no argument about this. We know&#x2014;and we believe it should be known to our Defence Leadership&#x2014; the effect of tension and of friction within and between the peoples of South Africa on the strategy and the effectiveness of our security. The difference is that we debate that when we are dealing with the Government&#x2019;s maladministration, the civil maladministration of South Africa. [Interjection.] The point I want to make now, if that hon. friend could just catch, up with 1975, with his own Prime Minister and with the policy of his own Government, is that one cannot measure the amount which, one spends on security by the degree of failure or of success which the Government has achieved in its civil administration. We believe that peaceful change can only come about in South Africa on a basis of law and order and of stability. In both these fields of external d&#x00E9;tente and internal d&#x00E9;tente law and order and stability are prerequisites for success. If peaceful change is to be achieved we must have as backing for that peaceful change, a deterrent and a preparedness matching the threats of violence against us. We must match them with an effective deterrent against external adventurers or against internal anarchists. Thus, facing the reality as it is and the facts as they are and not as we would like them to be and not as hon. members like the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark think that they are or dream that they are in their euphoria, we have accepted this expenditure in principle, evaluated against the realities of the possibilities&#x2014;the threats &#x2014;facing South Africa as a country. Luckily on this issue both sides of the House are at one, and despite members like the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark we will keep South Africa safe. We will defend South Africa while that hon. member is playing politics with the defence of his own country and while he is undermining the views, the policy and the direction which the Cabinet follows. I hope that he will be properly put in his place by the responsible leaders of that party.</p>

<p>When we measure this threat we must remember that China and Russia do not use their own troops to achieve conquest. They use the troops of other countries as they have used them in Korea, Vietnam and in other parts of the world. It is clear that our defence must be a sufficiently strong deterrent to let those who might become the potential tools of this strategy know just what they would face if they should attack us.</p>

<p>This then brings us to the second responsibility of this House. Having accepted the principle of this expenditure, this House must determine how it is spent, how productive that expenditure is in the returns in security&#x2014;i.e. the effectiveness of the defence which it provides&#x2014;and also how it is controlled. The only parliamentary safeguard we have is the report of the Controller and Auditor-General. That is the only parliamentary control &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Well, we can draw pictures for him if he so desires. Each picture would show a strong criticism of the control of stores in the Department of Defence. Every paragraph, in the report refers in one way or another to the lack of control. That is all Parliament has before it. There is nothing else. All the rest is veiled in secrecy.</p>

<p>Let me deal with just this one aspect, the question of stock control. In every case the answer of the Department of Defence is one of staff problems&#x2014;either the department does not have sufficient staff or it does not have sufficiently trained staff. Every year, however, there are called up for service <span class="col_4545-4546" refersTo="page_0686"/>qualified auditors and accountants and dozens of article clerks. These are persons whose job in &#x201C;civvy&#x201D; life is to audit and control stock and accounts. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has ever considered using these qualified people instead of having them go off to camp to do square-bashing for three weeks, as teams of audit inspectors to spend the three-week camp doing an inspection of the stores. I mention this now because later other members on this side are going to deal with the proper use of the qualifications of qualified persons in the force. I know, and everyone must know, of many examples of auditors and article clerks who in fact are operating as cooks, waiters and riflemen. They could instead be helping to solve this problem of the control of stocks and stores in camps. This would help internally within the Defence Force to bring their house in order. Then, when the Auditor General does his inspections, he might be able to make a rosier report. For the rest, however, we have no control.</p>

<p>The Minister promised us an insight into the Armaments Board and Armscor. I am sorry to say this, but what we attended turned out to be a well-run public relations exercise. The Press was present, the briefing was well done and well documented. In fact, it was a public relations exercise justifying the operations, existence and activity of those two boards. We received globular breakdowns, but the curtain was not lifted. One reads in the Press about what is going on. I read a report only this weekend of things that we have certainly not heard about officially.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Another leak.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I must say that my colleagues and I have also learnt nothing which reduces our concern, for instance at the wholesale purge of top officials and qualified people last year. When there is a wholesale dismissal of senior people, and I am talking now of 40 or 50 people, it shows that something was wrong. The hon. the Minister is looking at me quizzically. Yes, the figure was announced as 40 in one firm alone, Atlas, last September. I have seen two of the letters whereby the people were instantly dismissed. No reason was given except to say that their services were terminated with immediate effect. They received pay benefits and so on afterwards, but their duties were terminated immediately. As I say, I have seen two of them and the reports indicated that some 40 people were dismissed in that one purge. When that sort of thing has to happen, it gives grounds for concern. I believe that we are entitled to know more about the inner workings of an organization to which we are voting hundreds of millions of rands. The Special Defence Fund gets some R600 million this year and I believe that Parliament is entitled to a greater control than we have.</p>

<p>Then in the material field too there are things that worry us. Let me mention one example. On 15 April I asked a question about the Naval supply ship <i>Tafelberg,</i> which was bought in 1965 for an amount of R1 100 000. It was converted at a cost of R1 400 000 and since then it had a refit in 1968 because of mechanical, electrical and hull defects, amounting to R42 000. In 1969 it had the same defects and the repairs then amounted to R50 000. In 1970 it had a major refit at a cost of R500 000. In 1971 major repairs were carried out at a cost of R170 000. In 1972 repairs amounted to R740 000, in 1973 minor repairs amounted to R110 000 and in 1974 it amounted to R3 000. At the moment a tender is out for repairs which, according to my information, will amount to something like R1&#x00BD; million. And this ship cost us R1 100 000! I do not have time to deal with it but <i>Lloyds Journal</i> of 8 April this year referred to the tanker depression at the moment and said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">In the sale and purchase market for second-hand tankers one can hardly talk of any activity other than for demolition of over-aged tonnage. No turnover of second-hand tankers can be reported from March in the Norwegian market.</block>

<p>In another report in <i>Marine Week</i> we find the same story. In other words, according to these reports the sort of tanker which we can use is sold at far below its value. We are spending big money and I believe that Parliament is entitled to query this sort of expenditure and to ask whether we should not have bought a new ship long ago and cut our losses, especially knowing of the weaknesses and hull deficiencies of this ship.</p>

<p>These are material things and in the few minutes left I want to turn to what is the key to the ultimate effectiveness of our forces. Sophisticated hardware requires skilled and trained operators. We are spending <span class="col_4547-4548" refersTo="page_0687"/>a total amount of R227 million on manpower and approximately R750 million on hardware and administration. This means that we have a ratio of three to one when we compare the figures spent on materials and the figures spent on manpower. Yet, people are the key. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to remove completely the control of the Defence Force from the Public Service Commission. It is creating anomalies which are not good for defence. When we look at the fact that we have on our establishment 143 generals today, with the rank of Brigadier upwards, then one accepts that this has to be done, that the only way in which you can keep people is by paying them enough for their qualifications. But then one is cheapening the rank. People are being promoted to the higher rank because they cannot be paid enough in the lower ranks. So the whole rank structure goes out of balance. I hope the hon. the Minister follows me but if not, I shall deal with it on a later occasion. If one cannot raise the salaries because the Public Service Commission sits on them, another way will have to be found. So they are promoted instead of being paid more in the same rank. There should be flexibility in a Defence Force. It is not like sitting in an office from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. It demands the kind of duty and responsibility that needs flexibility which should be controlled by the department and not by the Public Service Commission.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Will you kindly explain to me what the Public Service Commission has to do with the number of senior officers in the force&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It has nothing to do with the number of officers, but it does determine the rate of pay for the rank. It equates a rank with a secretary, an undersecretary or a deputy secretary. It equates the pay for a particular rank with the pay for an equivalent civilian post. That is the position. [Interjections.] If it does not do so, I have heard a lot of ungrounded complaints because that is the standard complaint I receive, i.e. that the rank is lifted rather than that more is paid within the rank.</p>

<p>Speaking of men, I want to say that the Citizen Force and the Commandos are the operational backbone of our force. In this regard I want to express appreciation for the concessions made in respect of ceremonial uniforms. However, I would like to plead that, rather than turning out one-dimensional pawns and producing dull, souless conformity in the army, we should seek to encourage initiative and individualism. Conformity is necessary to a point, but in our sort of army, in our sort of war and considering our tradition as a nation, individualism and initiative are vital. That is why we were able to second 3 000 officers to other forces during the last war. We had a surplus of 3 000 officers because our people had initiative and leadership qualities. I do not believe we are at the present moment drawing the best initiative out of people because we are trying too hard to create total conformity and not enough to create individualism and initiative. Do you remember, Mr. Chairman, how Montgomery turned defeat into victory not by standardization but in fact with what was probably the most crazily dressed army ever&#x003F; Yet that army engendered a spirit and pride that turned gloom and despondency into determination and victory. I believe therefore that we should encourage initiative and individualism in our forces as far as we can.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, one has so little time to deal with the many things one wants to deal with. I refer to the &#x201C;orphan Annies&#x201D; of Defence. First Military Intelligence. The White Paper stresses the importance of Military Intelligence and information but we are spending a miserable R410 000 on Military Intelligence whereas the Bureau for State Security&#x2014;Boss&#x2014;gets R14 million. Military Intelligence is, I believe, something which requires at least a larger responsibility to be controlled by Defence itself. Secondly, less than R750 000 is being spent on civil defence. A colleague of mine will deal with that aspect. These are what I call the &#x201C;orphan Annies&#x201D; of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>There are other things we welcome, such as the corps structure, e.g. the building up of a corps with brigades and divisions. Again I hope that we shall instil a sense of pride and identity in the different units. I also welcome the navy expenditure. The navy has been left out of the draw for a long time as far as hardware is concerned. I hope that now that we are getting missile boats, it does not mean that the corvettes have been put into the ice-box for good. I believe we need both and that the navy requires a bigger slice of the hardware allocation.</p>

<p>We also welcome the increasing use of all the non-White Race groups. Again, this <span class="col_4549-4550" refersTo="page_0688"/>is a belated step. We should be doing more in this regard, not only 60 or 200. We should be bringing in all our people to participate in our defence. In that field I hope the hon. the Minister of Defence will have a quiet talk with the Prime Minister about the basis on which the Transkeian and Okavango armies will ultimately operate.</p>

<p>I want to express appreciation for the full dental treatment now being given to the men. This is something I asked for in this debate some four years ago. It has now been operating for over a year. It shows that one can sometimes do good by raising matters which may seem piffling but which are in fact important to the people concerned.</p>

<p>So there are many other aspects which affect people. For instance, I want to refer to a small matter like the uniform allowances for warrant officers which have been stopped. I wrote about it and I was told that there was now going to be no warrant officer uniform allowance. The warrant officer is the key&#x2014;I often think he is more important than the commanding officer&#x2014;of a unit because the warrant officer is the man who determines basic discipline and down-to-earth control of the men. It is from him that the spirit goes out to the NCO&#x2019;s. There are little things like that, costing a fractional amount of money, for instance to give Citizen Force warrant officers a uniform allowance so that they can wear blues when they go to an official function like a mess function, dinner or dance. The allowance should be made so that they can afford to buy their blues which cost R70 or R80 today. Most of these warrant officers are youngsters and they need some sort of assistance in this field. I am thinking of the little things that affect morale; they can bring big results because these are key people, people who can influence the morale, who can build up the spirit and who can differentiate between preparedness and success or disgruntlement and failure of a Defence Force.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying again that it is no use having sophisticated equipment if we do not have the men with sophisticated training to make it work. I hope that this ratio will be looked at again and that, small or large, attention to men as well as machines will be one of the guiding principles of the Defence Force.</p>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban Point has made quite a number of points with which I am in agreement. For instance, he has asked for more money for civil defence and for the navy and I support him in that. But surely he realizes that such a request, if granted, would entail a larger defence expenditure. I suppose he is preparing his side of the House for the Defence Vote next year. The hon. member has furthermore made the point that there were inevitable antidotes for the threat against us. He accepts as one of the inevitable antidotes our military preparedness, and I support him here too. By accepting that premise, the hon. member differed vastly in his speech, as far as form and spirit are concerned, from the speeches made by other Opposition speakers on that side of the House. It is clear to me that what really concerns the hon. member is the here and now, the present. He is merely critical of some aspects of our policy but being so is his own right and although I may differ from him when he criticizes on particular premises, I have appreciation for the fact that he honoured the spirit of consensus which he himself had introduced into these debates a number of years ago. To my mind consensus serves a two-fold purpose. Firstly, it presents to the outside world a picture of solidarity which discourages the would-be aggressor and disheartens the revolutionaries who thrive on division. Secondly, it supports the morale of our men and women who are full-time members of our Citizen Force and Defence Force, our national servicemen and the members of the civil defence. One cannot expect these men and women to render their utmost by telling them that they are defending an unjust cause. If time permits me, I will return to this aspect.</p>

<p>This brings me to our state of preparedness and the Vote itself. A well-known author, Colonel Norman R. Dodd, came to the following conclusion after having analysed our defence system and our ability to mobilize; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Militarily the Republic is virtually impregnable to any conventional attack, except one made on a vast scale by one of the super powers, an unlikely event</block>

<p>Another author, Lewis H. Gann, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is the only sub-Saharan State with an industrial and logistical infrastructure strong enough to maintain an up-to-date system of land, air and sea defences.</block>

<p><span class="col_4551-4552" refersTo="page_0689"/>The same author concludes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Republic offers very little revolutionary potential to forces from within and without.</block>

<p>*Sir, these quoted viewpoints were aired before the present Budget, and I want to make the point that in the light of our Budget, we are in a much stronger position today than we were at the time when those gentlemen came to those conclusions. Our ability, our preparedness, has been much, increased in the meantime. The Vote of the Minister of Defence, Sir, bears witness to determination and planning. The White Paper, read in conjunction with the Budget, can be seen as a programme in terms of which the department wishes to run its affairs on the long-term. It also sets out the following quite clearly: The evaluation or appreciation, by the department, of the present military situation in the first place, and in the second place the priorities in terms of which the Minister and his High Command wish to carry out their task. According to this, if one analyses it, the greater emphasis still falls on landward defence, because the expenditure on this item as a whole, constitutes 40% of the total expenditure, viz. R383 million. This increase comes at the same time as the establishment of the South African Army&#x2019;s corps organization which is subdivided again into two divisions and a number of brigades. Furthermore, we notice a re-organization which amounts to a Commandment Commanding Officer being placed at the head of a anti-insurgency unit. On the other hand, the planned expenditure in respect of maritime defence, shows an increase of almost 100% for the financial year 1975-&#x2019;76 as against a 20% increase in expenditure for air defence and a 30% increase for landward defence. These increase expenditures bear witness to our awareness of our situation on the route from the Indian Ocean, the life line, the main artery, of the free-world. Sir, it coincides with the Russian occupation of the Indian Ocean. A visit to Simonstown shows one the great activity there, and we want to wish the Command and its officers every success with what they are doing.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as the utility of Simonstown and our maritime defence in general is concerned, it is important to notice that we can link up quite easily with any defence network in the free world. That is a point which is made by an increasing number of influential visitors. Another aspect of our defence expenditure which should be underlined here, is training, to which the hon. member for Durban Point asked that special attention be given. The expenditure on training constitutes 12% of the total expenditure, but the increase itself represents 50% on the expenditure of the previous year. Sir, I provide here for the increase in the cost of living and I provide for the rate of inflation. Nevertheless it is very clear, Sir, that the Supreme Command underlines this aspect of training in particular. I venture to say that our Defence Budget is the smallest possible premium for the maximum security which we can enjoy as a result thereof. It is the largest and best policy we can take out for the economy of our country, for the foreign investor and in particular for the entrepreneur who wanted to launch a business enterprise here in South Africa. But our Defence Force makes a contribution to our economy in another sense as well. In this respect I have examined the matter more closely and considered those aspects which were raised by the Opposition on the other side, especially by the Progressive Party, which amount to the viewpoint that this is futile expenditure, a total loss. I want to point out. Sir, that the money which is spent on defence is to a great extent, not spent on hardware, not only on tanks and guns, and so on. Of the total appropriation, expenditure other than armaments expenditure amounts to R414 million. That represents 44% of the total expenditure, in other words, only 56% is for hardware, as the hon. member put it. If we analyse further the amount spent on armaments, i.e. R534 million, we find that a large portion of that amount, is spent locally, viz. R184 million. The local expenditure, therefore, of our armament expenditure amounts to 35%&#x2014;a considerable amount of which, i.e. R59 million, is ploughed back into the private sector. We can divide the local expenditure into two groups. We have Armscor on the one hand, with its subsidiaries, and we have the private sector on the other hand, the private sector which is not only geared to defence material, but to diversity. They might perhaps manufacture a component of a component. That explains why 3 200 contracts were concluded in the year 1974, 340 of which were of a value of more than R100 000 each&#x2014;a considerable amount which therefore, goes to the private sector. Last but not least, I want to tell you that Armscor and its subsidiaries are a considerable <span class="col_4553-4554" refersTo="page_0690"/>employer and make a substantial contribution, also as far as our Black and Brown workers are concerned.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have no quarrel with what the hon. member who has just sat down said. We have no quarrel with expenditure on defence. We also agree that South Africa at this stage is far more prepared than we were in 1939, but I would like to point out that in our opinion it is a completely different picture. In 1939 we were one of a very large allied force. Against that, I think, if trouble comes to South Africa in future we would be very isolated. We would be in a position similar to that of Israel today, or perhaps in a worse position in that we would not get the help which. Israel gets from America. So when we voice any criticism here, it is meant to be constructive and not destructive. Because we are fully aware of what the Department of Defence is doing for South Africa. I should also like to point out that we, like Israel, have a very limited work force. We have men who have to be utilized in the army for military skills and those same people also have to be utilized in civilian life as well, for their civilian skills. It makes one think of a great institution like the engineering corps in the U.S.A., where they have a permanent engineering corps which does some of the greatest engineering works in America. They are actually an army unit. When war comes, of course, they already have a unit which is completely ready to tackle the machinery of war.</p>

<p>Now, we keep on hearing certain things, and I do not know whether this is familiar to the Government as well, but it certainly is to the Opposition. We hear from trainees that there is a lot of wasted time in their training. They come back from or during their military training and say that they are having a glorious loaf in the base camps; they are not doing anything and are bored to tears. This does not apply to the first couple of months after the start of their military training. I would say the first five or six months they are busy and intensely interested in their work. They enjoy it and they do not get the chance to be bored. The time on the border is also one of great activity and interest and do not get bored.</p>

<p>The trouble starts when they come back to the base camps where they have to wait around and sit about. They do guard duties but they have lots of time to be idle, non-active and non-productive periods. This has been discussed in this House before and the hon. the Minister has said that this was investigated. There does not, however, appear to be any tangible result. I have information from people who are intimately involved in the training of our youth, not only parents, but also school-teachers, university teachers and employers, to the effect that the young man who comes back today after a year, years or two years of training, is not the same as the young man who came back after a shorter period of training. There is a vast difference. After a shorter period of training there was no difficulty in the switch over from military duties to civilian work. These young men were used to work; they were used to being busy and they were used to discipline. There was no problem at all. Today, however, it is a different story. The boys come back and they no longer want to work or study. They no longer even want to go back to the jobs they had before.</p>

<p>I have it on information from people connected with those boys.</p>

<p>This problem of inactivity after intense duties is natural and it happens to any boy. He cannot but be different. When a person is involved in very intense and dangerous work, sometimes exciting work and he then returns to a state of inactivity there is a complete change. It is then very difficult for these boys to adjust themselves. I fear that this is where the problem lies. Here we should be liaising with educational authorities to try to keep these boys busy and to interest them. The devil finds work for idle hands; there is no doubt about this. When I say &#x201C;idle hands&#x201D; I do not only mean learning to play klawerjas. These boys come back and they pick up all sorts of bad habits. They meet boys who teach them gambling, smoking and other habits which could lead to drug addiction. When a person is idle these things are easily picked up.</p>

<p>I would now like to refer to the chances we now have of educating these boys. I am not only referring to technical education, but also to commercial and academic education. This can easily be done in this period. Today our educational system is orientated towards differentiation where it is established during the school period what a boy&#x2019;s aptitudes are and in which way he is inclined to go in future life. These aptitudes can be pursued further during his military training. We have the people, the time and the ability. The opportunity should be afforded for these boys to continue assimilating knowledge while they are busy with their military duties. I am not presuming that all boys who are technically trained are taken into the army and put into technical units. This would, of course, be desirable, viz. that a boy who is in an engineering trade would go into an engineering corps. Similarly a boy involved in post office work should actually go into a signal corps. I presume this is normally done wherever possible. This theoretical knowledge can be added to even if such a person has the knowledge which he acquired in his civilian job. It could be added to in the army. There is no doubt about this.</p>

<p>The method is very easy. When the last war broke out we were faced with a similar problem. There were a lot of unskilled men and the technical colleges were called in to assist in the training of these men. A director of technical manpower was appointed. I think it was a headmaster at Pretoria College.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. A. VAN COLLER</person>:</from>

<p>This director got the whole thing going. No, not the Cott scheme. The Cott scheme was for the training of technicians. At Lyttleton the air force established a training school and we have the same thing in Cape Town now in respect of the navy and the Cape Technical College. This sort of thing can be enlarged upon and encouraged. The knowledge obtained there can be supplemented. There is a shortage of those entering the trade and specialized professions today. Boys go into the army straight from school and this should be the place to prepare them and to develop the wish to go into specialized trades. How many boys today, after their army training, are going into the trades or into specialized professions&#x003F; Very few. The majority orientate into office jobs, salesmen, etc. But if they were given a bit of encouragement and preparatory training and tuition, we could persuade them to lake up this sort of work. I wonder how many men, when war comes, will be found to be equipped to go into an engineering corps with full military engineering knowledge. I wonder how many with signal experience we will be able to put into the signal corps. During the last war we saw people in charge of military transport who were hearse drivers in civilian life. We had veterinarians who became army doctors. It would not surprise me if, during the next war, we have Members of Parliament becoming military policemen. For this reason I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if he would consider going into this matter and to appoint someone or a committee to see whether there cannot be a closer liaison between the army, the navy and the air force and our technical colleges. Here you have men and equipment on the one hand who are willing and able to impart their knowledge to the boys and on the other hand you have the boys who are ready and willing to assimilate that knowledge.

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for South Coast came along once again with the old, old story that sufficient care is not taken of our national servicemen, in the sense that once they have completed the basic training period, they become bored. He also asked that these people be given the opportunity to undertake further studies during their period of training. We have had this complaint since the national service system was introduced. The hon. member ascribes it to the fact that national servicemen now have to serve a longer training period. But surely it is a fact that these boys are called up in the first place to be trained as soldiers. For this they give up a year of their lives. In so far as it is possible to fit it in with their training programme, there is more than enough opportunity for those boys who have the desire and the ability to do a little extra study in their leisure time. This matter has been brought to our attention so often that it is really not worthwhile arguing about it any longer.</p>

<p><span class="col_4557-4558" refersTo="page_0692"/>In sharp contrast to the responsible attitude adopted by the hon. member for Durban Point this afternoon in certain specific aspects, I have to accuse the Opposition today of having people in their ranks who are totally indifferent to the needs of the Defence Force of this country.</p>

<p>I shall come to who they are. One can simply not escape from this conclusion after one has listened to the criticism we had to listen to during the Second Reading debate of this Budget. Nobody is denying the Opposition the right to criticize expenditure on defence. But this has to be positive at least. To over-emphasize the size of the amount without referring to the necessity thereof in today&#x2019;s circumstances, to question the amount without making alternative proposals which will ensure that the Defence Force maintains its maximum degree of preparedness and to allege that the money should rather be used for other purposes, shows a negativism which is not to the advantage of the morale of our young people in the Defence Force. One of the major tasks of our Defence Force staff is to motivate our young people, and utterances such as those which we have heard in recent times in this House, are not conducive to the success of that aim of the Defence Force. In passing, I want to refer to the hon. member for Hillbrow. He has acquired the habit of referring in a cynical way to our Defence budget every year. It has become a habit of his, as well as of other hon. members of the Opposition, to accuse this side of the House, timeously and untimeously, of not doing its duty during the Second World War. We are now sick and tired of that reproach. With reference to the Opposition, I want to ask the hon. member for Durban Point especially to tell his people to refrain from making reproaches of this nature because this sort of thing will boomerang against them.</p>

The fact that we want to bring about d&#x00E9;tente with Africa, does not take away the threat of Communism. The communists threaten us with their policy of world domination. We have to provide for that threat, and for that threat we have to make greater provision than for the threat which

<p>The hon. member for Maitland was either not here or he did not listen. Here is the hon. member for Hillbrow&#x2019;s Hansard. I invite the hon. member to read the speech. The reasons for the increase of defence expenditure is so obvious that they hardly require an argument. The days are past when a country could regard itself as being prepared when it had sufficient rifles, machine guns, cannons and a few armoured cars and tanks in its possession. Highly sophisticated electronic equipment is a requirement of a modern defence force today. Research on the basic level, as well as applied research, is the order of the day in keeping the Defence Force as prepared as possible. Sophisticated weaponry systems have to be adjusted and maintained continually, and consideration must be given to technological development in that sphere. As there are shifts of emphasis in the strategy against us, so the Defence Force has to adjust its priorities to cope with the changed situation. These things cost money, and in many cases the money has to be available immediately.</p>

<p>The Defence Force realized several years ago that it has to plan on the long term. Therefore it switched over to the system of programme planning. At the basis of programme planning lies the fact that when one has said A, one also has to say B and C in the following years and then one must take note of the escalation of costs. That which was planned and ordered as long ago as in 1970 and which only now has to be delivered, modified or expanded, costs three to four times as much as it did in 1970. We have to take the modern tendencies and technological development into account and we have to incorporate this into our Defence Force. That is the reason for this increased amount, apart from the increased salaries, as was clearly apparent from the White Paper. In the light of our strategic position in the Indian Ocean, the expansion of our maritime defence system is of the greatest importance. There we face the problem that we, as Whites, can simply no longer man that system. For that reason it was essential&#x2014;I want to commend this, because it was the right step&#x2014;that we accommodate Coloureds and Indians in our navy as well. I should very much like to hear from the hon. the Minister to what extent his efforts in this connection have succeeded.</p>

<p>This amount of approximately one milliard rands we want to spend on our Defence Force, is an insurance premium for our future. Let us then accept the burden happily, and in this way give our youth the assurance once again that we want to leave them this beautiful country unravaged and free.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. S. F. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, whenever our Defence Force is being discussed, a simple question always presents itself to us: Why a Defence Force&#x003F; The question really is why so many millions and millions of rand have to spent on a Defence Force. As is suggested by the Opposition parties&#x2014;even if they want to deny it&#x2014; the question whether we cannot put the money to better use by buying tractors or, as the Progressive Party says, for the upliftment of the Coloured and other non-White peoples is asked. Among our older generation there was a brief, matter-of-fact and simple reply to this question, viz. to defend and protect hearth and home. Hearth and home symbolized their country for the old people and should symbolize for us today our fatherland and everything which it has for us as a people. For us, it is South Africa, our own beloved fatherland, our beautiful country with its blue skies, our rich country with its fertile soil, our country with its wealth of minerals, our wonderful country with its excellent human material which is capable of developing it into an economic giant and a force in Africa. It is this country which is already able to be the scientific and technological brain and the political leader and partner of other Africa States. The other Africa States, if they are willing to accent d&#x00E9;tente and co-operate with us, can find in us a partner which will make it possible for us to develop together and to make Southern Africa the most beautiful, the richest and most pleasant part of the world to live in.</p>

<p>However, South Africa&#x2019;s borders are wide, long and extensive. The coastline from the Kunene to Oranjemund is 1 550 km long and from Oranjemund to Kosi Bay, 2 705 &#x2014;a total of 4 255 km. That is a tremendously <span class="col_4561-4562" refersTo="page_0694"/>long coastline. Our national borders are extensive. From Oranjemund to Union&#x2019;s End, is a distance of 1 100 km; our Botswana border is 1 610 km; our Rhodesian border is 227 km and our Mozambique border, 508 km&#x2014;a total of 3 445 km. Together with the border around Lesotho, which is 812 km, and the Swaziland border of 439 km, our coast and national borders are in aggregate 8 951 km, almost 9 000 km. To undertake the protection and the defence of our fatherland within these borders, is a mighty and almost impossible task. We must defend ourselves landwards against the insurgency and the threat from the north, and seawards against the Soviet sea power which is already making an appearance around our coasts and observing us through the periscopes of its submarines. Our numbers are small&#x2014;barely 4 million Whites&#x2014;and our enemies are legion, hostile, militant and bloodthirsty and enjoy moral, economic, financial and physical support from the West, from our kindred countries. They enjoy direct support from the East as well, which encourages them to act towards us in a more militant and provocative way. Our friends in the Western world and the kindred countries with whom we share our civilization are few. They are indifferent to the value and significance of South Africa and of the sea route around the Cape as a strategic bulmark against penetration from the East. Twenty-five thousand boats sail around the south coast of South Africa each year, and 12 000 call at the various harbours along our southern coast. Nevertheless, Great Britain is at this very moment withdrawing from the Simonstown agreement while the actual assessment up to now of the significance of this sea route for the entire Western defence against the East has also been feeble.</p>

<p>A new dimension has been created in the military balance of power in the East, in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans and in the countries which have coastlines adjoining these oceans. The proud Western eagle&#x2019;s wines have already been clipped and the awe-inspiring strokes of its wings are no longer heard, feared and respected in Africa and in the East as was the case previously. What happens now&#x003F; The Western powers are withdrawing from the East. That has been happening for decades. The French are out of Further-India and the Dutch are out of Indonesia. The British are not only out of the Indian Ocean, but show a completely disinterested attitude to the maintenance of any base or foothold in the East or in Africa. Alas, we now know that the Americans seem to be finally out of Vietnam and out of Indo-China. It is a regrettable situation that the Western eagle is now being replaced by the Eastern vulture. This is already happening. The communist vultures are no longer merely hovering and watching from the heights, but have already found many perches from which they can prey. The vacuum is being rapidly and subtly filled. These are the facts which make our long coast-line and our national borders so important and so vulnerable, because those posts which were previously manned by the Western powers, were in reality our furthest defence posts for South Africa because we fit into the whole strategy. If I listen to threats in the council chambers of the world today, and especially to the militant African States with their cry of Black majority rule in the whole of Africa at all costs, even bloodshed, then it is clear that South Africa stands alone and will have to rely on its own abilities. For this the most effective Defence Force is necessary, a Defence Force which is prepared and mobile for land, air and maritime defence. For this it is also necessary that the most effective armaments be manufactured in South Africa itself. We need the most highly trained, best instructed and strongly motivated manpower. For this we definitely need more than the R948 million which was appropriated this year. For this we need more than 3,7% of the gross national product; for this we need at least 5% and more. I say this without fear of an opposition and I know that the people of South Africa will be willing to contribute this by means of taxation. We are a small nation. We must be correctly adjusted to and motivated for this large task of the defence of the tremendously long borders of this beautiful country of ours which must be defended against any onslaught from the north, the east, or from whatever direction this may come.

Our concern is to be critical&#x2014;and I hope, objectively so&#x2014;of the fact that there could be a wastage and that if we are to spend enormous sums of money on the Defence Force of this country, if we are to spend about R1 010 million we would like to know that every cent of it is being spent effectively and is being put to the best possible use.</p>

<p>I feel it is incumbent upon me to draw the attention of this House to the position in respect of the young man who has obtained his academic qualifications but who still needs to spend a prescribed period of time on practical work so as to obtain his final qualifications; that is to say, before he is entitled to put up his plate. I am referring here mainly to university graduates. I am also referring to all the professions that are enumerated in this excellent little booklet that is sent out to all young men before they are called up for their national service. The booklet is entitled &#x201C;Your National Service Explained&#x201D;. I should like to comment on a few of the paragraphs contained in this booklet.</p>

<p>In the first instance, I should like to refer to paragraph 3 under the reasons for national service where it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It trains the citizen to a level where he would be immediately useful should war break out but does not jeopardize the economy by having him out of his job for too long.</block>

<p>I should like to suggest that after I have finished my address this afternoon, it might be agreed that this could possibly read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It trains the citizen to a level where he would be immediately useful should war break out but does not jeopardize the economy <i>and his future</i> by having him out of his job <i>or career</i> for too long.</block>

<p>Sir, I should like to look now at paragraph 7, where they say that if you serve tor either 18 or 24 months, you will not be called upon to attend any camps. Here I feel that the suitably academically trained young man, who hopes to be able to put up his plate as soon as he possibly can, would be foolish not to avail himself of the opportunity to do a minimum period of service of at least 18 months, because he would then obviate the difficulties that would arise if he had to attend five 19-day camps after only 12 months of voluntary service. Sir, in reply to the self-imposed question, &#x201C;Should I go to varsity or tech, before or after national service&#x003F;&#x201D;, paragraph 52 says <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as we are concerned, you are more useful when you have been academically trained.</block>

<p>That speaks for itself. With your indulgence, Sir, I will now go back to paragraph 50 and read it <i>in toto</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you have a degree in one of the following directions, you may be appointed as an officer, serve in your professional capacity and qualify for the payment of a professional allowance: Architects, engineers (including audio-engineers), land surveyors, medical doctors, dental surgeons, veterinary surgeons, pharmacists, law officers, psychologists, quantity surveyors and town planners.</block>

<p>Sir, let us deal with a cross-section of these professions. Time, unfortunately, precludes us from a detailed study of them all, but I think a fair sample would be doctors, pharmacists, engineers, lawyers and&#x2014;one that is not mentioned in the list&#x2014;accountants. In the case of doctors, it is well known that the medical man spends six years at university attaining his M.B., Ch.B., before spending a year in a hospital for his housemanship. The pharmacist has to study for four years at one of the two universities in this country equipped for the training of pharmacists to obtain the degree of Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy, or for four years at a suitably equipped technical college before doing a year of practical work in the field of pharmacy. The engineer studies for four years for a Bachelor of Science (Engineering) degree, and then has to do three years&#x2019; practical work before he gets his Pr. Eng. Certificate and is considered to be a professional engineer. A lawyer <span class="col_4565-4566" refersTo="page_0696"/>has to study for five years for his B.A., L.L.B. and serve articles for two years before he can practise as an attorney. The accountant attains the degree of Bachelor of Commerce after three years at university and then has to serve articles for two years, and this is followed by an examination before he qualifies as a chartered accountant. As you can see, Sir, each of these professions requires practical experience of anything from one to four years before the young man concerned can claim to be fully qualified in the profession of his choice, and it is here that I wish to make an appeal to the Minister. I appeal to him to initiate discussions with the various professional councils in order that agreement may be reached that at least some, if not all, of the time spent by the degreed national servicemen actively engaged in the practical field of his chosen profession is credited towards the requirements of that profession. At the moment a doctor is only accepted into the armed forces after he has served his housemanship. I submit, Sir, that it would be fairer to accept him after he has completed his university education and to put him into an army hospital. Sir, if that hon. member over there has finished, I would like to complete my address to the Minister. The young man could then go into an army hospital and do his training there. If there is no room for him in the army hospitals, he could then, in terms of recent legislation, be seconded to provincial or other hospitals near a military camp, where he could not only serve the army but where he could certainly serve his country very effectively. The same applies to the pharmacist, but there appears to be some confusion about the pharmacist. I understand that there is the possibility that the pharmacist&#x2019;s year in an army dispensary may be considered as acceptable as the year required to give him his MPS.</p>

<p>In regard to the engineers, I would like to isolate the civil engineer for the purposes of this discussion. He has to obtain a Pr. Eng. certificate before he is basically able to go out in on his own account as a suitably qualified professional engineer. This entails three years&#x2019; practical experience after his university career is completed. It cannot be denied that there must be more than enough scope in all the three arms of the service for these young men to put their university training to practical use and I feel that some of this period should be credited to the period required under the Pr. Eng. certificate regulations. The lawyers have a similar problem. One of my colleagues has suggested that as far as the lawyers are concerned, it is best to put them on the square, but I think that that would be grossly unkind. In the legal arm of the army we can use the lawyer who has to serve his two years&#x2019; articles, and during this time he could surely contribute his services meaningfully. The hon. member for Durban Point referred to the use of accountants for stock control. He made the point more than adequately.</p>

<p>I would like to add three thoughts for the Minister&#x2019;s consideration in the hope that it will further encourage him to start negotiations along the lines that I have suggested.</p>

<p>I believe that the degreed man who goes in for his national service would be far happier doing so in the knowledge that his career will benefit from the practical experience he will gain and from the time he will save, and that he will therefore approach his period of service with enthusiasm, and, Sir, it is a truism that enthusiasm breeds success. I believe, secondly, that we will effect a better utilization of manpower, coupled with a saving of manpower hours, without any loss of efficiency or competence; and finally, I believe sincerely that by negotiation between the Ministry of Defence and the various professional councils in South Africa, we will achieve something from which only good can flow, good for the armed forces, good for the professions and good for South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Umhlanga dealt with training for the most part. I just want to say that the policy of the Defence Force to allow students first to complete their post-school training before commencing their national service, is generally welcomed. I do not want to comment any further on the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. I am glad he did not deal with the Anglo-Boer War all over again, and I do not intend doing it either.</p>

<p>During the past year important strategic changes took place in the policies of certain African states as well as of countries elsewhere in the world. With the wise policy of d&#x00E9;tente the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government achieved a major breakthrough for greater tolerance, greater respect and greater understanding in Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_4567-4568" refersTo="page_0697"/>It is true that South Africa is being placed in the international limelight to an increasing extent. Cognizance is being taken of the real value the Republic of South, Africa has for the free world, and this is being appreciated to an increasing extent. Furthermore, there is our policy of separate development which, along the road of evolution, is in the process of succeeding internally and is enjoying wide interest in Africa and in the Western world. It also commands to an increasing extent the respect of many people in Africa. The progress which South Africa has made and the role it is playing in Africa, is of course not only noticed by the friends of South Africa, but as can be understood, also by the enemies of South Africa and for that reason it is to be expected that hostile action by communists or communist inspired elements will be intensified. The communist does not like to see change taking place through the process of evolution. In any evolusionary progress which takes place in South Africa and Africa he sees a threat to his ideal to bring about change by means of violent revolution. The enemies of South Africa are jealous of the progress which has been made and therefore intensified onslaughts from this quarter can be expected on every imaginable terrain in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister launched a peace offensive in Africa, not out of fear, but from a position of power. To strengthen his hands, we must see to it that our Defence Force is kept strong. There are people in the world who understand only one language and that is the language of force and power. Therefore I say that it is important that the Defence Force of South Africa is kept strong. To be able to act efficiently, we always have to bear in mind three requisites, i.e. the acquisition and provision of equipment, the question of manpower and then, of course, a high standard of training for those men. In a climate of weapon boycotts the hon. the Minister of Defence and his department has seen to it that we are largely self-sufficient today as far as armaments are concerned. We are indeed proud of the achievements of our local armament industry in this regard. South Africa today possesses the most modern weapons in the world. We are grateful that we are living in a country that can afford to appropriate almost R1 000 million for defence. If we consider 1973-&#x2019;74 in retrospect, we find that we spent R472 million on defence in that year, in other words, 2,6% of the gross national product. In 1974-75 the amount was R692 million, or 3,2% of our gross national product. Now, in 1975-76 it is R948 million, or 3,7% of our gross national product. It was mentioned previously that if we add the functions of other bodies such as Armaments Board, Armscor, the Department of Public Works and Community Development, we arrive at an amount of R989 million. The hon. member for Durban Point differs in this respect because he arrives at an amount of R1 010 million. However, I do not want to split hairs about the matter.</p>

<p>You are reading from the White Paper and I am reading from the Budget.</p>

<speech by="#van_heerden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. F. VAN HEERDEN</person>:</from>

<p>I had a look at both. After we have adjourned, we can make some calculations together. The point I want to make is that we are spending 4,1% of our gross national product here. I trust that, at the next Budget, we will be able to spend considerably more than 4% of our gross national product on the safety of all the people of South Africa. It is no use developing a country, and it is no use there being enormous growth, and industrial development in that country if that country is destroyed. Therefore, it is important that we should display this power and have a powerful Defence Force. However, we can have the best weapons one could have, but if we do not have the people to handle them, it serves no purpose. Therefore one is pleased that our men in the Defence Force are particularly well trained. When one comes into contact with these men one is particularly impressed by the enormously high, standard laid down for all the sections of the Defence Force. The potential of the manpower of our Defence Force is increased by the positive motivation of our soldiers. I found it quite striking yesterday when I asked a young man in the State President&#x2019;s guard where they were off to this week and he replied: &#x201C;You know, Sir, we are the first company to have the privilege of doing border service&#x201D;. May it be that all our people are similarly motivated. I would like to ask our parents to decide today that they are also going to make a contribution by imbuing their sons and daughters with, the proper attitude. I am referring now to a willingness to serve South Africa, also in regard to their responsibility concerning <span class="col_4569-4570" refersTo="page_0698"/>the defence of the country.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe the hon. member for De Aar will not take it amiss of me if I do not react to his arguments, seeing that most of what he said was of a non-contentious nature.</p>

<p>As I understood the hon. the Minister of Defence, on different occasions in public and also last year in this House, he laid special emphasis on the fact that we should not make a party political football of defence. In fact, I recall what the previous Minister of Finance, now the State President, said last year when he referred to the fables of Aesop in his Budget Speech, to the story that one should not be too busy working in the field not to attend to the hedge. He used this story to explain that the Defence Force of a country, especially a country like South Africa, should be above suspicion as far as party politics are concerned. I, too, adopt this point of view. It is important that political parties should not try to make petty political capital out of the Defence Force or from Defence Force matters. More important still is that the Defence Force itself, the Defence Force as a whole and even in its smallest subdivision, should not be seen as being involved in party politics. If the Defence Force, even its smallest subdivision, is seen as being involved in party politics, it can have nothing but a dividing effect on our society, on the White society as well as on the White/Black society in South Africa.</p>

<p>I read the White Paper of the hon. the Minister with great interest and must say in all sincerity that it is an excellent piece of work. On the whole one gets a very good impression of the modernization which is taking place in the Defence Force and of the development which is taking place there. An interesting paragraph to me personally is paragraph 87, &#x201C;Civic Guidance&#x201D; under the heading &#x201C;Personnel&#x201D;, where the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because of the importance of civic guidance, it was decided to divorce it from leisure time utilization and to make it an integral part of personnel development. The ideal is to motivate every person in uniform, especially the young national servicemen, and to promote a positive approach to citizenship. Knowledge of subjects such as modern ideological tendencies and world trends, a deeper insight into the problems of Africa, and the part the RSA can play in it, has become vital to every citizen of the State.</block>

<p>Now, this paragraph in particular interested me. I then made enquiries at the department to find out what civic guidance entailed. I must say that they reacted to my request with great courtesy and speed. The instructional guide in connection with civic guidance was made available to me. The guide consists of two volumes compiled by the directorate of Civic Guidance and Leisure Time Utilization. It consists of lectures. I devoted a great deal of time to working through these two volumes and I must say in all sincerity that on the surface the subjects which are covered are ones which one expects people who undergo civic guidance will have to study. In general they are subjects which deal with people&#x2019;s attitude towards citizenship. They are lectures on the preamble to the Constitution Act, on the code of honour of the soldier, on education and citizenship, codes of conduct at flying our national flag, patriotism, our national holidays, etc. In addition there are lectures on ecology, on the Bantu of South Africa, the Coloureds, a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of the world, the necessity of nature conservation, etc., in other words more or less the same as what was mentioned by the hon. member for Umhlanga as aspects of national service and what it all meant. There is also a chapter on the State as political organization, on political parties and elections and by-elections in which the structure of the State is explained. On the surface it looks as though these are essential subjects in a study of civic guidance. However, I regret, having to say that I cannot but draw the conclusion that there is an enormous lack of objectivity, especially in respect of certain subjects. Indeed, it would be possible for me to go so far as to say that the way in which certain subjects are dealt with, especially subjects in connection with the political parties, the Bantu in South Africa and the Coloured population, leaves one no alternative but to draw the conclusion that this guide is prejudiced and, to a certain extent propagandists in favour of the Nationalist Party. [Interjections.] In order to prove this statement I shall read out a few quotations from these documents. If hon. members are of the opinion <span class="col_4571-4572" refersTo="page_0699"/>that I am quoting out of context they may come and read this for themselves. Under the title &#x201C;Political Parties and Policies&#x201D; the following is said on page 50 (paragraph 27)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of the National Party, the party in power in the RSA, concerning this issue &#x2026;</block>

<p>This issue is the issue of race relations and multi-nationality&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is one of separation between the different ethnic groups. Every group is to be given full opportunities towards nation building and national development according to its own desires, character and culture within the borders of its own territory.</block>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. van Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Page 50, volume 2.I continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The basic premise of this policy is to preserve the White South African State for the White nation but at the same time exactly the same rights and opportunities are created for the non-White ethnic groups in their respective homelands&#x2014;opportunities towards complete nationhood and independence.</block>

<p>And then in paragraph 29&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The foundation of this policy of separate development is thus to be found in the acceptance of ethnic diversity in South Africa, as well as the acknowledgment of the unquestioned right of every group to preserve and further its own culture, nationhood and liberty within the boundaries of its own territory or state. Within the framework of this policy a Zulu state, a Sotho state, a Venda state and several others will gradually come into existence.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Now we come to the other parties. I read further (paragraph 30)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the other hand we have the UP and the PP who believe in the bringing about of one common society in one South African State. This policy is based on the assumption that all the different ethnic groups concerned will be prepared to abandon their own identity and right to self-realization in favour of a common loyalty to one multi-racial South African State.</block>

<p>Then the following is said in paragraph 31&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are no intense differences between the UP and the PP &#x2026; [Interjections.] &#x2026;&#x2014;they differ mainly in the tempo and method by which this common society will have to be brought into existence.</block>

<p>Then it becomes a bit more sinister and the following is said in paragraph 32&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If separate development is decided on, we must remember that the execution of this policy asks great sacrifices of each South African. Selfish social and economic gain will have to be given up. The virtues of hard work, self-activity above all, will have to be re-discovered.</block>

<p>Then, however, the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the choice is eventual integration, the concomitant problems and the failed efforts elsewhere in the world should be borne in mind, as well as the violence, spilling of blood and chaos forced integration brought in its wake. Think of the position of the Negro in the USA, the Biafrans in Nigeria, the Watusi in East Africa, the Turks in Cyprus, and the Arabs in Zanzibar &#x2026;</block>

<p>There is a very clear distinction in the approach which is expressed here in respect of the Nationalist Party as a political party and that in respect of the Opposition parties in this House. That is not all. The implication is further that the point of view which is put in favour of the Nationalist Party, is not only the point of view of the Nationalist Party but the point of view of South Africa. I say this, because a little later, on page 62, the following question is put. Under the heading &#x201C;Policies in respect of the Bantu&#x201D; the question is put&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What policies are there for the Whites who rule the areas to follow in respect of the Bantu in the areas&#x003F;</block>

<p>They say there are only two. One, they say, is assimilation and the other is integration. <span class="col_4573-4574" refersTo="page_0700"/>In respect of another little question which seems quite innocent and which reads (page 63)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How does South Africa view the matter&#x003F;</block>

<p>the following answer is given&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa does exactly the opposite of what Portugal does. Because South Africa believes that mixing of the races will lead to unrest, violence and the swallowing up of the Whites, laws have been made to prohibit mixing of Whites and Bantu. South Africa further acknowledges the fact that there are different peoples among the Bantu, the same as among the Europeans there are Germans, Frenchmen, Swedes, etc. South Africa, therefore, set aside separate areas for the Xhosa, Zulu, Tswana, Venda, Shangana-Thonga, Northern and Southern Sotho and Swazi for their own separate development. South Africa has also for some time been busy enlarging the areas (homelands) of these peoples and to develop them economically towards viability.</block>

<p>The next question is: &#x201C;How will this happen&#x003F;&#x201D; The answer is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Whites do not give up ground to the Bantu peoples for their own states, they will have to give the Bantu political rights in an undivided South Africa. And because the Bantu are numerically much stronger than the Whites, there will eventually be more Bantu than Whites in Parliament. Then all laws or Acts separating Whites and Bantu can be repealed, and friction, violence and mixing can be expected.</block>

<p>It will avail the hon. member nothing to try to create mistrust in respect of these lectures, because the youth who come to the army to do national service, have all the newspapers at their disposal. They get the Progressive Party&#x2019;s newspapers as well, because these are also in the reading rooms. They are quite intelligent enough to make their own choice. In the discussion of these matters, they are completely prepared to express an opinion themselves on what is true and what is not true. That is an objective view and I say that a soldier who is not motivated to fight for South Africa and a soldier who is not purposeful, does not have a hope of helping to establish an effective Defence Force. The hon. member can decide which one of the two he wants. He can decide whether he wants to adhere to his first congratulation or whether he wants to question our methods. As long as this Government is in office, we shall continue with these methods.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlanga made an outstanding speech in this House and I want to congratulate him on it.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to tell him that I shall go into the matter and that I shall see what can be done to carry out his suggestions, if they have not been carried out already. I am informed that in respect of certain categories of professions, such as the engineering profession, the practice is already being applied.</p>

<p>*I have been informed that in 1974, 19 engineers with B.Sc. degrees and one with a diploma reported for national service. In the July intake, there were ten with degrees and one with a diploma. In 1975, there were 16 with degrees as against six with diplomas and in the July intake 11 with degrees as against nine with diplomas. They are being used in a professional capacity and the S.A. Council for Professional Engineers is already giving recognition to such people. If this does not happen in respect of other professions, I think it is something that ought to happen. I want to thank the hon. member for his positive approach.</p>

<p><span class="col_4575-4576" refersTo="page_0701"/>Perhaps I should begin with a few general statements. Before I come to these, there are two matters which I want to rectify immediately. I have much appreciation for the hon. member for Durban Point when he philosophizes as he did on defence policy. I like listening to him. But he can never resist the temptation to call the administration of the Department of Defence in question or express misgivings in regard to it. Let me mention two examples. Apparently the hon. member has suddenly heard somewhere about the ship <i>Tafelberg</i> and that there is something which ought to be investigated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I put a question about it as long ago as 1972.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The fact of the matter is that the <i>Tafelberg</i> was bought at a price of R1 100 000. Then there were conversion costs of R1 290 000. The cost of the major repair work which had to be done, was R1 780 000, while the cost of anticorrosion maintenance came to R450 000. That gives a total of R4 625 000 which the <i>Tafelberg</i> has cost us so far.</p>

<p>However, the <i>Tafelberg</i> is not just a tanker as the hon. member alleges. It is far more than a tanker. It has been converted so that it can serve as a supply ship. Therefore, it is far more than just a tanker. The <i>Tafelberg</i> transports fuel and diesel oil, carries ammunition, provisions and water. In this way there are various services which it renders. If we were to buy a new ship of the size of the <i>Tafelberg</i> today, it would cost us R31,5 million, according to our latest calculations. That is what it would cost us to replace the <i>Tafelberg</i> with a new ship. It is true that we do have a new <i>Tafelberg</i> in mind for which we have included in our future programme, but now is not the right time for that. Since we have been able to buy, convert and maintained the <i>Tafelberg</i> up till now for R4,5 million, I think this was a far better business transaction than it would have been to have spent R31,5 million on a new ship, as my hon. friend has suggested.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>How much would it cost to buy a good secondhand tanker and convert it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>You have heard what it costs. We now have such a ship which we can maintain. Even if we spend another R2 million on it, this would only give a total of R6 million, which is far from R31,5 million. I do not know why we should buy another tanker if we already have one which we have converted. The hon. member should not pay any attention to gossip. He should obtain his information either at my office or at the office of the Chief of the Defence Force. Then he will not fall into such traps.</p>

<p>I want to give a second example of the sort of thing he is now saying. The hon. member says he has heard of large scale resignations of senior staff members at Atlas. What are the facts&#x003F; Atlas was a private industry. Then the State decided to make Atlas a subsidiary of the Armaments Development Corporation by means of shares. Of course, like any aircraft industry, Atlas had its growing pains. Through the services of people which we have obtained for the management and the board of directors, we have, however, succeeded in getting a board of directors and a management in charge of Atlas which is amongt the best in the country. I want to mention two examples in this connection. I want to mention the chairman of Atlas, namely Dr. Wim de Villiers, whose competence will surely not be doubted by any hon. member in this House. There is also Dr. Knoll, who is a member of the board of directors. He plays a major role in Seifsa. He is one of our major industrialists. We also have a general manager of outstanding calibre at Atlas. As a result of efficiency studies made on Atlas&#x2019;s instructions and effectivity processes which it introduced and with which I was involved and concerning which I have been fully informed by these prominent people, Atlas reached a point where they were able to attain greater efficiency and productivity while reducing their staff. Now is that wrong&#x003F; In the second place, they found positions in the Armscor group for those of their staff whom they could use elsewhere. They also got rid of the incompetent people in a fair way. That is only right.</p>

<p>We discharged far more than 43. I want to tell the hon. member that this parliament passed an Act in which certain provisions were laid down unanimously by this Parliament. Those provisions which we laid down, stipulated how a person who felt that he had been unjustly treated in Atlas&#x2019;s services, should deal with the situation. Under those provisions, <span class="col_4577-4578" refersTo="page_0702"/>he could take steps in terms of the Act to obtain justice. He need not run to the hon. member for Durban Point. Those provisions were laid down in that Act by this Parliament. I am surprised that the hon. member pays any heed to one or two people who tattle to him. He should have advised them to make use of the machinery which this Parliament has created. The hon. member helped to create that machinery. Today Atlas is an efficient organization. I am not saying this on the basis of my own observations. I am saying this on the basis of the opinions of experts whom we have brought here from abroad. I do not want to mention any names. They are distinguished experts who hold positions of leadership in the aircraft industry of various countries. They congratulated us on the efficiency at Atlas. We would not have been able to succeed in speeding up the programme and building the Impala II, which we now have in the air&#x2014;which the Chief of the Air Force was able to announce the other day&#x2014;and in reaching this ad-advanced stage, unless there was efficiency at Atlas. Nor would we have been able to conclude other contracts with other manufacturers which will result in even more sophisticated aircraft for South Africa. The hon. member must not make statements of this kind which are not based on facts. I do not take offence if he has real criticism. It is his right. However, he must not make statements prejudicial to establishments of this nature. Atlas&#x2019;s reputation, in particular, should be treated very carefully, because Atlas has to negotiate with foreign bodies. If the hon. member creates this impression through irresponsible statements which he makes here, then he harms Atlas and South Africa. What the hon. member said there is not true and I have to reprimand him. Such behaviour does not become him.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for South Coast apparently did not read what was stated in the White Paper at all. He did not read what was in the brochure of the Armaments Board at all. According to him, there is no training in the defence Force context or in the defence set-up. Sir, we are spending R500 000 annually on class fees for higher technical training at technical colleges, but this hon. member states here that no training is taking place. We should send him to a technical college.</p>

<p>Or to a preparatory school. What is more. Sir, we have agreements. Special measures are adopted for training people for the Air Force. We are giving people special training for the Army and for the Navy. Hon. members should go and see what we are doing here at Wingfield, then they need not have day dreams like the hon. member for South Coast. Sir, at Atlas we are training at least between 800 and 1 000 young men every year. We have wonderful hostels there; we have wonderful training establishments there. We are busy rendering a service to South Africa, for not all those people remain there. Why do we not emphasize these positive things, instead of standing here and unburdening themselves of trivialities which have neither sense nor direction. In spite of the fact that we all profess to agree to the amount which is being made available for the defence of South Africa, I regret to say that false notes have been heard in South Africa from individuals and from certain bodies who wanted to kick up a tremendous fuss about the billion rands which is being spent on defence. If we look at the latest summary, viz. that of 1973, of the <i>Military Balance</i>, a U.S.A. publication, then we find that Israel spends $1 310 <i>per capita</i> of the population on defence, the U.S.A. $377, Russia $134, the United Kingdom $155, the Netherlands $156, Australia $144, France $162, and the Republic of South Africa $28. In the light of these figures it is surely not right to try to create the impression that such a tremendous amount is being spent on defence in South Africa. The defence expenditure in South Africa as a percentage of the total State budget, places South Africa virtually at the bottom of this list. In other words, there is no truth in the allegation that South Africa spends excessively on its defence.</p>

<p>I shall come in a moment to the use of national servicemen. But in the first place, I want to say that there is proper control. The person who says that there is no proper control in the Defence Force, is talking nonsense. In a large organization such as the Defence Force, mistakes may creep in, and the Controller and Auditor-General may point out a slight discrepancy here or there, but in general, there is complete control over the utilization of funds and supplies. That is a statement which the hon. member cannot dispute. It is wrong to bring the country under the impression that there is no control. I say it is wrong, because proper control measures in the Defence Force are placed under close scrutiny. I want to point out one aspect of the defence Budget, viz. the large increase under item R as compared to item S. I should like to say a word about this, because there should be no misunderstanding about this, about the enormous amount which now appears under R, in contrast to what it was previously under S. In terms of Act No. 8 of 1952, an account for the purchase of special defence equipment was established. The aim of the account was basically to make funds available for the purchase of principal arms equipment as needed and when available. The allocation of funds for this purpose appeared under item R. With the establishment of the Armaments Board in 1964, the funds were systematically provided under item S to enable this board to carry out its functions, and funds were placed on item R for maintenance purposes. With the view to greater efficiency and more effective financial control, the Treasury recommended that the funds be centralized into one account, viz. the Special Defence Account. At the same time an authorizing committee was established which consists of the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Finance, the Chief of the S.A. Defence Force, the president of the Armaments Board and the Controller of the S.A. Defence Force, who, with his whole staff, maintains control over this matter and who is subject to continual auditing to control expenditure from the Special Defence Account in terms of the provisions of the Act. In other words, there is efficiency as a result of legislation which was passed here in 1974, and steps have been taken to see that there is control on the part of the Treasury, the Defence Force and the Armaments Board.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further and referred to the question of salaries. Sir, I have the figures here and I am prepared to let the hon. members have them. I should not like to make salaries of members of the Defence Force known in public. However, I want to say this, that fantastic improvements have been made in all ranks as far as salaries and remuneration are concerned. The hon. member has a large part of the information on the Citizen Force and the commandos before him, and he knows that we do not like publishing this, but that there have been tremendous improvements. He knows that in the Permanent Force we have not only introduced large scale improvements in the salaries, but large scale improvements in the (pension benefits as well. We have decided recently to effect parity between the Defence Force and the Police from 1 April of this year in respect of pension benefits. I think it is wrong to create the impression the hon. member tried to create, viz. that we do look after the interests of these people.</p>

<p>That was not my argument.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member will look at the Defence Budget, he will see that the increase in salaries and wages amounts to R27 million, rations and clothes are R35 million and labour saving devices R2&#x00BD; million. Therefore the individual and his interests are being looked after. I have here a long summary of what we are doing to acquire single and married quarters. Therefore we are looking after people&#x2019;s interests. Although we cannot do everything overnight, nevertheless I think that we have already made great progress.</p>

<p>In this connection, I should like to raise another point as well. Among some members of the public, the impression exists that, if the Government endeavours to bring about d&#x00E9;tente and relaxation of tension, as the Government is in fact doing now under the effective leadership of the Prime Minister, they can now sit back and almost <span class="col_4581-4582" refersTo="page_0704"/>neglect the country&#x2019;s defence. However, I want to make the statement today that there is no contradiction in a policy of relaxation of tension, on the one hand, and the establishment of deterrents in the defence of one&#x2019;s country, on the other hand. The ratio and relationship between all these things is sound. That is why the State President said in his opening address to Parliament at the beginning of the year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the same time the Government is aware that it is in the interests of South Africa to be able to defend its territorial integrity at all times and a state of readiness is therefore being systematically maintained and constantly improved. The South African Defence Force is now better prepared for the defence of our country than ever before, and our military organization is less dependent on out-resources. Research, development and production are proceeding on a carefully planned basis.</block>

<p>I should like to quote another witness, and I do not think that anyone can doubt the importance of this witness. I refer to the speech made by the Secretary for Defence of the United States of America on 5 February 1975. It provides one with much insight to read what he said in this connection. He refers to falacious arguments which people have previously employed in connection with defence in America, and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">More recently illusions somewhat similar to those of the fifties regarding deterrents, have emerged about d&#x00E9;tente. Only, d&#x00E9;tente exercises an even more powerful magic since it is believed, somehow, to obviate the need for both deterrent and defence. But we should make no mistake about it&#x2014;there is no conflict among d&#x00E9;tente, deterrent and defence. They are inexplicably bound up with one another in the maintenance of equilibrium of power.</block>

<p>I offer that for the consideration of hon. members. What applies here and what is the judgment of Mr. Schlesinger&#x2014;speaking for the particular position of the United States&#x2014;can be applied to South Africa in much the same way, although on a smaller scale, viz. that d&#x00E9;tente, the ability to establish deterrents, and the defence of one&#x2019;s country are very closely connected with one another in an equilibrium in regard to other states. I am quoting this because I can think of nothing better as an answer to those people who want to sit back and abolish the Defence Force the moment the peace bells ring. In the world of today, that is foolish.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to a few other matters. The hon. member for Durban Point asked what we are doing to overcome the manpower shortage. Surely there is no organization in South Africa today which does not have a shortage of trained manpower. What have we done in this regard&#x003F; In the first place, we have begun to use women on a large scale in posts where we were able to dispense with men. We have begun to train women as officers in various directions where they could replace men&#x2014; in the Navy, in the Air Force and in the Army. There are a few hundred of them today who are filling posts which would otherwise had to be filled by men, and we are continuing with this. In the second place, we have begun, to a greater extent to make use of the Coloured population on a voluntary basis. We have been successful in this. The training ship <i>S.A.S Protea</i> is manned by Coloureds. The crew was trained in Scotland. They behaved themselves so well that the commander of the ship told me that he could not have expected better behaviour from anybody. Furthermore, we also restored the Cape Coloured Corps to its full status. I have held out the prospect that our minesweepers should be manned by Coloureds. Consequently we have also made a start with that. The minesweeper <i>Walvis Bay</i> has recently been provided with a crew of which a large proportion are Coloureds. They are doing excellent work.</p>

<p>That brings me to the matter about which I also want to say a few words this afternoon before I give hon. members another chance. I want to make the position very clear so that there should be no doubt as to how we are going to utilize our non-Whites, i.e. Coloureds, Indians and Bantu, in a defence force context. If there is one thing through which we can cause unrest to be unleashed in this country, it is the start the starting of agitations in regard to this matter. I amended the Schedule to the Defence Act recently, with the help of other hon. members, and I am grateful for that. In one of the Sunday newspapers I notice that some stupid little girl or other decided to write something about <span class="col_4583-4584" refersTo="page_0705"/>that. She knows absolutely nothing about defence, but now she has to blow her own trumpet about this thing which is being removed from our Defence Act for the first time now. So what&#x003F; It has been removed. In regard to matters such as these we should be careful. Members of the Coloured community are being trained by means of a system of voluntary national service within the content of the Cape Corps. They can advance to the rank of non-commissioned officer, to warrant officer, and at present a number of officers are also being trained, who will receive their commissions soon. As I have said, some of them are already in service on the <i>Protea</i> and on the <i>Walvis Bay.</i> The same, we hope, will eventually apply to the Indian Corps with which a start has been made. As far as Bantu are concerned, I want to say that one cannot decide today that one is going to use Bantu in the Defence Force and find tomorrow that one no longer has them, in exactly the same way as one cannot do this with any other population group. First of all a start has to be made with the training of instructors, with which we have accordingly begun. We are doing this thoroughly. Within the Defence Force content in the territory of White South Africa a support service corps will be established in which Bantu will be able to advance to the rank of warrant officer. They will be used for guard duties and other auxiliary duties. The present casual utilization of Bantu will take shape more clearly within this support service corps. Bantu sections will be added to certain commandos&#x2014;and I am not prepared to say which commandos&#x2014;with the help of those commandos. This has been approved by the Cabinet, and therefore, what I am announcing here, is Government policy.</p>

<p>Then the homelands remain. There must not be any doubt about them either. To begin a Defence Force for any country and to maintain it, is an expensive transaction. It would be wrong of the homelands to spend all their money or utilize it arbitrarily for the establishment or maintenance of Defence Forces. This should happen gradually. There are some of our homeland leaders who are eager to let their peoples play a part in the safeguarding of South Africa&#x2019;s borders, and that should be appreciated. Therefore a start will be made with a home guard in the homelands concerned, after proper consultations with, them have taken place. The idea which I have&#x2014; it can still be changed&#x2014;is that we should begin with small units which, are used at ceremonial occasions and can serve as small infantry units. At the same time they can be trained to perform military engineering operations. In other words, they can make a positive contribution to development. For some time, this will have to be done under White officers, because it is not child&#x2019;s play to train non-White officers. In this regard I also want to say that proper agreements will have to be concluded when these Black states become independent, agreements in connection with fundamental matters such as overflying rights, anti-communistic action and protection of their own territories against offering possible access to South Africa for hostiles. These will be laid down when those homelands become independent. I am happy to be able to say that as far as the Transkei is concerned, consultations have already taken place between the Chief Minister and the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of the Army. In this connection I should like to read a letter which the Chief Minister wrote to the Commissioner-General as recently as 10.4.74. In this letter, the following is said:</p>

<block name="quote">My Government has the honour and pleasure to thank the Government of the Republic for having consented to establish a Transkeian military unit manned by Transkeian citizens in preparation for the contemplated independence of the area. My Government discussed the terms on which training will be done with Admiral Biermann and General Malan and is in full agreement with the Admiral&#x2019;s proposals. The statement I made this afternoon in the Assembly was well received and acclaimed by members on both sides of the House. Please convey these sentiments to your Government.</block>

<p>In other words, we are liaising with this Government in a responsible way. This must take place gradually, and I am stating here in public that it is my firm conviction that when these homelands are established in their full character, it will be imperative for Southern Africa that they will occupy a position within the military milieu of the Republic of South Africa and not outside the military milieu of the Republic of South Africa. These are the things which are causing us to move in this direction. I hope that in this regard we shall convey a spirit of unanimity throughout the country, and that party-political capital will not <span class="col_4585-4586" refersTo="page_0706"/>be made from this, because these matters are delicate. I do not say that it will be done by members of this House, but there are people in this country who will take advantage of anything. We can do this in a responsible, sensible and gradual way and we can do so in such a way that we shall give added strength to the security of the whole of Southern Africa. I hope that we will obtain co-operation. Finally, I want to advocate that the implementation of this matter&#x2014;except for the principles which I have laid down&#x2014;should rather be left in the hands of experienced Defence Force people themselves because they are people who know how to apply it without causing friction and tension. I think that I have said enough as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>Then I come to another question. I think that it was the hon. member for Cradock who put questions to me on this specific matter. In the past, tremendously high discharge fees have applied to members of the Permanent Force who wanted to buy their discharges. As hon. members know, I cannot give the full particulars here. I have a long list here and it would bore hon. members. The amounts which certain members of the Permanent Force had to pay to be able to resign, were in some cases as much as R4 400. The Rieckert Committee, which investigated this matter at the special request of the Cabinet, recommended certain changes. It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Cabinet has approved the recommendations of the Rieckert Committee. Consequently, the different and diverse scales of discharge fees which are applicable at the moment, are being done away with. The highest scale will now be R200. Compared with the discharge fee for privates at the moment, the proposed amendments will create a far more realistic state of affairs, which will be comparable with the position of members of the S.A. Police. It is expected that the new scale will stimulate the recruitment campaign of the Defence Force to a very great extent and will also result in apprentices and artisans who are deterred by the present high discharge fees, will be more inclined to join the Defence Force.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In conclusion I want to say, that there are other points with which I shall deal later. We went out of our way to provide hon. members with the White Paper and with the brochure on the Armaments Board which appeared after the 10th, birthday of the board. I believe that with that information which we have made available, we have replied to a great extent to most of the questions in hon. members&#x2019; minds. After this debate has been concluded tomorrow, I shall also have every hon. member&#x2019;s speech scrutinized and if there are any questions to which, I have not replied, I shall do so&#x2014;as I usually do&#x2014;by writing to the hon. members concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the attitude of the hon. the Minister that he will furnish written replies at the end of the discussion of his Vote to any outstanding questions. But I want to say that I found the initial reaction of the hon. the Minister to the various extracts I quoted here disturbing, to say the least. The implication of what the hon. Minister said, i.e., that he accepted every word I quoted as the truth, is simply that there is no need for party politics and political quarrels in South, Africa. The implication is that that side of the House has already furnished the full answer and that we on this side are merely an addendum which is here for the pleasure of hon. members. I presume that this is the implication of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s point of view. But then I want to go further and ask the hon.

<p>&#x2026; and that their policy will lead to bloodshed. It is a question of party political differences. It is a question of political persuasion and not a fact. I want to say that I have no objection in principle to civic guidance. I have no objection either to people being given lectures or that lectures on various aspects of the social sciences are given on rather delicate subjects such as racial relationships, or the Bantu or Coloureds. As a matter of fact, I have attended lectures at the military academy at Saldanha myself and I was impressed by the variety of people who went there to give lectures. But where it is made the ideal to &#x201C;motivate every person in uniform, especially the young serviceman, to cultivate a positive approach towards citizenship&#x201D; and this is the information he is furnished with, what must a young man whose sympathies lie with the Opposition, feel like when he enters the Defence Force and this kind of information is furnished to him as factual&#x003F; What must he feel like when he is told that the policies in which, he believes and which he practises in a peaceful and quite legal, democratic way in the political life of South Africa, are nonsensical and may lead to bloodshed&#x003F; What must he feel like when he is blatantly told that the Government has the right or a realistic policy, that the Government should be supported and that criticism of the Government may in effect also mean that one takes part in subversion and undermining&#x003F; I can well believe that the hon. Minister himself has said that he does not accept it either. He has even said in this House that he appreciates criticism, and that he appreciates it when the Opposition puts its point of view, but now the hon. Minister says that is not so, and that one is not allowed to put one&#x2019;s point of view.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Is the Progressive Party an opposition party in South Africa which criticizes the policy of the Government&#x003F; Is the Progressive Party a party which adopts the attitude in the South African politics that we do not <span class="col_4589-4590" refersTo="page_0708"/>support separate development and that we do not believe that a solution can be found for the political problems of South Africa, by establishing separate states as is being envisaged by the Government&#x003F; If so, we and our children and our young people have the right to participate in an unbiased manner in the Defence Force of South Africa. We should not be subject to a situation where we have to accept that what is being advocated is the truth, and that no criticism may be expressed. Therefore I say again that I am not against the principle of civic guidance. As a matter of fact, I think the hon. Minister can make use of a wide variety of experts to assist with the compilation of lectures of this nature. I say this because I am aware of the problems of objectivity especially in the social sciences and because I am aware that it may arouse feelings, that it may excite and annoy people if they have to read about or listen to delicate human matters from only one point of view. Therefore I say that if there has to be civic guidance, there should be control in some way or other as regards the kind of lectures given about race relationships or group relationships in South Africa. I want to say in passing that hon. members can also read what is said about the Bantu. Not one word is said about the urban Bantu. What is being said about the Bantu, seems to me to be rather old fashioned. As far as the Coloureds are concerned, all that is said is that it is the ideal to work for one&#x2019;s own people, that the Coloureds are a people in the making that will eventually have to become a nation. That is what is being said about the Coloureds. But that is a political controversy and not a fact. As I have said, I want to prevent at all costs that it be suggested that political controversies become part of the training in the Defence Force. If this happens, it will be impossible to discuss defence matters in this House on a basis of consensus, as has been said by the hon. member for Bloemfontein West.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it was too good to be true that the hon. member for Rondebosch should have started his first speech in this discussion by saying that he agreed with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s approach and that we should keep politics out of the Defence Force. He saw fit to raise two aspects of civic guidance here today and, in fact, to display his entire party&#x2019;s negative approach to national preparedness with regard to this matter.</p>

<p>The first issue he seized on was the fact that the National Party Government is dealt with in detail in this instructional guide. I say &#x201C;National Party Government&#x201D; because the National Party governs this country. The National Party Government&#x2019;s policy has been dealt with in detail.

Is that not true&#x003F; Has the hon. member completed his revision of his party&#x2019;s colour policy&#x003F; [Interjections.] The Slabbert Commission is still sitting and it may be that the recommendations of the Slabbert Commission will be changed on the basis of negotiations with the Reformists. In other words, he does not know what his policy is. But that does not matter. On the one hand one has a party that has been governing the country for 27 years and that is giving specific content to a way of life in this country. That is Government policy. The Government of the day may expound it in this way. [Interjections.] I challenge that hon. member to show us one instance of incorrect reporting of Government policy in-this document. We are giving content to it in such a way that any other upstart party such as the one sitting before me, if they were ever to come to power, would not, in any event, change the position.</p>

<p>There is another aspect. I refer to the second matter he raised in regard to subversion. I must honestly say that I do not understand his argument.</p>

<p>On page 34 of this instructional guide we find the heading &#x201C;The Threat to Spiritual Preparedness with special reference to Subversion&#x201D;. The &#x201C;subversion&#x201D; is defined as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subversion is the purposive process of breaking down a nation&#x2019;s preparedness.</block>

<p>What is wrong with that&#x003F; There are other headings, too, but the specific heading to which the hon. member for Rondebosch referred appears on page 34. In paragraph 6 on page 34 they state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Action on this level is aimed at obtaining control of an organization.</block>

<p>Is there anything wrong with that&#x003F; Surely that is penetration; that is what subversion is. It is infiltration and penetration, to such an extent that they are able to undermine at a later stage. The guide continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The encouragement of and support for policies opposed to those of the Government.</block>

<p>Is that not correct&#x003F; However that is not to say that it is necessarily the Progressive Party&#x2019;s policy. These are general statements. However, the analogy and the statement inferred from this by the hon. member for Rondebosch, viz. that democracy is subversive, are not in here. Where are they in this book&#x003F; They are not here. Will the hon. member show me where this is stated in this guide&#x003F; It is a well-known <i>modus operandi</i> of Communism to penetrate existing organizations and parties and undermine them from within, and not only parties, but churches and University Christian Movements, etc., as well. That is not a secret in this country. If the hon. members of that party think we are so na&#x00EF;ve as to be unable to see this or not to have analysed this in the finest detail at this stage, then they should rather make way for others in this Parliament.</p>

On Saturday he lost his way somewhere between the church and the Parade, but fortunately one of the other hon. members assisted him in time. Probably he fell out of his &#x201C;pram&#x201D;.

<block name="quote">Concentration on splinter groups and extremists through whom the subversive cause may be furthered.</block>

<p>That is one of the acknowledged methods of Communism. What is wrong with what is stated on page 34 in regard to the Government plan&#x003F; There is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>I had wanted to discuss other matters in the short time I have to speak under this Vote, but now I have virtually no time left for that. I want to tell the hon. member for Rondebosch that my knowledge of Communism&#x2014;I, too, know a little about it&#x2014;and my knowledge of subversion, the training I have had in this regard and the research I have carried out, compel me to say that I can find no fault whatsoever with any of these statements.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that party as it sits there has a negative outlook towards the Nationalist Government&#x2019;s entire defence programme. It does not want South Africa to have a Defence Force that can defend it at all times and at all places against any attacker. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>In the last few minutes at my disposal I should like to discuss the involvement of our people in our national defence programme as a whole, in our national preparedness as a whole. If a people thinks that it can leave the defence of its country to its Minister of Defence, to the Chief of the Defence Force and to the soldiers and the national servicemen, then that people&#x2019;s cause is already lost. It has been proved on innumerable occasions that an army must have a people behind it, a people with the will that that army should win and which is with that army in spirit in pursuing the struggle. Sir, it has been proved on innumerable occasions that a passive, unmotivated people that is weary <span class="col_4593-4594" refersTo="page_0710"/>of life is unable to inspire an army in any way. I think that in the week that is past we were able to take cognizance of this once again. I want to plead that in our approach to national service&#x2014;those of us who have completed our national service and those of us who will probably not become involved in national service again, and here I have in mind parents, teachers and clergymen and politicians, too&#x2014;should at all times positively motivate our national servicemen or those who are still to perform their national service, those who are undergoing training and those who are doing border service. I think that in the first place, we should consider staying in constant contact with the men in the camps and on the border, or wherever they may be, through correspondence, through gift parcels and through radio messages. In the second place, if one has a chance meeting with a national serviceman in uniform one can tell him, &#x201C;Man, I am proud of you; I am proud to see you wearing this uniform.&#x201D; Or we can give them a friendly wave as we drive past, or we could even give him a lift if we feel that we can take him safely to his destination. I wonder whether it is not time for our existing women&#x2019;s organizations to consider forming a section in their respective organizations to see to this aspect and in particular, too, to see to the families and particularly the wives and children of men doing border service.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. D. PALM</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I think the hon. member for Waterkloof reacted very effectively to the statements and allegations made here by the hon. member for Rondebosch. I want to add that the hon. member for Durban Point should stop being so sensitive now when the word &#x201C;patriotism&#x201D; is used. Last week I used the word in another debate and tried to provide him with a definition of what we understand by the word &#x201C;patriotism&#x201D;. It has a much broader meaning than just the one meaning of taking up arms for one&#x2019;s country. The hon. member had better go and read that definition again and be less sensitive when we use the word. Sir, a short time ago the hon. the Minister rightly said that there are people in this country who say that this money that is being spent on defence could have been used to much better effect. The hon. member for Hillbrow said this too. Sir, it is true. We could have used the money to better effect if there had only been doves in the world and not hawks as well. Unfortunately, there are people who look without seeing and who hear without listening and who do not want to see the hawks that are looking at South Africa with avaricious eyes. I could not emphasize this better than by quoting just one short sentence from page 4 of the White Paper, in which we are told&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We could survive defeat in other spheres, such as diplomacy and economy, but our first defeat in the military sphere would also be our last.</block>

<p>That is why it has been necessary for us to spend large sums on defence in recent years and that, too, is why we are requesting a large sum for defence this year, because a strong defence force is a guarantee of security, security for those of us who live within the borders of our country, but security and peace for Southern Africa too, because I am sure that if South Africa had not built up a strong defence force over the years, then we should undoubtedly have found in the past that some militant political adventurer would have tried to carry out some kind of raid on South Africa. In the second place, Sir, it was also stated here very clearly, yesterday and the day before, that our defence force is a vital factor in the effort of our Government to normalize the situation in Southern Africa, because with this strong defence force we tell the world, with the hon. the Prime Minister, that what he is trying to do, he is not doing from a position of weakness or of fear, but from a position of strength.</p>

<p>Sir, whereas Parliament is being asked to vote an amount of almost R1 000 million for defence, permit me, too, to discuss for a moment the man who heads this organization, the man on whom rests the final and ultimate responsibility for the secure protection of South Africa against outside enemies. Sir, I am not going to use flattery. When I discuss the political head of this department, then I do so with sincerity because he has been at the head of this department for nine years already, and I think it is time for South Africa to take note with gratitude of his share in establishing the Defence Force as we know it today Sir, in the political head of our Defence Force we have a balanced man of integrity, a disciplined, religious South African and in addition, a man who does not know the meaning of fear. For years, Sir, a task of persuasion has been <span class="col_4595-4596" refersTo="page_0711"/>performed by this head of the Defence Force, or by the military chiefs in consultation with the political head of this department. To convince South Africa, and they have succeeded in convincing everyone in South Africa that for the purposes of our defence we must stand together in what he describes as a total strategy.</p>

<p>In this regard we were also grateful to hear yesterday, through the hon. member for Piketberg and other hon. members, of the partnership that exists between the State and the private sector. Sir, the hon. member for Rondebosch dealt the department a backhanded blow and maintained, indirectly perhaps, that politics had been dragged into the Defence Force. I think we can say that the political head of our Defence Force has never introduced party politics into the Defence Force, but that through his objectives, ideals and loyal actions he has made the Defence Force in South Africa a unifying force, rather than a divisive factor. Consequently I think we owe him our sincere thanks. Large sums of money are being requested here, Sir, but this, too, I want to say of this man: He has never been alarmist. He has often told us that we should be aware of danger; that we should not sit back and think that there are no problems, but he has never yet sounded the alarm. He has never yet misled his voters. He has never yet tried to present to us a false picture of security, but nor has he ever hesitated to talk to us frankly and emphatically when it has been necessary to do so.</p>

<p>Sir, I was on the Parade last Saturday when soldiers of the various population groups were marching there. The hon. the Minister has been as good as his word in that he wants to involve the other population groups, too, in our Defence Force in order to give them, too, a chance to assist in the defence of South Africa. I am grateful to be able to support this. I am pleased that he is involving the various population groups in our national security in a dynamic and meaningful way.</p>

<p>Earlier this afternoon, Sir, reference was made to the conditions of service of our Defence Force. Why, Sir, do we have a happy Defence Force&#x003F; In my opinion one of the major causes, apart from others I have mentioned, is that the political head of this department has played his part through the years in improving the conditions of service and housing and other facilities of our men in the defence force.</p>

<p>There is another point which I find important and I should be much obliged if the hon. the Minister could say something more about this in his reply to us tomorrow. It concerns civil defence. The idea of civil defence originated with him. I really think that it is time for an appeal to be made to all our local authorities to display a greater degree of motivation in this regard because civil defence is very important in these times we are living in. Sir, we know the national service system. It was not his creation, but this fine section of our defence force has been developed under his guidance and initiative. During his national service, every young man is not only given military training and trained to deal with an emergency, should one arise, but may also learn true citizenship, even though the hon. member for Rondebosch thinks that we are expounding party politics to the young man.</p>

<p>To conclude, I want to say that in the Armaments Organization we have a fine organization. What would we in South Africa have done without that organization and its subsidiaries&#x003F; Again I want to say that in my opinion, South Africa can also say to this political head of our defence force that we are grateful and proud of what he has done in this regard and of what that organization is today. To conclude, therefore, I want to say this. I think that we, as the House of Assembly, will unanimously say to the hon. the Minister: Take this money you are asking, use it, and by so doing give South Africa a steadily growing security policy. It is the prayer of all of us that this war machine that is being built up will never have to be set in operation, but we also want to say that the world must know, and our enemies must know, that if our security were to be threatened, if there were to be anyone so foolish as to seek military confrontation with us, South Africa stands united to fight to the last drop of blood for the security of its children.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there has been a lot of talk about what a Defence Force does in times of emergency and what is required of it in order to defend us, but right at the outset I would like to express thanks to the services for what they have done when South Africa has been faced with natural disasters in times of peace and when they have contributed in order to make our lot <span class="col_4597-4598" refersTo="page_0712"/>an easier one. I think that contribution should not be overlooked, even though obviously it is not the major function of our defence forces.</p>

<p>Sir, those of us who sit in these benches often talk about bringing about changes in South Africa, but we believe that change in South Africa must be brought about by peaceful means and constitutional means, and we also believe that you can only bring about changes in South Africa if actually you are strong and you are able to control the situation and to bring about changes at a time when you are speaking and operating from strength. For that reason we have no difficulty whatsoever in saying not only that we believe in the defence of South Africa from the point of view of ordinary South Africans who want their country to be defended, but that it is absolutely vital to the future of South Africa, not only for the protection of our physical being, but to enable us to change our society into the form in which we want it, for us to be militarily strong. One of the factors which I think is overlooked is that if you wish to enjoy the benefits of your society and if you wish to enjoy the benefits of peace which a defence force of strength gives to you, then you are also obliged to help to maintain that peace and to help in the defence of your country.</p>

<p>I think that is a factor which perhaps should be pointed out, that you cannot just enjoy the benefits of peace and of protection; you must also in fact help to maintain it and make your contribution towards it. Whereas we have due regard for the religious and other conscientious problems in regard to killing that certain individuals may have, we have no doubt that there is an obligation on every citizen who wishes to enjoy peace in South Africa to contribute towards its continuance. We also believe that all races should, participate in the defence of South Africa, and we are obviously pleased to hear some of the things which the hon. the Minister has said. We have a difficulty with him, which is a political difficulty and which <b>I</b> think affects us in so far as the structure of defence is concerned, because we believe that if you have a common South Africanism as opposed to the concept of different nations in South Africa, the feeling of belonging and the feeling of wishing to defend your country would be much easier to engender in all the races in South Africa.</p>

<p>This is a political difference we have, but I think it is one which is real and which arises by reason of the philosophical beliefs of the Nationalist Party. I think also that one must accept that defence of one&#x2019;s country, as has been demonstrated around the world, is not just a question of military force, but that you must have a situation in the community where people have a stake in the community and where they are willing to defend and have something to defend. That is often as vital as arms themselves. If anything has demonstrated that recently, it has been the war in South Vietnam, where it was quite clearly demonstrated that unless your people and your troops have morale, unless you have a local population that feels strongly about your cause, you cannot wage a successful modern type of war against the type of activity which might be launched against us in Southern Africa</p>

<p>Lastly, on this issue I should like to raise the point which has been raised across the floor of this House often, and that is that defence should not be a matter upon which the community is divided. Remarks which tend to show that one or other political party is less willing to defend South Africa, is less willing to contribute, and is in fact less loyal, not only harm that political party in the eyes of those who believe those remarks, but actually do harm to South Africa in that it tends to portray a divided people in respect of an issue where we have to demonstrate that we are in fact not divided. Sir, I think this is fundamental; it is not a matter on which we can afford to be divided.</p>

<p>One of the issues on which there is criticism, and very real criticism, in this House is the amount expended on defence. Anybody who queries that amount is criticised. Let me say that as far as I am concerned, I believe that you must spend money on defence, as I think I have indicated clearly in my speech, but I believe that everyone in this House agrees that we would all prefer not to spend this money on defence. We would prefer not to have to do it, but the question is whether we have a choice. Unfortunately I have come to the conclusion, as no doubt the hon. the Minister and other people have, that we have no choice but to spend it, and this is the tragedy of the situation in which we find ourselves. But I think we must know what are the implications of spending this large sum of money on defence, as we are obliged to do. Sir, defence <span class="col_4599-4600" refersTo="page_0713"/>in itself is not an object. Defence is a mechanism which is designed to protect our existence and our way of life and our society. It is designed to protect something; it is not an object in itself. It is purely designed to protect what we have. Sir, guns before butter is not an acceptable philosophy of life. What is necessary is guns to protect our butter, to protect our way of life. Rut the gun in itself is not an aim or an object. It is the preservation and the advancement of our society, the preservation of our economy and of our way of life, which is the priority and not, as the hon. the Minister of Finance said, defence in itself. Defence is merely something to protect the priorities that we should have. The other implication we cannot avoid is that expenditure on defence is, unfortunately, inflationary. We only need to look at the Middle East for example, to show what happens when you have to spend too much money on defence. If defence expenditure is not productive, in the economic sense of the word it is, in fact, inflationary and, when the State is obliged to spend money on non-productive activities, one is obliged to produce more in other respects to counter inflation. The challenge to South Africa as a result of this need for high defence expenditure, is that we have to become more productive. We have to compensate for this if inflation is not to become a serious problem. We need only look at the situation in Israel where the high defence expenditure is accompanied by a high rate of inflation. We, however, do not have the advantage of money and aid flowing into our country as happens there. The lesson we must learn is that we must in fact produce more in other fields if we are not going to find ourselves in a serious inflationary position.</p>

<p>Many of us&#x2014;I think all of us&#x2014;would prefer not to spend this money in a way which is non-productive. However, we have to do. We must also remember that the day will come when we no longer will have to spend this money. Then we can look back on the fact that this year&#x2019;s expenditure alone would have paid for Sasol 2. Interest alone at ordinary rates on this amount would have paid for the whole of the Bantu Education Vote. We know that we have to pay a tremendous price for our protection and for the need that we have to be vigilant. What we have to do, in addition to spending money, is that we have to create a situation, not only in South Africa but in Africa as such, where in the years that lie ahead, this expenditure will become unnecessary and can be avoided. One of the things we must do here is to look at the relationship between ourselves and the other African States in order to endeavour, through negotiations and discussions, to create a situation where none of us in Africa, particularly in Southern Africa, need to arm at the rate at which we are now obliged to arm. Certainly we should agree that foreign military presences must be excluded from Africa by consent. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have no fault to find with the statement of the hon. member for Yeoville that &#x201C;people cannot enjoy the benefits of peace unless they contribute to it&#x201D;. Actually I think it is a laudable statement the hon. member made. He referred to the question of the homelands where there seems to be some kind of understanding between his party and the homelands that those homelands, when they have no part in the defence of our country, would be hostile towards the Republic of South Africa. The very statement I want to make is that these people will in fact have a part in the defence of the country, as the hon. Prime Minister, too has clearly stated here. After all, they are part of the community of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the situation in Vietnam. I think Vietnam has taught us in South Africa that we should not rely on the possible or potential aid of the Great Powers. The Opposition always kicks up a row about the question that we apparently have nobody in the world who supports us. There we now have conclusive proof of the fact that we cannot rely on any nation in rest of the world, for here a fine country and a fine people have been left in the lurch. I do not know whether the statement the hon. member made with regard to the large amounts in respect of the expenditure on defence and with regard to inflation, is correct. The hon. member apparently meant that the heavy expenditure on defence would supposedly contribute to the inflationary trend in our economy. I want to ask the hon. member whether he does not want to see that the amounts reflected in the Budget for defence boost and stimulate our industries at a time when there is a slumping trend in our economy. One must take into account the stimulating effect expenditure on defence has on our industries. It does have an effect, for I read somewhere in our English-language Press <span class="col_4601-4602" refersTo="page_0714"/>of &#x201C;the nourishing effect of the Budget, especially with regard to defence&#x201D;. With these words I want to drop the hon. member&#x2019;s speech.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Durban Point. He made certain statements on a previous occasion, and repeated them in this debate, with regard to the armaments Board. The hon. member referred to the visit we had paid to the Castle. On such occasions one can hardly fail to notice the hon. member, for he is big to look at and he talks of big things. He described the visit as a &#x201C;public relations exercise&#x201D;. He wanted &#x201C;some lifting of the blanket&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I cannot understand what the hon. member means. What does he want to see under the blanket&#x003F; Does he want the Armaments Board to reveal its secrets&#x003F; To me personally, this visit was an education, and I was hoping to hear some constructive criticism from that hon. member this afternoon. The hon. member for Rondebosch in referring to criticism said that the governing party did not like criticism.</p>

<p>*If there is one thing which is appreciated by the governing party and the hon. the Minister of Defence, it is constructive criticism. The criticism of hon. members on the opposite side, however, is always of a kind which has a destructive effect. It is under the blanket. On a previous occasion the hon. member for Durban Point raised objections to the army unit established in the Transkei. I wish to quote the hon. member correctly. He spoke of a &#x201C;foreign military force&#x201D;. He also referred to the &#x201C;vast stretch of coastline&#x201D; of the Transkei. He had all sorts of misgivings about the training of soldiers in the Transkei. He said they had to be integrated with our own &#x201C;uniform force&#x201D; and that we should have a &#x201C;unified defence system&#x201D;. A small Defence Force is being established for the Transkei on a small scale, as was explained here by the hon. the Minister. This forms part of and is one of the consequences of the policy of the National Party for the development of the homelands. Does the hon. member have any objection to a Defence Force of Lesotho, Swaziland or Botswana, which one can almost say form part of our South African household&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Surely it is very clear that there will be integration. However, I do not want to go into this matter any further.</p>

<p>Now I should like to confine myself to a certain matter in consequence of a speech made by the hon. the Minister of Defence at the opening of the Legislative Assembly in Kavango, in which he gave us an indication of what the plan was specifically with regard to the foundations which had been laid for the establishment of a local Defence Force in Kavango. I should just like to refer to certain aspects to which the hon. the Minister referred. He referred to the education of the young people there, and he inspired the people to send their children to the schools. This is another of the splendid results of the policy of the Government; educational matters in Kavango have been stimulated and the parents take an intense interest in the training of their children. There is, of course, no comparison whatsoever between the amounts which are being spent on education today and which were spent on it when the United Party was in power. Today this is the foundation we are laying with future development in mind, for without education, the expansion of the intellectual scope of the non-White populations, one cannot make any headway. After all, this is the basis of our access to the intellectual world of the non-White populations in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Now we come to what the hon. the Minister said about the integration of certain aspects of the army with the agricultural activities of Kavango. I want to express my sincere appreciation of the attitude adopted by the hon. the Minister in this regard. The Defence Force is accommodated in the local economy and this is a splendid example of the further development of a spirit of goodwill towards that non-White population. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Etosha mentioned that it appeared as if the Opposition was keen on looking underneath the blanket, but I do not think that he should blame the Opposition for looking underneath the blanket. It is quite surprising to see some of the things that we have discovered underneath the blanket. I say this not in <span class="col_4603-4604" refersTo="page_0715"/>the sense that these things have been tucked away deliberately, but in the sense that there are things underneath the blanket which do need exposing. Many of the things that the Opposition has exposed from time to time, have been rectified by this Government in turn. We therefore have a duty to look underneath the blanket.</p>

The matter that I want to deal with on this Vote is the question of the Commandos. If one looks at the Estimates of Expenditure, under sub-head P on page 19, one will find that the subsidy or other financial assistance for the ensuing year which will be granted to Commando units, far from being increased, has in fact been decreased for this financial year from the sum of R760 500 down to the sum of R696 500.</p>

<p>I am referring to the item &#x201C;Commandos&#x201D; under sub-head P which, appears on page 19 of the Estimates of Expenditure. This sub-head refers to subsidies, grants-in-aid and financial assistance. In respect of the Commandos the amount which is asked for totals R696 500. Related expenditure under the items &#x201C;Citizen Force&#x201D; and &#x201C;Air Commandos&#x201D;, which appears under the same sub-head, shows an increase on the amount which was voted last year. I believe that some form of explanation should be forthcoming from the hon. the Minister because this gives the impression that the Commando units are being discriminated against. The hon. the Minister shakes his head. I hope that this is not the case.</p>

<p>The White Paper on Defence which was tabled recently stressed the necessity for particular attention to be given to vigilance and readiness. I quote from page 7 of the White Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Particular attention is given to vigilance and readiness with a view to obviating or nipping in the bud any crises sparked off by aggressive incidents. This entails, <i>inter alia,</i> the pre-positioning of adequate forces, ordinance and stores &#x2026;</block>

<p>The pre-positioning of adequate forces includes the maintaining and the building up of an effective, highly-trained and resolute Commando force, a structure which, is in being throughout the length and breadth of the Republic at present. Commando units together with specially allocated Citizen Force units form a part of our counterinsurgency force and they function also as support and back-up units to the S.A. Police. They are geared to take an active role in regard to the assistance to local authorities when necessary in the event of a disaster. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that this role is vital to the whole concept of civil defence. According to the White Paper the Commando units still consist of a large percentage of volunteers. The hope is expressed that these volunteers will continue to stay on in these units and it is stated that people who have completed their national service in Commando units will be encouraged to continue in those units. It is also interesting to learn that the department has a desire to extend the membership of the Commando units to include women in a non-combatant capacity. I believe that these fervent hopes of the Department of Defence <span class="col_4605-4606" refersTo="page_0716"/>will prove a dream if proper and adequate financial provision is not made to enable such dreams to become realities. It is in the sphere of finance, I believe, that this Government has not given proper consideration to Commando units. Take for instance the provision of accommodation for Commando units. From the very nature of the function of these Commando units and their formation, the members of these units are drawn from large geographical areas, making them dissimilar from Citizen Force units which in the main are drawn from urban areas. Frequently the companies which form the Commando units are themselves drawn from geographically circumscribed areas. A centrally situated headquarters is established for the Commando units because it is vital that the operation of the units be given some form of cohesion. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what arrangements have been made at the various headquarters of Commando units for suitable accommodation.</p>

<p>I know that most of the Citizen Force units have suitable accommodation such as parade grounds, proper office accommodation, orderly rooms, equipment stores and mess facilities, but I believe that in many cases the Commando units have to share the accommodation at the discretion of the Citizen Force units. To my mind this is a very unfortunate situation. It is unfortunate because it gives a feeling of inferiority to the Commando units and it does little to engender a spirit of individuality and the <i>esprit de corps</i> which it is so necessary to build up in these units. Furthermore, I believe that far-flung companies of Commando units which are sometimes more than 100 km away from their headquarters should receive special consideration. Frequently they have to operate under the most difficult circumstances. They invariably have to use accommodation which is made available to them from peculiar sources, accommodation such as houses and so on which they then have to use for training, lectures and paper exercises. Very often they have to borrow halls for this purpose. I believe it is unthinkable for us to expect those company units to go to their Commando unit headquarters for this type of exercise. I believe that the proper provision of permanent accommodation for such company activity under these special circumstances&#x2014;I emphasize that these are special circumstances&#x2014;should be provided by the department or otherwise by the Minister prevailing upon those colleagues of his in the Cabinet who are able to provide such accommodation. I am aware of the fact that the hon. the Minister has called upon local authorities to assist in this regard but I honestly do not believe that that request for assistance has been met. I believe we all understand that local authorities have financial difficulties, particularly in this tight economic period we are going through, and I do not believe that they have been successful in providing the necessary accommodation. Suitable ground in local areas is invariably available and I believe that proper accommodation can be erected at a minimum of expense. It is in such surroundings that I believe a proper <i>esprit de corps</i> amongst the members of the Commando units can be built up. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in his speech here the hon. member for Yeoville made the statement that it would be to no-one&#x2019;s benefit to imply or maintain that the Opposition parties were not co-operating with the Government in regard to defence matters. In the course of my speech I shall deal forcefully with that statement. Permit me to say that in South Africa, it is in the interests of all the people in the country that this Government should continue to act from a position of strength. The hon. member for Yeoville, too, referred to this. This position of strength is based on a strong economy, on military preparedness and on political stability based on sound race relations, racial peace and race harmony in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it is also based on a strong National Party that gives effect to everything I have mentioned.</p>

<p>In the nature of the circumstances, the South African Defence Force plays a key role in the military situation. The high degree of preparedness that exists in regard to training, discipline and morale is thanks to the dedication of those outstanding men who wear the uniform of the Defence Force of the Republic of South Africa with such dignity and loyalty, and I am referring to all the members of the Defence Force, from the humblest private right up to the highest officer. I should like to take this opportunity of felling them that we praise them for that and that we love them and <span class="col_4607-4608" refersTo="page_0717"/>that we should like to give them the assurance that we pray for them too.</p>

<p>As regards the striking power of the Defence Force itself, which depends on its being provided constantly with the most modern and effective armament, Armscor and the Armaments Board and their subsidiaries play a key role too. The members of these organizations perform their task without fuss or bother, virtually unnoticed and in silence, so that for the most part, the public is not even aware of the existence of these organizations, that have the mighty task of keeping the wheels of the Defence Force rolling. Consequently we should like to convey our sincere gratitude to Prof. Samuels, director of Armscor, to his general manager, Mr. Dekker, and to the general manager of the Armaments Board, Mr. Lutsch, for their dedication and zeal in the interests of South Africa and its people.</p>

<p>At the start I said that the basis on which our stability rests is the sound ethnic relationships throughout the structure of our society in South Africa. Racial peace and harmony are at the heart of it. It is of no avail for the Opposition to say that they co-operate with the Government in regard to defence affairs when they are, in fact, undermining the basis of our position of strength. In this regard I am not referring to the references made to our Defence Budget by the hon. member for Hillbrow. Nor am I referring to the utterances of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout two years ago concerning the so-called budget of fear. No, I am drawing attention to the fact that our entire relationship with Africa, and the averting of confrontation and war, will, in the final analysis, determine the course of history in Africa and that this is intimately bound up with racial peace and harmony in South Africa. It is in regard to this very point that one gets the impression that the Opposition wants to make things as difficult as possible for the Government in this field. There is an almost obscene urge among certain propagandists of the Opposition to create a feeling of unhappiness, oppression and injustice among the non-Whites in the important field of human relationships.</p>

<p>What is also important for the maintenance of peace is sensitive relations situations where attitudes are of immeasurable importance. It can also mean the difference between peace with Africa on the one hand, or war with Africa on the other.</p>

<p>Here, too, the Opposition creates the impression that they regard this as a suitable sphere in which they may carry out their destructive actions most effectively.</p>

<p>At this stage I do not want to put it more strongly than that, except to say that in contrast to what would be the case in more favourable and safer times, this behaviour on the part of the Opposition is becoming ever more dangerous and injurious to the security of the country. However, this still does not afford the Opposition any hope that they will thereby boost their prestige among the electorate. Let me say that co-operation in regard to peace also signifies co-operation in the hope that it will never be necessary to mobilize the Defence Force. It is therefore rather meaningless to say that one assists in maintaining and even enhancing the preparedness of the Defence Force when one is not assisting in promoting the basic elements of peace, particularly if one&#x2019;s aim is peace and not war. This is precisely what South Africa&#x2019;s aim is as regards its Defence Force, viz. to ensure peace for South Africa and its people.</p>

<p>We may now consider the many issues which today&#x2014;in conjunction with the Government&#x2019;s d&#x00E9;tente politics, with the aim, <i>inter alia,</i> of averting confrontation and war in Africa&#x2014;are a subject of discussion between the Central Government and the emergent administrative institutions that are being created for the Black and Brown people under this Government. As I have said, these issues are being dealt with in conjunction with the Government&#x2019;s d&#x00E9;tente politics in Africa, with the aim, <i>inter alia,</i> of averting war and confrontation. Where, and in what respect, have the Opposition parties played a significant role in these processes&#x003F; Where have they made a contribution&#x003F; If such instances exist, they are totally insignificant or minor as opposed to the situation in which opportunities, discussions and negotiations are constantly bedevilled and poisoned by virtue of propaganda wars waged by the Opposition which could be the precursor of an eventual shooting war in Africa.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE V. MORRISON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of personal explanation to clear up a misunderstanding that may have arisen as a result of an altercation between the hon. member for East London City and myself yesterday afternoon across the floor of the House. In his speech, the hon. member quoted me as having said in an earlier speech more or less the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The problems that this country is facing now are partly the result of this country&#x2019;s participation in the last war &#x2026;</block>

<p>By way of interjection I denied that I had said anything of the sort, a denial by which I still stand. Unfortunately, my interjected denial evoked interjections from all sides of the House and in the resultant noise I did not hear the hon. member continue, according to his Hansard, with the following words attributed to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and those who took part in that war should talk in softer terms of their part in it.</block>

<p>I interjected a second and a third time that I had said nothing of the sort. After having perused the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard, I believe that my second and third denial may conceivably be construed in such a way that I also had denied having used words to the effect that those who took part in that war Should talk in softer tones of their part in it. This is not the case. I believe that these words are a fair reflection of what I had actually said in my earlier speech.</p>

<p>I wish to assure the Committee that it was not my intention or purpose to deny the second part of the statement attributed to me by the hon. member. Had his remarks been audible to me I would certainly not have reiterated my denial a second and a third time. My denial therefore referred to the first part of his remarks and not to the second part made after my first interjection. I wish to apologize for any embarrassment caused by this unfortunate misunderstanding.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the debate was adjourned last evening, the hon. member for Parys had for some ten minutes been dealing with the need for discipline in our Armed Forces. He had stressed the fact that they play a key role and that what was necessary was an <i>esprit de corps</i> as well as hitting power. He also said that they played a key role as far as race relations were concerned.</p>

<p>I hope that you will allow me today to pay tribute to a Citizen Force battalion which will be celebrating its 90th anniversary tomorrow. Its record shows that all the factors that are called for in the Defence Force have been present over the years as far as this Active Citizen Force unit is concerned. I refer to the Cape Town Highlanders who tomorrow, 24 April, will be celebrating their 90th anniversary. The year 1885 was the year in which this House first assembled in these buildings and the year in which the Cape railway first reached Kimberley. It was also in that year that the Cape Town Highlanders were recognized as a battalion. They have been a remarkable unit because they have epitomized not only a regard for the highest Scottish traditions but also a regiment that has been served faithfully by South Africans of both language groups. It has always been a puzzle to me how so many &#x201C;Vans&#x201D;&#x2014;Van der Menves, Van Hoogstratens and so forth <span class="col_4611-4612" refersTo="page_0719"/>&#x2014;have been able to serve with so many Murrays, McLachlans and McGregors in harmony in the fighting forces. I can only assume that the typical Scot in his kilt in the early days could not resist the pretty faces of the &#x201C;Afrikaanse blommetjies&#x201D; and equally, that the South African girls could not resist the appeal of the Scottish infantryman in his kilt. In saying this I do not suggest, as was suggested earlier, that anything should be looked for under the blanket!</p>

<p>I should like to quote a reference in the <i>Cape Town Highlanders Record</i> made by the editor, Mr. Orpen, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No other kilted regiment in South Africa and indeed few regiments of any kind in the S.A. Defence Force can boast a fighting record in World War 2 to equal that of this illustrious battalion to whose distinguished record South Africans of both language groups, united in a spirit of service unsurpassed in the Army of the Republic, have contributed selflessly and nobly.</block>

<p>I think too that this hon. House should listen to the words of Lt.-Gen. C. A. Fraser, General Officer Commanding the Joint Combat Forces in 1970, who wrote of this regiment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the story of how the Cape Town Highlanders have continued throughout the decades to add lustre to their earliest distinctions. What a tale it is. What a history of dedicated service and glorious fighting. Their motto, that of the kings of Scotland: <i>Nemo me impune laecesset</i> &#x2014;&#x201C;No one provokes me with impunity&#x201D; &#x2014;is apt. My own recollections of this regiment in the First South African Division and in the Sixth South African Armoured Division are of quiet, efficient professionalism, all the more noteworthy since they were not professional soldiers, of bold and effective patrolling, an <i>esprit de corps</i> that was second to none and of fierce, heroic fighting. I remember them particularly, as will many others, at Gazala, El Alamein, Casino and Monte Sole. These battles were among the toughest fought by our South Africans in the Second World War and the Cape Town Highlanders fought as toughly and were as dauntless and contributed as greatly as any in those great divisions. They bought their glory dearly, but, oh, they were magnificent! A proud heritage indeed and it is in safe keeping.</block>

<p>On behalf of the Cape Town Highlanders I also want to pay tribute to the hon. Minister for the assistance he gave them in ensuring that they will continue to wear the traditional kilt on ceremonial occasions. The last Budget made provision for some R10 000, which they have already received, and this year I understand that they will be granted R6 000, for which they are deeply grateful.</p>

<p>I also want to pay tribute to the Navy for the part it has played in ensuring that our sporting regattas take place faultlessly and successfully in our off-shore waters. I want to refer particularly to the Cape-to-Rio Race which, has already been held on two occasions and which will again be held starting on 10 January of next year. All of us in this House are aware that without the sea there would have been no South, Africa. Some 25 000 ships pass our coastline each year of which more than 12 000 call in at our ports. On behalf of the sportsmen concerned I want to pay a great tribute to the Navy for having made the guard-ship available, and for making it available, to ensure that this ocean-racing classic which brings sportsmen from all over the world to our coast, the Cape-to-Rio Race, will continue. It is a tribute that cannot be overstressed.</p>

<p>I think it is only fitting that I should pay tribute to our new submariners in our naval force. Only recently members of the defence groups in this House had the honour of being escorted through the naval establishment at Simonstown. We realized there that here we have a new breed of South Africans, South Africans who have become the watchdog of our seas, who display an incredible heroism, an incredible dedication to their country. These are men who suffer incredible hardships and tremendous loneliness in the coastal patrols that they undertake. It is gratifying, Sir, to see that there is to be added to the fleet of submarines an additional number which will make them a more effective fighting force. For this we can only express our gratitude, and I hope that all South Africans will remember that these men are South Africans in the truest tradition.</p>

<p>Then I also want to make reference to <i>Paratus,</i> the journal of the forces to which I referred last year. This journal continues to play a tremendously important role in <span class="col_4613-4614" refersTo="page_0720"/>maintaining the <i>esprit de corps</i> of all South Africans in the forces. I want to express the hope that this journal will be distributed much more widely to all our universities, to the parents of our serving members, to our colleges and to our youth organizations. When one follows the articles in this journal, one really feels proud to be a South African and to be able to serve in the forces.</p>

<p>Sir, I come now to the question of civil defence. The vote this year has been increased from R561 000 to R713 000 approximately. I compliment the Minister on having made additional provision for further civilian defences. Sir, never before in the long and colourful history of our country has there been a more pressing and urgent need for our civilian defences to be maintained up to the hilt. When we reflect on the capitulation of the Portuguese in Mozambique and Angola, when we bear in mind the pressures upon the civilians living in the northern territories of Rhodesia, and when we learn of the anguish of those who were involved in the withdrawals from South Vietnam and Cambodia, then we may not and must not be found wanting in our own state of civilian preparedness. Sir, military aspects apart, there have been numerous occasions during recent years when the need for civilian preparedness has been only too manifest. We have experienced many national disasters such as earthquakes, floods, train and ship disasters, droughts, civil uprisings, agricultural pests such as locusts and foot and mouth disease, and still fresh in our memory is the recent disaster at Sasol. I believe, Sir, that it is necessary for all South Africans to appreciate what is implied in civil defence. I quote briefly the aims as set out in section 2(1) of the Civil Defence Act of 1966&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In order to take measures for the purposes of (a) providing the Republic and its inhabitants in a state of emergency with the greatest possible measure of attention and assistance and (to) combating in the most effective manner civilian disruption during a state of emergency.</block>

<p>It then goes on to set out the Minister&#x2019;s powers. Sir, I appeal to the hon. the Minister to give this House the fullest possible information in order that not only we tout all local authorities may increase their present state of preparedness. I realize that the responsibility for civil defence rests mainly on local authorities. It is mainly the responsibility of civilian authorities in liaison with those officers at defence headquarters to whom various tasks in this connection are assigned and, of course, in liaison with the South African Police. I believe that our local commando system must be closely integrated with civilian defence as well. But, Sir, I believe that the operative word in this case is preparedness. When one thinks of the national disasters that have taken place merely through a lapse in preparedness on the part of those responsible &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. B. UNGERER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the course of the debates on Defence Affairs that have been conducted this session, there were certain things that I found striking. I am sorry the hon. member for Houghton is not present this afternoon. During the Second Reading debate she blatantly insisted that expenditure on Defence should rather have been devoted to housing and the building of schools, as usual for the non-White section of the population. I should like to ask her the question whether this is her advice to Israel, too, because Israel is a case analagous to South Africa. I should like her to reply to that. The drift of a certain part of the speech by the hon. member for Yeoville was almost the same. He adopted the standpoint that by means of d&#x00E9;tente, we in South Africa should create a situation in which it would not be necessary to incur further Defence expenditure. It seems to me that these people suffer from a total lack of realism, because do they learn nothing from history&#x003F; History teaches us time and again that in every era, on every continent, every civilization worth mentioning&#x2014;and South Africa is the only civilization worth mentioning on the continent of Africa&#x2014;has always been bolstered and supported by military power. This in spite of the fact that the National Party&#x2019;s apartheid policy was not followed in those countries or in those civilizations. As I say, history repeatedly teaches us this lesson. But now they want to picture to themselves a Utopian situation, a situation in Africa in which the white lamb and the black and the red lion will live together in peace. To use the Prime Minister&#x2019;s idiom, it is an idea too ridiculous to speculate about. I want to leave it at that.</p>

<p>Today I want to discuss a factor in the S.A. Defence Force which, until fairly recently, was probably very much neglected. I want to discuss the place of women in the S.A. Defence Force. This factor definitely <span class="col_4615-4616" refersTo="page_0721"/>deserves more attention. In his speech in this House yesterday the hon. the Minister referred to this in passing and I want to say here and now that I am grateful that he has taken upon himself the task of rectifying this situation. It has worried me for a long time that in countries like China and Russia with their teeming millions, women should be incorporated in their Defence Forces, whereas in South Africa, with its critical shortage of White manpower, literally nothing was done in this regard in the past. Israel, which, as I have already said, is an analagous case, apparently makes use of women in its Defence Force on a large scale. Already, through the centuries and throughout our entire history, South African women have proved that they are prepared to play and are capable of playing an active part in every phase of the evolution of South Africa. At the time when we were pioneers they were often, without having any choice in the matter, actively involved in military defence actions. I think that we could even say that on occasion their military involvement was possibly decisive in preventing the evolution of <b>South</b> Africa from being brought to a sudden and tragic end. Thereafter we had a period in which the women provided the men of South Africa with moral support only. Even in the darkest hours of our history the South African woman has been the one who has inspired the man to fight through to the end for what was his and for his cause. But there was little question of actual military involvement. During World War I, for the first time, women were actually incorporated in the Defence Force again. During this period they were employed exclusively as nurses. But only a small number of women&#x2014;382&#x2014;were employed in the Defence Force. During World War II the number of nurses rose to 4 000, while 21 000 women were employed permanently by the Defence Force in other capacities and 65 000 women in temporary capacities performed valuable replacement service in order to free men for active service. After the Second World War our nurses remained in uniform, whereas only a small number of women remained in the Defence Force in civil capacities as clerks and typists. Here again I want to address a special word of thanks to the hon. the Minister for his wise decision to involve women more actively in the S.A. Defence Force. It is necessary for this to be done now, before a war obliges us to take such a step. Owing to this wise step the place of the woman in the S.A. Defence Force is being decided and prepared in an orderly fashion. At the beginning of 1971 the first intake of women took place at the Civil Defence College at George. The aim of the course is the development of their leadership potential, and consequently they undergo a rigorous process of selection. In particular, they are taught to provide leadership and to organize in emergency situations, to drive and maintain vehicles and to be able to do everything in regard to fire prevention and firefighting and a great many other tasks as well. Consequently, her background training makes her eminently suitable to be considered for inclusion in the S.A. Defence Force. Those who do not join the S.A. Defence Force can, of course, play a particularly valuable role in times of emergency in the civil defence services of the communities they belong to. They can play a pioneering role in regard to civil defence&#x2014;there need be no doubt about that &#x2014;because they have the necessary training and background. The first course ended at the end of 1971 and was completed by 132 women. Nowadays, graduated and professional women are taken directly into the Defence Force and undergo a shortened orientation course of six weeks at the various centres where women are trained for the various sections of the Defence Force.</p>

<p>At this stage there are already 325 female officers and 571 female other ranks in the Defence Force. A conservative estimate&#x2014;I say &#x201C;conservative&#x201D; because the standpoint is adopted that in conditions of active warfare, women must never move within sight of the enemy&#x2014;has indicated that the South African Defence Force can employ 4 500 women very profitably in present circumstances, 312 of them in professional posts. These figures constitute a statistically significant percentage but it would not be advisable to mention the percentage. I should like to mention as a matter of interest the tasks performed by the women. In the capacity of officer they serve as administrative officers, supply officers, training officers, catering officers&#x2014;who could do that better than a woman&#x003F;&#x2014;as signal officers, flight control officers and as tactical data operators and in nursing capacities. The other ranks serve as clerks, supply clerks, telecommunication operators, apprentice draughtswomen, information clerks, sport and physical training clerks, programmers, nurses and drivers of vehicles. I want to congratulate and thank the hon. the Minister and the Government once again for <span class="col_4617-4618" refersTo="page_0722"/>the fact that our daughters, too, are already being involved in semi-military activities at school in a cadet capacity. This can only have the effect of making them more useful to the S.A. Defence Force at an early stage and this, although we do not hope so, may be very necessary. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to continue along these lines.</p>

<p>It is my considered opinion that the South African woman, who is now being well trained and prepared for her task, will and can in the future, as in the far distant past, play a decisive role in the securing and defence of our fatherland, if necessary.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Sasolburg made an interesting speech on the role the women of South Africa is at present playing in the South African Defence Force. Furthermore, he stretched in an interesting manner the role women played in the past, and he also indicated what he had in mind for the future. I shall not go so far as to say that there should be a national service system for women, but I think the hon. Minister may consider the possibility of a voluntary national service for carefully selected women in South Africa. I think women should play a much more important role in the defence of their country.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Durban Point, the Opposition spokesman on defence, made what I would call three very valid points. He has said that it is necessary as an antidote for attacks on South Africa and criticism of South Africa that we should have an outward-moving foreign policy as opposed, obviously, to an isolationist policy. Then he said that he believes it is essential that South Africa should enjoy the loyalty of all people living within the borders of the Republic as opposed to separate loyalties&#x2014;an argument which we have heard often enough in this House and on which I am not going to elaborate this afternoon. It is our standpoint that a common loyalty is better than separate, individual loyalties. Then, in the third leg of his argument he made the point that in order to discourage any possible aggression that military preparedness of the Defence Force is necessary as opposed to being caught napping.</p>

<p>This afternoon I want to deal briefly with the question of military preparedness. As I see the question of military prepared ness, it means in our particular case the existence of a standing army, navy and air force. By world standards our Defence Force is limited in numbers and is, admittedly, small, but it can be efficient, can be well-run and it can enjoy excellent conditions of service. I believe that the conditions of service in all three the arms of our Defence Force have improved over the last few years. The Republic is renowned for having resourceful and determined leaders and I believe that the top echelons of our Defence Force today show just the same resourceful and determined leadership as we have had in the past.</p>

<p>It is of course a necessity that our standing Defence Force should be adequately armed. For it to be adequately armed, we have to be able to get arms from overseas and we have to establish an armaments factory of our own which can provide us with arms for internal use. Thus then, the standing Defence Force, is the backbone of our Defence Force but it is also the basis for the training of our army in mobilization, the people in mobilization, the people who are undergoing national service. The national serviceman today is going to be the army of tomorrow. In the last war South Africa was caught unprepared for war because of many reasons, on which it is not necessary to elaborate. South Africa came on to a war-time basis at very short notice indeed. Today this is no longer the case. Our soldiers of the future have been trained for a number of years in national service. Therefore I say that national service is a mobilization of our nation in stages. What concerns me most is the way it is being operated. Young people are called up to do national service and they must be willing and enthusiastic participants in national service. They must not be sullen and they must not be reluctant to do the obligation of national service. For this to be the case, I think it is necessary, first of all, that they should be placed in the right unit where there talents can be employed most usefully. Then it is also necessary that they should be kept busy at all times during their national service because as we all know idle hands can lead to all types of things.</p>

<p><span class="col_4619-4620" refersTo="page_0723"/>It is this particular point that I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. As a result of policies which have been pursued for a long period of time in South Africa, our young men when they are called up to do national service come from different backgrounds, from separate schools and from different religious and social environments. In fact, the first time that they come together as South Africans is when they are called upon to do national service at the age of 18, 19 or 20 years. They are thrown together in circumstances which constitute traumatic experiences for many of them. Others emerge from these experiences as enriched South Africans. It nevertheless is a fact that this is the first time that these young South Africans from both language groups come together and meet each other as South Africans. As I have said, it is a traumatic experience for many, because some of them fail the test and some of them come out of the national service programme as embittered South Africans, embittered towards South Africans of another language group. There are others who are enriched by this experience and these become broader-minded and more mature South Africans.</p>

<p>I maintain that this system is employed too late. The hon. the Minister has to give consideration to bringing South Africans together at an earlier stage than the national service stage. I am one of those who regret to a large extent the falling into disuse of the cadet system, I think that if further attention can be given&#x2014;particularly during the high school years&#x2014;to bringing South Africans together in preparation for the national service which they will have to do together at a later stage, it will be in the interest of all of us in South Africa. I think the period of getting to know each other should start at least at the beginning of high school. Nevertheless, the national service system is better late than never.</p>

<p>It is a necessary experience for every South African and that is why I particularly want to refer the hon. the Minister to the question of deferment for university students. I believe all South Africans should do their national service as soon as they leave school and before they go to university. What arguments are advanced in favour of deferment for university students&#x003F; First of all, the argument is advanced that there is a shortage of doctors, engineers and other professional classes. I do not know whether that is altogether an argument that holds water, but I shall deal with it in a minute. A second argument that is used is that if you do not defer national service in respect of some of the students, you will have an enormous number of what is known as the &#x201C;leadership group&#x201D; in the January intake and not enough in the middle of the year. I believe that that is not a valid argument. If the Minister and the university authorities co-operate in this matter, there is no reason why there should not be two intakes of students so that a student can study for six months and be taken in in the July intake and that he can be given credit when he has completed his national service of, say, 12 months, 18 months or 24 months, for the six months he has studied. Co-operation by the universities is, I think, very important and I am not by any means satisfied that there is the co-operation that there should be between the universities in South Africa and the Defence Force. There are thousands of young people in our universities at the moment who would like to switch over to medicine or engineering who, because they did not get first-class passes or a couple of distinctions are considered by the university authorities as not suitable as engineers or doctors. My experience, at any rate, is that most of the general practitioners I have had anything to do with, have been people who had second-class passes at school. Yet they make the best general practitioners. However, the tendency seems to be that unless one gets a first-class pass with a couple of A&#x2019;s, one is not considered a fit and proper person to become a doctor. There is another reason why I am against deferment for university students. I think the hon. the Minister would be doing the students concerned a favour if he were to insist that they should do their military service before going to university. The reason I want to advance for this argument is that, having done their military service, they would be more adult, mature and responsible people, they would be more worldly-wise and they would be far better South Africans than many of them are at universities at the moment. We would then probably not have the same difficulty and trouble that we have been experiencing at universities over a period of years.</p>

<p>There is another category of people who, I believe, must not be forgotten. I refer to the people who did not have the opportunity of doing their national service, people who were not involved in the national service scheme at all because of their age.</p>

<p><span class="col_4621-4622" refersTo="page_0724"/>Somehow or other they must be brought in to play their part in the defence of South Africa. Reference has been made to the role of women and I support any suggestion whereby a limited national service scheme can be put into operation in terms of which women can be utilized at least in auxiliary military services and paramilitary services. I think there are also others in South Africa at the moment who have had experience of guerilla warfare on our borders and who have come to live in South Africa permanently. I would like the hon. the Minister to give some consideration to making use of their experience and talents, perhaps in a special battalion. There is a last category of people whom I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I refer to the children of immigrants. The stories one hears of the number of immigrants in South Africa who never register as South African citizens and whose children for some reason or other appear, according to the stories, to escape the net of military service, are alarming. I do not believe that that is in the interest of either our country or the children concerned. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to hear the hon. member for Simonstown speaking, particularly because he comes up with positive ideas which one would like to support. What he had to say concerning the cadet system and the training of young men before they undergo their university training are decidedly things which one can support. This only emphasizes once again the very strange situation one finds in the United Party today. Yesterday, for example, we had the hon. member for Durban Point who endorses the defence expenditure. This, of course, is in glaring contrast to the standpoint of the hon. member for Hillbrow. That hon. member made a speech in which he spoke about 100 tractors instead of one tank, and it cannot reason away the fact that he does not agree with, but objects to, the expenditure of these funds on defence. This kind of public behaviour is reprehensible. In my opinion it can be described as political opportunism. We have also heard the standpoints of the Progressive Party and the Reform Party. The Progressive Party has not told us again in this debate how they feel about the amount being spent on defence. During the Second Reading debate, however, the hon. member for Johannesburg North and the hon. member for Houghton very clearly intimated that they did not agree with the expenditure of this sum.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Rondebosch started an argument with us and was very angry because we were supposedly bringing politics into the Defence Force. However, what has the hon. member and his party done but made a political football of the Defence Force and dragged in the Defence Force by campaigning against the amount we want to spend on the defence of our country&#x003F; I was given the impression that the hon. member was angry because in that lecture to which he referred, the policy of his party was put on a par with that of the United Party. I am being quite honest when I say that I, too, would have been a little angry if that had happened to my party&#x2019;s policy! The objections&#x2014;overt or covert&#x2014;raised against this Defence budget by members of the Opposition parties really fill one with disapproval. And this from people who live in this country and who, we hope and trust, love their father-land. One is really dumbfounded that in these times they can be so na&#x00EF;ve as to think that they will be spared when this country is taken over and controlled by Communism. Have hon. members not learned what has occurred in the world in the past&#x003F; Do they not see what is going on in Vietnam or what has happened in Cambodia&#x003F; And then they are the people who talk about realities and accuse us of not taking account of realities. In the meantime they live happily in a condition of security ensured by this Government&#x2019;s defence policy in this country. They batten on the fat of our country and raise a hue and cry against armament while enjoying its fruits. I do not think they realize what they are doing. The armaments we are manufacturing are surely used by Black and Brown people, too, and are to their benefit as well. For example I call to mind the many employment opportunities created for these people in this way. Surely a Black and a Brown soldier fighting for our fatherland alongside the White soldier will be filled with gratitude for a good weapon in his hand. I do not think hon. members will complain about that. I want to ask whether hon. members are still opposed to this defence expenditure. I think we owe a debt of thanks to a Government and a Minister that, notwithstanding this unjustified opposition, continue to do what is in the best interests of South Africa and all its people. Over the years we have clearly seen in the White Papers on Defence that the hon. the Minister <span class="col_4623-4624" refersTo="page_0725"/>and his department are keeping pace with the requirements of the S.A. Defence Force. To reach the goal of full preparedness, ample provision has been made over the years for the best armament we can afford. Technologically we have kept abreast of the rest of the world. We can even say with pride that in some respects we are ahead of the world today.</p>

<p>All these things are very reassuring. However it is true that in the times we are living in today, dangerous times, the question of the extent to which South Africa is prepared for action, is a vital one and deserves closer examination. The question can certainly be asked whether, for example, we are able to deal with an aggressor and put him to flight. We are a small country with limited capabilities. In the same context one could probably ask whether we would be capable of stopping an attacker rapidly and effectively, particularly with a view to the great distances involved and our country&#x2019;s extremely long borders. I realize that this will probably depend on the type of onslaught against South, Africa, viz. whether it is conventional, unconventional or both simultaneously. In the event of a simultaneous type of attack, very great demands will be made on our Defence Force since we should then have to cope simultaneously with both an onslaught from beyond our borders, and revolutionary warfare in the interior. As far as conventional attack is concerned, we have the good example of the so-called Yom Kippur war in the Middle East in October 1973. The facts are known to us, but in retrospect it is perhaps as well for us to dwell on them just for a moment and for us to consider whether there are certain lessons we could learn from them. After the event it was very clear to us that Israel had been caught entirely unprepared and that they had to pay for this very heavily in human life and material. We see that the Israelis possessed all the information concerning the imminent attack but that they simply failed to react to it. The principal reason for this is the fact that they interpreted it entirely incorrectly. They thought it was just another exercise of some kind taking place. This was owing to the fact that their information service was completely overloaded with details which they were gathering and which they failed to evaluate correctly in time. The sources of information had expanded rapidly through, the years, whereas the apparati to process it has not kept pace with this development. A further and vital reason is the complacency of the Israelis. To be specific, they believed that their air force and tank force were indestructible. They continued to believe it until the Russian antitank weapons and anti-aircraft missiles shot them to pieces.</p>

<p>What lessons can we learn from this&#x003F; In the first place, we can say that the information gathered by our really outstanding sources of information must be evaluated as quickly as possible and thoroughly and submitted to those people in our Defence Force who must take the decision. In the second place, our people must never underestimate the enemy we are dealing with. It does not matter who it is; we must never disparage the enemy. At present we have entered the era of the counteractive weapons. Portable missiles are capable of shooting the best and fastest aircraft out of the air and can also make short work of the largest tanks. This fact is to the benefit of South Africa since basically our Defence Force is a defensive one. However, there is a further lesson to be learned. In the face of the imminent defeat of the Israelis, the role of the man behind the weapon, of the officer and the enlisted man was decisive. They were able to convert imminent defeat into victory even though the price was very high. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend following the hon. member for Verwoerdburg, who has endeavoured to make a responsible contribution to this debate. My time is limited. I wish to begin by thanking the Defence Force for making it possible for members of this House to attend the military tattoos which were held at the Goodwood Showgrounds as part of the Cape Town Festival. I also wish to thank them for the recent visit to Simonstown by the joint defence groups and for the visit to other arms of the service which are still to be visited. I sincerely appreciate these visits and I believe the Defence Force should be thanked for them. I also wish to thank the Armaments Board and Armscor for the briefing given to us in the Castle. We hope a closer liaison will come about between them and the Opposition as time passes.</p>

<p>In dealing with defence, I believe that I am correct in saying that South. Africa&#x2014; although we think very differently about South Africa&#x2014;as the world knows it is a geographic expression. I also believe that I am equally correct in saying that within <span class="col_4625-4626" refersTo="page_0726"/>that geographic unit which is South Africa, there are people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds and people of different colours and at different stages of development. All these people are bound together by one economy. Thirdly, I believe that no one will contradict the fact that the circumstances of history and the expansionist policies of European powers during previous centuries have left us, this Parliament, consisting of Africans in every sense of the word, except our skin colour, in sole control of political power in geo-economic South Africa. I believe that in these facts lies the pertinence of the words with which the hon. the Minister of Defence begins his preface to the White Paper on Defence dated 25 March 1975&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A credible military capability still remains a requirement for survival. This does not mean that in the prevailing circumstances any country can rely on military power alone.</block>

<p>I believe that these words are exceptionally pertinent in that total strategy includes and in fact demands the goodwill of all the people within the country, area or zone to be defended. We live in a rapidly changing world and on a continent on which the map of colonialism has rolled up with a snap so loud that it has aroused us from the euphoria of our own colonial and Commonwealth days. We now find ourselves in the age of d&#x00E9;tente, in a period of reassessment, a period of re-alignment. Where I say that in recent years Africa has not suffered us to be the workshop of the continent, it seems that in some instances this resistance is softening for the pragmatic reasons which are created by economic pressures and the gradual belief that we have no aggressive intentions on this continent. Man is a being born to believe and it is our belief that it is as much the duty of this hon. Minister and the Department of Defence, as it is that of any other hon. Minister, department or responsible member of this House, to prepare the mind of the country for the changes and adaptations which must inevitably be made to maintain peaceful co-existence and economic prosperity on this subcontinent. Much, has been done over the past few years to bring non-Whites into the overall defence of our common home. We welcome all this, and it was indeed a proud day for the Republic of South Africa when we saw troops of all colours taking part in the ceremony of the inauguration of our third State President. We now have a new development in the recently announced army for the Transkei, which we were initially told was to be of battalion strength. That matter was raised under the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote and again under this Vote by the hon. member for Durban Point. We are grateful to the hon. the Minister that he has replied in some detail to the queries which were raised on this matter and that he has clarified the position to a large extent. We will, however, reserve the right, as an Opposition should, to ask further questions and to make positive suggestions and recommendations in regard to this particular matter in the future. Suffice it to say at this stage that it is extremely gratifying to hear that the homeland leaders and their people are ready and willing to stand by us in the total strategy of the defence of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Talking about total strategy, one comes to the question of certain documents in connection with civic guidance which, were quoted backwards across the floor of this House yesterday. I do not wish to comment on these documents at all because I have not had the opportunity of reading or studying them. I do believe&#x2014;and this side of the House believes&#x2014;that the communist threat in the Indian Ocean, on the continent of Africa and also within our borders, is a very real one which we should endeavour to counteract with every means at our disposal. Although it has been said that the Kremlin is distinguished for its ignorance or that it has only one idea and that that is wrong, we have to accept that that one idea is world domination, and that even if they are wrong they have come a long way in the realization of that idea. Here, Mr. Chairman, I come back to the question of preparing the minds of the people. We have to prepare the minds of the people not only for the changes and adaptations which, must inevitably come in this country and in this world, but we also have to prepare the minds of the people for false prophets who can insidiously soften the minds of people for the final onslaught by Communism. In this connection, Sir, I wish to come briefly to the speech made yesterday afternoon just before the House adjourned by the hon. member for Parys &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; in which by implication and by innuendo he accused the Opposition of upsetting and poisoning efforts at dialogue and negotiations in the direction of peace in Southern Africa. Sir, I wish to say categorically that every effort made by the Government in the direction of peaceful co-existence in Southern Africa&#x2014;and this has been said by my leader and others on this side&#x2014; receives the support of this side of the House. But I would like to point out to that hon. member that accusatory speeches such as his, which have a very serious effect on internal and inter-party relations, have as bad an effect on the morale of our forces and our people as the most insidious of subversive Communist propaganda. I leave the hon. member there, Sir. I think that is all that need be said about his speech. The defence of our country, the morale of our people, the morale of our Defence Force, is to us far too important than for us to indulge in making petty political points and attacking each other on grounds that are stupid. Sir, we are grateful on this side of the House that we are not in the position of other countries like Australia. I was shocked to note that that country, situated in the geographic position that it is in South East Asia, was told by its Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, that at this present time there is not a fully operational division capable of being exercised. I was shocked to notice that their budget had dropped from R233,9 million in 1971 to R182,5 million in 1974. Sir, it makes one feel secure when one knows that one&#x2019;s country is prepared. By this one does not mean that it must be prepared in an aggressive sort of way&#x2014;I think that should always be made very clear&#x2014;but in the efforts to maintain peace there should be strength. Sir, we will continue to criticize and to question budgets in the future; we will continue to question the way in which money is spent. We will question the way in which certain things are provided for in the Budget, but that does not mean that we do not support the fact that our military presence must be a strong one and that it must be felt.

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Z. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, speaking after the hon. member for Albany, I want to say that I think it is clear to all of us that we all agree that a total strategy should be envisaged and enforced as if we are engaged in total war. From some of the speeches we have heard from the Opposition, I feel sure that in future we can expect to find a more united front when we consider matters of defence.</p>

<p>*When one speaks of R1000 million for defence, it is a large sum of money. But then it is also a very good idea that we bear in mind that the South African Government has a Department of Defence. Many other countries have a Department of War. We in South Africa have a Department of Defence, because we are primarily intent on defence. The R.S.A. does not have any aggressive aims; we are intent on defence and the fact that approximately R20 <i>per capita</i> is spent on defence underlines this fact, so that our friends in Africa can be sure of our intentions purely on the grounds of the appellation of this department. But when one speaks of defence, one must also take into consideration that war usually consists of four phases. There is the retreating phase, there is the defence phase, which then gradually changes into an attacking phase which, in turn, can change into an advancing phase. For each of these phases, provision must be made&#x2014; provision for armaments, because the arms differ for each phase, and provision must also be made for training, because that differs as well. All these aspects cost money, and even if the country is primarily intent on defence, these other aspects cannot be neglected.</p>

<p>So it is also necessary that we pause at the type of training which is required for each particular phase. Each of the four phases has diversity of its own&#x2014;a sort of morale of its own, a sort of motivation of its own and a sort of courage of its own. From my experience, I say that I think that our Defence Force is motivated in all aspects. We are a free people and we will remain a free people, and I am sure that our enemies will also take note of the fact that, although our intentions are of a defensive nature, we will not fall short in other spheres.</p>

<p>When we speak of human material in the Defence Force, we must remember that the primary groups here are the Citizen Force and the Commandos, the people who also take their places in civil life, who have to compete with other people in civil life and who are also obliged, above and beyond that, to render national service to the country, in the sense of military service. Therefore I think that we should give particular attention to the problems and the position in connection with the <span class="col_4629-4630" refersTo="page_0728"/>motivation of the Citizen Force and the Commandos.</p>

<p>As has been said, it is not only their time which these members of the Citizen Force and the Commandos sacrifice for the Defence Force. They also suffer the inconvenience of military training, sometimes under difficult circumstances, and for training purposes it should be that way. They also forfeit their personal liberty, which is peculiar to the military being, and they take part in nerve-destroying patrols and actions in which their brothers in civil life do not always participate and for which they do not have to make sacrifices either. Therefore, the sympathy of all of us is with the young men and women in our Citizen Force.</p>

<p>Therefore I should like to thank the hon. the Minister for the great relief which has been brought about to the pay structure of the Citizen Force. The salaries of members of the Citizen Force and of members of the Commandos have increased by 250% if my calculation is correct, over the last ten years, since 1965. We find now that a member of the Citizen Force receives a salary which is virtually equal to that of a member of the Permanent Force, except that the salary of a member of the Citizen Force is fixed at the lowest notch of the salary scale concerned. That is something very important in the eyes of the Citizen Force and the Commandos. It contributes to peace between the Citizen Force and the Permanent Force and it creates a new atmosphere of mutual respect. In principle, I can see no reason why the salaries of members of the Citizen Force, too, cannot be placed on the same salary scale so that these may increase gradually, because we must remember that there is no difference at all in the nature of the duties which they execute. All are subject to the Defence Act, to the M.D.C., as they call it.</p>

<p>The discipline which applies in the Citizen Force, is obviously of a different nature from that in the Permanent Force, because in the case of the Permanent Force, discipline can be applied throughout the year, while that is not the case in the Citizen Force, because the person only serves there for a short time. Therefore, the Citizen Force Officer understands the problems of the Citizen Force member far better than the Permanent Force Officer understands them, because the latter has not grown up in the same milieu. Once again, I want to compliment the hon. the Minister on the fact that the Citizen Force now has a Citizen Force Officer in the person of Gen. Webster who understands the Citizen Force and who understands the Citizen Force milieu. That is another step in the direction of tremendous progress in the set-up of our Citizen Force.</p>

<p>I should like to bring two problems to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The first is that the Citizen Force Commanding Officer works in his spare time because he has to do administrative work which is connected to the administration of his unit. If he comes across problems which he would like to solve, he finds that his time is limited and consequently it is virtually only on a Saturday morning that he can go and work in his office. So he comes in on a Saturday morning from his house or farm to work in his office. However, if a problem arises on a Saturday morning, there is no member of the Permanent Force whom he can ask for assistance to solve the problem. This difficulty which the Citizen Force officer experiences, can be solved in one of two ways. The first is that a Permanent Force adjutant be added to every Citizen Force unit. That, I think, is more or less the British system. As an alternative, it could be arranged that some liaison would be made possible on Saturdays so that the Citizen Force&#x2019;s quartermasters and others may liaise with the members of the Permanent Force. These are the two solutions which I suggest.</p>

<p>The last point which I want to mention concerns another problem which causes some irritation. I refer to the fact that there is not always the necessary accommodation for members of the Citizen Force and the commandos. I know just as well as anyone else that accommodation in the Permanent Force, as in any other sphere of life, is a problem. However, we must give these people who really are our fighting soldiers a pride in their units. A soldier must be proud that these are his headquarters and that they are so well-appointed. That aspect is important to him. Perhaps I would be mistaken in saying that is more important to him than it is to the member of the Permanent Force, but to the member of the Citizen Force it is a matter of pride and prestige to belong to a unit. Pride in a unit is something which is very important and we must encourage it in the set-up of our Defence Force.</p>

<from><span class="col_4631-4632" refersTo="page_0729"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, South Africa spends more on Defence every year. An amount of R948 million is being spent on Defence in the present financial year. The question may therefore be asked why such a substantial amount should be spent on Defence and on armaments production. This question has already been asked by certain hon. members of the Opposition, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Johannesburg North. The answer is simple. South Africa does so because it has no alternative. The Republic has been built up by its inhabitants into the country maintaining the highest standard of living in Africa. It is also the country with probably the greatest diversity of races and peoples in the world. However, the Republic has a formula which has already proved itself to be one of the most successful formulae in the world and which holds out a promise of growing prosperity for the country and its inhabitants if South Africa can continue with it without improper foreign interference.</p>

<p>As an ally of the West, as a direct stumbling block to communism, and owing to its strategic position, the onslaught on South Africa, in the form of demonstrations, sanctions, isolation, boycotts and terrorism, has increased in intensity in recent years. Although in recent years South Africa has repeatedly confirmed that it harbours no aggressive intentions in regard to any country, people or group, and although it has repeatedly been stated that it does not desire territorial expansion, the onslaughts continue and we have no alternative but to defend steadfastly what is ours. Without a formidable capacity to retaliate, these words would be meaningless and consequently the expenditure on Defence is the price the country is forced to pay in the interests of the peace and security of its inhabitants. Owing to the tremendous technological development in this century, defence, and armaments in particular, are expensive today &#x2014;expensive in manpower, expensive in money and expensive in time. The price of giving pause to would-be aggressors is high. Defence expenditure in South Africa is still relatively low today, as has already been proved by some of the hon. members on this side of the House who have already spoken, because it only represents 3,7% of our gross national product.</p>

<p>In contrast, the onslaught on South Africa has continued to grow in recent years, and indications are that the threat will continue in the future. It is therefore possible that in future, Defence will take a bigger slice of our income. However, the days are past when the question could be asked as to whether South Africa could afford to spend so much on a matter that did not contribute a great deal that was positive to the country&#x2019;s growth and prosperity. The price of securing the survival and freedom of our country and its inhabitants is going to be high, but however high it may be, the alternative is so high that there is no country whose inhabitants could afford it. What is the alternative&#x003F; It is destruction, suffering and loss of freedom. If we bear that in mind, no price is too high to pay for the continued existence of a peaceful country with prosperous inhabitants.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria West mentioned the daily rate of pay that has been adjusted for members of the Citizen Force and commandos, and I should like to support him wholeheartedly in that regard. As one who has been a member of a commando organization for many years, I should like to say that this is an adjustment that is going to prove very fruitful. Then, too, I should like to convey my sincere thanks to the hon. the Minister for this adjustment since it meets a longfelt need, since members of the Citizen Force and the commandos have been undergoing the same courses for a number of years and consequently there is no difference in training. In addition, it will contribute greatly towards the preparedness of the Defence Force, since it will serve as an encouragement for members to qualify themselves. The commandos perform an important role or task.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is the combating of insurgence and terrorism. That is the guarantee for domestic law and order. In the second place there is civil defence, alongside the local managements or authorities to, which this matter has been entrusted. I am grateful to note that in recent times local authorities in the Republic and South West Africa have made good progress as far as this matter is concerned. I note in the White Paper that of the 666 local managements or authorities identified for the purposes of civil defence. 554 have already appointed their heads of civil defence and, in general, have made satisfactory progress in regard to planning for emergencies. This progress applies, too, to areas outside the jurisdiction of local authorities where the planning, as indicated above, is co-ordinated under the guidance of the commandos.</p>

<p><span class="col_4633-4634" refersTo="page_0730"/>I just want to say that I have noted in magazines that certain women&#x2019;s organizations such as the Noodhulpliga and others are experiencing financial problems. These women&#x2019;s organizations play a vital part in the organization of civil defence, and consequently I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether it is in any way possible for them to receive financial aid from the State.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to use this occasion to pay tribute to the members of the commandos throughout our country who have been serving voluntarily for years and are still serving in the interests of the security of our country. In spite of the fact that these men are people following various professions, they are prepared to sacrifice time to attend courses and bivouacs in order to qualify themselves. At the moment there are 30 000 such members in the commandos. This attests to true patriotism.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the two hon. members who have just spoken made constructive speeches. This applies particularly to the hon. member for Pretoria West.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This has been so for many years. I only hope the hon. member will speak to his colleagues as well, because a few unpleasant things happened during this debate.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to refer to the hon. member for Cradock who apologized this afternoon for having denied that he had said something. As far as I am concerned, he should have apologized for what he did say, rather than for the allegation he made. The hon. member said, and I quote from his Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If I were one of the people who took part in that war, I would have celebrated my participation in that war on a far lower note than is being done.</block>

<p>I just want to remind the hon. member that when South Africa declared war, it was against two allies. Nazi Germany and Russia, were allies. They were the collective enemy. It was the time of gas ovens, of the annihilation of people. It was the time when violence was threatening to take over the world. Those who fought in that war sincerely believed themselves to be doing so in the spirit of and in the search for freedom. I am not prepared, none of us who devoted those years to that purpose, are prepared to hear it criticized by people who say, &#x201C;We should not be proud of our service; we really should be ashamed of it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member said we should not talk about it or make such a noise about it. It is not a question of less noise being made about it, but it is a matter of pride to us that we were prepared to serve our country when she called on us. That is what counts.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We have heard much about my country right or wrong, but that was the issue. Those who served their country when the call came have no need to hide their heads in shame. I am not prepared to accept any lecture from that hon. member or from other hon. members on this subject.</p>

<p>There is another aspect that needs putting right which was raised by the hon. member for Cradock and by way of interjection by other hon. members. Let us lay the ghost once and for all that there is any difference of opinion between what the hon. member for Hillbrow and what I said. I want to quote from Hansard, col. 3725 and 3726 of 9 April 1975 the words of the hon. member for Hillbrow. I hope that we will hear no more of this nonsense thereafter. He said the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Defence expenditure is necessary, but let us not bluff ourselves. It is unproductive in the sense that today what you have to spend in buying one tank could buy nearly 100 tractors. Think of the impact on our economy if we had that kind of money to devote to that kind of productive entity. I am not saying that we must not spend money on defence; on the contrary, with the position that exists at the moment and is being created by this Government, we must spend money on defence, but let us not bluff the people.</block>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I have it all here. Why did that hon. member refuse to quote this when I challenged him&#x003F; Why did he remain silent and misrepresent the spirit and the words of the hon. member for Hillbrow&#x003F; I can quote the previous columns, but I am not going to devote my speech to quoting from Hansard. I fling the accusation back with contempt.</p>

<p>Let me come to some other matters. Firstly, there is a pleasant one. There have been a number of tributes paid to the Defence Force for various reasons. I would like to add mine for, perhaps, one small service which was performed but which impressed me particularly. I am talking about the part the Defence Force played at the farewell banquet to the ex-State President at Stellenbosch. I was most impressed by these young chaps who, with virtually no training, carried out, with military precision, an exercise that would have daunted many experienced commercial caterers. They carried it out not only with efficiency and with precision but in a cheerful spirit and in a way which I believe did nothing but make friends for the national servicemen and the Force itself. The way that some 700 guests were fed from, I understand four army kitchens was a tribute not only to the members of the Defence Force who participated.</p>

<p>I want to refer to two other matters briefly. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he should not be so sensitive about criticism. The hon. the Minister is correct&#x2014;I do not blame him&#x2014;in defending his department but he must not provoke by over-reacting. He attacked me very strongly about my remarks in regard to the <i>Tafelberg.</i> All that I had suggested was that as we were spending a lot of money on repairs it might be better to buy a new ship. As a result he launched a violent attack on me. He asked: Why did I do it&#x003F; Why did I throw this sort of thing into the debate&#x003F; [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister should have heard himself. He said that this was the sort of thing I should not do. However, on the 15th of this month, last week, the hon. the Minister told me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die antwoord daarop is dat dit &#x2019;n aangeleentheid is wat the Krygstuigraad op die oomblik oorweeg.</block>

<p>His own Armaments Board was considering the very matter. However, when I had the temerity to raise the matter in the House, the hon. the Minister saw fit to attack me and to say: You should not do this sort of thing. He also asked: What are you insinuating&#x003F; What are you implying&#x003F; No, Mr. Chairman, let us get some perspective. I raised a ligitimate query. The hon. the Minister gave us a figure of R31 million. If he had replaced this vessel a few years ago it would have cost less than half that figure.</p>

<p>It is very clear that the hon. member wanted to quote an extract from Hansard here in order to embarrass the hon. member for Cradock. However the hon. member for Durban Point did not quote what was said in the previous column by the hon. member for Hillbrow. The hon. member for Hillbrow said the following (Hansard, 9 April 1975, col. 3725)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What I find so tragic also is that in this particular year of d&#x00E9;tente, when the hon. the Prime Minister is moving out into Africa with this great gesture, instead of getting an understrutting and supporting operation from the hon. the Minister of Finance in so far as the African States are concerned, what do we get&#x003F; The biggest hike in defence expenditure in the whole history of South Africa. It had its impact immediately at the OAU &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow then went on to say what those members supposedly did while that matter was being discussed in this hon. House. [Interjections.] It will get the hon. member for Durban Point nowhere to be so sensitive. He is still busy with what I said at the beginning of my speech! It will get the hon. member nowhere to be so over-sensitive in regard to this matter. We on this side of the House have never attacked any hon. member on that side for having regarded it as his duty to go and fight for his country in the last war. We are very proud of what was achieved. We believe that they came back from that war as heroes, particularly the South African troops. The hon. member refers to the sensitivity of the hon. the Minister. He should be so proud of the fact that he fought that when the hon. member for Cradock makes a few statements here, well-founded statements, he should not be so sensitive as to kick up a fuss about it.</p>

<p>We have heard a great deal about this Budget in the last few days and a lot of criticism has been levelled at it. However, if it is seen as a whole and public opinion is gauged, then one fact stands out as plain as a pikestaff and that is that this National Party Government sees to the interests of South Africa and its people, and in particular the defence of this country. It is quite clear that the arguments we have heard from that side have the false note one hears when one bangs an empty tin. I shall come back to that. It is pointless for the hon. member for Durban Point to say that he hopes that that will be the end. That is not the end of the hon. member for Hillbrow, who gave us to understand here that South Africa should not spend that amount on defence. [Interjections.] This shows that that hon. member does not realize what the stability and peace in South Africa derives from and also that he does not realize that to be able to enjoy that peace, order and stability, it is necessary that large sums of money be spent on defence. I repeat that there are a number of members opposite who have said that they have no quarrel with us concerning the amount being set aside for defence. To those hon. members who have said that, I want to say: If tractors must be bought, I hope that one of those tractors will be used to drag the hon. member for Hillbrow through a cactus hedge so that he may be shaken out of his deep sleep.</p>

<p>Fortunately this Government knows its duty to South Africa and its population. We know that it is necessary to spend large sums of money to ensure peace, security and stability. I&#x2014;and, I think, all the members on this side of the House, too&#x2014; would be the last to raise any objection were the hon. the Minister of Defence to request double this amount for defence next year. I think it is time for every individual in South Africa&#x2014;and that includes those members on the other side of the House and their supporters&#x2014;to realize that it is time for us to be prepared to make personal sacrifices in a world which is largely hostile to South Africa, personal sacrifices in the interests of South Africa and its people. The time has come for us to ask ourselves: Is it not already time for us to sacrifice part of our personal freedom for the sake of this matter&#x003F; Must we, as individual citizens, sit quietly and wait until attacks are made on our borders and on our towns and cities before we wake up&#x003F; Or should we not rather take the decision even now that the slogan we should adopt should be that of the Scouts, viz. &#x201C;Be prepared! &#x201D;</p>

<p>Our hon. Prime Minister has stated repeatedly that we should not regard his <span class="col_4639-4640" refersTo="page_0733"/>efforts to bring about d&#x00E9;tente as a weakness, but as strength. Strength is the motive behind those efforts. I do not want to speak from the point of view of preparedness to proceed to the attack, but from the point of view that we should be prepared to defend what we have built up in this country and what belongs to us&#x2014;what we love&#x2014;with all our might. We do not want to fight, we do not want to make war, but neither do we want other people to come here seeking for what they have not lost here. If we want to provide for that, we must see to it that we are in a state of readiness and that we are prepared, and we must be able to defend ourselves whenever it may be necessary.</p>

<p>A few days ago, in a bookstore in the city, I read the words &#x201C;Because you do not know when the hour will come&#x201D; and immediately decided to use them as the theme of my speech on the Defence Vote today. We may not sit back and relax. When I say we should be prepared to sacrifice part of our individual freedom, then I just want to remind you, Sir, what the Ukrainian poet, Taras Krafchenko, had to say; he uttered these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Terrible to be in chains</block>

<block name="quote">Terrible to be in captivity</block>

<block name="quote">But worse, far worse,</block>

<block name="quote">To sleep, to sleep,</block>

<block name="quote">To sleep in liberty.</block>

<p>When we receive warnings issued by communists abroad stating that people are being trained for urban guerrilla warfare which we can expect within a few years; when we read in Dutch newspapers that the Pan African Congress states that a war could break out in South Africa at any time, which could take place at midnight at a specific selected time, and could develop into the form of urban warfare, then we should be asleep if we were not to reckon with those warnings and statements and decide that we should be prepared in every respect. Sir, I thank the hon. the Minister of Defence for everything that has already been done in our country to keep us prepared, but I request, and I insist on even stronger measures. When I ask this, Sir, then I have in mind in particular the civil population as such. Our defence force is battle-worthy; we are vigorous, but I feel that if anything can be done to place our civil population, too, on a footing of preparedness in all respects, this would contribute towards our being able to do what is necessary in every part of our country. In this regard I have in mind the women&#x2019;s shooting clubs, for example, that are being established everywhere. I ask the hon. the Minister to put free pistols, free ammunition, free targets and other equipment at the disposal of these women. Sir, these women are very anxious to make use of that privilege. Although we use women to drive trucks and to act in other capacities in our army, there are many of them who would like to enter the field of actual active defence of South Africa. In my opinion it would be worthwhile for us to give attention to this matter and for those women, too, to be afforded the opportunity to do their duty in this regard. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>All religious wars waged, were waged because one religion was afraid of being dominated by another. All wars waged for economic reasons, were waged because one economy was afraid of being dominated by a stronger economy. All wars which resulted <span class="col_4641-4642" refersTo="page_0734"/>from border disputes, resulted from this fear. Millions, countless lives and untold grief and incalculable sums of money have been spent in escaping one thing, viz. domination. This is an instinctive desire in mankind, and throughout history, as history stratifies itself in waves, one always finds the Defence Force interwoven into the resistance of the people to domination. The ancient Portuguese and the ancient Spaniards said they had a religious mission; they had to conquer the world for Catholicism, but they followed with weapons in the wake of that mission. When that period, that wave in history, had passed, one found the major economic expansionist urge. The Cape was discovered in that time. Natives in colonial areas were wiped out indiscriminately by weapons according to the concept of the Old Testament. Weapons were always present. When the world started liberating itself, when the liberation movements began in 1776&#x2014;the American War of Independence&#x2014;it was weapons that brought about liberation, which sought to give those people release from military economic imperialism. That is also the position here today in Southern Africa. There is one sentiment which dominates all these debates on defence and national relations and that is the fear of domination. If approximately R1 000 million is voted for defence, it gladdens our hearts. Why&#x003F; Because it enables us to escape eventual domination. Now we must accept it as a hard, real and cold fact that we are confronted by the position at this hour in Southern Africa, where we are dealing with raw power politics which do not root in manifestos of human rights. No, the people who are present in Mozambique, are present as a minority, but they are there because weapons are behind them, power politics. Our Defence Force has a difficult task today. I am sorry for our young men. We do not have a religious mission such as the ancient Portuguese and the ancient Spaniards had. We do not live in a time of mercantilism with its aims of economic profit and of conquest. We are not colonialists. We do not want to build colonial empires. Nor are we a mother country which has to be protected by a Defence Force or by colonial forces. No, we are confronted by raw power politics which are being practised here in Southern Africa at the moment, and what has happened in Angola and in Mozambique here on our borders and what is still going to happen, is an unfolding of power politics. We stand here with no other mission, with no other aim and with no other assignment than to defend what is ours. Sir, it is difficult for the young people. For a soldier who has to sit still while one deprives him of the heroic, the adventurous, for the soldier who has to sit and wait and not be used for some task or other, but only the task of maintaining and keeping, it is very difficult.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that tremendously heavy demands indeed are being made on our Defence Force, as it is today, and on our young people, demands of self-control, because the Defence Force has been deprived of the heroic and is being provoked. One actually grinds one&#x2019;s teeth because provocation is part of the onslaught on us. They lie to us; they try our courage and patience as part of the onslaught on our resistance and on the spirit of our young people. I want to take my hat off to our Defence Force&#x2014;I think I do it on behalf of all of us&#x2014;for the way in which our Defence Force and our young people serve as an inspiration to us in all these circumstances. In the times which lie ahead, ever greater demands will be made, but I do not doubt for a single moment that we shall ride this wave with flying colours, the wave on which history has carried us into Southern Africa, because our aim is pure and right, our organization in the Defence Force is effective, our projections in the fields of strategy and in whatever field, are correct, no matter from what side we look at them, and because this is the case, there is general unanimity when our hon. the Minister of Defence asks for almost R1 000 million. I repeat and confirm what was said by an hon. member who spoke before me, viz. that if twice as much is asked next year, he will also support that. I believe that the entire nation will do that. Our Defence Force has come up against a power in Southern Africa which has never before made its appearance in Southern Africa. It is a new task, a tremendously demanding task, but I think the Defence Force may rest assured that the entire nation is standing behind it in spirit as one man and with all the inherent and inner conviction and motivation which can be expected from a nation.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the hon. member for Carletonville on his stirring plea for our Defence Force and our armaments set-up. To prove that he is correct in his statements, I want to quote from the <span class="col_4643-4644" refersTo="page_0735"/>same speech from which I quoted yesterday, namely the speech made by the American Secretary for Defence on 5 February this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whatever the case, the future is clouded with uncertainty. There is no doubt about the very large military capabilities at the disposal of the USSR. What is more, these capabilities continue to grow. At our prices the Soviets now devote more resources than the United States in most of the significant categories of defence. In overall research and development they outstrip us by 20%, in general purposes forces by 20%, in procurement by 25 % and in strategic nuclear offensive forces by 60%.</block>

<p>It is astronomic to hear this from the mouth of someone who is the representative of the largest country in the Free World, to receive this testimonial from his mouth of the force which is being built up under the guidance of the militaristic imperialism of Russia. Therefore I cannot sufficiently endorse and support what the hon. member for Carletonville said. With this tremendous potential Russia is fighting by proxy in the Far East, in the Middle East and in Africa. Therefore the hon. member for Carletonville is correct when he says that in these days a voice should issue from our Parliament which is not a voice of division and a voice of despair, but a voice of support for the S.A. Defence Force and our armaments organization. This is necessary, not because we want something from others, but because we want to preserve our right to decide on our own destiny in our own way.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to thank the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens for his contribution. I agree with his congratulatory remarks on the Cape Town Highlanders and I thank him for the kind remarks he made about my small share in promoting their interests. I shall deal with the other points which the hon. member raised at a later stage.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Sasolburg referred to women in the S.A. Defence Force. I want to thank him for his splendid and well-prepared speech. In all three arms of the Defence Force, namely the Navy, the Air Force and the Army, a broad foundation has now been laid for the training of women in various directions, also as officers. This training is not confined to the Civil Defence College at George only, but is also taking place in the Air Force and the Navy. I hope that we will gradually extend this training so that we can involve increasing numbers of women in it. It is not practicable for us to introduce national service for women, otherwise I should have liked to have done so. But I do think that we should give women a part to play in the S.A. Defence Force on a larger scale, in that direction where they are able to replace manpower.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Simonstown referred to the question of national service, the cadet system and the deferment of students&#x2019; training. I can promise him that we shall make a study of the points which he has made. His contribution was a positive contribution. I can tell him that we shall have a gradual implementation of the new cadet system as from 1 January 1976. At present we are in consultation with the Education Departments and officials and we hope to reinstitute an improved and better cadet system than exists at present. In the recess I shall also give my attention to certain of the other points which the hon. member raised because I think that some of them are worthwhile considering.</p>

<p>*I want to congratulate the hon. member for Verwoerdburg on his speech. He is one of our younger members, and he made a speech here which testified to study and preparation.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the hon. member for Albany for his positive contribution. The same applies to the hon. member for Pretoria West. All I can tell him is that we are unfortunately unable to post an adjutant to every Citizen Force unit because we will not, no matter how much we would like to do so, have the manpower for that purpose. Hon. members know that our instructors and our Permanent Force staff are working a great deal of overtime. We should also afford these people an opportunity though, when it is in any way possible, over the weekends for example, to be with their families. If we do not do this we shall lose them.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Ladybrand and Aliwal both advanced pleas for civil defence. I shall say more about that and about the women&#x2019;s organizations in a moment. We are subsidizing auxiliary service organizations such as the Red Cross, the Noodhulpliga and the St. John Ambulance <span class="col_4645-4646" refersTo="page_0736"/>Brigade for specific tasks which they have to render. At present this is under review again. We also subsidize shooting clubs for women. If they are affiliated to the S.A. Shooting Union, they are subsidized with inexpensive ammunition. Further than this I really cannot go, in view of the other priorities which are most certainly more important.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>* The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have already furnished an exposition of this in Parliament. The St. John Ambulance Brigade, in exactly the same way as the Red Cross, owes certain obligations to the Surgeon-General. They also receive subsidies from other Government departments, such as the Department of Railways, and the Department of Mines, because they also have certain obligations to those departments. The Noodhulpliga, on the other hand, is being used only for civil defence. Nevertheless, we are re-examining the entire subsidy basis of those organizations. I hope to be able to give attention to this matter in the year which lies ahead.</p>

<p>I do not want to become involved here in an unnecessary debate on what these people or those did 40 years ago, for then we are finally going to end up with the year 1900. I just want to say that I am not accusing the official Opposition of being disloyal to the Defence Force. It would be wrong to say that. However, I do think that the hon. member for Hillbrow made an unfortunate speech He is, after all, a frontbencher. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should call him to order. I shall tell you why. I shall read what the hon. member for Hillbrow said. He began by saying (Hansard, 9 April 1975, column 3725)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When you spend R1 000 million on defence, it is a massive amount because this is the total amount which we collect in excise duties, in customs duties and from sales tax duties every year from all the people in South Africa.</block>

<p>That was his first statement. Then he went on to speak about the price of a packet of cigarettes, after which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What I find so tragic also is that in this particular year of d&#x00E9;tente, when the hon. the Prime Minister is moving out into Africa with his great gesture, instead of getting an understrutting and supporting operation from the hon. the Minister of Finance in so far as the African states are concerned, what do we get&#x003F; The biggest hike in Defence expenditure &#x2026;</block>

This is not the spirit in which the hon. member for Durban Point, the hon. member for Green Point, the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens or the hon. member for Simonstown will speak, for they have a feeling for the necessity for a country like South Africa to be prepared in the military sphere as well, whether or not d&#x00E9;tente and relaxation of tension politics are being conducted, viewed in the light of the speech made by the hon. member for Carletonville and what I have just quoted here from the speech made by Mr. Schlesinger, the American Secretary for Defence.</p>

<p>This is what the hon. member read, but he did not read the whole story. Because the hon. member is angry with the hon. member for Hillbrow now&#x2014;and I think he has reason to be angry with him&#x2014;the hon. member for Cradock has to suffer for it. The quarrel of the hon. member for Cradock was actually with the hon. member for Hillbrow, and not <span class="col_4647-4648" refersTo="page_0737"/>with the hon. member for Durban Point. The hon. member for Cradock quite rightly said: &#x201C;I have great respect for the people who felt during the Second World War that they should take up arms.&#x201D; He then went on to point out the consequences of the Second World War and surely what he said in this regard was true. Surely we have the position that the Western nations weakened one another and that as a result Russia became the power it is today. We are not apportioning blame to hon. members opposite; surely these are the facts. Therefore, I do not want to participate in the discussion on this basis. All I want to say is that an unanimous voice should be heard from this Parliament. With that I do not want to stifle criticism. The hon. member is quite entitled to criticize me in regard to details, and even as far as my approach is concerned. I said this to him yesterday as well. But the hon. member must make certain of the facts. He was angry with me because I had supposedly attacked him so vehemently in regard to the <i>Tafelberg.</i> No, I did not attack him. I simply told him that it was bad business to buy a ship for R31 million, whereas I can have one repaired for R6 million.</p>

<p>What is more, the hon. member also referred to my reply in regard to the Armaments Board. I said that the matter in regard to the Armaments Board was being considered, and that I would take a decision at a later stage. The matter has been submitted to me in the meantime, and I have decided that we would proceed to renovate the <i>Tafelberg,</i> and not to purchase a new ship for R31 million. The money is not there. Does the hon. member want to add a further R31 million to this amount&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member raised another point to which I also have to reply. He said that the amounts shown in the White Paper were incorrect. In one respect he is correct, for the amount of R21 million was not included in the calculation in the White Paper because it is an annual and normal part of the total allocation, part of which is spent on Defence by the building departments. However, this is not part of the additional amount, but an overall annual amount which is normally given to the building departments, and from which a portion is allocated to us. This is the only difference, and is the only amount which was not included in the calculation. If the hon. member wishes, we could simply add it on.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the utilization of national servicemen. He asked how they were being utilized. We are utilizing them, for example, as accountants. I have been informed that we are employing nine graduated national servicemen in the department as accountants. We are utilizing them for data-processing, which is an important task in the department. We are utilizing a further 862 of them for supplies administration. Therefore, we are using them wherever possible. I do not want to discuss all these matters in public. We are also using trained people in specified directions, for example for counter-insurgency tasks in the army. I do not want to discuss these matters in public, for it would be extremely irresponsible to do so. We are in fact using them, and if the hon. member wants to know how, then I can give him the details if he will promise me that it will not go any further.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the hon. members for Bloemfontein West, Verwoerdburg, Waterkloof, Worcester, Colesberg, Cradock, Umhlanga and Yeoville for their positive contributions. I want to reiterate that I hope the S.A. Defence Force and our armaments organization&#x2014;although I admit that they are not perfect&#x2014;will leave here with the feeling that the South African Parliament is determinedly behind them, that South Africa&#x2019;s integrity and the integrity of its borders will be maintained with the support of this entire Parliament.</p>

<p>Let us consider the armaments organization, of which the hon. member for Durban Point has recently become rather critical. The armaments organization has helped to bring us so far that we have in effect neutralized to a large extent the arms embargo which has been applied against us for years. This is a statement which cannot be disputed. We have to a large extent neutralized the arms embargo and its effect. Secondly we have so effectively expanded our know-how in manufacturing <span class="col_4649-4650" refersTo="page_0738"/>arms ourselves, and this applies to the more sophisticated armaments such as the electronics industry as well, that we are entering an entirely new phase. This is one of the reasons for the increase in our Defence Force Budget. That is the reason for results such as the Impala II, and the new infantry combat vehicle which is at present in production. That is the reason for results which have made it possible for us, through another strategic industry, the optical industry, to make our own night vision equipment available soon. That is why we have progressed to such an extent that we have been able to do something which, outside France, has only been done in South Africa in respect of this type of submarine, namely the Daphn&#x00E9; submarines. Apart from France there is only one country, ours, that has succeeded in doing what we are doing, and that is to undertake the major maintenance service of the <i>Maria van Riebeeck</i> and <i>Emily Hothouse</i> in Simonstown. This is an achievement of the greatest value to South Africa, and I think we should congratulate our navy very sincerely on this achievement. That is why we are able, despite our problems in regard to manpower, to continue with a modernizing programme, which will inevitably entail increased expenditure. I want to say today, after having listened to hon. members, that I consider it my duty to tell you that&#x2014;whoever the Minister of Defence might be in future &#x2014;if the world remains as it is today South Africa will have to keep on increasing its defence account, and whoever expects anything else, is living in a political fool&#x2019;s paradise. While the hon. the Prime Minister concentrates on and toils to bring about d&#x00E9;tente and relaxation of tension, the economic strength of South Africa is on the one hand a weapon for him in those attempts. But let me say that a defence force which is effective and prepared is another weapon on his hand.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This brings me to the hon. member for Yeoville who stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that expenditure on defence is inflationary. I quite agree with the hon. member. This is the usual statement that is made about defence expenditure. The point I wish to make, however, is that such a statement tends to be a generalization. It is essential that such expenditure be subjected to an analysis in depth before getting too dogmatic about it. I think that it is imperative to view it as an investment to safeguard the future of all the people in our country. As such it is perhaps tantamount to an investment in an insurance policy. No hon. member would say that premiums on an insurance policy are inflationary. Defence expenditure is a nation&#x2019;s premium on its insurance policy. At the same time it is an investment which affords us a platform of strength from which to negotiate, as I have just stated. I think a proper analysis of defence expenditure will reveal the beneficial impact on our economy as a whole. I would like to point out as an example, that overall employment is stimulated to a large extent and I trust that the income from this is in any case channelled into even more productive areas. I would like to quote a few examples. Today in the Permanent Force we have apprentices. In the army there are 252 apprentices in training. In the air force there are 637 and in the navy 54. This gives us a total of 1 043. In Atlas there are 1 200 apprentices in training. This means that, at present, we have over 2 000 apprentices in training in different directions. All of these apprentices do not stay with the armed forces and with Atlas. There is a continuous flow into the private sector. In this field we are, therefore, actually activating and supporting private industry. At present we have national servicemen in technical musterings, a total of 2 239. These are apart from the apprentices. That is the reason why industrialists and businessmen are coming forward more and more to say: &#x201C;We are proud of people who have done their national service and we are looking for them; we are crying out for them <b>to</b> put them into jobs in our businesses.&#x201D; It is not as the hon. member for South Coast wanted to make out yesterday, namely that employers are not eager and anxious to take these people into their service.</p>

<p>A factor which is often overlooked is the investment made in respect of the training of people, especially in the technical fields. I think, however, that it is even more important to take due cognizance of the substantial contribution defence expenditure is making towards the establishment and promotion of industries in our country. In this regard I wish to quote a few figures. For example, the total expenditure on the acquisition of armaments during the years 1973-&#x2019;74, 1974-&#x2019;75 and 1975-&#x2019;76 was R201 million, R334 million and R534 million respectively, of which R141 million was spent locally in 1973-&#x2019;74, R143 million in 1974-&#x2019;75 and R184 million in 1975-&#x2019;76. That expenditure represented a very valuable contribution to the establishment and promotion <span class="col_4651-4652" refersTo="page_0739"/>of our own industries. Our engineering industry and our electronical industry especially benefited from the steps taken by our armaments industry. That is why I say that it is not always right to say in general that this expenditure is inflationary, because the contribution that this makes to the development of the engineering industry and the electronical industry is of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>*Sir, this brings me to another matter which was raised here, particularly by the hon. member for Simonstown when he referred to our ability to defend ourselves. The hon. member for Durban Point also referred to the question of corvettes, when he said that he hoped that the building of missile ships would not eliminate corvettes. To that I just want to say the following: Missile ships are being built. We cannot say anything further about that. The existing frigates are being modernized. This is going to cost us money, but they are being modernized rather than written off. Negotiations for the acquisition of two additional submarines are already far advanced. The Navy is making a projection of its requirements for the next decade, and this will be considered as funds become available. Included in that are two missile-carrying corvettes. In other words, we are looking to our maritime defence in the short, medium and long term.</p>

<p>Sir, I come now to the hon. member for East London City who said: &#x201C;There are things under the blanket which need exposing.&#x201D; I do not know what the hon. member meant by that. If the hon. member knows of things which need exposing, he is entirely welcome to do so. I have stated repeatedly in this House that, built into the Defence Force and the armaments organization is a system of internal audit with external control, a system of armaments control, which ought to to convince the country that there is the greatest possible measure of control over expenditure. I have called in the assistance of prominent businessmen, who serve on boards of directors. Prominent overseas visitors who were in South Africa only a few days ago, and who have a knowledge of military matters, told me that I could be proud of the top management and of the control which is built into the Defence Force and into the armaments organization. But the hon. member comes here and says: &#x201C;There are things under the blanket which need exposing&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Sir, all I can say is that this was a very general statement. The hon. member then discussed the Budget, and said that he wanted to refer to item B, page 19. He said it dealt with commandos. He wanted to know why the commandos are now being neglected, as indicated by the reduction under that item. But that is not correct. There is a reduction under the item, but this reduction is attributable to the fact that the subsidy which we are paying for the building of shooting ranges for commandos, is decreasing because most of the work has already been completed. That is one of the reasons. Now I do not know whether this is one of the things under the blanket which require exposing. But I have very great appreciation for another part of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech, namely where he advocated more commando headquarters, and that we should place commando headquarters in the same category as that of many Citizen Force units. Let me tell him that we are trying to do this. There is an agreement with the Administrators that they should allow local authorities to make contributions to commandos to enable them to build headquarters.</p>

<p>One cannot do everything overnight. Rome was not built in a day. A few years ago the Administrators gave their consent to this and it is only now taking effect. In any case, many commandos already have headquarters.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I know, but there are 250 commandos. [Interjections.] Yes, there are examples in Natal of splendid headquarters for commandos. In one case, that of the Highway Commando, they built their headquarters themselves. They did not wait for other people to help them. [Interjections.] If the hon. member wishes to see this, he need only cross the border into Natal to see those headquarters.</p>

<p>Then the hon. members for Sasolburg, Cape Town Gardens and Worcester referred to the question of civil defence. I have discussed civil defence repeatedly, but this afternoon I just want to say this: In the first place, the Civil Defence Division, which exists in the Defence Force, is a co-ordinating body, and is there to give guidance and instruction. Fundamentally, however, civil defence is the responsibility of local authorities. We are trying to activate our local authorities to introduce civil defence measures, but some communities become so over-enthusiastic in regard to civil defence that they are even stockpiling food, preparing sandbags, and I do not know what else. But that is not civil defence. Civil defence is related to averting the consequences of disasters. Hon. members must give me a chance to discuss this matter, because some hon. members do not know what it is. On the other hand, there are local authorities and communities which are indifferent to and see no need at all for civil defence, with the result that if disasters should occur, such as the recent floods, it is the Defence Force which has to take a hand. Then we have to supply tents and lorries and bring in water supplies, and we have to make men available and sometimes we have to utilize the limited supplies which we have built up for mobilization purposes. We do so gladly, but then we also expect local authorities to play a part in their sphere, according to the established principles of civil defence. Before the end of the year we shall try to have a general plan accepted by all local authorities. Hon. members can help in their respective constituencies by going to their local authorities and asking them what they have already done in co-operation with auxiliary services to draw up a local civil defence plan&#x2014;not to make war, but to counteract the consequences of disasters. This is what I want to emphasize, because some people think they should stockpile food and build sandbag shelters. However, that is not the intention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterkloof advocated a greater involvement on the part of the people in the citizen force and the commandos. This can only happen if we can get parents so far as to motivate the 20% of the annual intake of national servicemen who are not motivated. Between 20% and 30% of them are not motivated at all. We cannot succeed in doing all this within a year. They have to be motivated in their homes as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Etosha referred to the question of counter-insurgency. I have also referred to that already. I shall discuss this matter with him as well, but at this stage I want to point out that the Army and other Government departments are playing their full part.</p>

<p>I think that I have with that, replied to most questions, except for one, which I still want to deal with.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member paged through it rapidly and strangely enough, came upon one particular chapter entitled &#x201C;The Threat to Spiritual Preparedness with special reference to Subversion&#x201D;.

Yet that hon. member is still investigating it himself. [Interjections.] Once the hon. member has the policy of his party clear in his mind, and sends it to us, we will add an appendage to this instructional guide. This chapter in the instructional guide is part of our attempt to make our young soldiers understand that they have an enemy and that there is a danger which they may have to deal with. At the same time it is also an attempt on our part to make them understand what the State, of which they are members, looks like. However, we do not tell them that they have to swallow everything. The instructional guide consists of articles which have been scientifically compiled.</p>

<p>Now I am asking what made the hon. member for Rondebosch turn so quickly to this lecture on subversion. First I want to tell this House how this lecture was compiled. This morning I asked my department to tell me how and by whom this lecture was compiled. The chapter &#x201C;The Threat to Spiritual Preparedness with special reference to Subversion&#x201D; was compiled by the Senior Staff Officer, Civic Guidance, Col. J. L. Pretorius, M.A. (Sociology) on the basis of interviews with military intelligence officers who can speak with authority on subversion, a number of theologians&#x2014;<i>inter alia,</i> Dr. Murray Janson&#x2014;and certain books and articles. The first is <i>Twentieth Century Political Thought</i> by J. Rouceck, <i>Modern Revolutions</i> by John Dunn and <i>Indirect Strategy</i> by A. Beauphre. I do not know whether the hon. member for Rondebosch knows who A. Beauphre is, but for his information I want to say that this person is perhaps the greatest expert in the field of revolutionary warfare in the world. I do not know of anyone who is a greater authority. He is a person whose name is mentioned with respect throughout Europe. In addition various articles by Mao Tse-Tung were used in compiling this lecture. In other words, this lecture is one which was compiled by a competent officer, who is highly developed and well qualified. He made use of handbooks which were written by persons such as Beauphre, John Dunn and other leading writers on this subject. He also conducted interviews with officers who have knowledge of this matter. On the basis of this knowledge he compiled his lecture. What did this young hon. member of Parliament, who says he is in favour of our creating in the S.A. Defence Force a South African spirit, and a sense of purpose and motivation, come here and do&#x003F; He seized upon this to sow mistrust of these lectures among the national servicemen.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when this stage of the debate was being dealt with, on Monday, I made the point that there were two matters I wanted to deal with at this stage of the Bill. In introducing the first of these, I made the point that it is accepted by members on both sides of this House that it should be the aim to try to keep the cost of housing as low as possible, especially for the middle and lower income groups.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Hon. members must not converse so loudly amongst themselves.</p>

<from><span class="col_4659-4660" refersTo="page_0743"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The bulk of housing for the middle and lower income groups comes from the larger house-building groups. One hesitates to mention names, but I think it is necessary for me to mention some names so that the hon. the Minister will understand what I am getting at. I refer to groups such as SchachatCullum, Van Agterberg, Mondorp, Gough Cooper and here in the Cape, Bellandia Homes. By far the bulk of the housing for the lower and middle income groups is provided by those groups together. There are of course other smaller house-builders who play a very important part. I do not wish to detract from the part they are playing in providing this housing. However, to be realistic one has to accept that the bulk of this housing is provided by these larger groups. These groups in the past used to build what is called &#x201C;spec, housing&#x201D; or speculative houses. That is to say, they would build and then look for a purchaser either during the course of construction or when the house was complete. All these groups are finding that this is a very precarious way of operating and very few of the speculative houses are constructed these days. All these bigger groups are now looking for firm contracts before they build. What they are offering to the public is what is called a &#x201C;package deal&#x201D;. They advertise, they find a man who wants a home and then they sell him a stand in a particular proclaimed township. Simultaneously with this sale of a stand they enter into a contract to build a particular type of house for a particular price. In the past the transfer duty on this type of transaction was paid only on the land, but in terms of a decision some while ago of the Witwatersrand Local Division it was held that transfer would have to be paid not on the stand alone, but on the total value to the purchaser, namely, the stand plus the building contract. Obviously that has added very considerably to the cost to the ultimate purchaser. It makes not the slightest difference to the building concern, because they do not pay more or less either way, but it does make a big difference to the ultimate home purchaser who has to pay transfer duties on the additional amount, which is usually by far the greater amount, namely the cost of the house.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 8 of this Bill, this type of transaction is being made even more difficult in the sense that it is made clear beyond doubt that the transfer duty which will have to be paid will be on the total &#x201C;package,&#x201D; to use the word commonly used. I can see no reason whatsoever for penalizing this type of transaction, because it is dearly in the interests of the home builder that he should have a firm contract rather than to speculate. It is clearly in the interests of the home purchaser that he should be able to pay transfer duty on the land only. After all, at the time that he takes transfer, which is on completion of the contract, there is nothing whatsoever on that stand; it is bare land. He is therefore taking transfer of bare land. Indeed, he must do that before the builder can go ahead with the building, because it is only when the purchaser has taken transfer of that stand that he is able to get from the building society and other sources the funds that are required to pay the home builder. Therefore, there is no question of taking transfer of a house. If that was the case there would be no problem because then transfer duty would have to be paid on land plus building. But here we have the situation where transfer is taken of a stand only, but, of course, a stand in respect of which there has already been a contract to build a house. I can see no reason why the purchaser in such circumstances should be penalized by having to pay the additional amount which can add at least R1 000 to the total price of the project to him, depending on the price of the house. In most cases it would be in the region of R1 000. I would ask the hon. the Minister to let us know what his attitude is towards this transaction and if he agrees with me that it is in the interests of both parties that in such cases transfer should be limited to the amount of the transfer duty on the land only, then I would ask him what steps he intends taking to deal with the situation. In addition to an amendment to clause 8, it may well be necessary to have an amendment to the Deeds Registries Act which deals with &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>It is not so much a sequence of transactions; it is <span class="col_4661-4662" refersTo="page_0744"/>simply a transfer on a total package, in this case land and house, as against land only which is in fact what the purchaser is acquiring at the date on which he takes transfer.</p>

<p>The other matter that I want to deal with is the definition of &#x201C;land&#x201D; in the Bill and in the Act, because there is doubt as to whether it includes the sale of a unit under the Sectional Titles Act. Up to now there have been few transactions under this Act. It has in fact been regrettably slow in coming into operation for various reasons, but one hopes that in time there will be more and more of these transactions and more and more sales under the Sectional Titles Act. Therefore it is right that this Act, the Sale of Land on Instalments Act, should also include the sale of a unit under the Sectional Titles Act on instalments. I am aware that section 3(2) of the Sectional Titles Act states clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A unit shall for all purposes be deemed to be land and urban immovable property.</block>

<p>It can therefore be argued, and it is argued, I think, by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, that the definition of &#x201C;land&#x201D; in the Sale of Land on Instalments Act includes the sale of a unit. That may be so. I think the argument could well be advanced and if it were tested in a court of law, it may well be held to be so. The point I wish to make is that this Act is intended for the benefit of purchasers who buy on instalments. It should be clear from this Act alone what it covers without having to refer to some other Act to find out whether in fact something else is covered under this Act or not. I do think that as we are now in the process of making amendments to this Act, this is one amendment that should be made, even if it is not absolutely necessary, for the sake of complete clarity. I would like to go so far as to suggest that the title of the Act should be amended to read &#x201C;Sale of Land and Units on Instalments Act&#x201D;. Then, Sir, a definition dealing specifically with units ought to be added, to make it clear that the Act deals with the sale of a unit under the Sectional Titles Act. I emphasize that whilst I accept that this may not be strictly necessary, I believe it will be in the interests of everyone if they can see clearly from one Act alone what is dealt with and what is not dealt with. It is not satisfactory to say that because the matter may be clear from some other Act, this is sufficient. I emphasize again that whilst dealings under the Sectional Titles Act are few at this stage, in time they will, so we hope, increase considerably and it is necessary that this matter be clarified in advance. Those, Mr. Speaker, are the two matters that I wish to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister and of this House at this Stage of the debate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to take part in this debate because I took part in the debate on the principal Act when it first came before this House in 1971. At that time we pointed out to the hon. the Minister who was then in charge of the Bill that there was no question that the Bill would, after it had been put into operation, have to come back to this House for further consideration because in practice many problems would arise in the interpretation and application of its provisions. When it is necessary to incorporate into statute law a most important aspect of our common law which has existed almost since time immemorial in the laws of countries and in the history of the development of the laws of mankind&#x2014;and purchase and sale is one such aspect of common law&#x2014; it is quite natural that problems will occur, no matter how well the draftsman endeavours to put into cold print the basis upon which he wants the law to operate. And so, Sir, we would not be surprised, as has been suggested, if in the course of time further amendments to this Act become necessary, even though it is amended by the provisions of this Bill, because the problems have largely arisen out of the practical operation of the Act.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is fortunate enough to be in possession of some very interesting views put forward by the Association of Law Societies who, I think, may well have been largely responsible for a number of the amendments which are proposed in the Bill before us. I have not had the privilege of seeing those suggestions, nor am I even aware of the contents of any communication between the Association of Law Societies and the hon. the Minister or his department, but I do know from articles which have been written in law journals and from practical experience that there have been a number of problems which have given great concern to the legal profession in the operation of this statute. For that reason, it is not surprising, as has been pointed out by previous speakers on this side of the House, that some very important practical difficulties have arisen, difficulties <span class="col_4663-4664" refersTo="page_0745"/>which require amendments such as those which are before us today. One does not regard the department or those who have been concerned with the administration of this Act as having been in any way unmindful of these additional viewpoints that have been expressed here; in fact, one could say that the hon. the Minister and this House are enjoying the benefits of experience on the part of the members who have spoken, because of their practical involvement in the various problems that have arisen. For that reason there has been a fair amount of discussion on this Bill, a Bill which we largely welcome, a Bill which we shall certainly not oppose, and a Bill which we commend because we find all the amendments to be of value. Nevertheless, in respect of some of the provisions, we shall move further amendments during the Committee Stage. We regard it as important, for instance, that there should be some remedy for the purchaser; that he should not be placed in the difficult position of having to go to court for an order for the performance of the conditions of a contract, without also having the remedy of being able to go to court to claim cancellation of the sale or the right to resile from a sale and to be refunded his money where there will be an inordinate delay in obtaining transfer or where the seller for some reason or other will be unable to give transfer. We also hope that the hon. the Minister will consider the question of the loss of the 2% subsidy to the purchaser where the finances are provided by a financial institution other than a building society. We also hope that he will consider the question of protection for the purchaser who pays the purchase price by instalments and who finds that the seller takes advantage of the situation by overbonding the property.</p>

<p>There is one other aspect to which I personally would like to draw the attention of the Minister, and that is the new provision in the proposed new section 10(2) that if in terms of a contract the seller is to transfer land to the purchaser against payment of the amounts referred to in section 4(1) (g), a banker&#x2019;s guarantee furnished by the purchaser for payment of the said amount against transfer shall be deemed to be payment of such amounts. I hope the hon. the Minister will accept the suggestion that a building society guarantee shall also be deemed to be payment of such amounts. The charges payable under section 4(1)(g) would be all the charges for which the deed of sale makes provision. It would cover all charges arising out of the provisions of section 4, as well as charges payable by agreement, such as the costs of transfer; in other words, legal fees as well as transfer duty and stamp duty. All those charges would be covered by the provisions of section 4(1)(g). I do not think it would be reasonable to disturb a long-standing practice in this country in terms of which transfer costs are paid on the presentation of accounts, because the legal fraternity must make provision for the payment of transfer duty, which in many cases could entail the expenditure of a large amount of money. In a busy practice it could involve a considerable amount of money. Payment of stamp duty also has to be made before transfer takes place, so it is important in order virtually to assist the buyer to obtain transfer more readily, to avoid this embarrassment to the legal profession. The suggestion that I intend to place before the House in the form of an amendment will be to add after &#x201C;mounts&#x201D; the words &#x201C;except in respect of legal fees, transfer duty and stamp duty.&#x201D; That is an indication of some of the amendments which are necessary in order to enable a Bill of this nature to be fully operative and satisfactory in the interests of all parties. I would like to say that we must not be unmindful of the part which has been played by all those who have been associated with this question of the sale of land. The estate agents themselves have also made an important contribution to the advantage of the purchaser. Despite the fact that the estate agent is really there to promote the sale and to ensure that the sale takes place as quickly as possible&#x2014;that is really where his duty would normally end&#x2014;the estate agents in establishing their organizations have also established a fidelity fund of their own, something which is to be highly commended.</p>

I feel that we should not be unmindful of that, and further that we should not be unmindful of the importance of the point made by the hon. member for <span class="col_4665-4666" refersTo="page_0746"/>Musgrave in regard to the package deal. Of course the problem arises in regard to the interpretation of the Transfer Duty Act.</p>

<p>I just thought I would mention the matter again, because that is where the problem really lies. I am sure that that problem could possibly be eased. If carefully considered there could be some means of assisting in respect of a genuine deal of that nature, because it would enable the acceleration of home ownership which is such a vital necessity these days. I do feel that a Bill of this nature deserves our commendation but that it also requires a more careful and detailed study. The hon. the Minister appreciated this himself in that he adjourned the debate after he had made his Second Reading speech. I sincerely hope that when we come to the Committee Stage we will be able to deal with with these amendment on a level so objective that our sole consideration will be the interests of the purchaser as well as of all those others who play their part in ensuring that people can acquire home ownership.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think this piece of legislation is one of a series which we will deal with during this session and which relate to consumer protection. It is quite clear that this falls into the same category as the Trade Practices Bill, which we have already debated, and the Bill relating to monopolistic conditions which is already on the Order Paper. The concept is that the consumer should be protected. No-one has any quarrel with that. I have a slight quarrel with what was said by the hon. member for Jeppe, if I may point it out in all friendliness, who said that our sole purpose should be to protect the buyer. I think he is over-stating the case, and I think the equity of the situation is such that one must also look at the seller and not create a problem. Sir, I do not think he intended to overlook the seller; perhaps he got carried away in the emotion of the moment on that issue. Also, in so far as the hon. member for Musgrave is concerned, I agree with him that housing costs are increased as the result of the interpretation which has been placed upon the transfer of the stand as part of the so-called package deal. I have only one problem with his submission and that is that unfortunately it does not relate to this piece of legislation. Except for that I have no quarrel with him at all. In fact I agree with the submission he made. Unfortunately, I do not think one can amend this piece of legislation in order to give effect to what he has in mind.</p>

<p>Sir, I have one point which I would like to make right at the outset. In our desire to protect the purchaser, I do not think we should do anything which in fact increases the costs to him, unless such an act is absolutely essential in order to give him the necessary protection. I am a little concerned with some of the submissions which have been made during this debate and which will result in very substantial increases in costs in so far as the buyer is concerned. Sometimes we can overreach ourselves in regard to the degree to which contracts should contain documents and how matters of that kind should be approached. [Interjection.] The Minister has pointed out one example. I think there is another one which we have to be careful of, and that is the question relating to interest. One of the difficulties one has in the present economic circumstances is that the township owner is unable to raise money for the normal financing of his township activities at ordinary building society rates. I can tell the hon. the Minister that, in fact, there are township developers, big concerns including public companies, who have decided to go out of the business because of the problems relating to the fact that they cannot get the return of interest on the sale of a stand that they themselves have to pay in order to service it. It is illogical to tie everything to a building society rate. I think there is an overstressing of the building society rate, not only in the past legislation, but even in this piece of legislation. Let me give an example. If we refer to clause 6, which introduces a new section 7 we see in subsections (1)(e) and (2) references to the fact that the terms as to the rate of interest and the redemption must not be more onerous than the terms upon which at the time when transfer is taken, a loan secured by a first mortgage bond over land is granted by a building society. There is a dramatic difference, if I may point it out, between the loan and the rate at which and the conditions upon which it is granted by the building society and the availability of an actual bond to the people concerned. It is very easy to say that that is the rate of interest and those are the terms of a building society bond, but to get one is another story. It is with great respect that I point <span class="col_4667-4668" refersTo="page_0747"/>out that for example in a provision such as this you have to say &#x201C;the rate of interest and the terms at which that particular man is able to obtain a bond&#x201D; because he may not be able to obtain a bond and he may be very happy to take a bond under other conditions, in the same way I think subsection (2) overstresses the rates of a building society as opposed to the availability of mortgage finance to the ordinary individual. With respect, I think one must look at this very carefully because one may find oneself in a situation where one may well squeeze people out of this type of business by reason of one&#x2019;s insistence upon linking schemes to rates of interest which to some extent are hypothetical because the money is not available.</p>

<p>There is also another matter to which I should like to draw attention. I do not want to draw attention to particular details, which I shall do during the Committee Stage. I refer to the question of the rights of a buyer who has not obtained transfer; in other words, the purchaser on deed of sale who is sought to be protected in terms of this piece of legislation. I venture to suggest that the rights which are created in terms of the Bill are akin to real rights in that a purchaser receives preference over ordinary creditors and receives the right to obtain transfer in certain circumstances when in normal circumstances he would not have obtained it. Even though again this is a matter which relates, in fact, to a possible amendment of the Deeds Registries Act, I think one must raise it here. Is there not a case to be made out for the registration of deeds of sale&#x003F; If we create this kind of right which is akin to a real right, then the public should know about this type of right and the public should, in fact, be able to see whether there are rights of this kind in respect of a property. This is very close to, if it is not actually, a real right in the way in which we recognize ordinary real rights.</p>

<p>Let me give an example of how this provision can be abused. One may find a situation where a man could enter into a deed of sale and in fact obtain only a nominal deposit. If he goes insolvent, the person who has paid the deposit will then have obtained a real right to obtain transfer of the property even though the purchase price might be less than the real value of the property and the other creditors may be prejudiced. This is a very serious position, because while we are protecting the purchaser I think we have an equal obligation to protect creditors of the people concerned who are in this type of business. What worries me is that in our anxiety&#x2014; I believe it is a correct anxiety&#x2014;to protect purchasers we are in fact prejudicing creditors. There is another example of this. If one looks at the new section 11, as inserted by clause 8, which gives a purchaser the right to obtain transfer, one will find that subsection (3), for example, does not protect the creditor adequately. In these circumstances the purchaser has all the rights. He may in fact be a person who is a party to an abuse of the situation and yet the creditor is left out in the cold. Let me give the hon. the Minister another example. If a man comes along to a bank or a financial institution and, in order to obtain credit, presents his title deed as unmortgaged and presents his financial position, credit can be given to him. Yet, it may well be that as a result of a deed of sale which has been entered into the creditor, who is completely innocent and <i>bona fide,</i> will end up being prejudiced because the purchaser may be entitled to take transfer against payment of a comparatively small amount. It is this protection of the creditor which I think has been overlooked to some extent in this piece of legislation. I ask the hon. the Minister to apply his mind to this because I think it may be necessary to effect amendments to this piece of legislation in order to protect both the creditor and the purchaser.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the problem which is created by the right to make payment by means of a banker&#x2019;s guarantee. I agree that it may not just be a banker&#x2019;s guarantee, but also an insurance company guarantee or a building society guarantee. But what worries me is subsection (2) of the new section 10 which is inserted by clause 7. This subsection provides that the furnishing of a guarantee shall be deemed to be the payment of such an amount.</p>

<p>I am very please to hear that because it is a practical problem from the point of view of the township developer.</p>

<p>Then I should like to deal with the question of the limitation of the seller&#x2019;s right to cede, which is referred to in the new-section 12(1A) as inserted by clause 9. I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that there is no prejudice if you have a cession which is incorporated in the original deed of sale. I shall tell hon. members why. If you have to get the purchaser&#x2019;s consent in regard to a particular assignee after the transaction has been concluded, the purchaser need only say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. There is no question of him having to give his consent, which he may not unreasonably withhold, or something of that kind. He may, however, very seriously prejudice a seller or a developer who uses his need of sale in order to provide finance for his operation by just refusing point blank to agree to any form of cession. With the escalating costs of township development and the changes in provincial ordinances in relation to the provision of services, when they have to be provided, etc., this ability on the part of a township developer to raise money by means of a cession of deeds of sale is one of which he is being deprived by the provisions of the new section 12(1A) as inserted by clause 9. Let me give an example. What happens in the average and ordinary case is that no township developer cedes a deed of sale to a company of straw in order to escape his obligations. What he does is that he cedes it to a bank or a financial institution which is well able to fulfil any such obligations. However, the obligation need not be assumed by the new individual who takes over the deed of sale because the original township developer, the cedent, can in fact be left with the obligation he has in terms of the deed, of sale. It would merely mean a cession of rights. I would like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to reconsider proceeding with the proposed new section 12(1A) because I believe it creates a real problem and will again increase the costs to township developers in regard to this particular matter.</p>

<p>These are the only matters of principle I want to deal with during this stage of the debate. There are other amendments of a technical nature which I think should be effected, but I think that, as a whole, this is a piece of legislation to which there will be no objections in principle by anyone. However, I think the hon. the Minister may well consider referring this Bill to a Select Committee after Second Reading so that all these technicalities need not be debated in this House. The Select Committee can then iron out the technicalities. I think that the attendance in this House during this debate has demonstrated that this is not a matter with which members as a whole are particularly concerned, but that it concerns only a limited number of people who perhaps have relatively specialist knowledge. I think we could dispose of all these matters in a Select Committee quite expeditiously during the remainder of this session.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, after listening to the hon. members and the hon. member for Yeoville today, I say thank you for the Transvaal Provincial Council. I give thanks for that Council and for the knowledge which the hon. member could acquire there. We taught him something in the Transvaal. I am grateful to say that the legislation which is before this House at present, will be one of the greatest assets to the township developer. As a salesman, one has never had a leg to stand on from a business point of view. Things went as they did with Adam and Eve in Paradise. The township developer blamed the client who was buying or blamed the agent. The agent would say in turn that it was the buyer&#x2019;s fault or that the problem has arisen here or there. It was the same with Adam and Eve as well.</p>

<p>Adam blamed Eve and she blamed him and in the end they blamed the snake who didn&#x2019;t have a leg to stand on. That is actually what has happened here. By means of this legislation, we are being placed in a position where I can feel free to say to anyone, &#x201C;Use the deed of sale, go forth, my son&#x2014;what does it say in the Bible&#x003F;&#x2014; and buy yourself a vineyard.&#x201D; There is not <span class="col_4671-4672" refersTo="page_0749"/>enough money in financial institutions in South Africa today to finance subdivision of land. I just want to mention a few figures briefly. 1 090 towns were frozen recently in the Transvaal&#x2014;thank the Lord that they are now free of that. Suppose that there are 100 stands in a town and that they are R5 000 per plot. In that case, the capital invested in those plots would have amounted to R545 million. I can tell hon. members that that amount does not come from the building societies. One does not get this sort of financing from building societies. As the hon. member for Yeoville correctly stated, one cannot get a loan for township development at a building society. One will not be able to negotiate such a loan at 8&#x00BD;%, but will have to pay 12%, 13%, 14% or 15% according to the circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member and I know, &#x201C;a little bit here and a little bit there and in the end we fix it up together&#x201D;. This is an opportunity which the ordinary man is getting to acquire land. Gone are the days when a man thought he should buy a house for cash. He never became a home-owner. The first thing which I taught boys who were my pupils, was to become land-owners. When I became a township developer, I said that they should not buy a motor car, because if they were to buy a motor car on hire purchase, they would find that their asset was depreciating by 25% annually and that they would have to pay 17&#x00BD;<i>%,</i> and more for financing.</p>

<p>You are always better than I am when it comes to the adding side of anything. The hon. member is quite right. Then there is also petrol, repair expense, etc. The opposite of this is the Act which indemnifies the young man against rogues and people who contravene the Act. This legislation gives him an honest and fair chance to say, &#x201C;Now I am going to buy myself a plot&#x201D;. In many cases, one only has to pay 5% of the purchase price of a plot as a deposit. Then one pays 8&#x00BD;% interest in respect of that plot. The real growth of the value of a plot in a good area is between 5% and 7%.</p>

<p>In other words, in that case one pays only 1&#x00BD;<i>%</i> interest. Our dear Lord made all the land at once. Afterwards he multiplied the people so that they filled the earth. Therefore, land becomes more and more sought after every day and it will only be the man who has capital who will be able to buy land if this legislation is not placed on the Statute Book. Up to 90% of the business men of South Africa are honest. There are only 5% or 10% of the people who do not keep to the Act and are therefore not fair towards a buyer. It is those people who will be opposed by this legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. Opposition reminds me of someone who knows that a baby gets whooping cough, measles, etc., and that it has teething troubles. In that way the Opposition analysed this Bill and they did it very well. However, with changes here and changes there, hon. members are trying to give the baby its medicines at birth. They want to give the baby an injection against whooping cough, castor oil, etc., at the same time. They will kill the baby before its lungs are functioning properly. Leave this Bill and give it a chance first. Give us the opportunity to test this measure. In the Lord&#x2019;s name, hon. members must not ask for the Bill to be referred to a Select Committee so that it may be delayed. This Bill must be placed on the Statute Book because it will stimulate business. The agent or salesman who is worth his salt can go to a buyer in all honesty and sincerity and tell him that he is indemnified by the National Party Government. Perhaps without even knowing it, these agents will be expounding National Party policy into the bargain! Therefore, this is a positive contribution. In 1967 I made a speech in Pretoria&#x2014;one of many&#x2014;on land and land ownership.</p>

<p>I said on that occasion, and meant it, that Jan Van Riebeeck came with 116 people and 300 years later we have this beautiful country, South Africa, with, its subdivisions, its buildings, etc. I said that it would take ten years for <i>3&#x00BD;</i> million people to be placed in the same situation. I said that the same utilization plan would have to come. I looked at Pretoria, Johannesburg, and their environs and saw that these had to be joined. At the moment there are 84 000 plots which have been subdivided. I want to say that from 1964 to 1970 more people in South Africa became land owners than was ever the case before. People had the opportunity to make the land of their <span class="col_4673-4674" refersTo="page_0750"/>fathers their own land. They did it through instalments.</p>

<p>The principal Act was not yet fully operative at the time. It was still only an idea then. Then we sold the plots already. [Interjections.] We know that there are problems which are being rectified by this amending Bill, but the principal Act gave everyone a chance to buy land. Let us go back to Germany. The hon. member for Yeoville will know what I am talking about. Why was an interest bank established&#x003F; The interest bank was established in Germany to make the German mark available for buying land and buildings and to give inflation the deathblow.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when we take off from the earth it is from land; when one lands, it is on firm ground; and when one is buried, it is in ground.</p>

<heading>INCIDENT IN THE KATUTURA COMPOUND IN WINDHOEK</heading>

<p>(Statement)</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to make the following statement to this House in respect of an incident which occurred this morning in the men&#x2019;s hostel at the Katutura Compound in Windhoek, South West Africa.</p>

<p>For a long time information had been available to the effect that a large number of illegal natives were hiding in the Katutura compound and were propagating and inciting a strike, and molesting the legal inhabitants. This hostel accommodates 5 300 natives, the majority of whom are members of the Ovambo nation. Acting on this information the council of leaders of the camp discussed the matter on 20.4.1975, and it was decided that action should be taken against the illegal inhabitants. The council of leaders consists of Ovambos and Kavangos who live on the premises, and is elected from time to time by the inhabitants themselves.</p>

<p>On the morning of 23.4.1975 the compound manger, with the assistance of 32 municipal police, White and non-White, took up positions in front of the main gate of the compound to demand the documents of those leaving the compound. During the process a number of natives whose documents were in order congregated in large numbers outside the gates. At 7 a.m. a municipal lorry, which removes garbage from the compound every day, arrived at the gate. When the gate was opened to allow the lorry to pass through, a large number of natives stormed the gate and a large-scale stone-throwing from inside as well as outside the compound began. The officials at the gate all sought shelter in the office inside the compound. The S.A. Police were sent for, and Captain Nortje and three constables arrived at the compound. They were armed only with pistols. Immediately afterwards the stone-throwing inside as well as outside the compound recommenced and increased in intensity. Captain Nortje requested those who were outside the compound to go to work, but they paid no heed to this, whereupon he sent for further reinforcements. The stone-throwing increased in intensity to such an extent that Captain Nortje and his constables were also forced to seek shelter in the office. Immediately afterwards the natives outside the compound rushed at the offices and pelted the offices with stones. The officers then realized that their lives were in danger and shots were fired at the attackers, whereupon the latter fled. Immediately after this, at 7.30, the district commandant, Colonel Schadle, arrived with five officers and 25 men. After this, no further incidents occurred. It was subsequently found that one Ovambo had been shot and killed outright, while three had been seriously and seven lightly wounded. Members of the S.A. Police sustained only light injuries. A large-scale investigation and clearing-up operation was carried out, and up to now 295 natives have been detained, of whom 127 have been identified as stone-throwers and 168 as illegal inhabitants. Various municipal vehicles and one Police vehicle were damaged. The roof of the municipal offices was also damaged. The South African Police are patrolling the compound and the surrounding areas to preserve the peace and to reassure those who want to go to work and protect them against intimidation.</p>

<heading>SALE OF LAND ON INSTALMENTS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I found it very pleasing to hear that it was <span class="col_4675-4676" refersTo="page_0751"/>Eve who said to Adam: &#x201C;Buy yourself a vineyard.&#x201D; I am very fond of a vineyard myself, and I am glad the hon. member for Langlaagte is also a lover of vineyards. It is gratifying to think that there are members from the Transvaal who also have vineyards. I am pleased to hear it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte said it was only after the Act, which we seek to change through an amendment today, had been approved that land was bought on instalments on a large scale. I cannot agree with the hon. member for Langlaagte. I can quote to him cases which I know of where the plots were purchased on instalments as long ago as in the years 1880-1883. This was done in the following manner: The purchaser obtained a full bond from the seller, which was never redeemed. The purchaser only paid interest on it. When the purchaser eventually died, the amount was recovered by his estate. That means that the purchaser himself never really paid off on the bond but only paid the interest for all those years. Of course, that was quite profitable, seeing that, according to the hon. member for Langlaagte, the value had doubled over and over again during the next 40 years or more. That means that the amount which was originally owed, was negligible compared with the value of the land when eventually paid off. I only mention this to point out to the hon. member that the sale of land on instalments is something which originated many years ago and that it did not need this legislation to promote it.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Yeoville dealt with quite a number of interesting matters. I agree with him wholeheartedly that this legislation does in fact create a real right for a purchaser by virtue of a deed of sale, whereas before a deed of sale did not give him a real right. But I cannot agree with the hon. member for Yeoville that because of the fact that this right which the purchaser now gets resembles a real right, there must be a means of registering deeds of sale. This is a very dangerous subject which the hon. member for Yeoville has touched upon, because if we were to start registering deeds of sale, I believe that we would eventually find that very few people would be prepared to take transfer of the land that they have purchased. They would say, &#x201C;We are perfectly happy with the registered deed of sale in the Deeds Registry; by not taking transfer we are going to escape transfer duty and other fees that we would have to pay.&#x201D; I cannot therefore agree with the hon. member for Yeoville on that point.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that you have to pay transfer duty on the sale. Sir, for the hon. member&#x2019;s benefit, you pay transfer duty before you register transfer, and if you do not pay transfer duty within a period of six months from the date of sale, then you pay a penalty on the transfer duty. But do you know, Sir, what the penalty is&#x003F; The penalty is 7&#x00BD;% per annum. At the present rate of inflation and with the present devaluation of currency, I do not believe that that is a penalty at all. I am not pleading that it should be increased; I am merely saying, as far as the argument of the hon. member for Yeoville is concerned, that I think my argument is better because I think the effect would be that everybody would be perfectly happy to have a registered deed of sale and would not bother to take transfer of the land and to have that transfer registered in the Deeds Registry.</p>

<p>To return to the principles of this Bill, a great deal has already been said about the protection of the purchaser. I agree that a purchaser who buys land on instalments should be protected. I know of any number of cases where purchasers who have purchased land on instalments have in fact not been able to get transfer eventually, or have been diddled out of the transaction. But, Sir, we are in a dilemma here. The dilemma is that we must not over-protect the purchaser, because if we over-protect the purchaser, the effect is going to be that we are going to hamper the seller to such, an extent that it is going to have a detrimental effect on the purchaser. That may perhaps sound a bit strange, but I think I can illustrate it by putting it this way: If we were to say, for instance, that we will not allow the title deeds of a property which has been sold to be pledged with a bank by the seller as security for an overdraft, then we are going to find that the seller will be unable to finance the development of that piece of land before he can give transfer to the purchaser. There is going to be an inordinate delay. In other words, by over-protecting the purchaser, we are now making it very difficult for the seller to carry out his obligations in terms of the deed of sale, namely to provide the necessary <span class="col_4677-4678" refersTo="page_0752"/>services. The same applies in the case of bonds. The question has already been raised of a seller mortgaging the property which he has sold on instalments for an amount greater than the balance of the purchase price which is still due and owing to him. This is a great difficulty. In fact, I have a note here saying that this question of mortgaging or pledging the title deeds as security for an overdraft, is something which in this sort of transaction is taking place more and more often. The man who writes to me says that in the last 26 years he has only come across cases of this nature within the last five or six months, and he believes that this sort of procedure is going to continue and that it will accelerate. His plea is that we should have something in this legislation to prevent these title deeds from being lodged with the bank as security for an overdraft, or to prevent these title deeds from being given as security for a mortgage bond. But I am afraid I cannot agree with the hon. gentleman who wrote to me, because if we are going to do that, we will find that as far as property development is concerned, it will come to a standstill. We must allow the property developer to borrow money in such a manner as he is able to for the purpose of developing the land, portion of which he has sold. I think a case can be made for a single erf or plot of land. I think a case can be made out for saying that where a seller sells a single plot of land which is incapable of subdivision, or which does not fit into the Sectional Titles Act, or which cannot be regarded as a section or a unit, we can protect the purchaser in such a way that this land cannot be mortgaged to such an extent that the purchaser eventually has nothing but a claim to transfer, which he can never get because the amount owing under that mortgage bond is far greater than the balance of the purchase price and he cannot pay off this amount. I think we will have to apply our minds very carefully to this aspect of the matter. It is not a simple one. I believe that the hon. the Minister probably saw this point&#x2014;I am giving him credit for having seen it&#x2014;and I think it will take quite a lot of very earnest consideration to see what can be done in order to try to protect the very small purchaser who buys a small piece of land in the way I have suggested. On the other hand, I do not think that we can protect the purchaser who buys from the developer, because the developer must be allowed to mortgage the land in order to provide ever funds are required in the way of development.</p>

<p>The other point I wish to raise relates to another aspect of this Bill. I believe one might say it is the principle of this Bill, namely that we are here trying to save the purchaser unnecessary costs. I think it is necessary that we should realize at the outset that there are certain costs that the purchaser can be relieved of. If we pass this piece of legislation we must, however remember that we cannot save the purchaser the cost of consulting his own attorney. I believe that after this Bill has amended the existing Act, any purchaser of land on instalments will willy-nilly have to consult his attorney before he signs a deed of sale, because unless he does that he is certainly not going to know what his rights are going to be and he will certainly not know what he is going in for. Therefore I believe that this aspect of the matter should be given wide publicity and prospective purchasers under the amended legislation should know that this legislation is not so designed that he can go into a transaction blindfolded, sign a deed of sale and then say that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is looking after his interests. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that he will be unable to assist that purchaser in any way if he enters into an agreement which makes it impossible for the Minister to assist him. There is a principle in the Act which is being amended by this Bill which I believe tries to save a purchaser the cost of transfer. The way in which this is suggested is that there should be a direct transfer from the registered owner to the final purchaser. This is a principle which I think is embodied in the Act which is now being amended. I do not know whether it was acknowledged as a principle at the time, or whether it was merely a fortuitous principle which crept into the Act. However, the amending Bill now does away with that principle entirely since it provides that the intermediate transactions must be registered in the Deeds Office. It therefore does not obviate the costs attached to the registration of the intermediate transactions. The Bill also provides that the final transaction must follow the normal sequence of transfers in the Deeds Registry Office. In other (words, if a property was purchased from the original owner and was resold nine times after that, there would be ten separate transactions before the ultimate purchaser would be able to obtain transfer. I should like the hon. <span class="col_4679-4680" refersTo="page_0753"/>the Minister to tell me whether there was such an intention at the time because he did not mention it in his Second Reading speech. Was it, in fact, the intention to save the purchaser the costs of transfer in respect of the intermediate transactions so that the ultimate purchaser would only have to pay for one transaction, i.e. from the registered owner to himself&#x003F; I do not believe the answer is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. I believe it is &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I shall tell the House why I believe that.</p>

<p>Are you referring to clause 11 &#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. I. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I believe the answer is &#x201C;no&#x201D; because the Government decided at that time&#x2014;I do not know whether it was the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor or whether it was the Secretary for Inland Revenue&#x2014;to look after itself. It adopted the attitude of &#x201C;We do not mind whether you take transfer direct from the original registered owner if you are the ultimate purchaser and you escape paying transfer costs for nine different transactions, as long as you pay transfer duty to us in respect of each of those transactions.&#x201D; I would say that in these times of high costs of housing and high costs generally for anybody who is starting a new life in a new home, I believe that the Government should show the way. I believe that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs can show the way very easily by saying that they are not going to ask for transfer duty on the intermediate transactions. If the hon. the Minister would agree to doing away with transfer duty on the intervening nine transactions, I am pretty certain that I shall be able to persuade the Chief Registrar of Deeds, and whoever else has an interest in this matter, to do away with the nine intervening transactions as being registered separately in the Deeds Office. I think we should have a leaf out of the book of the Receiver of Revenue to prove this earnestness on the part of the Government. I am not certain at all whether that is the intention, but I do hope that the hon. the Minister will give this matter a great deal of attention when he replies to the debate.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to a matter dealt with by the hon. member for Musgrave when he talked about the package deal. I think that quite possibly the reason for the decision of the Witwatersrand Local Division is the fact that the Transfer Duty Act makes allowance in certain sections for an irresistible conclusion. I am not going to read this to the hon. the Minister, but before he gives his reply to the Second Reading debate, I suggest that he should consult the Transfer Duty Act. He will find the following proviso to section 2(4) of the Transfer Duty Act, Act No. 40 of 1949:</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that where property is acquired under a transaction in terms of which the person acquiring the property agrees to pay in respect thereof a consideration which consists in part of a consideration for the erection or completion of a habitable dwelling-house or habitable accommodation thereon, the property shall for the purposes of subsection (3) be deemed to be improved property.</block>

<p>Because it is improved property, transfer duty is payable upon it. Section 6 of the same Act, which deals with certain payments which shall be added to the consideration payable in respect of property, provides in subsection (1)(c) that there shall be added to the consideration for the purpose of arriving at the transfer duty:</p>

<block name="quote">Any consideration which the person who has acquired property has paid or agreed to pay to any person whatsoever in respect of or in connection with the acquisition of the property over and above the consideration payable to the person from whom the property was acquired, other than any rent payable under a lease or sub-lease by the cessionary thereof.</block>

<p>This is another point to which the hon. the Minister should pay attention. Finally, I suggest that the hon. the Minister should have a look at section 8 of the same Act which deals with the valuation of the consideration which is payable. Section 8(b) makes the following provision:</p>

<block name="quote">Where the consideration is in the form of goods, services, rights or privileges, the current market value of such goods, services, rights or privileges at the date of the transaction or, where the market value of such goods, services, rights or privileges as at the date of the transaction is not ascertainable, a value which the Secretary considers fair in the circumstances.</block>

<p>If the hon. the Minister looks at these three provisions, I think he will come to the <span class="col_4681-4682" refersTo="page_0754"/>conclusion that it is really the Transfer Duty Act which is militating against the package deal to which the hon. member for Musgrave referred. I think the hon. the Minister can exclude this package deal&#x2014;where the builder agrees to build provided you buy land from him&#x2014;from the operation of the Transfer Duty Act by means of a small amendment to this Bill&#x2026; I do not think that it is necessary to amend the Transfer Duty Act itself. I think it can be done by reference. I think the hon. the Minister is in a position to do that.</p>

<p>There is one other matter which I think we should take into consideration and that is the fact that, where we find there are a number of intermediate transactions as I mentioned a little earlier, where between the registered owner and the ultimate purchaser there are, let us say, 10 transactions, there is a method of getting over this difficulty. This method has been employed since the Act that we are now seeking to amend, was passed. It is a simple way of getting out of the difficulty if the parties should find difficulty in proceeding with all those intermediate transactions. In addition, this is quite a legitimate way of dealing with those difficulties. The method I refer to is to cancel all the intervening transactions and to negotiate a fresh transaction between the registered owner and the ultimate purchaser. The only difficulty about such a transaction is that the various rights of the parties must then be described in the new deed of sale. Nevertheless, it can be circumvented. This method also circumvents the payment of transfer duty on the separate transactions. I do not think for one moment that the hon. the Minister can be in earnest in requiring transfer duty to be paid on these intermediary transactions and I believe, if he looks at it from that point of view, he can still come to the assistance of purchasers by helping them to get over this additional payment.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the proposed new section 14(1), clause 11. This rather peculiar section deals with the question of a property that has been sold on the never-never in the case where, before the eventual purchaser can get transfer, the registered owner of the land becomes insolvent or, in the case of a company, goes into liquidation or the property is attached and sold in execution. The situation that existed before these amendments were introduced, was rather curious because it provided that in such a case the eventual purchaser would have a claim against the insolvent estate or against the property in the case of a sale in execution, for the portion of the purchased price paid by him plus interest calculated at 5 % per annum on the said portion in respect of the period from the conclusion of the contract to the date upon which the land is sold. That is how it read. As I say, that in itself was a rather curious provision. It has become more curious now by bringing in &#x201C;the trustee or liquidator&#x201D; and &#x201C;deceased or insolvent estate&#x201D;, by changing words here and there and by adding at the end of this subsection:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; sold by the trustee or liquidator or in execution.</block>

<p>It is capable of a variety of interpretations, but I only want to deal with two. It refers to the 5% on the portion paid from the date on which the agreement was concluded to the date of sale by the trustee, by the liquidator or in execution. I have done the calculation and can tell hon. members that if we assume that the date of agreement was 1 January 1950 and the sale by the trustee or liquidator or in execution was on 1 February 1975, just over 25 years later, with a purchase price of R5 000 and with payments by the purchaser of R100 on 1 January 1950 and thereafter R25 per month, exclusive of interest, on the 1st day of every succeeding month, then by the time this sale took place he would have paid <b>a</b> deposit of R100 plus payments of R25 for 180 months. That would make his total payment R4 600. If I should interpret now what the interest is that should be paid, it would be interest of <i>5%</i> per annum on R4 600 from 1st January 1950 to 1st February 1975. Let us say it is 25 years. The interest will be R5 750 and the total amount which the purchaser could then claim against the insolvent estate or against the deceased estate or the property sold in execution, will be R10 350.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has been said by a writer in relation to the principal Act and this bill that it constitutes a socialistic inroad into the right of freedom of the individual to contract. I do not believe that, but it was an eminent writer who wrote this. He went on to say that however good a law may be, it always becomes the subject matter of litigation. I cannot criticize the Act, because I believe one is not allowed to criticize an existing Act in this House, but I can say just in passing <span class="col_4683-4684" refersTo="page_0755"/>that I do not believe that the existing Act should have been passed in the first instance. However, as it has been passed, we have now to try to make it into good law. I think the only good provision which has ever been passed in regard to contracts and contractual ability was that little paragraph in the General Law Amendment Act which stipulated that sales of land must be reduced to writing and signed by both the purchaser and the seller. I think it was only one simple clause and I doubt very much whether any litigation is likely to arise from that. I believe it is our function here today to see that we improve this Bill in such a way that the minimum amount of litigation arises from it. It should be our goal to see to it that the drafting of this measure is such that it is clear to the man in the street as far as it can possibly be made clear. The original Act was amended in a minor way one year after it was passed and I do sincerely hope that this Act will not have to be attended to again next year. It is important for us on this side. We have had a number of speakers on the Second Reading, but it surprises me that the Government has not found more members to speak on the very important provisions which are contained in this Bill. We are certainly determined to see that good law comes out of this particular Bill.</p>

<p>I am going to run very quickly through the provisions which will be dealt with in more detail during the Committee Stage just to give a preview to the hon. the Minister as to what we feel about certain clauses.</p>

<p>Clause 5 of the Bill which deals with section 6 of the Act has already been dealt with in part by the hon. member for Walmer, but I do want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that if the Bill is left as it is at the moment, it is going to cause some difficulty to both, sellers and purchasers. I say this because as it reads at the moment, it will inevitably result in sellers simply including in their contract a clause relating to interest in which is stipulated that the interest payable under the agreement will be the rate of interest prescribed by the Minister of Economic Affairs by regulation from time to time. I believe that this is going to cause uncertainty in the mind of the seller in regard to the interest he is going to receive, and uncertainty in the mind of the purchaser as regards the interest rate he will have to pay from time to time. I do not believe that this is a good provision. I feel that it can be improved upon by relating the interest that is included in the contract to the interest that is fixed by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs at the date of the conclusion of the contract. We also have certain other reservations in regard to this particular clause which were dealt with by the hon. member for Walmer. He suggested that the seller should be protected in relation to the bond which he himself holds over his own property. We will deal with this in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The second aspect of this Bill to which I want to refer is in regard to clause 8 which deals with section 11 of the principal Act. Subsection (2) of the proposed new section 11 washes out direct transfers. This has been dealt with by the hon. member for Wynberg, but I would take it just a little further in order to allow the hon. the Minister to consider certain amendments which we propose moving at the Committee Stage. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether in his reply to this debate he will tell us why direct transfers are being done away with. From his Second Reading speech it appears that a complaint was lodged with him by the Association of Law Societies. I understand that the reason for the complaint was that the principal Act imposed a peremptory condition in regard to a direct transfer of land.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Is the hon. member asking for the intervening transfers to be deleted and that there be a direct transfer between the owner and the buyer irrespective of any intermediary to whom the property might have been sold&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker. I am most definitely. The appropriate provision in the principal Act reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The land concerned shall be transferred from the registered owner direct to a person who acquired by cession the right of the purchaser to claim transfer of land.</block>

<p>I believe that the hon. the Minister will agree with me that that is obviously a peremptory condition. It imposes a considerable <span class="col_4685-4686" refersTo="page_0756"/>onus upon the seller and, of course, his attorneys and conveyancers, to ensure that transfer will be passed from the seller to the final correct purchaser. In terms of the amendment contained in this amending Bill, however, that difficulty has been eliminated. Subsection (1) of the proposed new section 11 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any purchaser of land under an intermediate transaction shall, after the commencement of the Sale of Land on Instalments Amendment Act, 1975, notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, but subject to the provisions of subsection (2) &#x2026; be entitled to claim transfer of the land from the registered owner direct to himself.</block>

<p>Therefore, it is not obligatory upon the purchaser to obtain transfer direct from the seller. This removes the difficulty experienced by the Law Society. What the Bill now does, however, is to include a condition in regard to direct transfers from the seller to the ultimate purchaser. I do not believe that there is any reason for this and I should like, in fact, to give the hon. the Minister three reasons why I think there should be direct transfer. The first one is that it saves costs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>It is not relevant to the objects of this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>Why&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell you why.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, you might hear me out and then tell me later. First of all, it saves costs. Secondly, it is more speedy and will obviate many practical difficulties. Thirdly, I think that it also has the effect of minimizing the possibility of tripartite agreements being entered into and also the possibility of the cancellation of contracts and recontracting which is a very clumsy procedure.</p>

<p>The third point that I want to raise here, is the proposed section 11(9) of the Act, clause 8 of the Bill. I want to put it that there is a serious difficulty that arises here. The Bill maintains that the purchaser will be entitled to sign on behalf of such intermediary or such predecessor all documents required in connection with payment of the transfer duty or the transfer. I believe that it means that the purchaser may sign documents in connection with the transfer of the land to himself. If that is so, I believe that it is a serious difficulty, because I do not believe that any purchaser would for instance be prepared to sign a Group Areas Act affidavit in regard to an intermediary. He does not know what the intermediary&#x2019;s race group or classification is. If these rights are given to him, he will be entitled to sign the document, but I doubt whether he will be prepared to do it. The Registrar of Deeds will refuse to register transfers until either the conveyancer certifies in regard to the group of an intermediary, whom he probably does not even know, or a Group Areas Act affidavit is submitted to him. I hope that it is not irrelevant to this Act.</p>

<p>There is also another difficulty and that is that there is no provision made in this subsection (9) in regard to the recovery of transfer costs. It does not say anything about the recovery of transfer costs and it appears that although the ultimate purchaser may pay transfer duty, he can recover the transfer duty which he has paid out, but in order to get transfer, he has to pay for cost of transfer and there is no provision in this subsection to obtain the costs of transfer from the intermediary.</p>

<p>In regard to clause 10, which deals with section 13 of the Act, I believe that there is a portion of the existing subsection (1) of Section 13 which is not being dealt with in this amending Bill, but which I think can be traversed at this stage, because it is important. That is the question of the 30 days&#x2019; notice. It has been proved by experience, that a defaulter is frequently a regular defaulter. He gets notice of 30 days that he must pay; he pays but then he again falls into default. He gets another notice of 30 days; he pays and again he falls into default. The result is that the seller is always in difficulty. I believe that this could be improved upon by stipulating that if a defaulter is in default more than twice in one calendar year, then he is only entitled to receive seven days&#x2019; notice in order to give him an opportunity of paying his instalments.</p>

<p>Then in regard to the famous section 14 dealt with under clause 11 of this Bill, I would like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to subsection (2), to the following words in line 27, namely: &#x201C;Does not so take <span class="col_4687-4688" refersTo="page_0757"/>transfer of the land&#x201D;. I believe that there is no certainty here as to when transfer must be taken. In other words, it is left rather open as to when transfer must be taken and obviously, the purchaser has to be put <i>in mora,</i> and he will only be able to be put <i>in mora,</i> and I am sure that the courts would say so too, after a reasonable period. However, I believe it is better to have certainty here as to when he should take transfer. In regard to subclause (3) of section 14 I also feel that there is no provision there for the costs of transfer. If one looks at&#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

</speech>

<speech by="#bell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. G. H. BELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to clause 11, section 14(3), where it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; within six months after the purchaser or the intermediary, or both, as the case may be, has or have been called upon in terms of subsection (2) to take transfer, for the payment of the outstanding balance under the agreement plus interest to the date of the registration of transfer.</block>

<p>There is no provision here for transfer costs whereas, in subsection (4) we find that there is, in line 16, on page 16, a reference to all other costs in connection with transfer. I do not believe that there is any reason, when transfer is taken, to differentiate between a person whose land is not subject to a mortgage bond and one whose land is bonded, by not allowing the latter to claim transfer costs. I think the hon. the Minister probably follows my point.</p>

<p>That just about covers all the matters I will probably want to deal with in the Committee Stage. I would like to repeat that we on this side support the Bill in general and that we believe that the changes we are going to suggest in the Committee Stage will be advantageous.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to react at once to a remark made by the hon. member for East London City. I am referring to his remark concerning the participation of this side of the House in the discussion on this legislation. I think his remark was quite unnecessary. In this connection I must point out that it was suggested that this hon. member would probably be the last speaker on the other side of the House. However, I do not want to take the point any further.</p>

<p>I have been listening to the debates and I want to say in general that I appreciate the contributions made by hon. members in so far as they were intended to improve the legislation we are now considering. However, it is obvious that several hon. members are completely mistaken as to the purpose of this legislation. Many arguments have been raised by hon. members concerning aspects which could rightly and fruitfully be discussed in other debates. It is quite clear that hon. members on the other side are using this particular legislation to take a stand in respect of other legislation which is totally irrelevant to the discussion we are conducting at the moment.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall give examples tonight. What is the essential purpose of this legislation&#x003F; The purpose of this legislation is in the first place to regulate the relationship between contracting parties in respect of the purchase of land on instalments. The second objective is to protect the purchaser against possible exploitation by ingenuous sellers. These objectives form the essence of the legislation. However, the hon. members opposite have argued <i>ad nauseam</i> that one of the objectives of this legislation was to reduce the cost of the registration of transfer of a property from one owner to another. I challenge hon. members to point out this objective to me anywhere in this Bill. It may be&#x2014;that I concede&#x2014;a by-product of the legislation, but it is not explicitly provided for in the legislation. Nor is it an objective of this particular legislation. If hon. members want to argue&#x2014; they may be able to do so quite rightly and to good effect&#x2014;that we should change the Deeds Act to provide for direct transfer between a registered purchaser and an owner, they can argue about that particular aspect under the Vote concerned. What I want to mention here is that this aspect is not relevant to this specific legislation. It is totally irrelevant.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when business was suspended, I was pointing out, <i>inter alia,</i> that many of the aspects mentioned by hon. members in their speeches were quite interesting, but had nothing to do with the legislation we are considering at the moment. I think it may be a good thing for me to start with the hon. member for Musgrave who opened the debate today. He basically mentioned two aspects, one of which I suggest has absolutely no bearing on this legislation. The other one does have a bearing on it. He referred to the interpretation given to section 1 of the Transfer Duty Act by the Transvaal Division of the Supreme Court. It is very clear, Sir, that we are not concerned in this Bill with the obligation to pay transfer duty or not. The rates at which transfer duty is to be paid are a fiscal measure which is prescribed in this House in terms of the financial legislation every year. I think the hon. member is completely mistaken in arguing that in the case of what he calls packaged deals we should consider only the land value for the purposes of transfer duty.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member said that previously the big housing companies&#x2014;and he referred to some of them&#x2014;used to build what he called spec, housing and that they then sold the plot together with the house. He said that more recently a different pattern had developed, namely the packaged deal where the plot is sold and the company then negotiates with the purchaser of the plot to build a house for him on the plot. He said that up to the time that the Transvaal Provincial Division ruled that duty was also payable on the cost of building the house, transfer duty had to be paid only on the purchase price of the plot. Sir, the Transfer Duty Act, section 6(1)(c), is most explicit in this particular regard. If you refer to the provisions of that section, you will find that the purchase price of the house is subject to transfer duty. But be that as it may, Sir, the point I would like to make in this regard is this: If the hon. member wishes to make representations that transfer duty should only be paid on the purchase price of the land and not on the contractual price for building the house, then he is free to do so, but the legislation before us does not in my opinion relate to that particular aspect.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Section 8 provides for specific circumstance, as I explained in my Second Reading speech. In this amending Bill I am now rectifying the omission in that section. Sir, I want to go further. The hon. member must guard against exaggeration. He said that as a result of the ruling of the court, a purchaser was now being burdened with additional costs amounting to R1 000 or more in most cases. Surely, Sir, that is not true. Hon. members on both sides of the House argued that this Bill was really trying to provide for the man who is unable to pay the full purchase price of a house in cash. It is absolute nonsense to say that as a result of the payment of transfer duties on the value of the house, the purchaser is being burdened with additional costs amounting to R1 000.</p>

<p>Sir, the Transfer Duty Act was amended last session to lay down new rates in respect of transfer duties.

Sir, I say that the hon. member should be careful not to indulge in complete exaggeration. Sir, in the cases in which this particular legislation is applicable, i.e. in the payment of the purchase price in instalments, surely the purchase price cannot be increased by R1 000 in terms of the point he made.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. ARONSON</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member referred to the Transfer Duty Act and not to transfer costs. I shall come to the transfer costs. I am dealing with the argument advanced by the hon. member for Musgrave. [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave confined himself to the effect of the fact that transfer duty is payable on the contractual price as well and he said <span class="col_4691-4692" refersTo="page_0759"/>that in most cases this increased the purchase price by R1 000. I am dealing with that. I shall come to the transfer costs.</p>

<p>The second point made by the hon. member was that the Bill should contain a provision to make this legislation applicable to sectional titiles as well. Sir, if you refer to the definition of land in the Act and in the Bill, you will find, amongst other things, that for the purpose of this legislation, &#x201C;land&#x201D; means land which is intended for residential purposes and that there is a restrictive application of the legislation. If we refer to section 3(2) of the Sectional Titles Act, we shall find that for the purposes of the Act, the section reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A unit shall for all purposes be deemed to be land and urban immovable property.</block>

<p>In other words, we must be clear about the fact that not all sectional titles in terms of the Sectional Titles Act, relate to such land as is covered by the Act we are now considering and amending. For that reason, because in my opinion section 3(2) defines a sectional title as being, in the first place, land, and since, in the Bill that we are considering at the moment, land is defined as land for residential purposes, there is no doubt whatsoever about the fact that land held in terms of a sectional title deed and used for housing purposes is also covered by the provisions of this Act.</p>

<p>To a large extent the hon. member for Jeppe repeated the arguments used by other hon. members.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, just to remind you of them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I repeat, and this has now been confirmed, that the hon. member for Jeppe repeated arguments advanced by others, to most of which I have already replied. But I just want to say quite honestly that there are several aspects of the Act, as put by hon. members, including the hon. member for Jeppe, which we can discuss much more meaningfully in the Committee Stage. Consequently I do not intend to reply or to react to them at this stage, apart from saying that my own approach to the Act is that we have not reached finality in respect of the aspects which we want to regulate by means of the Bill which is before us and that any further amendment which may be an improvement will be considered by me. It may not be possible to give effect to it at this stage, but I undertake at least to investigate it. All we are trying to do in this legislation, and I want to repeat this, is to regulate the contractual obligations of people, and, secondly, to protect purchasers, but not at the expense of sellers. This is the essence and the principle of the Bill.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Yeoville, who replied, <i>inter alia,</i> to the arguments advanced by other hon. members on the other side, and at the same time advanced certain new ones. He said that he did not think the legislation was intended to protect a purchaser against increased costs. I think his view in this regard is correct. There is a general tendency to reduce costs. For this reason, for example, transfer duty has been reduced and for this reason transfer duty and stamp duty have been consolidated.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! Hon. members must not converse aloud among themselves.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>However, the purpose of this legislation is not to reduce costs.</p>

<p>The second aspect to which the hon. member referred was the question of the interest rate which should apply. He quite rightly pointed out that township developers are often unable to borrow money at the same rate as that offered to purchasers by building societies to enable them to purchase property on instalments. That is true, but I must point out that this aspect is not really relevant. The existing Act already contains a provision to the effect that the maximum rate which is payable is the building society rate applicable at that time. The amendment proposed here has resulted from practical experience, because the fact that different rates are charged by building societies, different interest rates sometimes being charged by one and the same building society for different kinds of loans, made it impossible to determine exactly what the effect of this section was. For that reason the provision is now being inserted to the effect that the Minister may determine the interest rate from time to time.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to come at once to the hon. member for Johannesburg North. He is anxious to receive an assurance from me that we shall not use this section to prescribe a low or subsidized interest rate. I want to assure him immediately that this is <span class="col_4693-4694" refersTo="page_0760"/>not the intention at all. The only intention with the amendment is to have a uniform interest rate prescribed. This will be determined after investigation and will be related to average interest rates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Will you also consider what the township developer himself has to pay&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is very difficult. I must point out a very important consideration, namely that the developer is able to recover his cost of development, of which interest forms part, in other ways than by means of the interest rate. He can recover it by means of the price for which he sells his plots. In my opinion, therefore, he has another remedy to protect himself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>But that is a great burden on the purchaser.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is a great burden on the purchaser, but in another form. The burden is either in the form of an increased interest rate, which the hon. member advocates or, in the form of the increased selling price. However, I am not the one who increases the purchase price. The cost of development, of which the cost of capital forms an essential part, determines the selling price of plots.</p>

<p>The hon. member also says that since, with the provisions of the Act in respect of rights of the purchaser, we are really giving people a real right instead of a right to claim, as he put it, he thinks that we should proceed to register the deeds of sale so that people may be informed of them. I want to point out that the principle which applies here which is being inserted into the Act is not merely to give these people a real right. The provision does not create a real right. What it does do is that it confers on a buyer a certain preference in the case of insolvency. I want to say at once that this is no new concept, because it already exists in various Acts. I think the answer really lies in the fact that if we have to register contracts of purchase and sale, we may just as well use another form of registration of transfer as well. I want to ask the hon. member whether we cannot rather leave it at that for the moment. In any case, I cannot have the legislation relating to the Deeds Office amended because it lies outside my province. However, it is an interesting idea and I shall go into the matter to find out whether such a possibility exists.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of the right of a seller to cede his contract. Although the relevant provision is now being replaced, I just want to point out that there is absolutely nothing to prevent the cession of a contract. Nor does he require anyone&#x2019;s permission to cede his contract. I hope that the hon. member understands this legal principle. The right of cession has not been removed by the introduction of the amendment in respect of an intermediary in a transaction, but we have merely substituted a new provision for the particular provision as it used to read in the Act, and for obvious reasons, which I have already explained.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg and the hon. member for Musgrave discussed the question of transfer duty. I have already responded to that. Like the hon. member for Walmer, the hon. member for Wynberg also spoke of the question of the seller&#x2019;s right to register a bond on the property and of the fact that the amount of the bond may often exceed the balance on the purchase price. I want to say at once that this is true, but we must remember, too, that on the one hand the possession of a deed of transfer really constitutes proof of a person&#x2019;s real right. As far as this is concerned, we are not only dealing with the two parties who are involved in the contract of purchase and sale, but with a third person as well. Although I concede, and I want to repeat that, that this is one of the problems we are faced with, it is one which is difficult to handle. In respect of this particular aspect I want to say that it is quite clear that we have identified a problem. But it is equally clear that we have not offered a solution to the problem. I shall see in the recess whether it is possible to give attention to this problem. I hope that hon. members will be satisfied with this undertaking. I do not want to spend much more time on this.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke of the question of the registration of deeds having to follow the same sequence as the actions which give effect to the registration of deeds in terms of the Deeds Registries Act. I have already referred to the fact that the sequence in which deeds are to be registered is laid down by the Deeds Registries Act and that it would be very difficult for me&#x2014;and I think he will concede this&#x2014;to <span class="col_4695-4696" refersTo="page_0761"/>change the system of the Deeds Registries Act by means of this legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to inquire from the hon. the Minister whether he agrees with me that it will in fact be possible to circumvent the Deeds Registries Act before this legislation comes into operation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have already explained that this is in fact the case. However, that was done by mistake and not deliberately. The purpose of the amendment is precisely to correct the mistake. I hope that has answered the hon. member&#x2019;s question. I want to repeat that the whole system of deeds registration is the responsibility of another department, and hon. members are very welcome to make representations to that department. In fact, the hon. member knows that a new form of deeds registration has been and is still being investigated. All I want to say at this stage without expressing an opinion on this matter is that it is not relevant for the purposes of this Act, but that it is in fact relevant for the purposes of another Act.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City criticized the small number of contributions by Government speakers. He also referred to interest rates, to which I have already replied. Furthermore he referred to certain provisions of certain clauses. I shall debate these with him when we are dealing with this legislation in the Committee Stage. I think he accepts that those provisions do not affect the principles of he legislation and that it is not necessary, therefore, to react to them at this stage.</p>

<p>Several hon. members, including the hon. member for Johannesburg North, asked me not to prescribe an arbitrary interest rate. I have indicated what the basis and the procedure will be in fixing interest rates, and I take it that he is satisfied with that. The hon. member also asked why I was adding a new subsection (4) by means of clause 5(b). I want to explain to him at once that although a contract has to indicate the period within which a purchase price, together with interest and other charges, has to be Paid, a contract may also provide, <i>inter lia,</i> that interest will be payable even though the purchase price has already been paid. All we are doing here is to prohibit this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg North further referred to clause 6 and asked whether I should not insert a provision to prohibit the illegalities to which he referred and which may be contained in contracts until this legislation has been passed. I want to tell him at once that if he looks at the existing section 7 of the Act, he will find that that section provides that certain provisions in a contract shall be invalid. The proposed section 7(1) provides that as from a specific date, the inclusion of certain provisions in contracts will be prohibited. As I see it, therefore, no interim provisions in respect of invalid provisions are required in this particular case.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member further pointed out that the proposed new section 7(1)(e) and 7(2), as contained in clause 6, are supposed to provide for the circumstances under which building societies cannot grant a loan and where it is made available by the seller. In this particular case the provision is that the conditions may not be more or less onerous than those on which the building society would grant a loan. He said that there was an element of confusion in this particular regard, and I readily concede that. I shall see whether I am able to make a suitable amendment now, and if I cannot do so now, I undertake to see in the recess whether it will be possible to make an amendment.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member said that as far as clause 8 of the Bill was concerned, he felt that the word &#x201C;and&#x201D; at the end of paragraph (a) should be changed into &#x201C;or&#x201D;. In other words, he felt that it should be presented as an alternative. Section 11(1) of the Act provides for the circumvention of section 14 of the Deeds Registries Act. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposed section 11(2) of the Act will have a cumulative effect. The purchaser must comply with the provisions of the contract <i>and</i> an intermediary must be insolvent <i>or</i> the creditors of the sequestrated owner of the land must have attached the land itself. I hope this satisfies him as to this provision.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred quite rightly to the case of a purchaser who fails repeatedly to fulfil his obligations. This was referred to by other hon. members as well. It is quite true that in terms of the legislation a purchaser who has to make monthly payments may default every month and will then be entitled to receive a notice every month in terms of this provision. I concede that this may not be a practical arrangement and I shall see whether it is possible to insert a provision now or at a <span class="col_4697-4698" refersTo="page_0762"/>later stage to limit to a certain number or to a specified period the number of times a purchaser may default.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Walmer referred to certain aspects to which I have already replied. He asked whether I could not consider repealing section 72 of the Insolvency Act and fully incorporating the provisions of that Act in this legislation and providing that this is to be contained in the contract of purchase and sale. I hope I understood the hon. member correctly.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say at once that in the first place it is not customary to repeat all the provisions of an Act in another Act. Nor is it possible to remove them from the Insolvency Act, because they do not refer only to the purchase of land on instalments, but to other cases as well. What we are trying to do with this legislation is to achieve two objectives: Firstly, to set out the rights of the parties in the contracts and, secondly, to draw the purchaser&#x2019;s attention to his statutory rights. At the moment I think that a reference in the contract to the provisions of section 72 of the Insolvency Act is sufficient. We must not be under the illusion that most contracts of purchase and sale are drawn up by legal practitioners to begin with, or that they are, in the second place, checked by them. I want to emphasize that although I believe that the present provision is sufficient, we must also realize that for some purchasers one could repeat all the legal provisions and they would not read them in any case. The hon. member for Wynberg said that we should tell people and give publicity to the fact that certain rights and powers have been conferred upon them, and that they should consult their legal advisers to ensure that these will be properly incorporated into their contracts. That, I believe, is the correct attitude.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked whether we could not insert into the contracts a copy of the plan or of the township conditions of new townships. Let me say at once that I do not want to argue about the merits of the case at this stage. The powers and responsibilities of provincial administrations include, in the first place, the stipulation of the conditions for the lay-out of townships and, in the second place, the protection of purchasers&#x2019; rights in respect of new townships. Some provinces already have provisions in their ordinances which cover aspects to which the hon. member referred. I want to confine myself&#x2014;I hope the hon. member will accept this&#x2014;to making an appeal to all provincial administrations, in so far as they are competent to do so in terms of the enabling legislation applicable to them, to adjust the provincial legislation to make provision there as well for certain aspects such as those referred to by the hon. member, but in general for the protection of purchasers. I personally think that it would be preferable for a prohibition to be imposed on the sale of a plot in a particular phase of the development of a township until the conditions of the other one have been complied with. This can in fact be done by provincial administrations. My views on this point are very specific and I shall consult my colleagues in the provincial administrations &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and my future colleagues on this aspect in order to assist the hon. member in this particular regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member also requested that we should repeat the conditions for the establishment of townships in contracts of purchase and sale. The hon. member for Yeoville said that this would be expensive, but the hon. member for Walmer said that we could easily make photostats because these are very cheap at 5 cents a copy. However, the point is that this would serve no purpose, because we would have to go further than the hon. member is suggesting. It would mean that we would also have to repeat in contracts of purchase and sale all the title conditions of every deed of transfer relating to a plot which has already been transferred. The fact remains that in practice deeds of transfer contain the conditions of the township. These are repeated in the deed. All that is normally said in a contract of purchase and sale is that it is subject to the conditions referred to in the deed of transfer. I want to say at once that no purchaser is going to read through that deed or to ask for it. In other words, the evil, if it is such an evil, is much wider than the hon. member says. I really think that no case has been made out in this particular regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that I should make representations to the hon. the Minister of Finance in regard to the subsidy of 2%.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know why the hon. member anticipated me in saying that it is reasonable. He seems to think that I am going to accuse him of being unreasonable. The fact remains that purchasers do not qualify for the 2% today, except in respect of obligations under a building society and also when the purchaser has a specific income and when the amount of the bond does not exceed a certain amount. It sounds very popular to say that we are going to give purchasers of land on instalments the 2% subsidy as well, as if it existed automatically in any case. II is not automatic. The point I should like to make is that apart from my own standpoint in regard to the subsidy, that is not the responsibility of this legislation, after all. The hon. member will have the opportunity of discussing the subsidy under the Community Development Vote, for this is the department which is responsible for it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I ask the hon. the Minister a further question&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. the Minister to explain to me how the interest of 5% is calculated, as set out in the proposed section 14(1) inserted by clause 11.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The interest is calculated at a rate of 5% on that part of the purchase price which has already been paid, as from the date on which it was paid. The hon. member knows that the intention with this 5% is merely that it should be an equalizing interest rate. It is designed more or less to ensure that the money the man has paid retains its original value. The hon. member knows that this is so. He used to be a mayor and they had a revolving fund to which the same principle was applicable.</p>

<p>I just want to thank the hon. member for Potgietersrus, the hon. member for Pretoria West and the hon. members for Klerksdorp and Langlaagte for the contributions they made. [Interjections.] I want to say at once that in my opinion the hon. members specifically succeeded in giving a proper analysis of the legislation in respect of its design, objectives and application. I want to tell the hon. member for Pretoria West that I have already had amendments placed on the Order Paper in my name, which I intend to move in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say that I shall make or accept amendments to clause 6. On page 8, in line 18, the word &#x201C;upon&#x201D; will be deleted. Secondly, on page 8, in line 19, after the comma, the words &#x201C;apply in respect of&#x201D; will be inserted. I want to explain here that the provision relates to the fact that &#x201C;guarantee&#x201D; means the payment of the purchase price and interest. All I am adding to that is for the purposes of the contract itself, i.e. so that the interest rate may be continuous until transport has been given. On page 8, in line 26, the word &#x201C;upon&#x201D; will be deleted. In line 27, after the comma, the words &#x201C;apply in respect of&#x201D; will be inserted.

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to bring one or two matters to the notice of the hon. the Minister in relation to this clause. Firstly, it says in (b) that, in appointing members to the council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nine of the ordinary members of the council shall be persons who are appointed as such members on account of their knowledge or experience of medical schemes, and of such members&#x2014;</block>

<p>The first point I would like to draw to the attention of the hon. the Minister is that we are dealing here with doctors who are divided in their support of the Medical Schemes Act. There are some who are not co-operating with the Medical Schemes Act and others who are willing to do so.

<p>I would like to know what the feeling of the hon. the Minister is when he makes the appointments to this council. I would like to know whether he would appoint people who have already expressed themselves as being unwilling to co-operate with the scheme. In other words, will he consider appointing doctors who have contracted out to serve on this council&#x003F; That is the first question I wanted to ask.</p>

<p>Secondly, in paragraph (vi) we have a provision for the appointment of a person with special knowledge of medical schemes established under agreements published or deemed to have been published under section 48 of the Industrial Conciliation Act, 1956.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the Industrial Conciliation Act medical schemes are excluded from the provisions of this Act. Can the hon. the Minister tell me any reason whatsoever why we should have representation for the Industrial Conciliation Act representatives on this council&#x003F; If he is going to include members who represent the Industrial Conciliation Act, he will have to do the same in regard to the Railways. The hon. the Minister knows quite well that the Railways have been excluded from this. Why is he at this stage, while he is amending the Bill, including a member to be appointed to represent the Medical Schemes under the Industrial Conciliation Act and leaving out the Railways&#x003F; Could the hon. the Minister please answer those two questions for us&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as far as this question is concerned, I have already appointed in the Remuneration Commission in the past, medical practitioners that have contracted out. So, it is not an absolute principle that you exclude these people when having to appoint people on the council. As far as the people under the Industrial Conciliation Act are concerned, I think that it has also been accepted in the previous Act that as these people&#x2014;taking into account that they have only been excluded in terms of an arrangement between two Ministers&#x2014;represent a very big number of people on medical schemes, they should have representation in this instance. As far as I am concerned, they can make a very good contribution. That does not exclude the possibility of any representative under the benefit schemes, but at the moment there is nobody under <span class="col_4703-4704" refersTo="page_0765"/>the benefit schemes or, rather, from the Railways Sick Fund people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are amending an Act now and when one does that, one wants to exclude previous provisions or bring in other changes. One of the changes that I think ought to have been considered was the exclusion of representation of members under the Industrial Conciliation Act. If you are going to bring them in, then you cannot exclude representation from the S.A Railways Sick Fund. One must either include them both or one must exclude them both. You cannot include one and leave the other out. It is immaterial of what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s arrangements have been. We are here dealing, as the hon. the Minister has said, with a large group of people and if we want them to come into the scheme, and if we want them to learn about this scheme &#x2014;I will advise the hon. the Minister how to go about this later on&#x2014;then we should also do the same as far as the Railways are concerned.</p></speech>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I doubt it if the hon. member quite understood me. Actually the members of the Sick Fund of the Railway are under a benefit scheme and they have their representation. The Industrial Conciliation Act people do not have representation specifically.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to argue too long about this matter, but as far as I know&#x2014;and I know that the hon. the Minister knows this as well&#x2014; the Railways have excluded themselves entirely from the scheme. Nobody on this body which we are electing now will have any say whatsoever in the running of the Railway Sick Fund. The hon. the Minister knows that this excludes them absolutely, and permanently as far as I know. The hon. the Minister obviously does not know that this is the case, that although they are a benefit society, they have asked to be excluded. The then hon. the Minister, Mr. Schoeman, insisted that they be excluded. I sat on the Select Committee at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it seems to me as though the hon. member for Rosettenville has got hold of the wrong end of the stick. The Railways Sick Fund is a sick fund, while this legislation deals with the determination of tariffs. Under the Railways Sick Fund&#x2014;as the hon. member knows&#x2014;there are no specific tariffs. This involves a sick fund and doctors are paid <i>per capita.</i> Under the Industrial Conciliation Act, they are paid according to a certain tariff for a certain job. This is the real difference. The Railway Sick Fund is a completely different matter.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 10:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause is indeed an important one in view of the fact that it amends section 18 of the principal Act which gives the registrar or the council the right to cancel or suspend medical schemes. As I indicated during the Second Reading debate, such cancellation or suspension can have very serious effects, particularly on groups of persons who are unable to join any other scheme. I referred particularly to the position of widows. According to the latest report of the Department of Health, there are almost 14 000 widows and nearly 31 000 pensioners who are members of these schemes. If the scheme to which these members belong is suspended or cancelled and they are unable to join another scheme, they will then not be able to enjoy the benefits which they previously enjoyed and in most cases they will not be able to take other employment so as to enable them to become members of another scheme in terms of the provisions of one of the other clauses of this Bill. In terms of the principal Act, the registrar shall cancel the registration of a scheme on receiving proof to his satisfaction that the scheme has ceased to operate or if the registrar and the scheme are agreed that <span class="col_4705-4706" refersTo="page_0766"/>the scheme was registered by the State in circumstances not amounting to fraud, and then there is a proviso in terms of which this may be altered. The proposed new subsection (2) provides that the registrar may cancel or suspend the registration of a scheme if after investigation he is of the opinion that the registration of that scheme should be cancelled or suspended. In the first place I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that the suspension or cancellation of a scheme should only be resorted to with the greatest degree of circumspection because the effect of suspending or cancelling such a scheme would be to deprive the members of benefits. In terms of the proposed new subsection, the registrar may cancel or suspend a scheme merely after an investigation. It is not stated that the registrar must obtain the approval of the council or that he must consult the council before cancelling or suspending the scheme. It will be entirely within the discretion of the registrar to cancel or suspend a scheme. I think this considerably widens the provisions of section 18 of the principal Act, and I should be grateful if the hon. the Minister could give us some clarity as to the nature of the investigations that will have to be undertaken by the registrar before he exercises his power to suspend or cancel the registration, evidently without the approval of the council. The second portion of this new clause deals with the position where a scheme that persists in violating any provisions of the Act may result in the registrar then applying to the council for the cancellation or suspension of the registration of such scheme. Now, this is a provision which obviously is connected with a later clause, clause 18, which lays down what is virtually a code of ethics as far as medical schemes are concerned. The provisions of that clause also lay down, in regard to penalties, that every registered medical scheme under the Act, after an inquiry has been held by the council and the scheme has been found guilty of an act or omission contemplated in subsection (1), shall be liale to one or other of the following penalties, viz. a caution or reprimand or reprimand and caution, suspension for a specified period of its registration, or cancellation of its registration. As I see the situation, it would appear that there is ample provision in the second portion of this clause, taken in conjunction with clause 27 and with the penalties that might be imposed by the council, to cancel the registration of schemes which persistently violate any of the provisions of the Act, or if their conduct is deemed by the council to be of such a nature that the registration might be cancelled. However, the first portion of this clause is the one which I believe this Committee requires greater clarity on in view of the consequences if a scheme should be cancelled by the registrar after investigation without any provision that such investigation should at least include consultation with or have the approval of the council.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think it is only right for me to reply to the hon. member who has just sat down because he put this problem during the Second Reading debate. He expressed his concern in regard to widows, pensioners and similar people who might be affected by the cancellation of schemes. Now, I appreciate his concern, but I must tell him that as far as clause 10(a) is concerned it is not true that it is entirely within the powers of the registrar to decide, because the council must eventually approve what the registrar recommends. It is true that it is not a new principle, but the principle is being extended whereby the registration of a medical scheme can be cancelled. This principle is being extended. I must tell him that although to a certain extent I share his concern, the council for medical schemes is well aware of the vulnerable position in which some of these pensioners and other people concerned in this respect might be placed, and this situation is definitely something which I will give attention to. I think he has broached a subject here to which we must give attention. The main function of the council is to concern itself with the fact that schemes should be run on a sound financial basis. That is very important. They have ways and means of ensuring that many of these mistakes can be rectified. After all, there can be consultation; there can be a warning and there can be suspended cancellation, etc. Eventually the council will have to act. I can assure the hon. member that as far as the central council is concerned, I have made provision for a person with a knowledge of business and business ethics to sit on the council in future. As far as that is concerned. I think we will then be better able to advise these medical schemes how to run their businesses so as to see that their various members are in a better position. Steps will therefore be taken to ensure that they do not find themselves <span class="col_4707-4708" refersTo="page_0767"/>in these dire circumstances. I shall, however, put this matter before the council and let them investigate it to see whether we cannot create machinery to ensure that such persons can be accommodated. That was one of the main things that he had at the back of his mind in bringing up this subject. The hon. member also mentioned the problem that some doctors and dentists put endorsements on their accounts as far as receipts are concerned and so on. However, we shall come back to that later on. I must tell the hon. member that as far as that is concerned, it is for the council finally to decide. The hon. member was concerned about members whose position might be affected if the financial affairs of medical schemes were not in order or if the schemes did not apply sound business principles. I want to assure him that I shall have the position thoroughly investigated and I shall also ask the council to investigate the possibility of creating machinery in order to obviate such occurrences.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 14:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the reply of the hon. the Minister to the Second Reading debate he referred specifically to an aspect of this clause. I wish to make a few remarks in connection with this clause which, seeks to amend section 20 of the principal Act the marginal note of which reads:&#x201C;Matters for which a registered medical scheme shall provide.&#x201D; The section lists eight headings under which certain aspects of medical assistance shall be provided through the medical schemes. It refers among others to minimum benefits, to dependants, to continuation of membership after retirement, to widows, and to transfers from one scheme to another. Clause 14 entails a lengthy and fairly complex addition to the original section and to the amendment which was brought about by Act 95 of 1969. The amendment mainly embodies the terms, I believe, of the Friendly Societies Act.</p>

<p>In the light of the comments of the hon. the Minister when he replied to me during the Second Reading debate, the indications are that this clause makes provision in a small way for the assistance which we on this side of the House are seeking in regard to the Bill as a whole, namely that there should be State aid as far as possible to assist hard-luck cases. I know that the principle of the Bill has been accepted at Second Reading and I do not propose to enlarge upon that aspect. I merely want to say that this goes a little way to meet the requests of the Opposition and also the request of the original commission. I must refer to that because in the report of the commission it is stated quite clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your commission agreed that bodies which are to be controlled by the State &#x2026;</block>

<p>I think that the hon. the Minister in his remarks to the hon. member for Umbilo indicated that the State, the Minister as such, will be controlling the council to a certain extent.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; should not themselves provide the funds for such control, and decided therefore to amend the Bill so that an amount is paid annually from public funds to the fund and that such amount shall not be less than the administrative expenses of the central council for medical schemes during the preceding financial year.</block>

<p>Let me say once again for the benefit of some of our hon. colleagues on the opposite side that this is not a suggestion on our part that we want a welfare service or free medical services. In his reply to my request, the hon. the Minister referred to the new section 20B(5) as inserted by clause 15 of this Bill. It is a reasonably short subsection and I propose to refer to it briefly. I quote the new section 20B(5)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A registered scheme may, if its rules so provide&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) make donations &#x2026;</li>

<li>(b) grant loans to any of its members or make <i>ex gratia</i> payments on behalf of its members in order to assist such members to meet commitments in regard to any matters specified &#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_4709-4710" refersTo="page_0768"/>I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister on the question of the granting of loans. He should do so on the following basis. If the interest charged by medical schemes is on an economic and not sub-economic basis, some sort of subsidy should be provided by the State as far as the interest charged to people who are forced to ask for loans because they have had a limitation of their benefits or because they have had excessive expense is concerned. There are always precedents, and I want to mention a precedent for the consideration of the hon. the Minister. I refer to a Press Release indicating an improved loan scheme for the housing of farm labourers. I think that such a step is to be commended but I also believe that sick people are also entitled to improved loans. According to the statement on the improved loan schemes for farmers, assistance has been increased. The Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing will contribute four-fifths of the interest by way of a subsidy so that the farmer will be called upon to pay only one percent. My suggestion to the hon. the Minister, if the State is not prepared to subsidize these people directly, is that the hon. the Minister give serious consideration to ensuring that if it is not an <i>ex gratia</i> payment but a loan which the medical aid scheme offers to a person in distress, the interest on the loan be the very minimum. I believe it is only fair to ask that for people who suffer from health disabilities.</p>

<p>To sum up, I want to ask the hon. the Minister to try to ensure that the rules provide for such loans to be on a sub-economic repayment basis as far as interest is concerned. I also believe that he should make absolutely certain that <i>all</i> medical aid schemes comply with this provision, viz. that they grant loans. The proposed new section 20B(5) provides that a registered scheme may grant loans &#x201C;if its rules so provide&#x201D;. I suggest that every medical aid scheme should be forced to provide such means within the rules of that scheme.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the first and foremost principle that we must consider is that provision is made for <i>ex gratia</i> payments and loans. The second principle to be considered is whether these loans should be on a differential basis since it all depends on what the person&#x2019;s specific financial position is. Medical schemes can decide in terms of their regulations how they are going to apply their interest rates. It is perhaps a matter which should be investigated. Nevertheless I must tell hon. members that farmers and agricultural people as such are very fortunate these days. They are among the persons who are often helped by the State. I do not want to compare their case with this case as their circumstances are completely different. I do not want to compare farmers with people who are in need or in trouble as far as medical or health care is concerned. As far as the State is concerned ample provision is made for these people because they can go to the district surgeons or to the provincial hospitals which aid these people if they are really in need and in straitened financial circumstances. Nevertheless, it is a point to ponder on for the medical schemes as such has been said, it is something on which they will have to decide. I think, however, that it is going to depend on the specific type of case and on the merits of the case.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. F. WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the hon. the Minister for his explanation and I trust that he will see that this matter is gone into carefully. I realize, Sir, you would rule me out of order if I were to deal with the inadequacies of the present situation with regard to the services supplied by full-time district surgeons in city areas, but this is a case where people, because they are unable to get these services, require some form of assistance under the medical aid scheme. That is the object of my raising this matter with the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Clause agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 23:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, clause 23 deals with the Remuneration Commission. This is probably one of the most important aspects of this Bill. Almost all the dissatisfaction between the doctors and the medical aid schemes has revolved around the Remuneration Commission. Subsection (2)(a) on page 52 of the Bill reads as follows: Subject to the provisions of subsection (6), the Commission shall consist of &#x2026; a judge, or a person practising as an advocate, of the Supreme Court, who shall be the chairman thereof &#x2026;</p>

<p><span class="col_4711-4712" refersTo="page_0769"/>There is a big jump between a judge and a practising advocate of the Supreme Court. The advocate is in no way defined in this Bill. He may be a newly appointed man, a man who has just been admitted to the Bar. Is the hon. the Minister seriously going to consider appointing an advocate as chairman of the Remuneration Commission while he may have no experience whatsoever in this type of work or in any similar type of work. It would be equivalent to taking a doctor who has not even done his internship and asking him to perform a major operation and expecting good results. Therefore I want to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 52, in line 30, after &#x201C;advocate&#x201D;, to insert:</block>

<block name="quote">of not fewer than ten years&#x2019; standing</block>

<p>This amendment is fair enough. It gives the advocate standing and it gives the members of the commission confidence in the chairman, and I am certain that he would get good results and co-operation from the commission. Without this, one may immediately get queries, and dissatisfaction particularly from the Medical Association. They are going to say: &#x201C;Here we have a young fellow who has just qualified and yet he is going to determine through his commission what we are to be paid.&#x201D; I do not like that at all and I am sure the hon. the Minister himself does not. This may be an omission. I ask him please to accept this amendment. It will put a lot of fears to rest. The Medical Association particularly are very perturbed at the possibility of him appointing just such a man.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I respect what the hon. member for Rosettenville said, but if he reads the clause in its entirety, he will most probably see the matter in a different light. It is not a case of the hon. the Minister being able to drag in a young advocate and appoint him as chairman of the Remuneration Commission. After all, the subsection provides that it may be a judge &#x201C;or&#x201D; an advocate. The fact that it may be a judge &#x201C;or&#x201D; an advocate, really implies that in the case where a judge is not available and a certain case must come before the commission immediately, the Minister may, in that case, appoint an advocate. It will not be just any advocate either. If the hon. member reads the clause, he will see that the advocate is to be appointed by the Minister in consultation with the Minister of Justice. Surely the hon. the Minister of Health will not approach the hon. the Minister of Justice with the request, &#x201C;Colleague, is there an advocate who is at a loose end and to whom I can give a small job&#x003F;&#x201D; [Interjection.] That is certainly not the attitude which the hon. the Minister will adopt. Surely the Minister will ask the Minister of Justice whether there is an advocate with the necessary experience to do the job. However, to prescribe that it must be a person with at least 10 years&#x2019; experience, is something to which I cannot agree.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must agree with the hon. member for Brentwood, but I do feel nontheless that the arguments of the hon. member for Rosettenville have merit as well.</p>

<p>&#x2020;To a certain extent I agree with him that we might not be able to get experienced people. We want to have experienced people. They have to decide on monetary matters. You cannot equate such a situation with the medical profession, because doctors are concerned with the lives of people. That is why we have a provision that a medical practitioner must be at least 4 years qualified before he can issue a mental S2 certificate. This is perhaps a point in question.</p>

<p>Yes, that is so, but that has to do with the lives of people and experience counts a lot in that regard. Experience does count a lot everywhere, although many young people do not want to acknowledge it. However, an amendment of this nature would restrict the possibility of finding a suitable person from the outset. If you have a good advocate of seven or eight years&#x2019; standing, he would be quite capable of doing this job. It is not so easy to find a suitable person within three months. Hon. members must take into account that I have to adhere to a time limit in this regard. Hon. members must also keep in mind that I must make this appointment in consultation with the Minister of Justice, who does not have many people available. I therefore feel that hon. members <span class="col_4713-4714" refersTo="page_0770"/>must be more fair in this respect. Let us, at the start, be a little flexible as far as this matter is concerned. I am not going to try to get newly-qualified advocates for this purpose and will be led by my colleague, the Minister of Justice.</p>

<p>Because it will be in consultation with me there is no danger. We might have a man of five, six, eight, nine or 9&#x00BD; years experience who may be most suitable for this job. We have at least 28 of these supplementary health services and I want to ask the hon. member not to expect me to accept this amendment at this stage. He can safely leave this matter in my own hands and in that of the hon. the Minister of Justice. In a year or two&#x2019;s time, when we have had a little more experience, we can then decide better in regard to this matter. I do ask that hon. member not to tie my hands at the start, because I want to see how this system is going to work.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister has given no reasons at all why he should not accept my amendment. He himself suggested that a man of seven or eight years experience would be fair. I do not want to go on an auction sale with the hon. the Minister and argue with him whether it should be a man of 10, eight or seven years&#x2019; experience, but will settle with him if he says seven years. I will accept seven years if the hon. the Minister would. The hon. the Minister now says that he is going to make the appointment in consultation with the hon. the Minister of Justice. In reply to the hon. member for Brentwood, I would say that he does not seem to realize that the very fact that the hon. the Minister has added the words &#x201C;or a person practising as an advocate&#x201D; after the word &#x201C;judge&#x201D; means that he does not have sufficient judges for this purpose. It is almost certain that if he cannot obtain the services of a retired judge&#x2014;although it does not refer to a retired judge&#x2014;he will have to employ an advocate. I do not want a newly qualified advocate even if it is after consultation with the Minister of Justice. I do not want that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in my Second Reading Speech I made it very clear that it is not the object of this legislation to control the medical profession. In the new section 32(2) which is being inserted in the principal Act by clause 24(a), it appears as though an obligation is being imposed upon a medical practitioner to submit his second account directly to a scheme. I feel this may be somewhat contrary to the objects of the principal Act. One also has to take into consideration that there is no need for a medical scheme to pay an account after a period of, say, four months if the account is not submitted at the end of the fourth month. For that reason I want to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On page 56, in line 58, to omit &#x201C;shall&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;may&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I feel that this will protect the medical practitioner and will enable him to conduct negotiations with the medical scheme and that it will also leave scope for negotiations between the medical practitioners and the medical schemes. I also think this will be more in line with the spirit of the Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to keep the House for any length of time. I should like to clear up one or two matters which have been raised by hon. members on the other side of the House.</p>

<p>When I appealed to the House and to the hon. the Minister to consider bringing into being a voluntary national health scheme, it was not my intention, and it has never been my intention, either to encourage a welfare state in this country or to ask for a national health service. The impression I gained was that one or two hon. members on the other side of the House did think that we on this side of the House were trying to suggest that the Government should introduce a national health service in this country. That is something with which we on this side of the House will have nothing to do. What we are asking for is a voluntary contributory medical aid scheme for the whole of the Republic. We want all those people who want to contribute to medical aid schemes to have the opportunity of doing so. At the moment there are many thousands of people who are denied this privilege. The hon. member for Umbilo this evening pointed out one group specifically towards whom the hon. the Minister himself was sympathetic and said he was going to take steps to see what he can do about it. I would like to tell the hon. the Minister that this medical aid schemes Bill, we have at the moment before us, can be a first-class basis for bringing into being a voluntary medical aid scheme at the opportune time and, which I hope will be soon. It should be a medical aid scheme whereby the contributor, the employer of the contributor and the Government, i.e. the State, can each put their share into the pool. Each one of these three groups must be prepared to share the cost of it. It is a reasonable request and there are many hon. members on that side of the House who would like to see it done. The costs of treating illness today are becoming astronomic. The ordinary man in the street could not possibly pay the full amount. Even when he belongs to a medical aid scheme or any other benefit society, the ordinary man in the street often finds that he cannot pay the excesses he is responsible for. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister again this evening to consider this once more and to see whether or not he could bring this about as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Houghton supported the introduction of this amendment Bill to the Medical Schemes Act, 1967, on behalf of these benches during the Second Reading. The fact that there are over 30 pages of amendments to the Medical Schemes Act, clearly indicates the defects that exist in the present Act.</p>

<p>There are three groups of people who are directly concerned with the Medical Schemes Act. The first, obviously, the one who ought to receive the major priority, is the patient himself. It is well-known that many members of medical aid societies have expressed their dissatisfaction and their disillusionment with the present system. Contributions have been rising steadily and continuously. We would most warmly support the proposal that has been made by the hon. member for Rosettenville. To us it seems completely reasonable and long overdue. We welcome many of the clauses of this amending Bill before us. It brings considerable improvement to the present situation. Approximately 80% of all White people in South Africa are affected by this Bill. This again suggests just how important this legislation is. More and more Coloured, and Indian people particularly, as well as African people&#x2014;although these to a lesser degree&#x2014;are beginning to join these schemes. Once again this indicates that so many people of South Africa are directly affected. Their health and their concern are very much at stake in this Bill. The other group of people who are directly concerned under this Bill are, of course, the doctors themselves. In the Second Reading debate the hon. member for Houghton and indeed many other hon. members indicated that the members of the medical profession have been more than a little unhappy, and rightly so, up to this point. The mere fact that approximately 2 000 doctors have contracted out of medical schemes gives point to their dissatisfaction. The findings of the Remuneration Commission have been totally unacceptable to the majority of the members of the medical profession. Sir, all the details were spelt out in the Second Reading debate, so there is no need for me to enlarge on that, or <span class="col_4717-4718" refersTo="page_0772"/>indeed to repeat what has already been said.</p>

I thought I should say that myself before you call me to order. Sir, the letter to which my hon. friends to the left are referring in this instance is a very important letter from Dr. Glauber in the <i>South African Medical Journal.</i> That letter makes very good reference to the sort of changes which are required in terms of the Remuneration Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we welcome very especially the appointment of the Anomalies Committee. We would urge upon the hon. the Minister to see that this committee gets to work as soon as possible in order that the anomalies which do exist can be dealt with. Sir, obviously the smooth administration of this measure is going to be the best possible way of attracting back into the medical schemes the hundreds of doctors who have contracted out. Once this legislation has been passed, a great deal of work will remain to be done. Sir, we in these benches have pleasure in supporting the Third Reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I should like to thank hon. members opposite for supporting the Third Reading of this Bill. This is a Bill on which we have been working for a period of one year and in regard to which we had to have frequent consultations and discussions with various interested groups. It was not always an easy thing to reconcile the conflicting interests. Hon. members referred to the dissatisfaction prevailing in the medical hierarchy with the medical schemes and so on. Sir, this Act has been on the Statute Book for approximately seven to eight years. During this time we have discovered certain deficiencies in the Act, which I referred to earlier last year. We decided to try to eliminate these deficiencies one by one in the light of the experience we gained. Since we are dealing here with medical schemes we should bear in mind that we originally introduced this legislation to regulate medical schemes in such a manner that they should eventually involve an increasing number of our people, so as to make certain by means of a method of medical assurance, that they need have no concern for the day when illness occurs and when financial problems arise as a result.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Pinelands referred to the various races and to the existing dissatisfaction. Sir, I am not going to go into the various reasons for this dissatisfaction. I think we have managed to reach at least some sort of agreement with many of these various interest groups. The very fact that this is such a voluminous Bill should convince the hon. member that we have at least done our best to see whether we cannot iron out the present difficulties. I think we have succeeded 99% in doing so. We still have certain differences with regard to the question of contracting in and contracting out of the schemes, but nevertheless I believe that with the attitude of reasonableness that we have on both sides, we will be able to solve these problems as well. Sir, the hon. member for Rosettenville dealt with the question of a voluntary medical aid scheme. In this connection I must say that there are moves afoot to extend the whole area of medical aid schemes. We want to expand the medical aid schemes, but we want to do so on a voluntary basis. At this juncture we cannot introduce a national scheme. We cannot get the various medical schemes together immediately, but there are moves afoot to get more and more medical schemes involving all the people of South Africa. But as the hon. member points out, we already have at least 80% of the White people involved in these schemes.</p>

<p>*Also as far as the poor and needy patients are concerned, it is a fact that the Government takes care of our people who are in need.</p>

<p>There was a transitional period during which we have made mistakes. Misunderstandings were defined to the point where one was unable to concede on a principle and if the medical profession wishes to retain its full autonomy and wishes to have its right as a profession to charge whatever fee it likes, it must accept that there will never be any agreement.</p>

<p>This Government and we, as a Parliament, have an obligation to reduce the average medical expenses and those in respect of health services for our people, and for that reason the medical profession should sacrifice some autonomy and should <span class="col_4719-4720" refersTo="page_0773"/>be prepared to sacrifice, contractually, some of that autonomy by charging a standard fee. Then someone must not come along and tell me that the service he renders to a wealthy person is worth so much more than the service he renders to the poor person, because this is not according to the highest traditions of the medical profession. If we do not want to be socialistic now and would still like to maintain the relationship between the patient and the medical practitioner, I believe it is a matter of give and take.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I have often referred to this &#x201C;give and take&#x201D; philosophy which is part and parcel of the philosophy of our times, and even the medical profession must be prepared to sacrifice a little of its autonomy because of the bigger prospects and the bigger interests and the bigger principles that are involved as far as the public at large are concerned.</p>

<p>*Therefore I just want to say that I have listened very carefully to all the ideas which have been expressed here and that I have taken cognizance of them, but that I am unable to consider a national contributory scheme at this stage. We are still in a stage in which we are developing and in view of the existing facilities we have today to ensure our people of medical services, I think we are sufficiently protected so that there is no one who cannot be certain of the best medical service available in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>In pursuing its objects in connection with the development and financing of industrial development in South Africa, as envisaged in section 3 of the Act in terms of which the Industrial Development Corporation was established i.e. Act No. 22 of 1940, and especially in the field of import and export finance and of obtaining credit and loans abroad, a wide range of financing activities, which have to be undertaken by the corporation from day to day, arises.</p>

<p>In the light of prevailing fiscal conditions and for strategic and practical reasons, either the corporation or its wholly owned subsidiaries often act as principals or as channels for obtaining foreign loans and credits as well as for investing and utilizing such funds to encourage and to finance industrial development in the Republic. In this financing role played by the corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries and especially in the field of import and export financing, the corporation or its wholly owned subsidiaries are often required to provide guarantees or indemnities in respect of financing facilities made available to the corporation or such a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation. In addition to this, cases also occur of certain concerns insisting on such guarantees and indemnities being backed by State guarantees and State indemnities in order to improve or put beyond any doubt the credit worthiness and negotiating position of the corporation or its wholly owned subsidiary concerned.</p>

<p>The amendments to the Act embodied in this Bill, arise from two problems which are being experienced in this process, and they are, firstly, the limited powers of the Minister of Economic Affairs in the present Act as far as surety is concerned; and, secondly, the lack of any statutory power for the corporation or the Minister to provide indemnities or indemnifications.</p>

<p>As far as the provision of guarantees is concerned, the corporation and the Minister of Economic Affairs already have the power to issue guarantees in terms of the provisions of sections 4(e) and 5<i>bis</i>(1)(b) of the Act, respectively, in order to enable the corporation to take up loans. The powers of the Minister, however, are limited to guarantees which do not exceed a total amount of R30 million, jointly or separately, in respect of loan funds taken up abroad.</p>

<p>Hon. members will agree with me that when these powers were originally granted, a limit of R30 million probably was a realistic one, but that it is no longer a realistic figure in terms of the present-day value of money and the proportions which the financing of important projects may assume. In fact, guarantees for the total amount have already been issued, and additional provision will have to be made now as a matter of necessity if the efficient operation of the corporation is not to be curbed. Under <span class="col_4721-4722" refersTo="page_0774"/>the circumstances clause 2 of the Bill consequently seeks to raise this limit to R200 million.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In this connection I may remind the House that the hon. the Minister of Finance had to approach Parliament last year with a similar request to raise the limit of State guarantees in respect of loans by certain concerns in terms of the Finance Act, 1966, from R50 million to R300 million. Section 9 of the Finance Act, 1974, gave effect to this amendment.</p>

<p>The second problem to which I have referred arises from the fact that, although the corporation and the Minister are empowered by the existing Act to issue guarantees within the limits stipulated by section <i>5bis</i> of the Act, the relative powers do not include the power to issue indemnities.</p>

<p>As indemnities are often preferred and required in present day circumstances as security by certain concerns, it is considered necessary that the corporation and the Minister should have the power to issue surety for loans in the form of indemnities by the corporation backed by counter-indemnities by the South African Government as provided for in clauses 1 and 2(c) of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in essence these are the principles involved in this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#van_hoogstraten">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. A. VAN HOOGSTRATEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, the hon. the Minister is seeking to amend the original Act No. 22 of 1940 which brought into being the Industrial Development Corporation as it is now known. I feel that we on this side of the House cannot let this opportunity go by without restating the fundamental philosophy which underlies our beliefs concerning the activities of the Industrial Development Corporation. I believe that we should go back to the original Bill which was enacted in 1940 and take one look at the intentions as expressed by the then hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Stuttaford, when he stated what has remained our fundamental philosophy. In Hansard, 1940, volume 38, col. 3940 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Anyone who has known me in this House in the last sixteen years that I have been a member knows quite well that I hate Government messing about with any industries, but I want to explain that in this case they are not going to be industrialists themselves, they are only going to help enterprising industrialists to find the money to finance their own industries.</block>

<p>Further on in his speech he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If members refer to the Bill they will see that clause 3 lays down the objects. A power is taken not only to establish new industries but to persuade industrialists overseas to come here and bring their capital out here and establish branches of their business here. As one knows, there are several big concerns all over Europe and America which have vast resources and can provide us with establishments and capital, and employ our people in carrying out these industries.</block>

<p>In col. 3941 we read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As I say, the idea is that we are not going to provide a lot of capital for a few industries, but we are going to provide capital by underwriting the various propositions, and as and when the market will take up the shares which we underwrite then our money comes back to us and it can be re-invested in further undertakings.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor has stated quite clearly too that it is the belief of that side of the House that the State should interfere as little as possible in private enterprise. We who have watched the growth of this giant corporation, have constantly reiterated our belief that it is our function to ensure that the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa should confine itself to its original aims as set out in the Act. However, I want to say immediately to the hon. the Minister that we realize that the case is justified that he has made out for the necessity for the corporation in these modern times either to borrow money itself or to allow its wholly-owned subsidiaries to borrow money overseas for specific purposes in order to advance our tremendous industrial development. If I look at the annual report of the corporation which provides for schemes for the financing of export capacity and for the financing of export capital goods as well as for import financing, I want to say immediately that we on this side of the House are going to support the hon. the Minister in the passing of this Bill. We realize that the corporation and its wholly <span class="col_4723-4724" refersTo="page_0775"/>owned subsidiaries today have to raise funds overseas either for import/export finance or for international loans. Before the necessary credits can be obtained, overseas, the banks and overseas financiers want to know what comeback they have if the Industrial Development Corporation were to fail and they are looking not only for guarantees but also for indemnities. To the extent that they have the right to do so &#x2014;we believe it is a logical right&#x2014;we support the objects of the Bill.</p>

<p>We realize too that the corporation can only fall back on the Government itself. Section 4 of the Act provides for the powers of the corporation &#x201C;to guarantee any undertaking given in relation to the financing of any company or the performance of any contract by any company&#x201D;. I realize that guarantees are not as strong as indemnities and what the hon. the Minister is seeking is the authority to have indemnification as well as guarantees and we support that proposal.</p>

<p>In terms of section 5<i>bis</i> which is proposed to be amended by clause 2 the Minister can at the moment assist the corporation, but he may not go beyond a loan of R30 million unless Parliament by means of a resolution of both Houses gives the necessary approval. R30 million in 1940 and R30 milion today does not have exactly the same value. The hon. the Minister is now seeking authority to have the R30 million increased to R200 million. This is only realistic and again we support that.</p>

<p>We understand too that the corporation will look in the final instance to the Government to back its guarantees with, indemnities. If we have regard to the tremendous industrial development which confronts this country, if we have regard to our possibilities in the future and to the tremendous necessity for creating further job opportunities in South Africa, we can go along with, the Government. However, we want to stress our belief that the hon. the Minister should give us undertakings that the funds raised will be for the purposes stated and will not merely be channelled into ideological developments in the border areas. However much they may be necessary, we believe that the border areas can well look after themselves and we ask the hon. the Minister to be extremely parsimonious in his usage of any funds for purposes of development unless he has the intention that once these developments have taken place and have come to fruition, he will then consider offering the shares back again to the public, so that the moneys of the Industrial Development Corporation can be used to increase its turnover and be re-invested in opportunities for further development. With these words, I wish to indicate that we as the official Opposition will support the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waddell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. WADDELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great interest to what the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens had to say. In regard to two major points, which I hope to come back to, we are in full agreement with him. This is a short Bill which seeks to amend the provisions of the Industrial Development Act of 1940 in so far as four aspects are concerned, but it is not without importance, if only because it seeks to give the hon. the Minister the power, or to permit the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa, to raise the level of loan finance that may be raised by the corporation or indeed by its subsidiaries from R30 million to R200 million. That is an increase of R170 million and that is not without importance in our view. The hon. the Minister mentioned two points, the first of which is in regard to the indemnities, which I will come back to. Secondly, he also made a perfectly valid point in relation to the scope or size of developments. He pointed out that the range or level of finance which is now required is clearly not the same as it was in 1940 and certainly, therefore, there is an element of common sense in raising the limit.</p>

<p>I would also like to comment, before I come back to these points, on two other aspects. This proposed legislation widens the net in the sense of allowing this amount to be borrowed not only by the corporation itself, but also by wholly-owned subsidiaries of that corporation. We would regard that as a change of convenience and in line with normal business practice, but certainly not a change of substance. As such, we have absolutely no objection to it, nor to the similar change contemplated to section 5<i>bis</i> (1)(b)(i) of the principal Act.</p>

<p>There is, of course, another consequential amendment in the sense that this power is simply passed on to the Government. Clause 1 seeks to amend or widen the powers granted to the Industrial Corporation of South Africa in some important respects. Previously section 4(e) of the Act read: &#x201C;to <span class="col_4725-4726" refersTo="page_0776"/>guarantee any undertaking given in relation to the financing of any company or the performance of any contract by any company.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The proposal before us now extends that to cover the indemnification of &#x201C;any company or person in respect of the costs attaching to suits, or in respect of any loss &#x2014;and I emphasize the words &#x201C;any loss&#x201D;, because I would like to seek clarification from the hon. the Minister in this regard&#x2014; or damage, arising from (i) the financing by such company or other person of any other company or other person; or (ii) the entering into any contract by such company or other person.&#x201D; I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that, unless he can convince us in these benches to the contrary, these are very broad powers as they are now stated, unless we have misunderstood the meaning of the words. I would like the hon. the Minister to give an answer in this connection when he comes to reply to some questions that we have in relation to this particular wording, so that at least we will have more clarification as to what he has in mind. In the first instance we would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the Industrial Development Corporation is in the habit of entering into contracts with an individual or person as opposed to a company and whether it does so frequently or infrequently. Personally, we would not have thought that the IDC would enter into contracts with parties other than companies except on very rare occasions. I hope the hon. the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, or give us an explanation. The reason why we put this question is that the wording &#x201C;or other person&#x201D; is introduced after &#x201C;company&#x201D; in this Bill.</p>

<p>There is a second question we want to put to the hon. the Minister. As we understand it, it may very well be that the IDC may be called upon to give an indemnity on behalf of another company in which it is interested, such as to a foreign or overseas party or to a third party with which it is about to enter into a contract. The indemnity is, as we have said, against the costs attaching to suits or in respect of any loss&#x2014; this is what worries us&#x2014;or damage arising from the entering into any contract by such company or other person. A guarantee is usually limited to a fixed sum of money, whereas an indemnity as we understand it is related to performance. In that sense it is not in the first instance related either to price, to value or to a fixed sum of money. Let me take an example in order to get our own minds clear. Say a subsidiary of the IDC is about to enter into a contract with a French, German or American supplier to supply equipment to the value of R15 million, to choose a figure at random. It may well be reasonable for that foreign supplier to ask the IDC for an indemnity against the failure of that company in which it is interested or which may even be a subsidiary of the IDC, to fulfil its obligations. However, as we understand it, the wording goes even further than that. It indemnifies the foreign supplier against any loss from entering into any contract with such a company. If we understand it correctly that is surely going very far as it amounts to underwriting the foreign supplier so that in effect he is in a position of no risk. He cannot lose money on the contract unless we have misunderstood the wording. All we in these benches can say is that the practical experience of business&#x2014; and this is a somewhat similar case or even an analogous case&#x2014;is that, if one enters into a contract with another business entity on the basis of cost-plus, it is hardly a spur to his efficiency to produce or perform at the lowest cost. I hope that, when the hon. the Minister has a chance, he will give us further clarification on this point.</p>

<p>I would now like to come back to the question of allowing the Minister, which is what is asked for in this Bill, subject to certain conditions to which I will refer, to guarantee a further R170 million of loan finance to be raised by the IDC for itself without the necessity of coming back, as is provided for in the present Act, to ask for a resolution of both. Houses authorizing the raising of the limit. This is a very important matter in view of the very large increase from R30 million to R200 million sought by the Minister. I would have thought that both this House and the Other Place would want to consider very carefully the safeguards in the legislation which are still there, or to put it another way, the restraints on the conditions placed both upon the Minister and more particularly On the Industrial Development Corporation itself. I think it would be fair to say that this has an added relevance at the present time when the level of expenditure of the Government, both directly and through the public corporations, has become an issue with which we should all be concerned from two points of view, namely the expenditure <span class="col_4727-4728" refersTo="page_0777"/>in the aggregate, because it has been proven over the years without doubt to be inflationary and less productive and, secondly, because it is making greater and greater incursions into the spheres of the private sector. The Industrial Development Corporation and its development is, of course, germane to this particular issue. I do not think that it could be denied that the Government, directly or indirectly, is playing a greater and greater role in our mixed economy. I would like to emphasize that I accept that we live in a mixed economy and that the Government certainly does have a role to play. But the role of public corporations and indeed of vehicles such as the IDC, in a number of cases as the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens has mentioned, has moved far beyond the role that they were originally intended to play in the economic development of the country. This is neither healthy nor desirable since the public sector is neither as efficient nor as flexible as the private sector. Nor does the public sector operate within the same framework of the disciplines imposed by the necessity to make a reasonable profit and by the presence of shareholders. No one is going to deny, as I have said, that it is desirable for the State and its public vehicle or corporations such as Iscor, Escom and the IDC to play this part, but&#x2014;here again I must agree with the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens&#x2014;they should not become involved directly or indirectly, with spheres of activities where the private sector can or would undertake to provide the finance and accept the risks involved in the business. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give us an assurance in this regard. I will come back to it at the end of my speech. Because if the Government, Iscor, Escom, Meteor or the Industrial Development Corporation does not so refrain but instead simply continues to encroach on the private sector, then whatever it may say about being the champion of capitalism and free enterprise, its participation in effect amounts to a form of nationalization or socialism.</p>

<p>The example of the Industrial Development Corporation and of the legislation before us is a case in point, because we can only assume that the hon. the Minister has come to this House and asked for the limit on loan finance to be raised from R30 million to R200 million because it is the intention in the immediate or near future to raise, if not the whole of that additional R170 million, then certainly a significant portion of it, otherwise it would be slightly unusual to come with such a request in this Bill. I want to come back to the constraints which are in the present legislation and which, indeed, remain under the current legislation, and that is that the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs can only authorize or permit the raising of this very substantial additional amount of money with, in the first place, the concurrence of the Minister of Finance. That is a very reasonable constraint upon his freedom of action. With the concurrence of the hon. the Minister of Finance, he may guarantee the raising of such loans subject, firstly, to the provisions of section 4(f) which states, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the amount owing at any time in respect of loans raised or moneys borrowed shall not, without the approval of the shareholders previously given at a meeting of shareholders, exceed three-fourths of the issued capital of the corporation at that time.</block>

<p>This is also not an unreasonable restriction in terms of normal business practice. There is, however, a further restriction which is set out in terms of section <i>5bis</i>(<i>a</i>) and <i>5bis</i>(<i>b</i>)<i>.</i> Section <i>5bis</i>(<i>a</i>) states that any such loans must be&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">for the purpose of assisting in financing the establishment or operation of any undertaking for the production of oil from coal.</block>

<p>That is the first restriction. The hon. the Minister has not mentioned any such purpose in seeking this amendment so we must assume that it falls under the second category in <i>5bis</i>(<i>b</i>) which is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">for the purpose of enabling the corporation to attain its objects &#x2026;</block>

<p>In considering whether or not to support the request of the hon. the Minister to be given this permission, we must also then bear in mind the objects of the corporation. As the hon. the Minister will know, these are set out in section 3 of the principal Act. To this we only have to add the <i>caveat</i> or rider that as we understand it it was never the intention that the IDC should manage or conduct business enterprises where the private sector was able and willing to do so. There is an inference of <span class="col_4729-4730" refersTo="page_0778"/>confirmation of this in section 5(c) of the principal Act, which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">that, generally, the activities of the corporation referred to in paragraph (b) of section <i>three</i> are directed towards guiding and assisting others in financing the establishment or development of industries or industrial undertakings and that, so far as may be practicable, the corporation shall not be required to provide an unduly large proportion of the capital which is necessary for such establishment or development.</block>

<p>Two points are worthy of note in this respect. Firstly, the stress is laid on assistance to others and this is reinforced by the emphasis given to restricting the size of the IDC&#x2019;s commitment as far as is practicable. We take this to mean that where private enterprise is both willing and able to initiate the enterprise, the IDC should have no role or part to play, as inferred in the provision I have just quoted. We hope that the hon. the Minister will clarify this point because we feel that the corporation should actually be barred from doing so.</p>

<p>There is another aspect I should like to deal with. In circumstances where the IDC does feel itself obliged to participate even under the restrictions imposed upon it in terms of section 5 of the principal Act which are designed to keep its investment to the minimum, there is still the important aspect of time. The question which needs to be asked in relation to the IDC is whether it intends to play a part permanently in so far as its participation will permit it to do so or whether it is intended that the corporation will only hold an investment in a temporary sense from which it can move on as and when circumstances commit it to other enterprises. I should like here to return to what was said by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens. I want to go a little further in relation to what was said by the then Minister of Commerce and Industries in 1940 when this corporation was established as to what its future role would be. It is, of course, a matter for the record that this legislation was initiated by a United Party Government and agreed to by the Nationalist Party. The Minister of Commerce and Industries at the time said the following. This has already been partly quoted by the hon. member for Cape Town Gardnes, but I should like to go a little further than he did. The Minister had this to say on 28 March 1940 (Hansard, Volume 38, column 3941)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As I say, the idea is that we are not going to provide a lot of capital for a few industries, but we are going to provide capital by underwriting the various propositions, and as and when the market will take up the shares which we underwrite then our money comes back to us and it can be re-invested in further undertakings. We shall not have a lot of frozen assets, we shall constantly be turning over our assets so as to spread the benefit of this Corporation wider and wider.</block>

<p>It seems to be abundantly clear from that that the role of the Industrial Development Corporation was to nurse industries through the pains of birth where the private sector was not prepared to do so and once these were successfully established, to dispose of their interest and to move on to invest the proceeds in new and different ventures in the same sort of category, where the private sector at that point in time was for one reason or another either unable or unwilling to do so. Indeed, this was explicitly recognized by the present chairman of the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa in his statement for the year ended 30 June 1974, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the objective of the Industrial Development Corporation to utilize its resources as effectively as possible and to maintain its level of repayment at a high rate to finance new developments.</block>

<p>This is a similar theme, Mr. Speaker, but there is one significant difference. The chairman of the IDC speaks of the objective of the IDC as being to maintain its level of repayments at a high rate to finance new developments, but there is one notable omission in that statement by the chairman of the IDC, and that is that there is no mention of the sale of any equity interests. As I understand this statement of the chairman of the IDC, these can therefore be retained indefinitely or at least disposed of at leisure by the IDC. That, Mr. Speaker, is quite a different kettle of fish, because it certainly holds out the possibility of the corporation retaining a substantial and increasing stake in the control and management of our economy, where it is both unnecessary and undesirable. Sir, the hon. the Minister will be well aware of the facts <span class="col_4731-4732" refersTo="page_0779"/>of life, in the sense that an equity interest of quite modest proportions, when held by the IDC, will have or may have a weight or influence quite disproportionate to it in the conduct of the affairs of the company involved.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to an interesting table which may be found on page 24 of the latest report of the Industrial Development Corporation. This table sets out the total number of applications approved, and the amounts involved, since 1 October 1940. The total number of applications approved is 1 636, and the amount of money involved is near enough R1,4 billion. When one looks at the balance sheet as at 30 June 1974 one finds that it shows assets and liabilities of some R620 million. Now we of course appreciate the fact that the corporation&#x2019;s profit after tax of some R15&#x00BD; million, or a return of just over <i>2&#x00BD;%</i> above the line in relation to its investment, cannot be compared with that of other corporations simply because of the role the Industrial Development Corporation is playing. What I think is of interest, and I hope the hon. the Minister will comment on this, is to look at the break-down of that amount, of the R1,4 billion which has been invested since 1940. If one looks at the table one finds that R403 million has been invested in metal, engineering and machinery works. An amount of R252 million has been spent on petroleum, chemical and related products. This is not at all surprising because it includes the amount spent on the development of Sasol. They have also invested an amount of R199 million in what they describe as &#x201C;transport and miscellaneous&#x201D;. What is also interesting is that an amount of R279 million has been invested in construction and property. There is a number of other items but I am confining myself to the larger ones. An amount of between R62 million and R63 million has been spent on the processing of stone, clay and earthenware. We can, of course, understand that at some point of time it was considered to be in the public interest for the IDC to invest in some of these categories or other categories, but I think it would be difficult to describe some of these industries as infant or struggling industries in our country or to say that the private sector was without competence or experience if the potential risks and rewards were acceptable. We are left with the suspicion that the rationale behind part of these investments ran counter to the explicit instruction contained in section 5(a) of the principal Act and which remains unchanged. I hope the hon. the Minister will confirm that this provision remains in force. Section 5(a) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That every application or proposal dealt with by it is considered strictly on its economic merits irrespective of all other considerations whatsoever.</block>

<p>Those are very strong words.</p>

<p>We have now dealt with this Bill and we hope that the hon. the Minister will give the following assurances in regard to his request to increase the amount of loan finance which may be raised by the corporation or its wholly-owned subsidiaries by R170 million. The first assurance is that the IDC will only invest in spheres where the private sector is both unable and unwilling to invest. The second assurance we want is that where it does invest the IDC will within a reasonable period after the profitability of the enterprise has been established, and similarly the security for the repayment of any outstanding loans, take steps to dispose of any equity interest held by them through the medium of a public quotation or to the other partners in the venture or to other parties. If the hon. the Minister does not give these assurances, all of us will know the road on which we are travelling and let us hear no more about the sanctity of private enterprise from the Government</p>

<p>Revenue Vote No. 5.&#x2014;&#x201C;Foreign Affairs&#x201D;:</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, on various occasions this year South Africa&#x2019;s relations with the rest of Africa have been the subject of discussion here in the House of Assembly. I think you will agree with me that it is a good thing that so much interest should be shown in such an important matter&#x2014;a matter which is of such vital importance to us all. During the recent debate on the Vote of the hon. the Prime Minister, the subject of contact and dialogue with Africa, as well as with Rhodesia and South West Africa was fully debated once again. It is encouraging that these aspects of our foreign relations have been considered so thoroughly on this particular occasion. As the hon. the Prime Minister was right in saying on 23 October last year, Southern Africa has reached the cross-roads, and we are all facing a choice between peace, or escalation of violence. Consequently it is essential that there should be no uncertainty or misunderstanding in regard to our position, and that it should be stated with the authority of a Prime Minister. It is also a good thing that our Prime Minister dealt with this in such a masterly fashion, as he did during the debate on his Vote. I am certain that we are all grateful that South Africa at this juncture has a Prime Minister who, with so much statesmanship and success, gives guidance and takes the initiative in our endeavour to achieve peaceful co-existence in Africa. South Africa is fortunate that at this very juncture we have a Prime Minister whose role in Africa is recognized and appreciated today by friend and foe alike, a Prime Minister who has been praised in public by various African leaders for his honest, sincere and realistic approach, and because he is a man of his word. This can only benefit South Africa.</p>

<p>I am entering the debate at this early stage to emphasize&#x2014;nor is this the first time I am doing so&#x2014;that the gravity of the situation requires us all to speak with the utmost circumspection and responsibility of our relations with Africa, because these relations have reached a particularly delicate phase. I appreciate the attitude of both sides of this House during the discussion of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, in particular that there was so much appreciation in this House for our hon. the Prime Minister. Nevertheless I feel it is necessary for me to issue a word of warning in the hope that we will maintain in this debate as well the high level of debate which was established during the discussion of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote.</p>

<p>Since 1948, when a National Party Government came into office for the first time, until today, it has been the endeavour of one National Party Government after another, under various Prime Ministers, to build up contacts with Africa and to improve South Africa&#x2019;s relations with the rest of Africa. During the past 11&#x00BD; years, for three years under Dr. Verwoerd and for the past eight years under our present Prime Minister, I have had to perform this particular task. During these years I have reported regularly to the House of Assembly on our aim and endeavour, and the problems we encountered. As far as this was possible I reported regularly on the <span class="col_4735-4736" refersTo="page_0781"/>progress or lack of progress which had been made from time to time. I must say at once that it was an uphill struggle. In general we came up against a wall of prejudice. Frequently we came up against hostility, if not hate.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was progress. Thus I was able to state in this House on 11 September last year that I had reason to believe that a new spirit was developing in Africa. Many hon. members paid no heed to my words. They were sceptical. Rut subsequent developments have proved that my statement was not far-fetched and that it was not the result of wishful thinking. What has happened since then is well known. I need not remind you of the combined efforts of our Prime Minister and others to make it possible for the parties in Rhodesia to get together, to sit down around a conference table and to try to solve their problems themselves. I need not remind you either of the extensive contacts with African leaders. These developments have aroused great expectations here in South Africa as well as in Southern Africa, and further afield, too, among those in Africa who are supporters of de-escalation, instead of escalation and confrontation. The interest of virtually the entire free world has also been roused.</p>

<p>But in spite of the excellent work of our Prime Minister and others, and in spite of the progress which has already been made, there have also been setbacks and disappointments, and major obstacles still await us. The reaction of President Kaunda and others to the cross-roads speech of our own Prime Minister, created the hope of a new era in Southern Africa. But, Sir, voices were also raised, voices which, tried to sow suspicion, which condemned the peace offensive, which called it a cunning ploy of Mr. Vorster to undermine the unity of the OAU, to safeguard South Africa&#x2019;s position in the U.N., to strengthen South Africa&#x2019;s position in Africa at the expense of the rest of Africa. In the meantime the conference of African foreign ministers was held at Dar-es-Salaam, from the 7th to the 10th of this month. The hon. the Prime Minister has already dealt with that, and I think you will agree with me that for me to dwell on this again today would not serve any good purpose.</p>

<p>Sir, in spite of the disappointing aspects of Dar-es-Salaam, there are positive aspects as well, <i>inter alia,</i> that in consultation with South Africa a solution to the Rhodesian and South West African questions may continue to be sought. As far as the South African Government is concerned, we shall persevere with our peace offensive. We shall not allow ourselves to be diverted from our course, for there is too much at stake, not only for us but also for the entire subcontinent, and even for Africa as a whole. Sir, we shall proceed on the course we have adopted, and in the same unimpeachable manner in which we have always acted, even in spite of occasional provocation.</p>

<p>We shall continue with these actions, actions which have compelled the respect and confidence of those in Africa with whom we have had contact, or with whom we have co-operated. I am thinking for example of South Africa&#x2019;s reaction to the revolutions in our neighbouring states. Angola and Mozambique. I could mention to you our attempts to get the parties in Rhodesia around the conference table, without interfering in their domestic affairs, or prescribing to them. I am thinking of our interpretation of self-determination in the case of South West Africa, and the progress which has already been made and is being made in respect of our attempts to enable the people of South West Africa to co-operate and to find a solution to their problems themselves; to work out their future themselves. But, Sir, I cannot emphasize strongly enough that we who will participate in this debate, should all be on our guard and should not try to derive a little political advantage from a useless bickering over whose policy is more acceptable or less acceptable to whom. This is a temptation with which we are regularly faced. During the discussion of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote a great deal was said about our internal policy and how it influences our foreign relations. It is true that there is a very close connection between the two. No one can deny that. But it does not seem necessary to me that we should blaze the difference among us abroad, particularly when we debate our foreign relations in this House. For example, Mr. Chairman, it is not necessary, not advisable to proclaim that South Africa is not acceptable to Africa because we in South Africa have shortcomings, shortcomings which are present in a far worse degree in some African states.</p>

<p>Over a period of many years South Africa has demonstrated its willingness and its ability to co-operate with our neighbours and with the rest of Africa in many spheres.</p>

<p><span class="col_4737-4738" refersTo="page_0782"/>My own department and many other Government departments and bodies are already engaged in fruitful co-operation with several African states. In some cases we are doing this openly, and in many cases this is being done on a confidential basis. These Government departments and bodies are properly equipped and primed to continue and to expand their activities over a wider field. I need not mention the departments. There is virtually no Government department in South Africa which cannot become involved in some form of co-operation with the rest of Africa, to say nothing of institutions such, as the CSIR, the South African Bureau of Standards, the Industrial Development Corporation, and private bodies which specialize for example in the hotel industry, mining, agriculture, etc. Among all of these there is no lack of knowledge, experience, enterprise and enthusiasm in co-operating with Africa. Therefore, Sir, <i>that</i> is not our problem. It is indeed a good thing that we discuss methods and spheres of co-operation in this debate. We in Foreign Affairs and our colleagues in other departments, as well as the private sector, welcome new thinking, new ideas, but our problem with Africa at this stage is a political problem, and until it is solved, we will not make much progress in any of the other spheres. The search for a solution to the political problem is the task of the Government in the first place, and it is, to the Government, a task of the highest priority.</p>

<p>It is here that our hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s selfless labour is of inestimable value to South. Africa. His personal contributions, his initiative, guidance and contacts on the highest level, have given significance, have given cohesion to the work which has been done for many years on the diplomatic and other levels, frequently behind the scenes. I repeat: It is the task of the Prime Minister and of the Government, to find political solutions with the other leaders in Africa. Sir, this is a difficult, but not impossible, task, for we must also take cognizance of the fact that, in spite of certain negative aspects which feature prominently in the resolutions and in the published speeches of Dar-es-Salaam, there appeared nevertheless to be a consensus that the door should not be closed to the search for peaceful solutions. That is the direction in which the Prime Minister and the Government has been working, and in which we shall continue to exert ourselves. It is the duty of all of us to strengthen the hands of the Prime Minister and the Government in this respect, instead of making their task a difficult one. This applies to us all, on both sides of this House. I repeat, Sir: It is not a question of political advantage here, but of the interests of our country and people, the future of all of us. Unanimity on this important matter, is in the interests of us all.</p>

<p>Therefore an obligation rests on all of us to have a deep concern for the gravity of this matter, and to try to make a contribution to the promotion of dialogue with Africa. In exactly the same way an obligation and a great responsibility rests on all the leaders in Africa, on both sides, to act with extreme caution so that the progress which has been made is not destroyed, and so that this does not lead to an escalation of violence, which, will be disastrous for the entire continent.</p>

<p>Since the subject of contact and dialogue with Africa has already been debated so fully, and since as much as can be said about it with consideration for South Africa&#x2019;s interests has been said about it, it may be beneficial to the debate if I comment briefly at this stage on a few other aspects of our foreign relations, particularly in respect of Western Europe.</p>

<p>It is true that there have recently been indications of a decrease in the irresponsible attacks of the past on South Africa, attacks on us on the part of the free world, which were so discouraging to us all. In the annual report of the Department of Information, which has just been tabled, the statement is justifiably made that at present our relations with the outside world are better than they have been for three decades. Perhaps it is too early to speak at this stage already of a re-appraisal of South Africa in Western Europe, but nevertheless there are clear indications of a more cautious approach. The mounting trade offensive, if I may call it that, in South Africa by most of our important Western European trading partners, including Great Britain, definitely indicates a renewed confidence in the future of South Africa.</p>

<p>There are various factors that have been responsible for this, and I want to indicate a few of these. Take for example the oil-crisis with which the world has been afflicted since October 1973. As a result of the higher gold price South Africa has been better able to resist the rise in the oil price than most of the other non-oil producing countries of the world. Fortunately <span class="col_4739-4740" refersTo="page_0783"/>our dependence on oil as a source of power for industrial purposes is also far less than in the case of most other industrial countries. This has helped to create the impression, and quite rightly so, too, that South Africa is reasonably unaffected by economic disasters. In this way South Africa&#x2019;s status as a trading partner has been enhanced. In its turn the oil crisis has created an increased demand for alternative sources of power. This is also of significance to South Africa&#x2019;s uranium, and even to its coal. The effective functioning of our pilot project for the enrichment of uranium indicates that we shall become an important supplier of enriched uranium. Apart from energy, Western Europe is dependent on imported raw materials for its industries. It is true that South Africa offers a stable supply of raw materials, in contrast to the instability of some other suppliers. South Africa&#x2019;s correct attitude in regard to the role played by gold, as well as the rise in the gold price, has definitely benefited our position in the world. There are other factors as well, and I am merely mentioning them. I am thinking of the maintenance of law and order, and of the fact that South Africa is at present one of the most peaceful countries in the world. I am thinking of South Africa&#x2019;s strategic position here at the southernmost point of Africa.</p>

<p>The main object of the peace offensive in Africa launched by the Government is to eliminate confrontation and to normalize South Africa&#x2019;s position in Africa. However, this endeavour is producing by-products. This is already having a noticeable effect on the attitude of Western Europe. I am thinking in particular of the appreciation for the guidance given by the hon. the Prime Minister and his contribution to the attempt to achieve an understanding with Africa. Not only is this making a good impression in the West, but it is definitely helping to bring South Africa&#x2019;s detractors into disrepute. Persons and bodies that are well-disposed to South Africa are in this way being encouraged to take up the cudgels for us. Now we all know that at first there was a measure of scepticism at the d&#x00E9;tente attempts of the South African Government As we made progress, however, this scepticism made way for an earnest desire that our attempts should succeed and that a large-scale conflict in Southern Africa should be averted. It is therefore gratifying that there is more and more encouragement, from Western Europe and elsewhere, for these d&#x00E9;tente attempts. Admittedly the encouragement at present is unobtrusive, but subsequently it may perhaps be done more openly.</p>

<p>The progress which has already been made with the implementation of our relatione policy internally, has not gone unnoticed either and this has also benefited our position in the world. The same also applies to the emphasis we have placed on the human dignity of people and to our attempts to get away from discrimination on the basis of colour within the framework of our policy of separate development, as it had already been envisaged by the late Dr. Verwoerd.</p>

<p>Let us consider the question of the communist threat. In Western Europe the fear of the growing Russian strength and influence is increasing. Just think of the role of the communists in the trade union movement of Western Europe. Even socialist governments are becoming increasingly aware of the communist danger. The communists are also triumphing in a brutal manner in South-East Asia. Russian influence is becoming stronger all the time in the Indian Ocean, and it is generally feared that that influence will intensify once the Suez Canal has been reopened. In addition, the Russians are already present in the Atlantic Ocean. South Africa&#x2019;s unshakeable opposition to Communism has for many years been seen as unjustified and as a kind of neurotic fear with a view to internal unrest, to which it could give rise. However, it is now becoming clear in Europe that our standpoint was justified in view of communistic imperialism and its pursuit of domination, not only of Africa, but of the entire world.</p>

<p>Let us come to the U.N. and the effect of the actions of this body against South Africa. The West and the free world noted with dismay the developments there when the General Assembly deprived South Africa of its right of participation and placed our membership in jeopardy. Western European states and other members of the free world not only rejected these actions against us with the votes which they cast there, but several of them also expressed their opposition to this in the strongest terms. This had a beneficial influence on the attitude of other bodies, for example the news media, and persuaded them to reconsider their standpoint towards South Africa. This development also helped South Africa to cause its voice to be heard more effectively in <span class="col_4741-4742" refersTo="page_0784"/>Europe than ever before. It is no longer all that easy to make far-fetched and unfounded charges against us. Take for example, the propaganda which they tried to make from the faked film in regard to the alleged massacre in the Caprivi Strip last year. This charge was effectively and convincingly refuted with the aid, <i>inter alia,</i> of the findings of representatives of foreign news media in South Africa. All this is contributing to the influence of the anti-South African lobby&#x2014;for something like this does exist&#x2014;being undermined, and to it being discredited to a large extent. As it meets with increasing resistance, and as its influence wanes, it is reverting to more irresponsible actions and it is invoking violence openly. However, I am convinced that its actions are less effective than they were in the past.</p>

<p>I could elaborate at considerably greater length on South Africa&#x2019;s relations with States in other parts of the world, for example with Latin America, the United States and so on, but I think that at this stage I have already said enough.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask for the privilege of the half-hour although I may not use all of it at this stage.</p>

<p>However much we on this side differ from the Government on domestic policies, and however much we believe that the Government&#x2019;s race policies were responsible for the damaging decline in our international status, we do at last appear to be entering a new period in the field of international politics. During much of the Government&#x2019;s period of office since it came to power in 1948, they were toally on the defensive. There was very little in the nature of a positive foreign policy, and our domestic politics were conducted with almost total disregard for their wider implications. It was left largely to Mr. Eric Louw to battle along overseas and at the United Nations on a basis of tit for tat. The hostility we aroused abroad was simply ascribed to deliberate distortions and to a lack of understanding of our problems.</p>

<p>Fortunately this period is now largely a matter of the past and we hope that it will remain a matter of the past. The past couple of years have seen a much greater awareness by the Government and South Africa in general of the relevance of our presence in the world and of the necessity of good relations with the countries of Africa and the rest of the world. I think it can now be said that we have arrived at the stage where we are developing a positive foreign policy&#x2014;that is, we have moved from a defensive policy to a positive one and certainly to a more confident one.</p>

<p>At the United Nations we have admitted that there are conditions in our country that need to be put right. The hon. the Minister emphasized this just now in his speech. The Government has admitted that we have discriminatory legislation and that we are following discriminatory practices based on the colour of a man&#x2019;s skin, but that we will, in the words of our then Ambassador at the United Nations, do &#x201C;everything in our power to terminate it&#x201D;. We emphasized even more strongly than before that we would solve the South West Africa question and that we would do so along the lines of self-determination, independence and the emancipation of the peoples of South West Africa. Furthermore, contact and exchanges were established with important Black leaders in Africa while the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs embarked upon a round of personal diplomacy, meeting with a number of important leaders in Africa and offering their good offices in respect of the Rhodesian situation. It think it should be realized that if achieved, d&#x00E9;tente is still a long step from entente or from cordial relations Entente should, of course, remain our ultimate goal. Every one of the steps which I have mentioned in the new approach of the Government, received the fullest support from the Opposition simply because they are fully in line with the policies for which we have always stood. There is no doubt that the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister took a calculated risk in their d&#x00E9;tente efforts, a calculated risk because the Prime Minister&#x2019;s position is far more vulnerable than that of the other leaders. At any moment any or all of the African leaders can turn around and revert to militancy and blame the hon. the Prime Minister for not moving fast enough and far enough in respect, for instance, of the removal of discrimination or for stalling on the South West Africa issue. We therefore have no hesitation in commending the hon. the Prime Minister and in commending the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the efforts they have made despite the risks involved for them.</p>

<p><span class="col_4743-4744" refersTo="page_0785"/>What is left for us to do is to look at the preliminary results and to see if we can make an assessment of where we are at the present time. I must say that our conclusion remains, as we have put it before in this House, that from the present positive approach in the field of foreign policy, we shall have to move to a productive foreign policy. By that I mean that we carry out almost immediately all the changes that we talk about abroad. I shall return to that point at a later stage. Looking at the preliminary results of the Government&#x2019;s efforts, we note the following: Firstly, there is the question of the Western powers which the hon. the Minister touched on. There is no doubt that there is an improvement in the climate as far as South Africa is concerned, an improvement amongst some of the important European nations. Of course, this is to be welcomed, but I think we would do well to remember that this is largely based on the belief that real and meaningful changes are taking place in the field of race relations in our country. We should also remember that we are faced all the time with the danger that a strong reaction may set in if we do not live up to the expectations which were created. In one of its newsletters, the S.A. Foundation reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The major Western powers need South Africa, but cannot afford to be seen as our friends. We would be helping them to help us if we eliminated the outdated and unnecessary racial discrimination which is the root cause of South Africa&#x2019;s international rejection.</block>

<p>It adds:</p>

<block name="quote">If nothing substantial materializes, we will be infinitely worse off with the international community than before.</block>

<p>I am inclined to support this. I also have here a report from Washington in which the S.A. Foundation reports the following in respect of our relations with the United States of America:</p>

<block name="quote">For South Africa to accommodate the new trends &#x2026;</block>

<p>The trends they had in mind were that Congress was &#x201C;becoming more liberal with each election&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For South Africa to accommodate the new trends, policy-makers in the United</block>

<p>States need to be assured that the situation in South Africa is not static, that South Africans recognize what is amiss and are concerned to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>If this is to be achieved, particular attention should be paid to three points: South Africa&#x2019;s reaction to its critics should not consist in references to their peripheral misrepresentations and omissions when the gist of what these critics are saying &#x2026;</p>

<p>This is a South African reporting &#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is held to be true by most observers in the United States; when South Africa is singled out for special criticism, it should be understood that this is because events there are always seen to be clouded with racial overtones; and, lastly, that the South African Press and public should continue to be critical in a way which effectively proves that concern exists.</block>

<p>In passing I do want to pay a special tribute to the S.A. Foundation under the presidency of Dr. Jan Marais for the excellent work they do both in South Africa and abroad. They have outstanding workers here and abroad and their reports and publications are a tremendous help to those who study South Africa&#x2019;s international position. However, the point that emerges from what I have quoted is that it is entirely in our own hands whether or not we shall be able to make the fullest use of the improved climate to strengthen our support in the West As far as Africa is concerned, there is the meeting which was held in Dar-es-Salaam recently. Last Friday the hon. the Prime Minister reported to us in very blunt terms that d&#x00E9;tente and dialogue were now out but that room was left for contact and consultation with South Africa, though only in respect of specific measures such as South West Africa and Rhodesia. A few days ago President Kaunda spoke in Washington. His speech was seen here as something of a kick in the teeth. I had occasion to look at the full text of his speech and there can be no doubt that he gave very strong support to the liberation movements in Africa, as he called them. He <span class="col_4745-4746" refersTo="page_0786"/>said among other things that the struggles of the oppressed peoples&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; have now received the baptism of fire. Victories in Mozambique and Angola have given them added inspiration. Africa has no reason, no reason at all, not to support the liberation movements.</block>

<p>What is significant though&#x2014;and I was pleased to see it&#x2014;is that while he made a strong attack on apartheid and racial domination, he said: &#x201C;It has to be put to an end peacefully.&#x201D; and he repeated the word &#x201C;peacefully&#x201D;. That as far as the Africa situation is concerned.</p>

<p>*As far as Rhodesia is concerned, the position seems to be far from encouraging. If reports are correct, a ceasefire has not yet been achieved on the terrorist front, and it seems that in terms of the standpoint it has adopted, the Government has not yet been able to withdraw the S.A. Police from Rhodesia. This means that although we have no direct responsibility for solving the Rhodesian question and we cannot interfere with Rhodesia&#x2019;s domestic affairs, we are nevertheless involved in the problem because of the presence of our Police forces there. There is no doubt about the fact that if terrorist activity against Rhodesia were to be resumed, and if that terrorist activity were developed into large-scale guerrilla warfare with the support of the OAU and the powers which support the OAU, South Africa would be in an extremely difficult position and would have to take a very critical decision. The OAU has already intimated that a renewed attack would be made on Rhodesia if negotiations with the Government of Mr. Tan Smith were to fail. I believe that they have referred to a period of six months in this regard. We have also seen in the Press that Mozambique, which shares a lone border with Rhodesia and controls the Beira harbour, has intimated that if a settlement is not forthcoming in Rhodesia, they will be prepared to act as a base against Rhodesia for the Black nationalists. The problem is that the Black nationalists can wreck any negotiations which are taking place whenever they like and then lay all the blame on the Government of Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>If one looks at the world situation today, there are militant powers on every continent of the world&#x2014;we have just seen this again in Vietnam and Cambodia&#x2014;which adhere to a new philosophy and which advocate guerrilla warfare as a means of solving problems. Unfortunately that philosophy has its adherents in Africa as well, and obviously it has the full support of the communists. I recently came across the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The power of guerrilla warfare has not been properly evaluated. It may have produced greater change than nuclear energy. It gained victory for Tito in Yugoslavia; it conquered China and brought it under communist rule; it broke the French empire in South East Asia and in North Africa, particularly in Algeria.</block>

<p>&#x2020;They could have added, if this article had been written later, America&#x2019;s experience in Vietnam and Portugal&#x2019;s experience in Guinea Bissau, Mozambique and Angola. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has revolutionized the basic concepts of military power, as was shown by George Grivas in Cyprus and the Mau Mau in Kenya. It is estimated that an army needs 100 men for every single guerrila fighter.</block>

<p>*This view has become the basis of a new political philosophy, and one gets the impression that there are large groups of professional guerrillas lying about in Africa today who would be only too willing to resume terrorist activities where others have stopped. This is why I said that if the struggle in Rhodesia were to be resumed on any large scale, South Africa with its Police Force in Rhodesia would be faced with critical decisions. This gives one all the more reason to hope that a settlement will be reached in Rhodesia.</p>

<p>&#x2020;A factor which is extremely disturbing to us, is the serious decline in our relations with Lesotho, one of our closest neighbours and one of the first countries which originally supported the policy of dialogue with South Africa. Lesotho may be land-locked and, in terms of military strength, may be powerless, but surprisingly the meeting at Dar-es-Salaam and the previous one in Addis Ababa&#x2014;as in fact the hon. the Prime Minister also pointed out when he spoke&#x2014;have shown that Lesotho&#x2019;s attitude is not without influence in Africa. I think that this is in a great measure due to the fact that they are known to have <span class="col_4747-4748" refersTo="page_0787"/>intimate proximity with the South African scene. The hon. the Prime Minister has told us that Lesotho&#x2019;s hostility was due to the fact that its leaders were excluded from the exchanges which, took place between the leaders of South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania, Botswana and also Mr. Machel. I think that the hon. the Prime Minister is not entirely right, because it goes much deeper and much further back than that. I think that it has much to do with the question of labour relations, economic relations and the reception of their citizens. There also seem to be border problems. There is no doubt in my mind that the Government has made a mistake by nor forging closer links with Lesotho When the climate for that was better. After the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech last Friday, the Prime Minister of Lesotho replied and accused the Prime Minister (I am quoting from a press report)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; interfering in his country&#x2019;s affairs by suggesting that the Basotho should turn against their Government.</block>

<p>This is a very serious allegation which needs attention. Chief Jonathan added that it was false that Lesotho had been invited to join in the current d&#x00E9;tente move. &#x201C;She would not have accepted&#x201D;, he said, &#x201C;because it would have been contrary to the resolutions of the OAU, the Lusaka manifesto and the wishes of his people.&#x201D; Sir, whatever the case may be&#x2014;if the hon. the Minister can enlighten us we will be pleased&#x2014;I think the Government should take a thorough look at our relations with Lesotho and see what can be done to improve them. I must say, Sir, that I am terribly sorry that the Government did not use the occasion of inauguration of the State President last week to invite some of our neighbouring leaders. Was it not possible for the Government to invite men like King Sobhuza of Swaziland, Sir Seretse Khama of Botswana and even Chief Jonathan&#x2014;why not&#x003F; And what about Dr. Banda&#x003F; I pose the question realizing, of course, that it would not have been without certain difficulties, but, Sir, it would certainly have been a very farsighted move if we had done it. We talk a lot about our being an African State, but in fact we do very little to make ourselves part of Africa. Sir, in March the Department of Foreign Affairs brought out the <i>South West African Survey</i> 1974. It cost the department R34 000 to produce, and it is quite an attractive publication, but I must in all frankness say to the hon. the Minister that it is not likely to serve any useful purpose. Sir, the facts about South West Africa, its economic development and the Government&#x2019;s high political intentions have already been very well documented. In fact, the Prime Minister quotes from the 1967 <i>Survey</i> here and abroad to substantiate his policy of self-determination and independence for South West. He does not quote from this <i>Survey</i> but from the 1967 one. This publication is a disappointment because, let us face it, what everybody here and abroad wants is information about the future, full information about what practical steps are being planned to achieve the goal of self-determination and independence. Sir, it was mainly because of the Government&#x2019;s failure to give practical meaning to its concept of self-determination and to say clearly how it planned to implement its declared aims that the contacts between the Government and Dr. Waldheim were terminated, and it still remains the weakest spot in the Government&#x2019;s defence in respect of this particular problem. I think the Government, should attempt to overcome this problem and I hope that they will do so soon. There is an unfortunate thing about this <i>Survey,</i> Mr. Chairman, and that is that it still uses the term &#x201C;non-White&#x201D;. In the pictorial section of the <i>Survey,</i> reference is made to a non-White hospital and a non-White nursing home. Surely, Sir, this should be avoided in publications by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which are largely meant for foreign consumption. I think the term &#x201C;non-White&#x201D; should be dropped completely.</p>

<p>What do you suggest then&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, in a statement to the United Nations in April 1973 the hon. the Minister said the following&#x2014; and this in fact is quoted in the <i>Survey</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All political parties of South West Africa will have full and free participation in the process leading to self-determination and independence.</block>

<p>All political parties will have full participation in the process leading to that.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this does not seem to be in accordance with the facts. In South West Africa Messrs. Mudge and Van Zijl, who are organizing the talks between the peoples place the emphasis on the ethnic division.</p>

<p><span class="col_4749-4750" refersTo="page_0788"/>On Friday the Prime Minister talked about only the majority parties participating, without being able to say how he would determine a majority party in respect of a national group which has not yet got a representative political institution. The hon. the Minister again, as I have just quoted, told the U.N. that all political parties would have full participation. I should like to have a reply on this from the hon. the Minister in order to know precisely what the position is.</p>

<p>*In regard to the South West question, I just want to add that the Security Council has set the Government an ultimatum on the question of South West Africa, and that ultimatum is due to expire at the end of May this year. We should very much like to know from the Government what its attitude in this regard is and whether it intends to react to this ultimatum. We are in favour of the Government&#x2019;s keeping a cool head on the question of South West Africa, but the Government will be acting contrary to the vital interests of both South Africa and South West Africa if it does not devote the best planning and give the highest priority to finding a speedy solution to this problem. Sir, we must bear in mind that South West Africa&#x2019;s whole northern border adjoins Angola and Zambia, and two-thirds of its eastern border adjoin Botswana. Angolan military groups are already active among the Ovambo on the northern border in the south of Angola. We have seen the attitude adopted by President Kaunda in his speech in Washington. We know that Botswana is sympathetically disposed towards attempts to find a peaceful solution, but it is sympathetically disposed towards the &#x201C;liberation movements&#x201D; as well. Sir, they all support Swapo, which is already raising a liberation army, as they call it, outside South West, to which various countries and religious organizations are contributing to an increasing degree. I mention this to indicate, as it was recently put by a visitor from abroad, &#x201C;that we must use the time we have got and not burn it&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the question of the U.N., which was touched on by the hon. the Minister as well. The question of our relations there is still a matter of uncertainty. Our membership was saved in the Security Council last year by the veto which was exercised by France, Britain and the U.S.A. France and Britain did this because they believe in the principle of universality, i.e. that all countries, no matter what their domestic policy, must be and remain members of the U.N. America did so on the grounds that it saw changes taking place in the domestic policy of South Africa, and on those grounds it pleaded for South Africa to be given another chance. Well, the Government subsequently recalled our ambassador at the U.N., Mr. Botha, to South Africa, and intimated that it was reconsidering our membership of the U.N.</p>

<p>I hope that by this time the hon. the Minister is able to tell us what the Government&#x2019;s decision in this regard has been. Our standpoint on this side is that we are opposed to the termination of our membership of the U.N. It has been said before in this session, so I do not want to repeat the reasons for it. But we do not consider our membership to be a favour which we receive from another country or from another group of countries. The U.N. does not belong to a specific country or group of countries, and for that reason we regard it as the national right of South Africa to remain a member of that body, a right we should defend just as strongly as we defended our right to be present in South West Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, I believe that if needs be we should appeal to the International Court if possible, and especially if illegal action is taken against us in this connection. Further reason why we believe it to be in the interests of South Africa to retain our membership of the U.N., and in the interests of the West to remain a member of that body, will be dealt with by other speakers. Yet other points from our side will be raised at a later stage in the debate.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout raised a considerable number of matters this afternoon, most of which will be dealt with during the debate by other hon. members on this side of the House, and also. I believe, by the hon. the Minister himself at a later stage. I want to point out that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout began his speech by pointing out a change in emphasis which had supposedly taken place in the activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs. He stated that South Africa had a defensive foreign policy up to recent times and said that in the initial years, after the National Party had come into office in 1948, internal steps were taken in South Africa without regard to the effect such steps could have on our foreign relations. However, I <span class="col_4751-4752" refersTo="page_0789"/>want to make the statement without any fear of contradiction that since 1948 no single Act has been passed by this Parliament under National Party rule and no single step has been taken by the National Party Government which could not be fully justified at that juncture. In fact, most of the steps which many regard as negative steps today., were essential initial steps which eventually led to the implementation of the policy of separate development to its full consequences. Most of the measures simply ought to eliminate friction between the different population groups of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout also made the statement that we were not doing enough to prove ourselves part of Africa. That statement I cannot accept either, because the fact is that no other Government has done more than this Government to normalize South Africa&#x2019;s relations with the other African states. In the debate which took place a few weeks ago in this House on a motion moved by the hon. member for Edenvale, I tried to indicate the various phases through which our country has gone in its relations with other African states. I pointed out then that in the period up to 1950, we were dealing with an Africa composed virtually entirely of colonial territories. In the period from 1950 up to the present time we had to deal with the after-effects of the newly gained freedoms and we are only now entering the stage in which we can confer as an independent country with other independent states of full status in Africa, on an equal basis in a joint endeavour to work out a basis for peace. I believe that in the course of time and as the history of this continent is written, this will be proved correct.</p>

<p>As far as the activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs are concerned, the year 1975 is a key year in my opinion. Attention has already been drawn to the development which has taken place in respect of long outstanding issues, issues such as South West Africa and Rhodesia. These are matters which are probably receiving more intensive attention at the moment than ever before in the past, and we hope that we are now entering the era in which the issues which have been bedevilling our relations with the rest of the world as well as with other African countries for a long time, will be solved and that this will help to normalize our relations with the rest of the world and also with Africa.</p>

<p>At present this department is actually entering an exciting phase of its existence. The department was established in 1927, so in two years&#x2019; time it will have been serving South Africa for half a century. Up to now the activities of the department have been generated chiefly by the thinking of the Whites in South Africa, and that represented the phase in which the Whites governed the country on their own. Now, for the first time, we are entering the period in which the very policy of separate development will lead to peoples in South Africa being able to work out their own destinies to an increasing extent and being able to govern themselves. Obviously our foreign relations, too, will be influenced by that, and this being so, the activities of this department will enter a totally new era. I think the first steps were taken here last year when the hon. the Minister announced on 10 September that he would also include three prominent non-White leaders in his delegation to the United Nations, viz. Paramount Chief Kaiser Matanzima of the Transkei, Mr. Daniel R. Ulster, a leading figure in the Coloured community and Dr. M. B. Naidoo, a member of the Executive Council of the Indian Council. That emphasized that there are non-White leaders here in South Africa who can speak on behalf of their peoples and who can take a hand in stating South Africa&#x2019;s case abroad, that they can be a part of this process of representing and stating South Africa&#x2019;s case. I think all of us, both sides of this House, will agree that this was a wise decision and that South Africa has already been reaping the fruits of this.</p>

<p>A second announcement which was made here on that same afternoon by the hon. the Minister was that he had already decided in principle to commence the training of non-Whites for service abroad and to place them in the service of the various missions of South Africa abroad in the course of time. On a totally different level this is giving effect to the multi-national character of South Africa, and the fact that each population group is given the opportunity to participate in every sphere of government.</p>

<p>I want to point out this afternoon that this is only a new starting point in the activities of this department, that it is a new era which is being entered, and that it will be necessary to go a great deal further in future. In the first place, I want to advocate here this afternoon that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, in particular, should <span class="col_4753-4754" refersTo="page_0790"/>look for opportunities from time to time to hold consultations with the non-White leaders in South Africa about issues which affect South Africa&#x2019;s foreign relations. It is a fact that the very development of the homelands has led to the emergence of true leaders of the Bantu population in South Africa. The creation of the CRC and the Indian Council and the election of their own people by themselves to those bodies, have given leaders to the non-White national communities here in South Africa for the first time in the history of our country. These are people who have emerged as true leaders and who can really speak on behalf of their own people. Therefore, I think that the time is ripe for the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as the mouthpiece of South Africa in the international field, to look for opportunities to hold consultations with the non-White leaders&#x2014;as the hon. the Prime Minister does on issues affecting South Africa&#x2019;s internal position and the mutual relations of peoples in South. Africa&#x2014;even on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis so that he may know when standing on the international stage that he is speaking on behalf of the whole of South Africa. I believe that just like the first step taken by him in connection with the delegation to the U.N., which proved to be a wise step and of which South Africa is reaping the fruit, we shall reap the fruit of this, too, only if it is possible for constant consultation to take place with these leaders, through the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>It is also a fact that we are now on the eve of taking one of the final steps in the implementation of the policy of separate development in South Africa. I believe that when the history of South Africa in the 20th century is written one day, the Acts which had to be passed to give independence to the Transkei will be given a status by historians equal to other historic steps in our constitutional development. I believe that history itself will show that they are of as much importance to South Africa as, for example, the Act of 1909&#x2014;the Act known as the South Africa Act&#x2014;and as the Statute of Westminister, 1931, which gave South Africa full self-government. I also believe that they will be given a status equal to the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, which established South Africa as a sovereign power in the world.</p>

<p>What is important to me, is that in our foreign relations, we&#x2014;and especially the Department of Foreign Affairs shall have to see to a totally new relationship arising in these foreign relations and to a closer partnership and a closer form of co-operation developing between us and the Transkei than anything existing at present. These relations must be better than anything which has yet been seen in South Africa&#x2019;s relations with regard to foreign countries. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I start by commending the speech of the hon. member for Vasco, in particular the section of it which refers to the desirability of consultation with the non-Whites or, rather, the Black leaders in South Africa in respect of matters of foreign affairs. I congratulate him for what certainly was a sound suggestion coming from that side of the House.</p>

<p>The foreign service of our country is, of course, a show-case for us. Through that show-case it should become increasingly apparent to the world that the foreign service of South Africa represents not only the White community in South Africa, but the whole of South Africa. As we have heard in some suggestions in the past in regard to enabling people of colour to participate in the foreign service, it seems, with respect, to be a matter of some urgency to be able to portray the foreign service of South Africa on a basis of being fully representative of its peoples in the sense that it will have people of all races participating in it. In this respect it is not enough that there should be mere observers be present at certain occasions. They must be people who have the full status as representatives of our country when they appear in the outside world. This seems to me to be a matter of some urgency and of some importance, that we portray South Africa overseas in the manner which I believe all of us would like to see it represented.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister indicated that there has already been considerable debate on the subject of South Africa&#x2019;s place in Africa. There can, of course, never really be enough debate on this subject, but I would like to take the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s hint and talk about some other subjects this afternoon. In the short time I have available, I would particularly like to speak about the situation concerning international banks and multi-national enterprises in so far as they affect South Africa and in so far as South Africa&#x2019;s international position is likely to be affected by it. The Apartheid <span class="col_4755-4756" refersTo="page_0791"/>Committee of the United Nations has already on a number of occasions referred to the fact that the so-called collaboration by banks and multi-national companies with South Africa is something which they are concerned about and something they would like to see come to an end. As far as South Africa is concerned the position of international banks and of multi-national enterprises is of fundamental importance to us. If we refer, for example, to international banks and the need to provide finance on the international markets for South Africa&#x2019;s increasing capital needs and also the need to finance international trade, it will be appreciated how important international banks and their participation are to South Africa. The threats not only come from the United Nations in this regard, but I may, for example, refer to documents issued by the Labour Party who is in power in Britain at the moment and in terms of which the Labour Government is asking, <i>inter alia,</i> to deal with the termination of all export credit, loans and guarantees to South Africa, to the question of whether trade missions should be continued, to the question of ending banking links with South Africa, to the question of trying to prevent further British investment in South Africa and to the ending of cover under the Overseas Investment and Export Guarantee Act in respect of facilities for South Africa. In the United States of America there have also been murmurs in this regard. For example, the Democratic Party platform has on occasions referred to the question of ending United States tax credits for taxes paid to the White minority ruled countries of Africa, as they call it. This is clearly intended to include us. There are many examples of the threats that are made to banks overseas and to companies which have interests in South Africa by the shareholders and by depositors who threaten to withdraw their accounts. In respect of multi-national corporations we have the same situation in that there are multi-national corporations which have subsidiaries here and which carry on trade with South Africa. All this constitutes a real danger if in fact these efforts were to become meaningful in the future.</p>

<p>In the past South Africa has had a movement towards an era of economic and financial independence. There has been a lot of merit in this drive to make sure that South Africa is independent in this field, but in the new situation which exists for South Africa in the world, I believe we should now enter a new age, an age of increasing involvement with overseas concerns. There is a need to widen the concept of diplomacy and to have a form of people&#x2019;s diplomacy, diplomacy which includes all sorts of people with overseas contact, such as businessmen and bankers, who should be briefed before they go overseas in order to ensure that the case of South Africa is not only put by them, but put by them in the most effective and efficient manner possible. I think we should also look at the situation in regard to investments in South Africa. I believe that the time has come that greater incentives and less disincentives should be given to invest in South Africa. I am unhappy that we should be considering matters at this particular time which will have a restrictive effect on investment of foreign banks in the Republic of South Africa. I also believe that we should offer greater tax incentives in order to encourage people to invest in South Africa. There is another matter which is perhaps the reverse of this but which we should also look at. That is that reference has been made to the following facts by the apartheid committee at the United Nations, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South African interests have also been establishing multi-national companies abroad in partnership with foreign interests. These companies have acted as a channel for the extension of South African interest even into areas where governments have instituted economic sanctions against South Africa.</block>

<p>I believe that there should be greater encouragement to investment by South African concerns overseas, and that the time has come to look at the exchange control regulations in South Africa in order to permit of the expansion of businesses overseas not merely to earn more foreign exchange for South Africa overseas, but also to look at the long-term interests of South Africa in order to have these connections of which our enemies disapprove. If all in South Africa, whether they are in business or whether they are private individuals, whether they have business connections or whether they have family relations overseas, act as ambassadors for South Africa in order to put South Africa&#x2019;s case and are briefed in this regard, we would truly have a people&#x2019;s diplomacy in South Africa, which I believe would be of the greatest <span class="col_4757-4758" refersTo="page_0792"/>assistance to our professional diplomats who are putting our case.</p>

<p>I believe that the world is entering a new phase of foreign relations. The position of the United States in the so-called post-Vietnam era is going to create quite a different position. We are going to have situations of disengagement and of non-intervention. Basically it is going to mean that the countries of the world will have to look after themselves to an ever increasing extent. We have spoken at considerable length about our interests in the Indian Ocean, but in the Indian Ocean we shall find that in so far as the Western powers are concerned, the eastern coast of Africa will become increasingly unfriendly to Western countries and that the West is, in fact, likely to phase out of the Indian Ocean in future. This is, of course, a matter which should concern us in no small measure. There is yet another matter which should concern us and that is our position on the Atlantic side and especially the position of our relations with South America. There we have a continent with over 300 million people and one should, in fact, welcome the endeavours the Government has made to extend our relations and to improve them with the South American States. I believe the time will come when we will have to look increasingly to South America for friendship and trade, for investments in fields such as construction and mining, and for exchanges in the scientific, cultural and other fields. I believe that the efforts the Government is making in South America should not only be commended but should also be accelerated as far as possible. I also believe the time will come when there will have to be a South Atlantic defence pact between the nations of South America, ourselves and other African States. I would like to see South Africa taking an initiative in that regard because I believe that our defences and good relations on the Atlantic side are as important as our position in the Indian Ocean, about which we perhaps talk a little more than we do about the Atlantic. I would like to see our relationship with South America being improved even further and I would like to see us set about the creation of this defence pact which I have referred to.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. PANSEGROUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Yeoville must excuse me if I do not follow upon the positive contribution he made, because I believe that the hon. the Minister and some of our other speakers will do so.</p>

<p>I should just like to refer to that section of the speech by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in which he referred to the position of Lesotho in the immediate past as regards its behaviour towards South Africa. We are acquainted with Lesotho because we have been living and working alongside them for a lifetime. I can tell you that we were very disappointed to note that as long ago as the Addis Ababa conference Lesotho was adopting a certain course. It was not pleasant for us to have to learn later that, in co-operation with Kenya, Libya and Guinea, Lesotho played a leading role in making things very difficult for South Africa internationally. I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout took only what was negative from this attitude by Lesotho. He even questions the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s conclusions concerning the reasons for Lesotho&#x2019;s attitude towards South Africa these days. I must tell the hon. member that he did not do so very convincingly. I want to add that I observed a certain malicious joy on the part of the hon. member, and I trust that this is not really the case.</p>

<p>I rise in this House this afternoon as someone who, as I have said, knows the people of Lesotho, because we have been living and working with them for generations. The history of the South Eastern Free State&#x2014;in fact, of the entire Free State&#x2014;has been associated with that of Lesotho for a long time. In the course of many years and generations we have been living together, there have been occasions on which we have fought. I want to refer in particular to the three Lesotho wars of 1858, 1865 and 1868. However, since 23 February 1868, viz. for 107 years, my people and the Basuto have been living alongside each other. Our destinies are indissolubly bound up with each other. If I had the opportunity to relate to this House that history of which, Sir, you, too, are aware, you would be in a position to realize what a pity it is that a situation of this kind should have developed today. We want to co-operate with Kenya, Lybia and other African states, and we are grateful for the progress there has been in this regard. But for most of us these are merely names. On the other hand, Lesotho is a reality to most of us. We deplore this estrangement, if I may call it that, that has developed between our Governments. I want to emphasize here that the two peoples <span class="col_4759-4760" refersTo="page_0793"/>co-operate because we have no alternative but to do so. In the more recent past&#x2014;I am now just calling to mind what the position is in that part of the world&#x2014;if we have had a drought, then our neighbours in Lesotho, too, have had a drought, and when we have been doing well, then that has been the case in Lesotho too. They are agriculturists and agronomists and we are agriculturists and agronomists. They are stock farmers and horse lovers and we are stock farmers and horse lovers. We in that part of the world have learnt to live together. When we have been prosperous, we have been prosperous together, and when there have been hard times, we have endured them together. Since I have been in the House, we provided those people, who were starving, with food in 1965. During the recent snow disaster that struck them, the South African Government saved those people from a critical situation, because we were in the vicinity. They were provided with food and rescued from where they had been trapped by the tremendous Snowfalls. I said that these people are agriculturists and the South African wool farmer co-operates actively with these people through the Wool Board, through which they have established that fine wool farm in the Maluti Mountains. The financing there takes place through the S.A. Wool Board plus a contribution from the Lesotho wool farmer himself.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say here, is that our national relationship there is correct and consequently I do not think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was right when he said that it was owing to our policy that minor incidents and disputes have occurred on the border. No, this is so and it is true, but it is not only with my Basuto neighbours that I have difficulties. Sometimes I have difficulties with my own neighbours too. [Interjections.] We give offence to each other within our own small community, and to my sorrow I must say that some of my people, too, give offence sometimes. But, after all, I should not be telling the truth if I were not to add that our Basuto neighbours, too, sometimes give us offence. After all, I have just told you that we are all stock farmers and are fond of our livestock. There was a time when the situation at the border was an almost impossible one. Our hon. Prime Minister met the Prime Minister of Lesotho here in the Mount Nelson Hotel in 1966. I wish I could indicate to you the position as it is now, but stock thefts over the border have dropped to a minimum on both sides. What I am trying to say is that we, the people there, co-operate. We have problems and disputes, because wherever there is a border, one will have disputes. I am dissatisfied because the tails of 40 of the long-tailed hamels&#x2014;not long-tailed, you know that one does not cut a hamel&#x2019;s tail off short&#x2014;belonging to one of my voters were cut off by a little old Basuto, whereupon he released the hamels. This kind of thing will occur, but you must not say now that I want to cut all their throats because one did this, or that all of them must be angry with us because we have difficulties from time to time.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that we appreciate the action taken by the hon. the Prime Minister, our hon. Minister of the Interior and our Government in that they have acted to bring about good relations between our people and the Basuto people again. We want to express our confidence that this good relationship will be restored at Government level, too. Sir, I want to say to all those concerned that if we should allow national relations to deteriorate there, everyone would suffer, and I must emphasize that it would be the people of Lesotho, who have to sell us their most important export product, their labour, and eventually other things, too, who would suffer most. We must sound this warning so that there will not be people who will think that taking their part in this way, if I may call it that, will be to their benefit.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we listened with great interest to the hon. member for Smithfield. At the beginning of his speech he told us that he did not agree with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout; that he did not agree with the summary of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout with regard to the dispute with Lesotho. He then told us that he had a particularly close and intimate knowledge of relations with Lesotho, a knowledge which had extended over a long period, and we then looked forward with increasing interest to the solution he would offer us. Unfortunately his time expired before he could do so and we hope that he will get a second chance to speak when he can tell us what the solution is for the problems we have in our relations with Lesotho. We look forward to his second contribution.</p>

<from><span class="col_4761-4762" refersTo="page_0794"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to speak very briefly on the question of South Africa&#x2019;s membership of the United Nations Organization. Sir, it was a cause of very great regret to us that following the difficulties we experienced at the United Nations last year, the Government should have resorted to what we had hoped was a thing of the past, and that is a resumption of threats to leave the United Nations. Sir, if one reads in the local papers the rather sensational accounts that are selectively presented to the South African public about what happens at the United Nations, then it would certainly seem that the verkramptes who desire that we should leave have got a case. They argue that there is nothing to be gained by our membership of the United Nations and very little to lose by our non-participation. There is a large section of people, particularly amongst the supporters of the Government, who believe that this is so. Sir, I think that one needs to look at this much more carefully. While one certainly has the gravest reservations about the kind of thing that has been happening lately in that organization, one needs to look at rather more than the sensational reports that have been made public and look rather more deeply into the advantages and disadvantages of belonging to the United Nations Organization. Sir, in past years we have been encouraged by the very rational view taken by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and others about our membership of the United Nations. I remember that some years ago, in response to a private member&#x2019;s motion, the hon. the Minister himself said in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our relations with the United Nations are an important matter. The United Nations is an important institution. As a matter of fact, it is the most important world organization. It is also very important to South Africa as a member and as a foundation member of the organization and as a country that is constantly receiving the attention of the organization. I believe that the United Nations has the right to exist.</block>

<p>Sir, while I might have expressed it differently myself, I agree with the sentiments of the hon. the Minister. The question really is what have we to gain by withdrawal. Let us look at the case of Israel, for example. It is sometimes useful to make an objective comparison. Israel has been under extremely heavy attack at the United Nations. Israel is in dire trouble in the Middle East, but it is unthinkable to any objective observer that Israel would try to strengthen its position in the Middle East by abandoning its defences in New York. To anyone who knows the situation and who knows the attitude of the Israeli delegation and the Israeli Government, it is quite unthinkable that they would abandon their New York defences in the hope of strengthening their position in the Middle East. One has only to state the proposition to see how unrealistic it is.</p>

<p>Sir, let me make a second point. It was very clearly stated at Lusaka by those who have little sympathy for South Africa and no particularly good intentions towards South Africa that they would dearly love to see South Africa pushed out of the U.N. At Dar-es-Salaam, while I have not yet received the full and final text of the Dar-es-Salaam Declaration, I believe that attitude was maintained. Now, at Lusaka the Central East African countries declared in their manifesto that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa should be excluded from U.N. from the agencies and from U.N. itself. It should be ostracized by the world trade pattern and left to be self-sufficient if it can. The South African Government cannot be allowed both to reject the very concept of mankind&#x2019;s unity and to benefit by the strength given through friendly international relations.</block>

<p>Now, if this is the attitude, then clearly if South Africa were to leave U.N. it would be doing precisely what our enemies would like. We would in fact be committing a kind of international <i>hara-kiri</i> for the benefit of those who are opposed to us.</p>

<p>Sir, the fundamental principles of U.N. have to do with the promotion of international co-operation and the maintenance of international peace and security. I think if one could sum up briefly what the main aims of the organization are, those are the main aims. If there were no U.N. in the world, we would have to invent one. It is an essential part of the international system. It is something we cannot do without. Sir, U.N. is part of the world and we cannot leave U.N. any more than we can say that we want to leave the world&#x2014;stop it, we want to get off. It is essential to our own international security that it should be there and that we should remain a member of it.</p>

<p><span class="col_4763-4764" refersTo="page_0795"/>It is, as the hon. the Minister has himself pointed out, a world centre of diplomacy. It is a platform to justify our policies, to answer our critics; it is the key to our membership of the specialized agencies. Now, the specialized agencies are of course representative of many endeavours and many human activities. They deal with such things as agriculture, food, health, telecommunications, atomic energy and civil aviation. They deal with a wide variety of subjects which are essential in the international field. There was a time when the Nationalist Government&#x2014;and I think it must be said in their defence that it was in the beginning of their period of gaining experience of international affairs&#x2014;deliberately left some of these specialized agencies. They regret it to this day because it is much easier to leave a specialized agency than it is to rejoin it, and South Africa has in many respects suffered incalculable harm through leaving these agencies. We still belong to a few and we now go to extreme lengths to defend our membership of those agencies. It is of the utmost importance, for example, that we should remain a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency. If we were to leave U.N. our membership of these technical agencies would in fact be placed in jeopardy, because our claim to membership would be greatly weakened by our absence from U.N. I believe it is right to say that U.N. has disappointed many expectations. The conduct of certain countries over such issues as the credentials, for example, last year, was a grave disappointment not only to South Africans but to many responsible countries which looked to that organization as one which should be dealing with the real problems of the world. Sir, the real problems of the world are only too obvious, and for U.N. to abandon its attempts to solve those major problems and to concentrate on the perennial old topics is of course totally unrealistic. One agrees very much with the United States&#x2019; ambassador to the United Nations when he spoke some months ago and condemned what he called &#x201C;the sterile pursuit of empty majorities&#x201D;. There is, however, I submit a real majority at the United Nations. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, any country that values its sovereignty also has a certain amount of self-respect and reverence for what it believes in and what is of cardinal importance to it. Consequently I cannot agree entirely with the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Von Brandis and the words of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to the effect that because we have the right to do so, we should stay in the U.N. at all costs. If you would allow me, I want to approach the matter from a different angle. I want to approach it as would a representative of a country which has just come into being and which seeks representation abroad, since the country&#x2019;s people encourage its government also to take part in matters outside its sphere. My first step as a representative would be to read the charter of the U.N. to find out about this organization that offers my country the opportunity of further realizing itself. I want to quote a few extracts from the Charter and in the light thereof you should realize why the Government is justified in stating that it wants to reconsider its continued membership. At the very beginning I read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We, the peoples of the United Nations, are determined to save succeeding generations from the scourges of war which twice in our lifetime have brought untold sorrow to mankind.</block>

<p>I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and for these ends to practise tolerance and to live together in peace with one another as good neighbours.</block>

<p>I read these extracts in the same way as would the representatives of an independent state that has just come into being. Section 1(2) provides further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect and the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.</block>

<p>The only other extract I want to read is section 2(7) which could influence me, as the representative of a sovereign country, in acquiring membership of U.N. for my country&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State or shall require their members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter.</block>

<p><span class="col_4765-4766" refersTo="page_0796"/>Let us take it that the new country applies and is accepted as a member of U.N. as South Africa has been accepted for 29 years. The first problem the new country might come up against is the possibility that its credentials could be rejected, as, after 28 years, South Africa&#x2019;s were rejected. What are a country&#x2019;s credentials&#x003F; They merely constitute a documentary proof that the representative who has taken his seat in the assembly hall of U.N. has been deputed by the legal government of the country in question. I think that those documents are signed either by the Prime Minister, the head of state, or by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. They merely constitute documentary evidence that it is not any Tom, Dick or Harry who has taken his seat in the Assembly hall on behalf of that State. If, then, my credentials are rejected, I must surely have the right to reconsider my position. Through, the years South Africa has, without fail, kept faith in that it has acted in accordance with the Charter of the organization to which it belongs. The second matter that would strike a newcomer to that hall would be the fact that he would immediately be confronted by bloc formation. Whichever part of the world he may come from he will be confronted by a bloc of communist countries, Afro-Asiatic countries, African countries, or of the Arab countries. At the moment there is another bloc, called the Third World. They call themselves the unaligned countries that are neither left nor right, but in his first speech at U.N. Mr. Kissinger, nevertheless referred to &#x201C;the alignment of the unaligned&#x201D;, the commitment of the uncommitted. Possibly this new member would like to have a part in the fine things mentioned by the hon. member for Von Brands, for example the World Health Organization, Unesco, etc. All of us want to participate in those things, whether we receive something or only give. Another factor which the newcomer has to face is the fact that as the representative of his country he will be faced with enemies. Every country has its enemies, whether at home or abroad. Although such, a member represents his country he may, in the third place, be confronted by other organizations that are admitted there as observers, not to vote, but for whom a platform is created and who can take part in the proceedings by expressing themselves against any country. They may be organizations within or outside a country. That newcomer, if it has an enemy outside its country that is linked to one of these power blocs that are hostile to it, has no chance. Those organizations may be of any kind.</p>

<p>In reading the United Nations&#x2019; Charter, nowhere does one come across a reference to the Almighty, to Higher Authority. Nowhere in the entire concept of the United Nations does one find any reference to religious faith. That should lead one to understand why it is so striking that certain clerics make such constant use of it to denigrate various countries, e.g. South. Africa, there. One of them is the Rev. Michael Scott, who is probably one of the biggest anti-South African lobbyists at U.N.</p>

<p>However, there is also a ray of light for that representative who would like to take part in what is worthwhile in the U.N. We are grateful that that ray of light shone brightest, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout also put it, when the right of veto was exercised by three Western countries. I am only going to quote passages to prove that there is, in fact, still a ray of light and that there is still an opportunity for a man to put his case. In his reply, the representative of the United States had, <i>inter alia,</i> the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that the just solution of South Africa&#x2019;s racial dilemma indeed lies in South Africa itself taking practical steps towards improving the conditions of non-Whites and seeking changes through communication. This seems to us more likely to have impact than some other measures suggested. The United Nations was not founded to be simply a league of the just. Rather, in our view, it is a unique international forum for exchanging ideas where those practising obnoxious doctrines and policies may be made to feel the full weight of the world opinion.</block>

<p>France states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because the United Nations is the place where each can influence the other, where the smallest can make themselves heard by the largest and the youngest by the oldest. Because it is one of the centres of universal policy it should retain within its ranks those who, for better or for worse, have public power.</block>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Brentwood stated <span class="col_4767-4768" refersTo="page_0797"/>the problems surrounding U.N. membership very lucidly and I am not going to follow him in that regard.</p>

<p>When discussing South Africa&#x2019;s foreign relations, Africa remains an extremely relevant and pertinent subject. In this regard I should like to associate myself, in the course of my speech, with a remark made by the hon. the Minister this afternoon concerning human dignity. In passing, it is perhaps important, and very fitting, that the Foreign Affairs Vote should come up for discussion just after we have discussed the Defence Vote. In point of fact, these two constitute two sides of the same coin. Through the one we seek contact, dialogue and peace<i>&#x2014;inter alia</i> in Africa&#x2014;while on the other hand we are preparing ourselves for the alternative, viz. violence and terror, which is threatening everyone in Southern Africa. A situation of this kind is possibly closer to realization than we want to believe.</p>

<p>Fortunately the door to contact and dialogue is now open. The hon. the Minister referred to that as well. He also referred to the major part played by our hon. Prime Minister in this regard. For various reasons it is understandable that in its dialogue with South Africa&#x2014;to the extent that it is still prepared to want to conduct dialogue&#x2014; Africa, too, reveals two approaches. In this regard reference is often made to the doves and the hawks. In particular, these approaches are characterized and illustrated by two manifestos, viz. the Lusaka Manifesto of 1969 and the Mogadishu Declaration of 1971. In the same way, African leaders regard this manifesto and declaration as two sides of the same coin. In an interview with the periodical <i>Africa,</i> published in the February, 1975, edition, the President Kaunda said, <i>inter alia,</i> in this regard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Lusaka Manifesto and the Mogadishu Declaration are really two sides of one and the same coin. First of all we offer peace in the Lusaka Manifesto. That offer of peace still stands.</block>

<p>President Kaunda then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What the Mogadishu Declaration did was to say that, if they do not negotiate on terms outlined by the Lusaka Manifesto, an intensification of the war must take place as our only viable alternative.</block>

<p>The question must therefore be asked whether this so-called offer of peace as contained in the Lusaka Manifesto does, in fact, offer us a basis of contact and dialogue. We can reply to that in the affirmative, on certain very definite conditions. Apart from the fact that it must be clearly stated that there is a great deal in this Manifesto which is totally unacceptable to us because it rests on incorrect interpretation and on incorrect facts in regard to South Africa, on the other hand we can confirm that there is sufficient in the Lusaka manifesto to serve as a sound basis for further discussion. It is impossible to deal with all the aspects of this Manifesto in the short time at my disposal. However, the essence of this Manifesto is that justice must be done to the principles of human dignity and equality. The Manifesto itself puts it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All that the rest of the world has a right to demand is just what we are now asserting, that the arrangements within any state which wishes to be accepted into the community of nations, must be based on the acceptance of the principles of human dignity and equality.</block>

<p>Fundamentally, therefore, what is at issue is human dignity and equality. The Manifesto also provides that these ideals must, in time, be realized in the realities of the specific circumstances of the various countries. They accept that this will not occur overnight and for that reason the Manifesto also states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We recognize that for the sake of order in human affairs there may be transitional arrangements while a transformation from group inequality to individual equality is being effected.</block>

<p>Then the drafters of this Manifesto add&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">None of us would claim that within our own States we have achieved the perfect socio-economic and political organization, &#x2026; etc.</block>

<p>To come back to South Africa&#x2019;s position: It is the aim and the ideal of this Government, too, to promote human dignity and give meaning to the concept of equality. Let us take a brief look at these ideals in terms of our present policy in South Africa. As far as the first, viz. human dignity, is concerned, it means that a person&#x2019;s value <span class="col_4769-4770" refersTo="page_0798"/>must be respected and developed. Human dignity means that sufficient living space must be created to enable a person to conduct his life as, in fact, a dignified human being would. Then, too, human dignity has much to do with the wage that is paid, with the house in which the person lives and with his education and standard of living. Nevertheless, the recognition of human dignity is based on a condition which, if not respected, may over the long term threaten to send all human dignity in South Africa and, in fact, in Africa too, up in flames. The condition for true human dignity is simple, and yet it cuts deep into the being of man. This condition is that an individual, a community or a people can only recognize the dignity of another if he or it accepts and respects his or its own dignity. One can only respect and honour another if one honours and respects oneself as an individual or a people, one can only honour and respect the language, culture, freedom or rights of another if one has sufficient honour and respect for a language, culture, freedom and rights of one&#x2019;s own. Taken together, this means that separate development as developed by the Government over the long term is the only sound basis on which the greatest degree of human dignity in South Africa, and possibly in Africa, too, can be effected.</p>

<p>The second aspect is that of equality. Equality <i>per se</i> is a meaningless word. People are not equal <i>in abstracto</i> and we in this House&#x2014;thank goodness&#x2014;are not all equal, either. Equality has, therefore, to be qualified. Today equality is generally considered to mean equal opportunities, and people should achieve what they are entitled to. By means of those equal opportunities, people, even in competition with others, should achieve what they regard as their rightful share. As far as equal opportunities are concerned, therefore, this Government, to a greater extent, perhaps, than any other Government in Africa and in the world may express an opinion. In fact, in our efforts to create equal opportunities, we have gone so far that many people in South Africa&#x2014;I say this with all respect&#x2014;have been placed in posts which are beyond their capabilities and which, in a different dispensation, they would possibly never have occupied.</p>

<p>Of course, as far as human dignity and equal opportunities are concerned, we still have a long way to go. Along the way we shall continue to strive to get away from discrimination and to promote sound and normal relationships between people. That, surely, is the declared policy of this Government and has been stated repeatedly by the hon. the Prime Minister. The fact remains that in terms of our policy and in terms of the ideals of this policy, as far as human dignity and equality, too, are concerned, a just case can be made for South Africa in the forums of Africa and, in fact, in any forum anywhere in the world.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Johannesburg West indicated that he thought it was appropriate that this debate should follow the debate on the Vote of the Minister of Defence. I think he and I are in agreement on one issue, namely that it is a good thing for South Africa&#x2014;we have to thank the Prime Minister for this&#x2014;that the person holding the high and important office of Minister of Foreign Affairs is the member for Beaufort West and not the member for George.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the Lusaka Manifesto, as was done previously outside of this House by the hon. member for Pretoria Central. I am pleased that there is an increasing interest in the meaning and importance of this document. It has been my view and I have stated it in this House before that the Government of South Africa made a tragic mistake in not assessing the importance of the document when it was issued way back in July 1969. There is a dichotomy in that document between the arguments advanced for peaceful change and for those justifying violence. I think the Government at that time concentrated too much on the rationale for violence rather than seeing this document as the hon. member and the Government are seeing it now&#x2014;as basis for reconciliation in South Africa and in Africa and as a basis for South Africa understanding Africa and reaching out its hand towards Africa.</p>

<p>I find myself in considerable agreement with the hon. the Minister in his analysis of what is perhaps the changing attitude of the West because there is no doubt that the West in particular is going through a phase of re-examining its global strategy. I agree with him that perhaps the key date which triggered off the reassessment of the West&#x2019;s total global strategy was 15 October 1973 when the oil-producing nations not only pushed up the price of oil but also cut back the level of production and for <span class="col_4771-4772" refersTo="page_0799"/>the first time applied an embargo on certain countries because of their political views. This has had a profound impact on the whole of the Western world. It has caused the Western world to re-examine a strategy in international affairs, a strategy which, had been applied for some 30 years since the end of the last World War. Its financial strategy flowed from the deliberations at Dumbarton Oaks, its economic strategy flowed from the extension of the Marshall Aid Plan to the rapid industrial development in West European nations and its military strategy rested very heavily on multilateral treates such as Nato and Seato. This had been going on for some 30 years until the fuel crisis virtually shattered the foundations of that strategy. The West has now started to restructure a strategy for the next few years. The fuel crisis has imposed a severe strain on Western fiscal strategy. As has been said it has resulted in billions of dollars sloshing around in the bottom of the money buckets of the world waiting for recycling and re-investment and creating instability and insecurity. At the same time the West can no longer be assured of unlimited supplies of cheap energy on which to base its future economic expansion. In the simple equation, of East versus West in military terms, of a West centring around the United States of America and an East, the communist countries, centring around the USSR, of the situation in the Middle East has caused the Third World, backed by the wealth of the Arabs, to become a growing military factor. This has changed the power equation which operated for some 30 years. In these circumstances of rethinking and relative uncertainty it is quite natural that a country like South Africa could be in a position to use opportunities, to see whether it can be slotted into the Western strategy, to see whether there is a place for it in the strategy of the Western world which is now being reformulated. I am pleased to note that there is a realization on the part of the hon. the Minister and his department that this is the time to take the initiative. The past year has been a year of considerable initiative in the field of Government diplomacy. There have been initiatives in relation to contacts with the West and with, Latin America. One hears initatives in the Middle East and in Africa. We believe that it is appropriate that these initatives should be being taken at a time when the West is formulating a strategy for the future.</p>

<p>When one looks in greater detail at what that hon. the Minister and his officials have accepted one finds, in the first instance, that it was important as part of the strategy to Stop defending policies of discrimination; to say: &#x201C;We have these policies, we admit we have these policies but these policies are wrong and we are going to get rid of them.&#x201D; This is the burden of the speech made by our ambassador before the Security Council. He said: &#x201C;We admit that we do discriminate, we believe that this is indefensible and we are going to do all in our power to get away from it&#x201D;. I want to congratulate the hon. Minister and his department on having adopted this attitude. This is a far cry from the attitude of his predecessor, Mr. Eric Louw, who used to think that one could score points in the defence of discrimination by saying that because the Swedes discriminated against the Lapps or because the Canadians discriminated against the Eskimos, we had a precedent for what we might be doing in South Africa. I hope that by the time our ambassador returns to the United Nations he will be able to present to them a document showing the fields in which we have removed discrimination since he gave that undertaking to the Security Council a year previously. We look forward to seeing this document. We hone that it will be positive and that it will be long.</p>

<p>In the second place, the Government has realized that the route back to the world community, for South Africa at least, is via Africa, and that reconciliation with Africa is a prerequisite for reconciliation with the rest of the civilized world. This has been one of the reasons for the initiative that has been taken. It has been a long time in coming but nevertheless it was taken in October of last year and it continues to be taken.</p>

<p>The third fact which I believe the Government has accented but which it has not as vet acted upon is that the route back to reconciliation with Africa includes reconciliation among the Black and White and Brown people in South Africa, and that this involves making substantial changes to internal policies. In the course of his speech the hon. the Minister indicated that he accepted the fact that there was a correlation between internal and external policy. What concerns me is that all these initiatives that he could be taking may be shipwrecked either by rightwingers within South Africa who want to prejudice this <span class="col_4773-4774" refersTo="page_0800"/>detente move or even by hon. members on that side of the House who do not understand what has happened and who do not appreciate the subtleties of the situation.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to certain reports that have appeared about mercenaries who have been recruited and about mercenaries who have been quizzed by security men. Only last weekend in one of the weekend newspapers we read the reports of the recruitment of mercenaries to fight in neighbouring African States and also that the hon. the Minister had been given information in this regard. We hope that the hon. the Minister will not only tell us what has been the result of the inquiry but that he will also, as he did last year, and perhaps in more emphatic terms, tell us that the Government will not permit this sort of thing and that it will take action against people who use South Africa as a happy recruiting ground to obtain the services of mercenaries to fight against other countries. Secondly, there is a growing right-wing organization within South Africa, a growing association between certain right-wing elements in South Africa and elements within Rhodesia. It is disturbing to see that Rhodesian radio and television appears to be making increasing use of right-wingers from the HNP like Mr. Ivor Benson and Prof. Adrian Pont to speak to Rhodesians on television to explain to them that the solidarity between White South Africans and Rhodesians in this situation still exists. It was also distressing to find that the brother of the hon. the Prime Minister in addressing the Rhodesian People over Rhodesian television in February of this year had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no question of throwing Rhodesia to the wolves. In this critical time of d&#x00E9;tente we must either hang together or we must hang separately.</block>

<p>We believe that this kind of phraseology used by prominent South Africans in Rhodesia at this particular time can only be damaging to what the Prime Minister is trying to achieve. Thirdly, Sir, there is the existence of a new organization known as Saskon, an organization established in Pretoria towards the end of last year. Last week another branch of this organization was established in Salisbury, and next month another branch is going to be established in Windhoek. We believe that all this is evidence of growing right-wing activities, of racialist activities, which are linking across the borders of Rhodesia, and we believe that they are going to bedevil the activities of this Government in the field of d&#x00E9;tente.

<speech by="#viljoen">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. VAN B. VILJOEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point began his speech by discussing the Lusaka Manifesto. <i>Inter alia,</i> he blamed the Government for not having given attention to this matter previously. Sir, I challenge the Progressive Party to go and submit their own policy to the Lusaka Conference or the Dar-es-Salaam conference, and they will then find out whether their own policy carries the blessing of Africa. Sir, m strong contrast to the positive policy adopted by this Government in regard to the upliftment of the peoples of South Africa and in Africa, we have this negative approach on the part of these people who, from morning to night, and in co-operation with the Progressive Press, only want to emphasize all the negative aspects. Looking at the Press, and listening to hon. members on that side of the House, one finds that the poor wages paid to our Bantu population are repeatedly emphasized. What are the true facts, the positive aspects in this regard&#x003F; The average wage in South Africa is, in fact R71, according to the survey carried out by the World Labour Organization. What is the position in the rest of Africa&#x003F; The average wage in the rest of Africa is as follows: Egypt, R15, Mauritius R17, Morocco R24, Sierra Leone R32 and Ghana R45. What is more, Sir, it is that same party that is constantly pleading for the release of communists in South Africa. They hardly let a session go past without making this plea here. Sir, perhaps hon. members regard the subject of Communism as rather a stale one; perhaps we have discussed it too much. It is noteworthy that thus far in the debate, very little has been said about it. But we can never overlook the role of communism, particularly when discussing African affairs. The ideological struggle of the Third World against Communism has again suffered a severe jolt, owing to the collapse of Cambodia and Vietnam, events which have, in fact, shaken the Western world. They have shown us that it is not merely an ideological struggle, but that it is, in fact, a life and death struggle. Since the West gave virtually half of Europe do Communism at Yalta and Potsdam, the communists have simply gone from strength to strength in the Third World. They have gradually spread <span class="col_4775-4776" refersTo="page_0801"/>their antennae across the whole of Africa and are constantly engulfing more of the world. Here in Africa, too, and in the Indian Ocean, they have moved closer to reality as far as South Africa is concerned. This efficient onslaught on the spirit of the West, as well as the physical presence of Communism in Europe, in the East and here in Africa, too, is no longer a theoretical concept but a hard fact which we have to take fully into account in our view of politics.</p>

<p>The question arises as to the nature of the secret of this phenomenal success, particularly in regard to Africa. There are a few definite reasons for this. In the first place, there is the fanatical driving force and imaginativeness that is closely linked to the needs of the less-developed people in Africa in particular; secondly, through the exploitation of the lack of economic means and the educational background of the peoples of Africa; in the third instance, the creation of a common enemy, in this particular instance, South Africa and Southern Africa and in the Middle East, Israel. In contrast to this communist onslaught on the Third World, the West&#x2019;s counterattack, which has failed pitifully, is based on the handing out of alms, shipments of dollars and other aids to Africa, without the recipient having the necessary skill to utilize them. How the West could think that they could buy the goodwill of Africa, or that this assistance would constitute an effective counter to Communism, is quite beyond me, because no one that I know of loves his creditors. The key to Africa, and an effective counter to communism, is to be found in a new vision, a new diplomacy, and fortunately our Government discovered this before it was too late. For many years, owing to historical reasons, we were linked to the old British diplomacy, but today we are letting cur own diplomacy develop in Africa since, of all the peoples in the world, we are the best equipped to conduct a diplomacy, specifically in Africa, which is not only to our benefit, but to their benefit too, because we are, in fact, aware of the situation here and grew up with it. This new diplomacy is based on entirely new principles. In the first instance, it is based on our absolute honesty in order to establish unequalled confidence and eradicate mistaken impressions&#x2014;in strong contrast to the diplomacy of old in which one had to read between the lines to detect the true facts. In the second instance, it is based on a fixed intention to eradicate these mistaken impressions by means of dialogue. As far as technical assistance to the developing countries is concerned, our policy is not based on the policy of handing out alms, but on a policy of industrial partnership, which affords those people, too, a share in the development with an accompanying responsibility of their own, something that is absolutely essential. In the fourth instance, this new diplomacy requires an effective propaganda machine, and this is undoubtedly attended to by our Department of Information. Just consider this Government&#x2019;s outstanding achievement in having spent R57 million per annum on homeland development between 1960 and 1970, in strong contrast to the total effort by U.N. viz. R27,6 million to 38 countries with a total population of 190 million people. It is information of this kind which, in our new diplomacy, must be positively communicated to the world. The Western ideology badly needs an ideal which the masses of Africa can seize on and strive towards. That is where we fail. Capitalism in its present form symbolizes, to them, only the exploitation of the labour force for the enrichment of a few moneyed people. I am no champion of socialism, but there is one thing that is certain, viz. that in the future we shall have to make adjustments to our capitalist system. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. D. TERBLANCHE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the north wind of change over Africa has changed and is now blowing from the south. Even the leftist <i>Daily Mirror</i> of Britain cannot help but write: &#x201C;The winds of change are blowing across Africa again and this time, unbelievably, it is John Vorster who is fanning them.&#x201D; How true that is! Despite the negative decisions taken in Dar-es-Salaam recently, nobody can dispute the fact that South Africa&#x2019;s peace offensive in Southern Africa has so far had a very meaningful effect. No other subject was more extensively discussed at the conference of Black leaders than South Africa&#x2019;s endeavours to bring about peace. That was the crux of their discussions; South Africa was the centre of interest there. What is important is that African leaders decided at that conference to continue talking to South Africa about the key questions, i.e. about Rhodesia and South West Africa, and that they also decided to give peaceful negotiation a chance. This is a victory for South Africa&#x2019;s endeavours.</p>

<p>The d&#x00E9;tente policy which was initiated by South Africa, is the catalyst of this new <span class="col_4777-4778" refersTo="page_0802"/>way of thinking, this new dialogue, and it holds the key to breathtaking new possibilities. It really seems as if Southern Africa is shaking off the after-effects of the Uhuru orgy and is considering the problems of Africa with greater realism and pragmatism. A chain reaction of goodwill has been initiated by the endeavours of South Africa, not only in Africa, but throughout the entire Western world. Progress has undoubtedly been made and it has been made in spite of the fact that the hon. the Prime Minister did not try to achieve understanding and improved relations by means of sentimental talk and promises of concessions. We are able to negotiate from a position of strength because we have not yielded as far as our policy is concerned. We did not humiliate ourselves, because we did not crawl and we have no intention of crawling before Africa.</p>

<p>A new spirit of understanding and goodwill towards our hon. Prime Minister has started to manifest itself throughout the world. The world approves of his positive message of co-operation and peace, and the world wants us to continue in that vein. This is proved to us every day. We have stretched out the hand of friendship to Black Africa and it has not been refused. There is more than one who is prepared to accept this hand of friendship in spite of communist inspired pressure that this should not be done.</p>

<p>The message which we have transmitted to Africa so often recently, spelt out only one thing, i.e. &#x201C;peace, peace for all in Southern Africa&#x201D;. We are seeking peace and we seek it sincerely, although not at any price. Peace can transform Southern Africa into an economic giant, but what is the alternative to peace in Southern Africa&#x003F; The alternative is a cruel, hard reality.</p>

<p>If this desire for peace is not of a reciprocal nature, it can only lead to conflict and then the shocking choice we will be faced with is peace or annihilation. If peace were to fail. South Africa could become a cauldron of terror. This is what the British Institute for the Study of Conflict predicts &#x2014;&#x201C;If the present endeavours to bring about peace in Southern Africa fail, a new escalation of violence may be expected.&#x201D; One shudders at the thought of what would happen if a full-scale armed conflict were to break out in Southern Africa. It could bring Southern Africa to its knees. That is why Western countries and responsible leaders have so much appreciation for the peace endeavours of South Africa. They realize only too well that South African cannot afford armed violence. Whereas Africa is emerging from its poverty, confrontation would only bring about increased poverty and misery. Fortunately there are Black leaders who appreciate this and have also warned against it. We heard their voices, too, at the conference in Dar-es-Salaam. I want to quote a few examples of what they had to say there. President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania referred to &#x201C;peaceful means&#x201D; and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our sincerity in saying that we would prefer to negotiate rather than to destroy, to talk rather than to kill, has been demonstrated afresh in recent months.</block>

<p>The Zambian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Vernon Mwaanga, said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Zambia does not want the state of war with South Africa over the Rhodesian question to continue. In the absence of a solution for the Rhodesian problem a war could go on for 10, 20, 30, 40 or even 50 years. Zambia is of the opinion that the solution can be found through negotiations.</block>

<p>What is more important, at this conference of the OAU, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Ivory Coast, Mr. Assouan, had the following to say to his colleagues there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is all very well for some of my colleagues to say that we should emulate Vietnam. Do we really want millions of dead Africans as there have been and are millions of dead Vietnamese&#x003F; Africa has lost enough lives; it needs peace not blood.</block>

<p>It seems as if reason is prevailing again.</p>

<p>There is, however, another danger we have to warn Southern Africa against. Black States which accept communist aid and which collaborate with the communists of Peking and Moscow, should know that they cannot do so without dire consequences. There are countries in Africa which are paving the way for Peking and Moscow in their major onslaught on Africa. The consequences of that may be disastrous for these countries. It could give rise to a deadly stranglehold of communist imperialism, of slavery and an economic enslavement. Some countries are already paying <span class="col_4779-4780" refersTo="page_0803"/>an astonishing price for aid they receive. It took these African countries many years to throw off the colonial yoke. Let us tell them, however, that they will find it more difficult to throw off the communist yoke, if they are ever able to throw it off. The communist weapons which African countries accept, are more dangerous to them than they are to South Africa. This is going to boomerang on them and those weapons are going to explode in their hands. It creates a real danger for those countries and could push them into the line of fire, If the communists turn South Africa into a powder keg it will be these nations that will be hardest hit. The National Government has broken the back of Communism in South. Africa through determined and firm action. If the countries of Southern Africa want to stop communist infiltration and domination they will have to form a united front against the communists, and in such a united front South Africa can play a very important part.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that all of us have noted with appreciation the steps taken by the Government and the hon. the Prime Minister in recent times to bring about a degree of detente in Africa. Undoubtedly there is great appreciation on this side of the House for what the hon. the Prime Minister, the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and in particular the officials, too, have done. Here I refer to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary for Information, who have already achieved so much for us in this regard so selflessly and enthusiastically. Consequently I, too, want to associate myself with the appeal the hon. the Minister made this afternoon, viz. that we should approach this matter with the greatest circumspection and responsibility. This is certainly a matter which intimately affects all of us in this country and on which the future of all of us very largely depends.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>On a previous occasion I suggested possible constructive steps which we could consider as part of the overall policy of closer contact with Africa and I do not want to dwell on that any further today. When we consider what has occurred in the last few years, then we see that the problem that has developed for South Africa has been the danger of a growing isolation. The problem, which has in fact developed in this way in the last few decades, is associated with the efforts made by bodies and powers of all kinds to isolate South Africa in as many spheres as possible. Consequently I want to associate myself in this regard with the appeal made by the hon. member for Von Brandis, viz. that we should not take steps to isolate ourselves as regards membership of the United Nations.</p>

<p>It is clear that there have been four elements in particular which have attempted through the years to isolate South Africa in as many spheres as possible. There are the communists&#x2014;and in this regard I want to associate myself at once with the hon. member for Bloemfontein North&#x2014;communist influences and communist forces, but communists, too, who operate in other countries and who have made use of every possible opportunity to isolate South Africa in all these spheres. In the second place there are the various non-White peoples&#x2014;here I am, of course, referring to the colonial peoples of earlier times&#x2014;who have judged the South African situation and our treatment of our own non-Whites on the basis of their own colonial background and history. There are the Western powers who, owing to the new power situation that has developed in the world owing to the liberation of former colonial powers, the rise of the new power and the factors to which the hon. member for Sea Point referred, in fact found it difficult not to associate themselves particularly with the third force, the non-White parts of the world, in their opposition to South Africa. In the fourth place there are those who, through their opposition to South Africa, have created vested interests&#x2014;the hon. the Minister referred to this earlier today&#x2014;and what this amounts to is that they will stiffen their opposition in relation as a we succeed in bringing about d&#x00E9;tente. It seems to me that it is these four forces in particular that have succeeded in isolating South Africa to the extent that we are in fact isolated. That each of these four has been motivated by its own considerations surely goes without saying. It is also clear that there has been one cohesive factor running through everything like a thread and which has unwittingly assisted all four powers in acting jointly against South Africa and bringing about this isolation. That single factor is our domestic policy. Consequently it seems to me that if we want to practise a strategy to improve the situation for ourselves, <span class="col_4781-4782" refersTo="page_0804"/>then we must attempt to breach that unity. It is very clear that the communists only use our domestic policy, our colour policy, as an instrument. They are not interested in the furtherance of the interests of our non-Whites, they are only interested in the furtherance of their own interests and the establishment of communist power in as many parts of the world as possible. It is very clear, too, that the non-White peoples, particularly the Black peoples of Africa, owing to the common awareness of the degree to which they as Blacks suffered, are very frequently incapable of judging what we are doing in Africa and the problems with which we are faced here. If, then, we really want to make progress, it seems to me that we must, and in fact we can, get the Black countries of Africa and the Western powers on our side and isolate the communist elements and the irresponsible elements in the Third World, by furnishing proof that we do in fact, in our domestic policy, uphold principles that are acceptable in terms of the ideals for which the Western world and Western civilization stand.</p>

<p>It has already been conceded that we want to move away from discrimination and&#x2014;this is the point I want to make&#x2014;we can already see the positive results of our efforts thus far to get Black and White in Rhodesia to reach the point of seeking a political and peaceful solution. The positive results of the undertaking given by our ambassador at U.N. in regard to breaking away from discrimination are already visible. The degree to which a better understanding of South Africa already exists, is directly linked to the degree to which we have shown that we do in fact want to adapt our domestic policy to those higher ethical norms in which we as Westerners believe.</p>

<p>In this connection it is very clear to me that we cannot get away from this merely by falling back on what we want to bring about when territories such as the homelands are independent. I want to tell the hon. member for Vasco that although, it is true that when the Transkei is independent we are going to furnish those people with opportunities for political expression, we cannot get away from the question: In what respect will the position of one individual Transkeian citizen, after the independence of the Transkei, be different to what it is today&#x003F; Hon. members must not misunderstand me. I am not interested in blaming the Government for everything that is wrong in South Africa for the sake of petty party-political gain. What we have here is a historical situation and forces that developed here long before this Government came to power, but we must also admit&#x2014;and it is admitted&#x2014;that there are, in fact, many things that need to be rectified. If we want to continue to consolidate our position in the world in regard to those elements that are of importance to us&#x2014; the Western world and the rest of Africa &#x2014;the real problem lies in the fact that as far as the nature and the tempo of the change is concerned we are still incapable of providing an answer. What I advocate is that we should capitalize on the goodwill we have already achieved by means of the steps that have been taken. We can only capitalize when we furnish evidence as regards the nature and tempo of the change so that our Western friends and other Western countries and the countries in Africa, too, may have something on which to base their hope. It seems to me that this can be achieved easily enough when we all strive for that together. This side of the House is certainly not interested in undermining or subverting the real efforts being made to bring about d&#x00E9;tente. This side of the House would like to make its contribution to determine what the nature and tempo of change should be so as to move further in this direction without endangering the interests of anyone and in this way, to stabilize and develop further these efforts that have already proved so fruitful.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Brakpan)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Edenvale began by praising the Department of Foreign Affairs and also the Department of Information for the fine contribution made by them to recent events which took place in Africa. As far as that is concerned, I want to agree with, him wholeheartedly and I shall elaborate on that later in my speech. In a later stage of this speech, when he mentioned the elements which bring about isolation and the factor which is actually the chief contributor to our isolation, namely the internal policy of this Government, he was plucking at the old strings again. Strangely enough, he is a man who for many years believed passionately in those things which this Government is implementing <span class="col_4783-4784" refersTo="page_0805"/>in practice at this stage. I want to submit this to his consideration, i.e. that it is not our internal policy which creates the problem because, as has been said repeatedly, it is at this very moment that the African countries are beginning to show understanding of our internal policy and are beginning to appreciate our internal policy. The great success of the negotiations is actually to be found in the fact that we have made a breakthrough, to other states, as far as our policy is concerned.</p>

<p>To come back to the good work which this department is doing with regard to d&#x00E9;tente, it is interesting to note that, as the hon. member for Vasco mentioned, this department was only established on 1 June 1927. It was actually the Balfour Declaration which preceded the establishment of the Department of Foreign Affairs. When thinking of the Balfour Declaration, we cannot fail to call to mind once again the mighty and tireless contribution which Gen. Hertzog made in this connection. He insisted that it should be understood very clearly, that there should be no misunderstanding about the fact that the different countries would be autonomous communities with equal status and subordinated to one another in no way in their domestic or foreign affairs, but freely associated in the British Commonwealth of Nations. In other words, our status as an independent power was actually given shape with the establishment of the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is a department which is actually still so young that the present hon. Minister is only the second Minister who has been charged with, this portfolio as a separate Government department of full status. Before 1927, the Government of the United Kingdom was chiefly responsible for our foreign relations except for a few trade agreements, <i>inter alia,</i> that of 1923 with East Africa. In 1929, the Netherlands sent the first diplomatic mission to the then Union.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister mentioned that earlier South African Governments only had tentative contact with Africa. We only had a consulate in the Belgian Congo of that time. Whereas in 1934 we only maintained or began direct diplomatic relations in a humble way with Germany, Belgium and other countries, the Republic maintains more than 80 offices overseas at the moment while more than 45 countries have representatives here in South Africa. South Africa is a member of more than 500 organizations. This is how we have grown.</p>

<p>As we are now entering a period of d&#x00E9;tente, and while pressure is being brought to bear on us to change our policy to allow d&#x00E9;tente to succeed, the correctness of our foreign policy should be emphasized anew. We demand only that there should be no interference in our domestic policy, and we plainly refrain from interference in the domestic policy of others. The fundamental idea of our foreign policy, is, therefore, logical and correct and in agreement with jurisprudence, with the laws of nature, and with the idea of the territorial imperative. After all, I do not interfere with the personal affairs of my neighbour. I respect what is the property of my neighbour, even if he is weaker than I am. I shall not challenge him on his territory.</p>

<p>While there is such talk about our relations with Lesotho, it is interesting to recall again what Chief Jonathan said a few years ago in this connection. I recommend this book to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. It is Douglas Reed&#x2019;s <i>The Siege of Southern Africa,</i> where Chief Jonathan then said the following, according to the author&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has its own Government which was elected by the South Africans in accordance with the provisions of their own Constitution and laws. It is not for Lesotho to interfere in South African politics. Leave the problems of South Africa to the South Africans. This accords with the principle of independent States. Lesotho&#x2019;s safety lies purely and simply in the degree to which Lesotho can maintain friendship with South Africa and also with the rest of the free world.</block>

<p>I think a few of these things should be submitted to the consideration of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who mentioned that we did not really have very cordial relations with other countries in Africa and in the world. I want to submit to his consideration the technical and scientific co-operation which South Africa offers Africa and other countries in the world. It is actually ironic to realize that the OAU in point of fact grew from ideas and from organizations initiated by South. Africa itself.</p>

<p>I think, for example, of the Scientific Council for Africa South of the Sahara and the Commission for Technical Co-operation in Africa South of the Sahara. I want to submit to the consideration of the hon. <span class="col_4785-4786" refersTo="page_0806"/>member the work done by Sarccus&#x2014;the Southern Africa Regional Commission for the Conservation and Utilization of the Soil &#x2014;an organization which is described as one of the most successful undertakings in bringing about inter-state co-operation in Africa on a technical basis. We think of Onderstepoort. As you know, Sir, in earlier years, reference was made to a city such as Pretoria as a small place near Onderstepoort. Onderstepoort produces 100 million doses of vaccine against 28 different diseases annually and makes these available to the whole world. Are these not attempts at cordial co-operation&#x003F; Are these not attempts at entente in Africa and in the rest of the world&#x003F; I am not even speaking of the guidance, the advice and the diagnoses and research which are made available to the whole world by Onderstepoort. We think of the assistance and knowledge made available, especially to African countries, with regard to agriculture.</p>

<p>There are veterinary services and services by our Wool Board&#x2014;and in this connection I want to refer to Lesotho once again&#x2014;by our wool industry which diffuses our knowledge and makes the results of our extensive and sophisticated research on sheep breeding and the classification of wool available to other countries. We think of the stud farm, 1 300 ha in extent, at Mokhotlong in Lesotho which was established by the South African Wool Board. We think of the work of the CSIR, which the hon. the Minister mentioned, and of the South African Bureau of Standards, with its 600 scientists and technicians, which offers cordial co-operation to the rest of Africa and to the rest of the world. There is also the co-operation and guidance given in respect of water supplies; there is the provision of employment opportunities to more than 600 000 workers of other countries in Africa; the trade with Africa which amounts to approximately R300 million per year, according to the 1974 Year Book; the tremendous contribution in respect of health services through the Institute for Medical Research; the seconding of staff; medical assistance; the financial aid from the loan fund for economic co-operation and promotion. These are tremendous and concrete examples which give wings to the ideas of the hon. the Minister in this connection. I want to repeat this idea: We do not only demand for ourselves our continued existence in Africa; we also accept the responsibilities which go together with that. Our whole Africa policy is continually seen in the light of our responsibility towards ourself as a nation of Africa and towards other nations on this continent. We are co-operating here in the interests of other nations and in the interests of ourselves. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the beginning of his speech the hon. member for Brakpan paid tribute to the Department of Foreign Affairs and to the hon. the Minister. I should like to underline and endorse his words in this regard. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs is in the front line of the whole movement of d&#x00E9;tente and peace in Southern Africa. The Department of Foreign Affairs was described by the then hon. member for Wonderboom in his maiden speech as the shock-absorber of South Africa. This is apt and true in many ways. Particularly in recent months the hon. the Minister together with his department and many others certainly have had to endure a great number of shocks and to withstand enormous pressure in trying to bring about the necessary d&#x00E9;tente, the necessary movement towards peace in Southern Africa and in Africa itself. I want to try to suggest several ways in which this movement towards peace can be enhanced and encouraged.</p>

<p>In the first instance, it is absolutely essential in our view that membership of the United Nations should be continued. We are only too aware of the difficulties and of the stresses and strains, of the insults and of the double standards, but we believe it to be absolutely imperative that South Africa continue to maintain her membership of that organization. In this connection we would do well to remember that three major countries put themselves out on a limb on behalf of South Africa during the most recent session of that organization. I am, of course, referring to the United States, France and Great Britain. It is therefore not only as far as our links with the United Nations are concerned&#x2014;I also want to refer to the remarks of the hon. the Minister in regard to our relationship with Western Europe&#x2014;that it is essential for us to try to remember that they went in, as it were, on our behalf. They had, of course, their own criticisms to offer. They had, of course, to talk about a test of the new voices emanating from South Africa. Nevertheless, they did go in to support us and we would do well to remember it.</p>

<p><span class="col_4787-4788" refersTo="page_0807"/>Last year the hon. the Prime Minister also reported that he was recalling our ambassador to the United Nations and that he was going to withdraw the contributions which, I think, were due on 30 December 1974. I hope that in his reply the hon. the Minister will inform this House whether in fact these contributions have been withheld or whether in fact we are going to pay our contributions in order to maintain our membership of that organization. In this connection too, in regard to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reference in his speech last year in this House to the Leader of the Transkei, Dr. Naidoo and Mr. Ulster accompanying South Africa&#x2019;s delegation to the United Nations as observers, I should like to know whether there is any new thinking or development in this regard. It seems to us at least that we could only gain a great deal from elevating the observer status to actual delegate status. We realize again that there are enormous problems here, but we believe that it could only be to South Africa&#x2019;s advantage if a fully representative delegation attended the United Nations on our behalf.</p>

<p>The second point that I would like to make is that we need to hear the voice that we heard here this afternoon of the hon. member for Vasco, who suggested that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs should meet at regular intervals with prominent Black leaders in South Africa to discuss matters of interest in foreign affairs. I would like to support that suggestion as strongly as I can and say that if possible one should not only begin there but also go beyond that. To give an example of what I have in mind, one remembers a recent trip by a prominent businessman from South Africa, who went with Mr. Sam Motsenyane, and met a great number of people in different parts of Europe and talked about the problems and the needs of South Africa and the developments which were taking place in South Africa. The very fact that there was a representative, in the eyes of the people of Europe and Great Britain, from Black South Africa gave enormous credibility to what they were trying to do. This was not a kind of white-washing of the situation, but a simple factual account of the situation here, but I believe that the fact that there was a more representative voice there, a Black voice and a White voice, gave them a far better hearing. Sir, recently I was attending a conference on investment in London, where once again there were Blacks as well as Whites from South Africa, and the fact that this was possible meant that those of us who were arguing against disinvestment in South Africa were given a far better hearing because our plea was coming from a more representative voice. I would plead that this development should be borne in mind in this whole movement towards d&#x00E9;tente.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Sir, I want to refer to the diplomatic service. Last year the hon. the Minister told us of the training that was being started for certain Black people in South Africa&#x2014;I think for Coloureds and Whites and citizens of the Transkei. I hope that we will hear a little more about this from the hon. the Minister in his reply, and I want to suggest that we should develop beyond that as well so that there can be a truly representative force in our diplomatic corps. Then there is a fourth suggestion that I would like to make. None of these suggestions is original, but I do think that they ought to be underlined and stressed. It seems to me that in the question of d&#x00E9;tente, in the whole forward movement towards peace, it would be far better if we had contacts on a more normal, natural basis, as well as the obviously necessary official contacts. By that I mean more emphasis on exchanges between universities here and in Africa and more opportunities for people of all races to move from South Africa to other countries and for people from other countries to come here to us. I know that this is happening to a certain extent, but I want to express the hope that it will take place on a larger scale.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when our ambassador to the United Nations first came to this House, he referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and made the point that South Africa was not a signatory at that time, but that we ought to become more closely identified with this declaration. I believe, Sir, that the time has come for us to do exactly that. When we read the terms and conditions of this Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is quite obvious that is going to mean if we identify ourselves with this declaration in setting certain goals and standards for ourselves. Perhaps in our common desire to get rid of discrimination, to do the very thing that we have told the world we will do, we could adopt those standards as our goal because I think this, too, would enhance <span class="col_4789-4790" refersTo="page_0808"/>our credibility in the eyes of the world.</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it has certainly been some time since a debate has been conducted in this House on such a high level as that on which this debate has been conducted, here this afternoon, and the speech of the hon. member for Pinelands was in the spirit of this debate. Sir, in many of the debates in this House during this session, there was one subject which dominated, and that was the subject of d&#x00E9;tente in Africa. It was also the main course in the debate last week on the Vote of the hon. the Prime Minister. It was also the subject of a lively discussion in the debate on the Defence Vote and, as could be expected, it has also been in the foreground in this debate. So who am I, Sir, to speak about something else&#x003F; Without making myself guilty of repetition and incurring your displeasure, I want to speak about the same subject, but I want to approach it from a slightly different angle. I want to speak about d&#x00E9;tente and missionary work. A few weeks ago, the hon. the Prime Minister referred in a speech at Stellenbosch to the contribution made by missionaries in Africa, and on that occasion he quoted the Biblical instruction, &#x201C;cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days&#x201D;. In this connection, there is a very good story which appeared in a newspaper recently. Two reporters from <i>Rapport</i> met a Zambian journalist in Zambia with the classical name of Frank Vorster Tembu, His father, Tembu senior, was impressed by a missionary Vorster who worked there many years ago and consequently gave his young offspring this name. I think most of us who are sitting here have relations or friends who have served in the mission fields in Africa at some stage. This afternoon I only want to deal with the church of which I am a member, because that is the work with which I am familiar. Sir, the foreign mission of the Dutch Reformed Church dates from the year 1857 when the Cape Synod passed the historical resolution that foreign missionary work should be done in addition to the existing internal missionary work. The motivation for this resolution was the previous responsibility of the Church and its high calling. I think the motivation was summarized in these words, &#x201C;Thy Kingdome come&#x201D;. Sir, that and that alone gave rise to this resolution of the Synod that missionary work should be done abroad and that in addition to the annual collection for the domestic mission, there would be a collection for the missionary work abroad. The people of 1857 did not know the word &#x201C;d&#x00E9;tente&#x201D;. They did not see themselves as the pioneers of d&#x00E9;tente which would come later. If they had seen in the distance how storm clouds would gather over Africa, then they did not see themselves in a political role of averting those storms. They had no ulterior motives of a political nature. It was not an upsurge of patriotism which sent them to the mission fields, perhaps to expand the border of the fatherland and even to plant our flag on foreign soil. These people went purely and simply because they saw the need of others. They went because they saw people there who were living without hope and without God. They went, in the words of Paul, because they were constrained to and woe betide them if they did not preach the Gospel. They went to serve the Lord God, and for this those people laid everything on the altar of service and of dedication. I know of acquaintances of mine who served in the mission fields in the fifties, people who had had seven years&#x2019; training and who earned a salary of &#x00A3;200 per year. I understand the medical doctors earned considerably more. They earned up to &#x00A3;30 per month in the mission field. Sir, there is another remarkable fact about these missionaries, and I am referring specifically to the missionaries of our Church who went out at the beginning of this century. You know, Sir, a large number of Boer prisoners of war in Bermuda and Ceylon and elsewhere came to the conviction there that they wanted to offer themselves for the mission. Those were people who had lost everything. They had lost their possessions, many of them had lost their loved ones in the concentration camps. They had lost their liberty. Nonetheless, they knew at that time that they had something to give, and some of them, already at advanced ages, went to the mission institute at Wellington to be trained there. The first pioneer missionaries in our church abroad were the Rev. Henri Gonin, who worked in Saulspoort, in the Transvaal, and the Rev. Alexander McKidd, who began in the Soutpansberg. From Saulspoort the work spread over the border to Moshudi in the present Botswana while the work in the Soutpansberg spread over the Limpopo to Banjaland, now Mashonaland in the <span class="col_4791-4792" refersTo="page_0809"/>present Rhodesia. Together with the Church came the school and the hospital and Christian civilization and the translation of the Bible into the indigenous language. The greatest mission work of our Church was in Nyasaland, the present Malawi. When I heard over the radio this morning that President Banda had also sent his good wishes to our State President and had expressed the hope that the good relations between our two countries would continue, I thought of the Rev. Attie Vlok, who began with, that work in Nyasaland at the beginning of this century and the dozens of missionaries who came after him, and I wondered whether the contributions which those people had made had not perhaps made the good relations between our countries possible today. But what is most surprising is that they did not go with that aim. That was only a by-product of the work which they did. Our church did mission work in Nigeria, among the Tiv people there. We began a missionary action there. Gen. Gowon is also a member of the Tiv tribe and happens to be the son of a minister of religion. He undoubtedly would have come into contact with the church&#x2019;s mission there. We also did missionary work in East Africa. The first minister of the Afrikaners who settled in East Africa, ds. Loubser, told his congregants that every Afrikaner family was a mission station. Do you know, Sir, that during the Mau-Mau riots, when hundreds of people were killed, they did not lay a hand to a single Afrikaans family&#x003F; There was one of the farmers who told this story, that when the disturbances had reached their peak, his servants called him one evening and asked him to eat with them that evening because they had slaughtered an ox. In this way they thanked him for what he had done for them. Our Church also worked in Zambia and in Mozambique, but in 1922 the Portuguese forbade the Church to continue with the work. When our Church obtained permission again a few months ago from the Mozambique authorities to continue with the missionary work, there were more members there than had been left behind in 1922. We do work in Botswana and Swaziland as well and for the past few years in Lesotho too. The great missionary scientist, Prof. G. B. A. Gerdener, said several years ago that the two biggest mistakes which our Church made in their mission policy, was that it had left Mozambique and that it had entered the field in Lesotho at such a late stage.</p>

<p>Sir, if d&#x00E9;tente is going to succeed in Africa&#x2014;and in our hearts there is the unconquerable belief that it will succeed&#x2014;the greatest contribution which one can make to its success, is this indestructible belief, a positive approach and a determined will. I say if it is going to succeed, then we know who have helped to make it possible. These men and women were unknowingly the pioneers of a new dispensation in Africa. They were the first and for many years our only contact with Africa, the pioneers of a new dispensation who paved the way to better international relations.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I must say that the peroration of the hon. member who has just sat down certainly struck, I think, the correct and a sound note in this debate, and that is the question of a positive approach. It is against this background that I myself would like to discuss the Vote today and to say that during the course of the debate I detected what I thought was a rather plaintive air from the members on the Government side, which somehow suggested that they were still to some extent on the defensive with regard to foreign policy and the approach of South Africa to its problems. Some years ago when the hon. the Prime Minister took what was then regarded as an entirely new approach in South Africa&#x2019;s affairs, a forward policy, it did not take very long before he was chopped down, and unfortunately his efforts which, we felt were a move in the right direction, came to a standstill. But of recent date, when the hon. the Prime Minister, very ably assisted by the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, took positive steps in the direction of d&#x00E9;tente, he opened up an entirely new picture in the affairs of South Africa. I want to say further that it is this positive approach which is the only manner in which we can deal with South, Africa&#x2019;s affairs, at the crossroads at which we stand today.</p>

<p>It is in this sense that I would like to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and more particularly to our representative at U.N. for his magnificent address before the Security Council which appeared in the recent issue to us of the report on the United Nations. I think it is this type of talk which can do us a lot of good and which I think we must pursue, because I <span class="col_4793-4794" refersTo="page_0810"/>believe that we should today, in the climate of today, launch a new offensive in the form of factual and objective publicity, in the form of factual and positive information which should be spread with the assistance of experts in this field and be brought to the notice of the communities of other countries of the world, more particularly those who are contiguous to our borders and in the regions of Southern Africa in which we can play&#x2014;an important and vital role. At the same time we should also launch an all-out offensive in the Republic itself, at home amongst our own people, to re-educate them to new attitudes in their approach to their relationship with the various races in South. Africa. I think it is in this direction that we can play a positive part and ensure a better understanding within which will strengthen our hands in our problems from abroad.</p>

<p>I believe that we should play a much more positive part in assisting to combat poverty and disease amongst our neighbouring States, as well as further north in the heart of Africa, not only as a neighbour, but as a friendly African State ourselves. I think we should make a contribution, if we can, to the economic viability, which, we can do in the form of capital loans and in many other ways for the purpose of building up infrastructure and the important developments which are so necessary for people who are seeking it. I want to say that the very fact that we were able, as has been quoted in this House before, to provide wheat and other food to Mozambique while other nations had promised but had not carried out their promise, made a very deep impression. This is only one incident in a situation which created so much responsive goodwill and friendship towards us. One of the greatest enemies we have to fight, one of the causes of aggression in the world generally, more particularly in the field of Africa, is that the &#x201C;have nots&#x201D; stand by on the touch-lines looking particularly at our land which, we ourselves can literally describe as a land flowing with milk and honey. I believe sincerely that despite the gestures and activities of Moscow and Peking in Africa, particularly in Southern Africa, an issue which was so well described by one of the Government speakers the other day during another debate, South Africa has very much more to offer in a tangible and consistent form to the States in Africa. We should take the initiative in this field, not only to keep them, but also to convince them of the value which we, on the southern tip of Africa, with our tremendous storehouse and our tremendous powerhouse can provide for the benefit of Africa itself.</p>

<p>Our efforts in the field of detente receive very favourable comment from most of the Western countries, but our efforts are only the beginning of this new attitude, this new effort, this positive approach to the problem. We could have started these efforts many years ago. However, like President Ford of the United States I should like to say that we should not look at what we might have done before and we should not look back at the things which we feel have been done to the disadvantage of South Africa. We should leave the past behind and go forward positively and I think we have an opportunity to make a breakthrough. That is the way in which I believe we should approach our problems and not, as unfortunately we have heard today, continuously to harp on the question of armaments for the defence of South Africa, even though the procurement of armaments is necessary for every nation, as indeed it is stated in the statement of foreign policy by the President of the USA when he said that armament defence was important. Equally important as the offensive of which I have spoken and our efforts to bring it about, is the necessity for us to restore harmonious relations in Black Africa. At the same time we must turn our attention, as I have said, to our affairs at home, because the harmonious relations amongst our various races will play an important and vital part in the eventual success of our efforts to attain understanding abroad.</p>

<p>Here we have many opportunities of exhibiting evidence of our sincerity and honesty of purpose to bring about changes in South Africa. There have, in fact, been changes. As far as we in the Republic are concerned, the changes have been momentus, marking, as they do, a mature approach to what I believe is our inevitable destiny. Yet, to the outside world it has only been a small effort. I myself discussed our efforts with regard to the Nico Malan Theatre with some educationalists from countries in Europe very recently. Those people were visiting our country and called on some of us in the House. I pointed out what we were doing and I referred to the understanding which was taking place in our country. I told them that we were moving in the direction set out in our statements at U.N. One of the visitors said to me: &#x201C;If <span class="col_4795-4796" refersTo="page_0811"/>you regard that as a very big step, it may be so from your point of view; in fact it is just something in passing as far as the rest of the world is concerned in its attitude towards you&#x201D;. So I believe that we have to take more positive steps and give practical effect to statements which have been repeated on many an occasion in the House, that the colour of skin cannot and should not be reason for discrimination and we should, where we can, maintain the principle that only merit and a reasonable and fair civilized standard should be our basic criteria in human relations within South Africa. In our struggle to win the hearts and minds of others, we must succeed in our country so that we can enjoy the loyalty of all South Africans loyal to a common fatherland. In such a way we shall present a common front to those who, for reasons completely unjustified and illogical, seek to interfere in or attempt to impose themselves on our own domestic affairs.</p>

<p>Africa, because of its freedom from colonial control and dominance and because of its emergent nations still in many stages of development, has become the focus of world attention. The United States Government has stated recently that Africa must now become the focus of the United States&#x2019; new foreign policy efforts. The United States have the whole of Africa in mind and obviously included us as well. Recently a committee of U.N. met in Paris in order to prepare a new onslaught on us with, regard to apartheid. I think the hon. the Minister may have seen this in the Press. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to react fully to what the hon. member for Jeppe had to say. In his opening remarks, however, the hon. member said that this side of the House was &#x201C;somewhat on the defensive&#x201D;. If ever there was a misnomer, I think that a statement of that nature is one. To suggest something like this in the year 1975 is totally unfounded and unjust in the light of the fact that the positive breakthrough which has been achieved in the field of foreign relations has in fact been achieved by this side of the House in these times in which we are living. It has been achieved in spite of the sometimes very negative and destructive contribution which has come from the side of the Opposition.</p>

<p>In the same light and context I would like to say with all praise to the department and all praise and respect and understanding for what the hon. the Prime Minister said, that I think the whole of South Africa is reassured in the knowledge that this important department is being handled by the hon. the Minister whose responsibility it is at the moment. All over South Africa, amongst all communities and sections, there is great understanding and great appreciation for the unobtrusive but constructive way in which this hon. Minister and his department have been performing this task so successfully in recent years.</p>

<p>I do not want to venture into the broad sphere, because I am too uninformed for that, but I want to make a few remarks in connection with the purity of our domestic policy. In my view, and as the hon. the Prime Minister has also told us, his dialogue with Africa is taking place in terms of the policy of separate development in South Africa. I think it is quite a logical standpoint, because a country&#x2019;s foreign policy is after all based on the foundation of its domestic policy. Foreign policy is approached in accordance with the progress which has been made in domestic policy and not the other way round, as the Opposition sometimes argues. For this reason I believe that good and sound domestic policy will also promote good foreign policy and relations. When I say this, I confirm once again that the essence, the <i>sine qua non,</i> of domestic policy in South Africa is in fact the clearly formulated policy of separate development. I want to stress once again the moral aspects which characterize it, namely the human dignity referred to by the hon. member for Johannesburg West, the right to self-determination, the preservation of identity, differentiation, independence, and very important in the multi-national framework in which we live and in the application of this policy, the absolute minimum of racial mixing. For this reason I think that our foreign relations, too, should be seen in this context. Furthermore I say that this crystallized policy as it has developed in South Africa is not the creation or the special patent of the National Party. It is a scientifically founded philosophy which today is not only understood and accepted in South Africa, but is also being established and gaining acceptance all over the world. A well-known American author recently said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Man is the amalgam of his sociological inheritance and sociological acquisitions. <span class="col_4797-4798" refersTo="page_0812"/>He can give up his religion, his country, his customs and his culture &#x2026;</block>

<p>The author said, however, that man cannot escape from his ethnic context; this is permanent and inherent. This is an ancient truth which is now gaining acceptance in the world, namely that one&#x2019;s ethnic context is lasting and permanent. It is being accepted by the world, especially by Africa. Africa in particular is accepting it, because the African states have learnt from bitter experience, in this process of development and evolution, that with the establishment of the Western-type republics in Africa, which were simply an imitation, an imitation of Western norms, some of these States collapsed even before they had got off the ground. Therefore it remains true that peoples and nations in the world survive, are able to survive, and are able to preserve their identity, if they preserve their ethnic identities separately as nations. The same author says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The study of race relations has shown that the greater the social integration, the greater the social friction.</block>

<p>This is a profound truth. It sometimes reminds me of the United Party&#x2019;s politics of race federation. Lastly I would like to say what this respected American author said and what his final conclusion is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of all the courses of action separation is most nearly tenable. The American Negro will either return to his old world homeland or be assigned a homeland in the new world or there will be no homeland for anyone&#x2014;Black or White.</block>

<p>This is what is being said, not in South Africa, but in America. This philosophy is already being applied in South Africa. It was developed here and is impressing Africa, Africa which in its set-up, evolution and development probably has a dislike and an allergy in regard to the Western world and its democracy.</p>

<p>For this reason I say that in this connection a change is already taking place in the United Party &#x2026; [Interjections.] I beg your pardon. It was a slip of the tongue on my part. In the United Party there is only disintegration; there is still no change. In the United States, however, there has been a noticeable change in its statements to and in connection with South Africa. Our correct attitude in connection with Mozambique made a great impression there. Understanding for our problems is gaining ground. The double standards of the U.N. are being exposed. I am referring to Dr. Jan Marais&#x2019;s statement regarding the National Government in a publication of the S.A. Foundation which was published recently (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government&#x2019;s consistency and calm in a situation which is potentially explosive has achieved a breakthrough for it in America such as we have not seen in the past 20 years or more.</block>

<p>This is the breakthrough which was made in terms of our political philosophy in this country. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when I was speaking earlier this afternoon I mentioned that apart from what the American ambassador to the United Nations called the participants in the sterile pursuit of empty majorities, there is a real majority in existence at the United Nations. That real majority consists of those countries with the capacity to make a real contribution to the true purpose of the United Nations and who have the means and the strength to enforce those things which are worthwhile at the United Nations. These are the countries which are aware of the United Nations&#x2019; duties in connection with matters such as the present threatening world depression, mass famine, overpopulation, environmental destruction and the possibility of nuclear disaster. There is a real majority that has the means and the power to do something constructive, or to try to do something constructive, about such things. I believe that South Africa&#x2019;s task lies side by side with countries of this kind. I believe that South Africa has a contribution to make and that its obligation to make that contribution will increase as South Africa&#x2019;s own position grows in the world. I believe that when the United Party first heard of the possible intention of the Government to withdraw from the United Nations it was right in saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Resignation from the United Nations is a matter of the gravest consequence. It should not be contemplated nor even capriciously threatened unless the immediate disadvantages of membership are so great as to outweigh all South Africa&#x2019;s future opportunities and responsibilities <span class="col_4799-4800" refersTo="page_0813"/>as an increasingly important member of the world community.</block>

<p>That means in simple words that South Africa should never resign from the United Nations because it is virtually impossible to conceive of a present or temporary situation so grave that it would outweigh all South Africa&#x2019;s future potential within the world community. I believe that South Africa as a country in Africa has an enormous and an increasingly important role to play in the international community. I believe the time will come when South Africa will no longer be pilloried at the United Nations and will no longer be the scapegoat of the African countries at the United Nations. The time will come when South Africa, because of its stature in this continent, will become the mediator, the catalyst and the great contributor on behalf of Africa in its relations with the United Nations. This is something to look forward to. Sir it is an ideal which we must follow. I believe that capricious threats to resign because we have had a bad year at the United Nations are out of order. I think they are undignified and not in accordance with the kind of future which we hold out for ourselves.</p>

<p>I want to turn briefly to another subject and before I do this, I also want to pay tribute to the Department of Foreign Affairs. I believe that they have not only been a shockabsorber for South Africa, as was said earlier, but in some ways they have also been a spearhead. I believe there is a degree of talent, of intellectual thrust which has stood South Africa in very good stead in its relations with the outside world. I believe that, despite the great difficulties under which the department operates abroad and despite the pressures of time under which they sometimes operate at home, the department has in fact made a great contribution to South Africa which deserves to be recognized. I want to suggest one field to which the department could possibly begin to devote its attention. It is perhaps a little fanciful to say that it can achieve success because it is a very difficult task which I propose, but I want to draw attention to the problems arising in and around the Indian Ocean. No one can say that the Indian Ocean is not close to South Africa and is not of importance to South Africa. It has been said on previous occasions, not in this House but elsewhere, that war is too serious a matter to be left to generals. I believe it is also right to say that the Indian Ocean is too serious a matter to be left just to the admirals. I believe that is a field which calls for the most constructive diplomacy, the most careful and inspired diplomacy, because we have here an area of growing importance and of growing danger. The Indian Ocean is an area of the world surrounded by 26 littoral States; on the shores of the Indian Ocean are 26 nations. Here, indeed, bristling with difficulties and anomalies, is a field which could well be exploited by South African diplomacy or one in which South Africa could set its diplomacy the enormous task of securing in this area a measure of agreement or some degree of d&#x00E9;tente, if you wish me again to use that word, which will somehow lessen the growing tensions in this part of the world. This task is more easily described than done. It is a colossal task of diplomacy because there are many conflicting interests in the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>The Indian Ocean used to be described as a British lake. From about 1783 Britain has had a presence in the Indian Ocean. It has gradually reduced this presence. Apart from a naval base and some small naval presence in the Persian Gulf and in South East Asia, it has virtually disappeared from the Indian Ocean as the keeper of the peace in that area. Nevertheless it is still true that of the &#x00A3;15 000 million of British foreign trade or British investment, &#x00A3;4 000 million is still invested around the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean is for Britain still the supply-line of 60% of its oil, 50% of its food and most of its raw materials. We are aware of the British withdrawal, the temporary or partial replacement of British influence and of course, the enormous growth of Russian influence in the Indian Ocean which went step by step with the withdrawal of the British influence there. According to <i>Jane&#x2019;s Fighting Ships,</i> 1972 the authoritative handbook on naval power, there were 100 Russian naval vessels operating in the Indian Ocean at that time. This is a colossal number of naval vessels. The Russian presence in the Indian Ocean is as great as its presence in the South Pacific. In 1970 an attempt was made to reach some kind of agreement in the Indian Ocean. The Conservative Government which was then in power in Britain, approached the governments of Mauritius, India and Sri Lanka in order to see if some kind of agreement could be reached which would act as a foundation and basis for a collective security system in that area. These attempts did not succeed. We also have a partial or a limited American presence in <span class="col_4801-4802" refersTo="page_0814"/>that area and there has been some sign that the French will be willing to co-operate in this area. There is also the possibility that as the European Community expands into defence areas, there may be a willingness to play a greater part in the Indian Ocean. These things are in many cases still in an incipient stage; they need to be developed. What field for diplomatic participation could be more productive for South Africa than precisely a field of this kind&#x003F; It is true to say of our diplomacy that while it look for opportunities to advance South Africa&#x2019;s interests, it is often rejected. It is not accepted as a partner in some of the international initiatives for reasons which are well known. South Africa is not seen as a useful adjunct in certain initiatives, but nevertheless, where South Africa&#x2019;s presence can truly be valuable, it is less easy to reject South Africa&#x2019;s initiatives.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say to the hon. member for Von Brandis that I agree with him wholeheartedly that we should not sacrifice our international relations deliberately. I think he, in turn, will agree with me that it never was the intention of either the Government or the role of any other organization with international relations in South Africa to sacrifice their international roles. Where we were frustrated in the past, it was not as a result of our own unwillingness to take part in international conferences or in international action, but it was as a result of the opposition, the antipathy or the prejudice of the host country concerned and as a result of the fact that our delegates were, for instance, not able to obtain visas to visit the country concerned. Recently we had a case of this nature with regard to an international conference on the environment which was held in Nairobi.</p>

<p>I also want to refer briefly to the second point which the hon. member made, viz. about the importance of the Indian Ocean. By way of introduction I first want to say that there are two events in the Western world which are giving rise to a complete reappraisal of the view taken of communist expansion in the world. These two events are definitely the bloody tragedy of Vietnam and the present developments in Portugal. I may add in passing that in a certain sense the two events in the world have redounded to South Africa&#x2019;s good in that the strategic role which South Africa will have to play in this regard in future is being looked at with renewed interest. As far as these two events are concerned, viz. the tragedy of Vietnam and the developments in Portugal, where it seems as if leftist elements want to assume the reins of government, this is usually linked, at the same time to the obvious inability of the once powerful United States of America or the unwillingness of the United States of America to intervene and to enforce her will in this regard. Countries which boastfully toyed with the idea in the past that they were standing alone and that they would make their way through the world on their own&#x2014;and I am more particularly referring to certain Western countries&#x2014;suddenly find themselves confronted by the position of indeed having to start doing so. Then they look around them for possible allies who, like themselves, are intent on counteracting communist expansion. The events in Vietnam are of special importance to us here in South Africa.</p>
