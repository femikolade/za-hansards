<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. M. VAN A. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I indicated yesterday evening that the Bureau for Market Research had established where Black people in the urban areas spent their money. I shall mention only a few items. In respect of clothing, 77% of the total amount spent was spent in the White shops, as against only 7% spent at Black dealers. Of the expenditure on furniture and household requirements, 86% went to the White dealers as against only 5% to the Black dealers. As regards total expenditure, 43% of the total amount spent by Black people in the urban areas went to White dealers, as against only 37% to the Black dealers. As yet the true cause of the fact that the Black people buy more from the White dealers has not been determined scientifically. It is alleged by Black people, however, that the Black dealers exploit them. I repeat that this is being alleged, but if this allegation is true, it is probably fitting for us to give these Black dealers the friendly advice not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Sir, with the new rights and privileges for the Black people in the urban areas in respect of ownership rights and trading, licences, <span class="col_5279-5280" refersTo="page_1053"/>as announced here yesterday by the hon. the Minister, new doors are now being opened for the Black dealers.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me say at once that the announcement made by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development yesterday in respect of the urban Bantu, is regarded by many of us as a major step forward, and I want to express my unqualified gratitude and appreciation in regard to the changes which were disclosed to us yesterday. It may be said that we may perhaps go further still&#x2014;I shall come back to that later&#x2014;as far as some of these things are concerned, and I should like to devote this part of my speech to a few further constructive implications of the proposals announced here yesterday.</p>

<p>By way of repetition, I want to say that the intention to allow Bantu to rent premises and to build their own houses on those premises, houses which they may dispose of and which they will also be able to bequeath to other qualified Bantu, is a step in the right direction which I heartily welcome. We must obviously see these proposals against the background of the truly desperate position concerning urban Bantu housing, especially in the light of the achievements in this regard of a few years ago, for which all of us had much appreciation, when the Bantu housing problem was tackled in this energetic fashion. Sir, From the year 1948 to 1963, 248 000 houses were built for Bantu&#x2014;virtually a quarter of a million houses in approximately 15 years, a truly magnificent achievement. There is no reason why we cannot have a repetition of that achievement, especially in view of the really slow, alarming tempo at which houses in urban areas have been built for Bantu during the last few years.</p>

<p>In the most recent annual report of the department, we find on page 46 that whilst 24 285 dwellings were built in 1960-&#x2019;61&#x2014;I have to point out that the term &#x201C;urban Bantu&#x201D; is used here, and I do not know whether this relates merely to the residential areas in the so-called White areas and whether it also includes the urban residential areas in the homelands&#x2014;the number decreased to 5 000 in the year 1968-&#x2019;69; to 12 000 in the year 1969-&#x2019;70, to 8 500 in 1970-71, to 6 700 in 1971-72, to 5 100 in 1972-73, and to 7 500 in 1973-74. Within one year&#x2019;s time, when Soweto was under the control of the Johannesburg municipality, that municipality built 11 000 houses, an average of 60 per day, whilst the tempo during the past year was approximately four per day. The fact is that a minimum of 17 000 houses are required in Soweto alone. The normal population increase in Soweto requires a minimum of 2 500 houses per year.</p>

<p>The need probably is far greater than we know as a result of the well-known over-occupation which occurs in Soweto and other urban areas and which is apparent, <i>inter alia,</i> from the contribution which board and lodging fees make towards the income of Bantu families in these urban areas. When we look at the report of the Bureau for Market Research&#x2014;and here I want to reply to the hon. member for Kimberley North at the same time&#x2014;and at the contribution made by board and lodging fees to the income of Bantu families in urban areas, we find that in the five principal urban areas, the contribution of lodgers amounted to 5% of the income of the family in 1970 in the case of Pretoria, as against ,60% in 1960. In Johannesburg it was ,60% in 1960 and it increased to 3,80%. In Durban it was ,90% and it increased to 4,80% in 1970. In Port Elizabeth it increased from ,80% to 3,50% and in Cape Town from 1,40% to 4,20%. This means a tremendous increase in the number of people who stay with Bantu families as lodgers, both legally and illegally. As regards the hon. member for Kimberley North, may I also just say that the figures he furnished probably are somewhat outdated. According to the most recent report of the Bureau for Market Research, the 1973 report, in which the figures for 1970 are given, the ratio of the amount spent on alcohol to the amount spent on other commodities, is totally different and gives a totally different picture to the one the hon. member for Kimberley North gave us here.</p>

<p>May I just say in passing that the two items which could be regarded as luxury items, viz. expenditure on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes and tobacco, are indeed luxury items, but the other items he mentioned here, viz. personal care and patent medicines, can surely not be regarded as a luxury item. Those two items, i.e. alcoholic beverages and cigarettes and tobacco, came to 9,4% in 1970 in the case of Pretoria as against 14,3% for clothing. In Johannesburg it came to 8,2% as against 14,3% for clothing; in Durban, 8,6% as <span class="col_5281-5282" refersTo="page_1054"/>against 12,55% for clothing; in Port Elizabeth, 7,2% as against 11,65% for clothing; and in Cape Town, 5,55% as against 17,2% for clothing. In other words, a major shift occurred between those years for which the hon. member for Kimberley North quoted figures and the most recent data which was made available.</p>

<p>I just want to say that the housing problem in all the urban areas is an extremely serious one, with all its attendant social and other implications. I want to say once more that I am grateful for these concessions having been made. I said, with regard to the various proposals made here by the Minister, that I would come forward with positive additions, if I may use this term. I want to say at once that I associate myself with the appeal addressed here by the hon. the Minister to employers that they should make it possible for their employees to build their own houses, if need be by means of long-term loans. I just want to say in passing that I think we should give some Bantu the opportunity once more to own their own land in the urban areas, as the position used to be. But I shall come to that later. I deduce from what the hon. the Minister said, that a 30-year term will be considered in respect of the lease of the sites, in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister announced that when Bantu wished to buy those houses from the local authority or from the Bantu Affairs Administration Board, a loan with a term of 30 years would be allowed. I hope an immediate start will be made with releasing adequate numbers of vacant sites on which the Bantu who want to do so may then start building their own houses. In other words, it is essential that the Bantu residential areas be extended immediately. I also assume that provision is to be made for the necessary social and economic stratification so that we do not have the situation once more which we unfortunately had with the Group Areas Act, i.e. that a mere uniformity will be maintained. In other words, I think Bantu residential areas will have to be developed which makes provision for those Bantu who fall into the higher social and economic groups, and attendant upon this is the size of the sites. I also hope that negotiations will be entered into with the building societies and other financial institutions to see, in spite of the fact that the land will not belong to the Bantu, whether a way cannot be found in which the finance of these establishments can be made available to the Bantu to build their own houses. As I said earlier on, I would welcome an investigation by the department into the possibility of making building materials available to Bantu. This could make a tremendous contribution towards alleviating the pressure brought to bear on the State to provide housing. As I indicated earlier on, this had been done on a large scale by the Bloemfontein municipality and it worked wonderfully well there. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to say in regard to the speech of the hon. member for Edenvale that it is one of the more moderate speeches I have heard the hon. member make. He also made his speech with a reasonable amount of responsibility. I was a little worried that the hon. member would not come back to the debate we had under the Vote of the hon. the Prime Minister, because the hon. member said only this morning that he wanted to come back to the question of land ownership in the urban areas. When he refers to land ownership in the urban areas, I take it he means the urban Bantu areas.</p>

<p>We have had a very peculiar day yesterday. The hon. the Minister made an announcement here in regard to practical matters affecting the way of living of Bantu in Bantu townships. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana and the hon. member for Houghton immediately saw something in the hon. member&#x2019;s announcement which we, in terms of the National Party&#x2019;s policy, did not see in this announcement at all. These two hon. members adopted the premise that with this announcement the National Party acknowledges a permanency as regards the presence of different ethnic groups within White South Africa. I would like to say something about this aspect. This is the difference between the hon. members on that side of the House and the hon. members on this side of the House, and I am grateful that this difference exists. I think the word &#x201C;permanent&#x201D; should possibly also be scrapped from our vocabulary as far as these debates are concerned. Tust as the word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; has acquired a certain connotation, so hon. members on the other side of the House are also interested in giving a certain connotation to the word &#x201C;permanent&#x201D;. On the i basis of section 10 of the Bantu Urban <span class="col_5283-5284" refersTo="page_1055"/>Areas Consolidation Act, Act No. 25 of 1945&#x2014;with which hon. members are quite familiar&#x2014;I want to deal with the idea of permanency today. I want to reject categorically the fact that we can read some permanency or the intention of permanency in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement, as the hon. members on the other side of the House have tried to do. The major difference lies in the fact that the National Party was not in power in 1945, but that the official Opposition was in power at that stage. When we discuss influx control, the Opposition still uses that Act today as if the spirit of that fine flower child created by that side of the House at that time is still valid. Section 10(1)(a) and (b) extended certain privileges to the Bantu in the White areas, which amounted to a distinction being made at that stage between the inhabitants of the so-called reserves of that time and the Bantu in the White area. A distinction had to be made and measures had to be taken to establish facets of influx control to make it possible even for that party to implement their policy. I want to say today that the appearance of permanency which is attached to the presence of the Bantu or the Black man in White South Africa today loses sight of one factor. Here I am not only referring to the Bantu in the urban areas, and I want to cross swords with the hon. member for Edenvale, because that side of the House never gives any attention to the Black man on our farms. They are also in White areas, and those same people are also subject to certain provisions as regards their physical presence in White areas. The appearance of permanency springs from the provisions of section 10. We should however not lose sight of one thing. Section 10(1) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No Bantu shall remain for more than seventy-two hours in a prescribed area unless he produces proof in the prescribed manner that &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then follow four provisos. The premise, even of that party, in 1945 was not that there would be any permanency as regards the physical presence of the Bantu in South Africa. That was admitted by that party itself in 1945, and it even indicated the exceptions, i.e. that such persons will be present here, without their having to comply with other requirements, for example if they were born here or after they have been employed here for a certain period, and that they are also allowed to have their wives and unmarried children here under certain conditions. However, section 10(1)(d) was also added, which provided for what is today the standpoint of the National Party with regard to citizens of non-White peoples within the borders of South Africa, i.e. that those people are allowed to come here and that they may come and work here and are allowed to enter South Africa in terms of section 10(1)(b). It is precisely this appearance of permanency, which is embodied in section 10(1)(a) and (b) which compelled that side of the House, especially the United Party, to change their standpoint practically every year and which compelled them to accept a federal form of government for the people of South Africa. This is not the premise of the National Party. The appearance of permanency which may exist in regard to the physical presence of Bantu people in South Africa will not compel us also to accept a federal form of government. We act from the premise that those people are citizens of another state. The hon. member for Port Natal yesterday furnished figures according to which, in a place like Soweto, there were only 12 000 people who did not range themselves with their particular ethnic groups. In general the Bantu ranged themselves with their ethnic groups. I think the policy of the National Party has already developed to the stage where we can say without qualification that the Whites of South Africa have citizenship in White South Africa and that the Bantu in our midst have citizenship in their homeland. I know what I am talking about, and I know we should do it in a responsible manner, i.e. namely that this content of pretence permanency embodied in section 10(1)(a) and (b) should be removed because we have now reached the stage where we are dealing with peoples next to one another. Because we are dealing with peoples next to one another and those other peoples, the Black peoples may be in South Africa at a given time and under given circumstances, be it for a longer or a shorter period&#x2014;may be generations&#x2014;he is here as a citizen of that nation. He is here as a citizen of that nation to sell his labour, and we should link the sale of his labour to the possession of a certificate of citizenship. The fact is that he is a citizen of another country, and that may give him the right to come and work in South Africa and to <span class="col_5285-5286" refersTo="page_1056"/>stay to do that work. I think this idea also links up with the idea contained in the statement made by the hon. Minister yesterday. This is only possible in terms of the policy of the National Party. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Schweizer Reneke referred to the fact that until now no attention has been given to the Bantu on farms in the White area. It is about this subject that I would like to say a few words and more specifically about a few things which happened during the past few years.</p>

<p>It is quite clear to me when I look at the Press reports of the past years that one can come to the conclusion that the Press and the Opposition are not satisfied with anything less than complete integration in all fields. In this process the relations between Whites and non-Whites &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>The relations between Whites and non-Whites&#x2014;the hon. member has never condemned it, but I shall come to him&#x2014;has been bedevilled by it to such an extent that our people in the rural areas are today not properly informed about the real state of affairs and about what this National Government is actually doing for the non-Whites. The millions of rand which are voted every year for Bantu administration and the millions of rand which are voted for the acquisition of land, which is then given to the non-White peoples as a present, are never mentioned. What is mentioned, are things such as the following. When the International Labour Federation became interested in the wages of the non-Whites and when people became interested in this matter, I asked myself where they heared about it and why they were suddenly interested in this matter. I have here in front of me reports, which started in 1973, on the so-called ill-treatment of the Bantu on farms. A very unsavoury article appeared in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 15 July 1973 under the heading &#x201C;Men who work for nothing.&#x201D; Notice has to be taken now of the problem which arose since the publication of that article, which covered an entire page in this newspaper and in which it was broadcast how these poor non-Whites were supposed to have been beaten with sjamboks. Reports such as these about how they were supposed to have been beaten with sjamboks and how they have to work for nothing, were broadcast to the outside world. When we wanted to check the report we were informed that it was actually a recording which was made by a student of the University of Natal together with a non-White interpreter because the student concerned was unable to speak Zulu. He therefore obtained the services of the interpreter and questioned every person they met along the road. We followed the trail of that interrogation and each one of these allegations was proved to be a blatant lie. I have it in writing, substantiated by sworn statements, that the reporter had never been told that which was published in the newspaper, in other words that which the interpreter was told and which was conveyed to the reporter. I do not really want to deal with the facts of the case, but I want to point out that a newspaper which is published in Natal <i>The Weekend World</i> published the entire article two weeks later. In the same newspaper it was then said under prominent headings: &#x201C;Buthelezi warns of rebellion.&#x201D; He was so impressed by the article which appeared in the <i>Tribune</i>&#x2014;and I take it that the outside world was also impressed by it because it was actually meant for their consumption &#x2014;to the effect that the Bantu on the farms are ill-treated to such an extent that the farmer on the farm found that his Bantu were leaving one after the other i.e. those who wanted to leave while those whom the farmer wanted to remove of his own accord did not want to leave. Instead of encouraging their people to work and maintain good relations with their employers the Bantu homeland authorities started to claim higher wages. With all the responsibility at my disposal I say that the Bantu were priced out of the rural market completely on account of a constant rise in wages. I do not want to go into the cost structure of the farmer but I say that after these Bantu were completely forced out of the rural market, they left for the cities and the towns, which resulted that the Government had to take steps to provide them with the necessary accommodation there. Those Bantu were quite happy on the farms; they worked there under pleasant circumstances and even accumulated live stock. They were earning enough to support their wives. On my farm there was a Bantu with seven wives and he supported all of them. The article I referred <span class="col_5287-5288" refersTo="page_1057"/>to, created the impression that we do not pay the Bantu enough. I told this Bantu to find himself another place to live elsewhere. He then left.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Never mind, you were not one of those seven. In that way a situation developed where those people went to the cities and towns where they are sauntering about without work today. They are now making demands, which are supported by the Progressive Party and the United Party, demands in which the Government is urged to provide employment to those who are unemployed and who have nowhere to stay.</p>

<p>If it is not inopportune, I want to put a question to the gentleman Buthelezi. After all, he is a great democrat. The hon. the Minister might be able to furnish me with an answer. I read in a newspaper recently that the gentleman Buthelezi asked the hon. the Minister not to permit political parties in KwaZulu. The hon. the Minister refused to comply with such a request. But the matter has not yet been settled because our people do not know why the request was refused and we also do not understand why the gentleman Buthelezi made such a request. Has this request been made because he is afraid&#x003F; Does he no longer support the Western democracy&#x003F; The whole matter is quite vague to us.</p>

<p>What we do know, is that although the Bantu are supposed to be unhappy on the farms, we simply cannot get them to leave. Even after the repeal of the former master and servant Laws they still remain on the farms without rendering a service. They refuse to leave: they do not move; they do not want to go anywhere. Because they do not work, theft is the order of the day. The Police are kept busy with cases concerning State security and consequently they cannot investigate complaints about a few maize cobs that were stolen here and there. It is however a fact that if every inhabitant of a Native village picks six maize cobs on a farm every day, an enormous number of cobs are picked, and that before the maize is ripe and can be harvested. In Northern Natal the situation has become so desperate that some of the farmers now institute civil proceedings against Bantu to get them to leave the farms, the same farms on which they were supposed to have been beaten so much and was never given enough to live. In the <i>Tribune</i> a photograph was also published of a few young Bantu who were felling trees, work which was supposed to be too difficult for them to perform. This photograph was also sent overseas. Just to indicate how neatly matters fit into each other I should also mention that the SABC carried out a survey last year. In the course of the survey a few unfortunate cases were revealed and these were seized upon as proof of what the <i>Tribune</i> had published the previous year. The <i>Tribune</i> was very pleased about it and in a report on the front page the <i>Tribune</i> then declared that the SABC had given proof of the complaints lodged against the farming community, i.e. that they ill-treat the Bantu and do not pay them enough.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not reply to what the hon. member for Vryheid said. I want to return to the speech made by the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke. The announcements which were made by the hon. the Minister, will be welcomed throughout South Africa and I feel that, on behalf of South Africa as a whole, a word of thanks should be extended to the Government. However, the steps which the Government intends taking are limited. The course the Government is following in South Africa is still far from being the right one. But, Sir, they are at least moving in the right direction, and we are grateful for that. These announcements have generated a new interest in the political debate. For the first time during this session there is a definite relevance as far as the debate on racial matters is concerned. It is interesting to note that it also gives a clear picture of the fundamental dilemma the Government has to deal with. Here we see a clear picture of the Prime Minister, with his Cabinet colleagues, who would very much like to move in a verligte direction, and who would very much like to bring about the necessary adjustments and reforms in South Africa. But we also see&#x2014;and this is where I get to the hon. member for <span class="col_5289-5290" refersTo="page_1058"/>Schweizer-Reneke&#x2014;that there is a powerful, conservative group of reactionary politicians in the Nationalist Party, who are now assiduously counteracting the limited steps which the Government is prepared to take.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>It is clear. It is not necessary for us to look inside the National Party caucus at these fundamental differences which exist, because for every verligte announcement and statement that is made in this House by the Prime Minister or his Cabinet, there is within minutes a right-wing reaction from the ranks of the verkramptes in the National Party. I do not know why this is so, but here we are saddled with a massive conservative group on the opposite side of the House. The fundamental dilemma of the National Party Government, and the core of the racial problem in South Africa, has now been brought up by the National Party members themselves. <i>Inter alia,</i> it deals with the urban Bantu, his existence, his rights of existence and his future. The National Party Government will have to admit at some time or other that the urban Bantu are permanent inhabitants and citizens of the so-called White urban areas of South Africa, to whom civil rights should be granted. The Government will have to admit that these are people to whom human rights will have to be granted. This is the core of the problem with which the National Party Government is faced today. In the first instance the Government consistently refuses to admit that they are permanent citizens of the urban areas, although speakers on that side admit that they are living there permanently, and admit that many of them have been living there permanently for decades. A speaker on the opposite side of the House also said that they will always be there, but in a casual capacity. What that means, nobody knows. The hon. the Deputy Minister can sit there and sneer as much as he likes. The fact remains that they are permanent inhabitants and citizens of the urban areas, with the right to permanent rights. This is what the National Party will have to admit. What the National Party will also have to admit&#x2014;and this also applies to the hon. the Deputy Minister who tried to create the impression yesterday that the numbers are not increasing as rapidly as the figures and the statistics prove&#x2014;is that by the year 2000 there will be between 20 and 25 million permanently urbanized Black people in the so-called White area of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>These are the basic things to which the Nationalist Party would be well-advised to pay honest attention at this stage. In the first instance it is a step forward to giving them the right to own their homes. It is however, not the whole answer as regards the aspirations of the Black man himself. The steps which the Nationalist Party are taking, do not satisfy the reasonable aspirations of the Black man, nor do they serve the real interests of the Whites. The Nationalist Party should realize that until such time as they satisfy the reasonable aspirations of the Black man in South Africa, they will not in any way be able to maintain or guarantee the White man&#x2019;s existence and his future either. Here I am referring not only to home ownership rights, but also to freehold rights. It is a basic and fundamental right of the urban Bantu, and that because of many reasons. It gives people security, real security and many other benefits as well. It helps the person and the family to combat the effect of inflation; it offers geographic and economic security, to the husband and his family. I believe that the Government might just as well display the honesty and the courage now to grant the Bantu in the urban areas of South Africa freehold rights in addition to home ownership rights. If they were to do that, it would be a courageous step. It would not be half a step. It would satisfy the reasonable aspirations of the Black man and it would be a real and substantial contribution to the security and safety of the White man in South Africa.</p>

<p>There are a few other things I should like to mention. Together with freehold rights security and permanency, there are other interests of the Black man which the Government will now have to guard. One of them is economic rights. In this House we have already debated the aspects of work reservation, etc., many times. I want to mention another aspect. Every economic area, i.e. commercial and/or industrial area in South Africa, is an area which can be clearly demarcated. These are areas which do not include residential areas. One result of modern city planning is that clearly demarcated industrial and commercial areas <span class="col_5291-5292" refersTo="page_1059"/>exist, and this is where the Whites, the Blacks, the Coloureds and the Indians work. To give meaning and value to the real and significant economic rights of the Black man, to develop them, the Government ought to proclaim the following step: The clearly demarcated industrial and commercial areas will be thrown open to the participation of all the racial groups in South Africa, without the existence of any measures to obstruct the participation of the other racial groups.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat was such a jumble of liberalistic ideas that I hardly know where to begin with him. But let us begin with the last point he made, viz. that we should throw open all industrial areas in South Africa for participation by the Black people on an equal footing with the other population groups. Sir, this just shows you how absolutely ridiculous that hon. member&#x2019;s arguments are. The Blacks trading in the Bantu urban areas are the very people who would complain the loudest if one were to throw open those privileges in the Bantu areas to Whites, because one would then be laying them open to competition which they could not stand up to. That is the basis of our policy, that we not only want to separate people, but that we also want to protect them and provide them with development opportunities. The hon. member for Bryanston states that what has now been announced satisfies neither the aspirations of the Black people nor the interests of the Whites. Sir, it is on that fundamental principle that we differ with them so radically. What are the interests of the Whites&#x003F; In terms of their policy, they are not interested in what the political interests of the Whites will, in fact, ultimately be here in South Africa, and consequently they are able to come here and argue about the aspirations of the Black people on a different basis to ours. Ultimately, the matter at stake is what they want to channel to politics by means of economic integration and integration at other levels because they want to use it against the National Party. In fact they, too, are unable to satisfy the aspirations of the Black people. The hon. member for Bryanston states that what the Minister announced in regard to house ownership was insignificant; that we should go further and that we should also permit the Bantu to own land. Sir, that hon. member is absolutely ignorant about the Black people in South Africa and in the whole of Africa. Let him go to any Bantu homeland in South Africa, apart from the urban Bantu towns that are being developed there, and consider the Black man&#x2019;s conception of land tenure and then ask himself whether the concept of individual land tenure is really so important in the aspirations of the Black man. To the hon. member it is important, because to him it is all part of a series of political instruments he wants to use against us.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to dwell any longer on the hon. member for Bryanston. I want to come back to remarks made by the hon. member for Houghton in the debate on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. I am in a somewhat difficult position, Sir. The hon. member for Houghton was wearing a red dress yesterday, and at the time it was extremely difficult not to see red. I note that she is dressed in black today, just as beautifully as yesterday, but I fear that she does not excite one quite as much as she did yesterday. Sir, I want to refer the hon. member for Houghton to a remark she made in the course of the debate on the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote while referring to liquor consumption by Black people in the urban Bantu residential areas. She referred to R5 million spent on liquor in Soweto and stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the tragic story of a population which has just about given up the unequal <span class="col_5293-5294" refersTo="page_1060"/>struggle to try to live a decent life.</block>

<p>A little later she states&#x2014;,</p>

<block name="quote">I believe that the last straw to the whole situation has been the drastic increase in rents which has just been imposed on the people of Soweto on April 1, 1975.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, that is the whole basic problem. The whole socio-economic position of the Black people in the urban areas revolves around two things; it revolves around the influx, which we are trying to halt, of vast numbers of Black people to those areas which they are overrunning. It also revolves around the finances necessary to administer the Blacks that are there. The hon. member is just as well aware as the rest of us that the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards have two sources of finance. The one is the sale of Bantu liquor and Bantu beer, and the other is the source of accommodation fees and also the contributions from the employers. She is just as well aware as we are that each of these Bantu Affairs Administration Boards has difficulty in rectifying conditions owing to the lack of funds. We know, too, that there are only two options open to us. We can stimulate further the sale of liquor, but I honestly want to say that it is my moral conviction that we shall really have to reconsider this aspect of the financing of Bantu Administration in urban areas, because we cannot simply try to stimulate liquor sales, viz. Bantu beer and Bantu liquor, in order to obtain sufficient funds to do what must be done. Truly, we should eventually have to reap the consequences of doing so. But now this is an historic reality that we must take into account. People do drink, and we must utilize that source of funds, we must utilize the profits to subsidize losses in respect of housing. The hon. member knows how the cost of providing services, water, sanitary services, streets, lights and all the things which she is so fond of complaining about, is escalating. But when the rent tariff, which includes all those other services, is increased, then they maintain here that that is the last straw. In Heaven&#x2019;s name, Sir, how on earth is one to deal with this problem with people who, in fact, pillory the White people in this way&#x003F; I really believe that if there is one thing that should occur in this House during the next few years, then it is that the hon. member for Houghton and those sitting behind her over there should come to light with practical and realistic ideas in view of the prevailing circumstances. They should remove, just for a moment, the spectacles of liberalism, and look at economic realism and facts through the spectacles of patriotism. When I say this, Sir, I do not mean for a moment that they have no patriotism, but I do want to say that one cannot approach all these matters from a liberalistic point of view. For example, there is the influx of Black people about which the hon. member for Houghton again made a big fuss yesterday. The hon. member states that we should not demand these people&#x2019;s documents. In essence she is opposed to the entire policy of influx control. I have before me a number of annual reports issued by the U.N., <i>Report on the World Social Situation.</i> I could quote to her from each of these reports, but I shall not have the time for that. Let me just read this from this report published by the U.N.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most marked feature of the new towns is the poverty of the African urban masses. The urban worker is often far less privileged than is realized by those who set out to seek a better life in the towns.</block>

<p>The same theme occurs in each of these reports. One cannot have vast and uncontrolled influx without there being negative socio-economic effects. Sir, in this book, <i>African Aims and Attitudes</i>&#x2014;and the hon. member for Houghton and the members behind her would do well to read it&#x2014;President Kaunda refers to &#x201C;two nations that are being created in Zambia,&#x201D; one in the cities and one in the rural areas. Sir Seretse Khama also contributed to this book and perhaps they will listen to him. He states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No-one should think that the living standards of all the population can be raised by redistributing the assets of a few people who are relatively well off.</block>

<p>The whole issue concerns a total, major economic development. The Progressive Party states that it recognizes the homelands. I am addressing the hon. member for Johannesburg North specifically. Sir, are they really being honest when they say that they recognize the Bantu homelands&#x003F; Are they being honest when they say that they would like economic development to be stimulated and generated in those <span class="col_5295-5296" refersTo="page_1061"/>homelands, too, for the benefit of the Black people&#x003F; I want to ask him that, because he belongs to an organization and has contacts with the whole business world. They are people who can play a part in this revolution we need here in Southern Africa&#x2014; not a revolution of integrationary political ideologies as they, in fact, foresee for Africa&#x2014;I do not say what they want, but the way they foresee it. In 1964, Chou En Lai said that Africa was ripe for revolution. Sir, I agree with him. Southern Africa is ripe for revolution, a revolution of ideas, a revolution in the growing awareness of Black people, aided and generated and stimulated by what we&#x2014;and that includes the Progressive Party&#x2014;can do in regard to the homelands, which they disparage as being under-developed, backward and incapable of achieving anything.

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up some of the aspects which were raised by the hon. member for Innesdal. He said the problem of the urban Blacks was basically a problem of influx, the availability of capital and of coping with the influx to the urban areas. I must just say in passing that I am sorry that the hon. member again found it necessary to mention patriotism. I think the hon. member must realize that patriotism, like love, is a non-negotiable human commodity. If one does try to make it a negotiable one, one ends up with prostitution.</p>

<p>I want to become very concrete because the hon. member has challenged us to propose specific measures to cope with the problem. I want to refer to the problem of squatting. We read in the newspapers this morning that the people who are squatting at Crossroads were given a fair warning by the department that they will be removed. Notices were delivered, but they did not move. Eventually they were arrested and taken away. I just want to ask the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s assurance on one particular issue before I carry on with the debate, i.e. whether the hon. the Minister can assure us that there is no separation of children from their parents. If there are such cases I want to know whether something can be done to improve the situation.</p>

<p>Squatting, as the hon. member for Innesdal would concede, is a universal problem in developing countries. It is part of the problem of urban influx and basically relates to the human drive to provide shelter for themselves. People want shelter, they want to look after themselves and they want to go to a place where at least they have the expectation that they can find some employment, or some way of looking after themselves and their loved ones and where they can have a roof over their heads. There is no way in which we can frustrate this human drive. We can try to cope with it and try to direct it in a certain way, but there is no way of frustrating it. If one tries to frustrate it, one simply ends up by trying to stop an avalanche with a shovel. This cannot be done and therefore we must accept the reality of urban migration in Africa, Latin America and in India. It is, in fact, a universal problem.</p>

<p>We must ask ourselves how we are to cope with this problem. I am convinced that we cannot cope with this problem by simply ignoring it or simply trying to get people away from the urban areas by endorsing them out, or by using legalistic arguments and saying that they are illegal and therefore ought not to be here. That is a &#x201C;Catch 22&#x201D; kind of argument, to say that we make a law which declares them illegal and when they come here nevertheless, they have to go away because they are here illegally. The problem remains exactly the same. It is basically a problem of urban migration and of how does one cope with it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal says that if that is the case we can reduce the problem to the question of capital expenditure because it is always a problem of being able to provide adequate housing, and we do not have enough funds, etc. I want to make certain suggestions to the hon. the Minister or to his Deputy Minister, and make them in all seriousness and if possible. I want to response to these proposals. I think these proposals do not involve a great deal of capital expenditure. I do not think that they involve a great deal of labour for people with technical skill at all, but I do think that if these proposals are accepted we would have a stabilized situation and we would have the possibility of a community of squatters which is able to develop into a viable community and which has some form of security. I want to argue this in terms of six proposals which I want to make to the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

<p>The first point is that we must synchronize action on all governmental levels. By <span class="col_5297-5298" refersTo="page_1062"/>&#x201C;governmental levels&#x201D; I mean the Central Government, the provincial Government, the divisional councils and the city councils. There must be some synchronization of action when it comes to squatting. There must be a common policy. At the moment the divisional council takes one kind of decision and flushes out squatters like human guinea-fowl and pushes them onto the property of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. The department then chases some of them back to the homelands and others go to the city council. This is what happens. We have a circulating squatter population which has become so adept at erecting shacks that they can do it overnight. There is what one may call &#x201C;a squatter culture&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly, I accept that and now I am prepared to put forward some proposals. In other words, my first proposal was that there must be a common approach on all governmental levels to the problem of squatting.</p>

<p>The second proposal I want to make is that one basic aspect of this policy should be that we must then demarcate areas where people can squat legitimately. I know that the reply from the Government will be that the moment we do that we accept responsibility for the fact that these people are squatting. If we do not do it, we accept responsibility for exactly the same situation we have at Crossroads. We are responsible in any case, and this responsibility can be used either to stabilize the situation or to create a situation of instability. The only solution is to work out beforehand on a synchronized basis, or on an integrated basis with the different levels of government, where people can squat legally.</p>

<p>Thirdly, once one has demarcated this area, one must provide basic site and service facilities. I know all the arguments for and against this, but there is no way one can get away from the facts. Basic site and service facilities have to be provided there, as has been done at Crossroads and Lourdes Farm and places like that. Once one has these basic site and service facilities, at least people will have the minimum infrastructure for a community and work on it from there. Fourthly, after these facilities have been provided, one should have officials there, one official per squatter community, who should have a relative degree of expert knowledge to advise the people where they can erect their shacks so that there can be a physical structure of sorts that will not be washed away with the first rains, and some kind of rudimentary community planning available for these people there. Fifthly, one should provide the minimum health services for both humans and animals in that particular area. By &#x201C;minimum facilities&#x201D; I have in mind that a mobile clinic could perhaps visit the area once every two months, and there could perhaps also be a veterinary surgeon.</p>

<speech by="#slabbert">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. VAN Z. SLABBERT</person>:</from>

<p>Once we have done all this, my sixth point is that we then have to rely on the ingenuity and skills of the people in the particular area to provide their own shelters. They are doing so in any case.</p>

<p>In terms of the points I have outlined, they could provide their own shelters under more orderly conditions. At least one would then have a more stable situation, some form of stability and a form of co-ordinated planning, albeit at a very rudimentary level, which would be far more effective than simply trying to catch up with the backlog in the housing. For the information of the hon. member for Innesdal, research has shown, in fact, that in well-established squatter communities there is a much lower serious crime rate than in urban slums and urban communities. There is also a relatively high rate of employment. The people generate their own forms of employment in these squatter communities, for those, that is, who cannot find employment elsewhere.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, some way in which they can integrate themselves more or less into a community. I am convinced that the Government of the day is going to be forced&#x2014;whether it be now or in 20 years&#x2019; time&#x2014;to do this, whether they like it or not. If it is not done now, the problem is going to become far more serious than it is at the moment, because as sure as the sun will shine tomorrow, there is going to <span class="col_5299-5300" refersTo="page_1063"/>be an increase in the squatter population. The Government is using an influx control policy, is endorsing people out and follows a system of migratory labour. Despite all this, we have had an increase in the squatter population only in the Western Cape, and it is going to go on for the very simple reason that people who come here are looking for work, for a place where they can find work. That is the one reason.</p>

<p>Another reason is that they come here whether they can find work or not simply because they assume that an urban environment has some facilities that they cannot get in the rural areas. I know the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to say there are children there at Crossroads who cannot go to school here whereas they can go to school in the homelands. The parents in the homelands, however, can pay for the children to go to school up to Std. 2. We know what the figures are. The children then drop out. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the outset I should like to furnish a few replies to statements which were made here and to questions which were put here. The hon. member who has just resumed his seat will pardon me if I do not reply to his six proposals in detail I first want to have a look at them. I just wish to say that his proposals may be summarized as follows: &#x201C;Let them all go where they like with as many to accompany them as they like.&#x201D; With this we cannot agree. When there are positive suggestions, for example, on how to solve a very difficult problem, it would be irresponsible of any Government body not to pay attention to it. Now, in the course of this debate&#x2014;not only in the course of this debate, but also in the course of our action&#x2014;things were said and done which destroy, in a speech of only half an hour or only ten minutes, all the fine sentiments that have been expressed. The structure is simply demolished, and I am sure the majority of South Africans and Blacks living in South Africa, want to see this promoted. I do not think that this is a humiliation for me, but it is a humiliation for a person, when he is a member of Parliament, to insinuate that a person who differs from him politically, is a bully who does not care for his fellow-man and who only wishes to trample him underfoot. I am getting tired of being accused of this. The National Party has principles which it adheres to and I, because I also believe in them also adhere to those principles. Through all the years it has been in office, from the day Dr. Malan assumed office and spoke over the radio, and when he met his own people at the Union Buildings, the National Party has, through all its leaders, said that no one should ever try to understand or interpret this policy as one which suppresses anybody, because it seeks exactly the opposite. Now, we can differ on methods. If we have regard for the hon. member for Houghton because, for years, she has expounded what I regard as a totally wrong philosophy here, but because she stood by that policy, I should like to tell her at the same time that She owes it to herself&#x2014;also as far as her reputation is concerned&#x2014;not to put words in one&#x2019;s mouth which are not worthy of her.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I am going to quote. The hon. member said last night in regard to the statement that was made by the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<p>*In the second place, I wish to say that I differ greatly from the people on the other side of the House, and that there are certain matters we have to iron out among ourselves.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member who has just sat down, for instance, mentioned that he read certain things in the newspapers this morning which he accepts as being the truth, but you know, Sir, in a court of law you have to speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The hon. member could as well have mentioned that on my invitation the hon. member, together with others accompanied me&#x2014;and I thank them for doing so&#x2014;on a visit to the squatter camp. He knew about the facts and need not therefore have read in the newspapers about them, because I said here in Parliament&#x2014;and I was followed by the hon. member for Maitland&#x2014;that we would provide the services for which these members have been pleading, but I also said that the people who were squatting there illegally, knowing that they are squatting on other people&#x2019;s ground, should understand that they will not be allowed to break the law knowingly. I said too that people who encourage them to do it, must accept responsibility for the misery caused when we have to evict those people and have to take children away from their mothers. Where does the trouble start&#x003F; Does it start when we begin to remove them or does it start when people go and tell them in the Ciskei, &#x201C;Never mind about what is happening in Johannesburg; never mind about what they are saying in Cape Town; you move in and let them remove you&#x201D;. One gentleman, according to a newspaper report, said, &#x201C;Let them bulldoze my shack; I shall rebuild it as quickly as they bulldoze it&#x201D;. I want to say to that gentleman: &#x201C;Please do not take up that attitude; I want to make you a happy person, but do not try to put a pistol to my head, because you will not succeed.&#x201D; I want to warm the people behind this whole affair. I am not referring to any hon. member of this House, because I do feel that people who are elected to become members of this House will not be so irresponsible as to incite people. I hope that, leaving incitement aside, we shall never find an hon. member of this House or a responsible person outside even encouraging people to break the laws of the country.</p>

<p>*1 have been told that I can solve this problem by saying that we have to abrogate these measures. I should like to ask hon. members who suggest this, why they do not tell that to Chief Minister Mangope. The other day Chief Minister Mangope told his fellow-homeland leaders&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot allow this squatting in my territory just outside Pretoria. I have to introduce measures to stop this, because slums will develop if people are allowed just to move freely about and to settle wherever they want to.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to the hon. member. Because I have spent so much time to deal with negative matters, I shall now rather react to positive contributions. I think we can make some progress with this problem if we do not, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana and also other hon. members said quite rightly, make a political game of this. I think if there is one thing, apart from the d&#x00E9;tente reached in Africa and all the other things for which we can be grateful to the hon. the Prime Minister and this hon. Minister, then it is that we, on both sides of the House, have reached the stage where we can sometimes discuss these matters calmly. I shall not discuss matters with the Progressive Party any further for the simple reason that even if I could have regard for them as people&#x2014;and I do have regard for them as people&#x2014;I want to have nothing to do with their policy, because I want to tell every young South African and every minor and those who are 25 years old, to whom the hon. member referred, that what the Progressive Party is saying, means only one thing, viz. commit suicide or leave South Africa. [Interjections.] I know that, in any case as far as the National Party is concerned, we refuse to do this. I also know that this is also the case as far as the conservative South African in this country is concerned, although I differ from him as far as method is concerned. We refuse to commit suicide or to leave.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana referred to what the position will be like in 25 year&#x2019;s time. I also wish to consider what the position will be in 25 years&#x2019; time and not only 25 years&#x2019; time, but even in 250 years&#x2019; time, for this is the spirit in which we on this side of the House are trying to do our work. I want to say that we have extended the vision to 250 years in the future.</p>

<p>Please do not interrupt me. I want to say&#x2014;and I am saying it to myself and to my own department&#x2014;that through environmental causes people can become rapists, robbers and murderers. Those conditions prevailing on the Cape Flats and in many of our Black cities, cannot be allowed to continue. I say without fear of contradiction, and if I am contradicted I am prepared to stand up to the consequences, that I want to affirm the words of a former Minister of Finance that this party will bend the economy to have this policy of the Nationalist Party succeed. We have to bend the economy to develop the homelands so that 22 cities can as easily be established in the homelands as in other parts of South Africa. We have to bend the economy to provide housing for people so that they do not turn into robbers, rapists and murderers. We have to create conditions where people will not live in the filth and dirt so many of them are living in today. I am not now appealing to the Government; in view of the measures announced by the hon. the Minister I am appealing today to those people who will now be allowed to erect houses for the Black people of South Africa. I want to say to them: &#x201C;Take advantage of it. Do not ask for formal securities because by providing houses for these people you will secure the future for your children, for all the children&#x2014;Black and White&#x2014;in South Africa.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I agree 100% that we will have to have consultation on a local level too. This was not only said yesterday by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. It was also said by the hon. the Prime Minister and by the hon. the Minister. The following is an extract from the minutes of the meeting held between the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development with homeland leaders&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. M. C. Botha proposed and homeland leaders agreed that consideration be given to joining the existing Bantu urban councils and the councils representing homeland Governments in the urban areas into a new body with more powers and responsibility.</block>

<p>These things have been discussed. It is not necessary always to stand and point accusing fingers. These things are being done, The hon, member said that we must also have d&#x00E9;tente in South Africa. I could not agree with him more. We will be rubbing shoulders together in this country, Black and White, for many, many years to come [Interjections.] You can take your pick in regard to the question of time. There is one thing that I am adamant about and that is that we want those people to settle as quickly as possible and as happily as possible in their own fatherland, in their own country. However, we will still live side by side south of the Limpopo. We will still meet in the streets and the cinemas and elsewhere. [Interjections.] What is new about it&#x003F; Dr. Malan said it and Dr. Verwoerd said it, the present hon. Prime Minister has said it and my hon. Minister has said it ever so often. We will meet them and we will work together but not in the sense that I have to forfeit my identity because I want to live with these people. That we on <span class="col_5307-5308" refersTo="page_1067"/>this side of the House are not prepared to sacrifice. We want to remain here and we have promised our people and our generations to come that we will work so that the White nation will always be here. I want to tell hon. members something which may perhaps not even be known to hon. members on this side of the House. During the course of last year we did not have only one conference. The hon. the Minister, who bears one of the heaviest tasks on his shoulders, had 81 meetings with homeland leaders and homeland Governments at the highest level.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are always very pleased to listen to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. I want to begin with a few points which he raised and say that I agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister that a great responsibility rests on each member of this House to refrain from making speeches which will be to the detriment of colour relations outside this House. However, I also want to say that the hon. the Deputy Minister must also address these words to some of his own people in this House. I am referring more specifically to the sort of speech which we heard this morning from the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke, to which I shall return in a moment. I want to add that in this House we have general respect for the attitude which the hon. the Deputy Minister displayed in his concern at this situation. I want to tell you that there is a growing conviction that the hon. the Deputy Minister expects other people to do the work alone, to provide the housing, to provide the sports facilities, and the recreation facilities, while he and the Government, who have the power, are apparently not prepared to take steps which fall within the capacity and the power of the Government in this sphere. All that I want to say, with appreciation for the attitude of the Deputy Minister, is that it is still the task and the obligation of the Government to take the lead in this connection. Sir, we cannot get away from the fact that many of these squatters who are here in the Peninsula and elsewhere, came here because the economic circumstances in the Bantu homelands are not of such a nature as to offer them a livelihood, and as long as we fail to accept that fact as our basic premise, we shall not be able to solve this problem.</p>

<p>Sir, I referred to the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke. Obviously the hon. member is completely misinformed about this matter. The 1945 Act was purely a consolidation measure, as he ought to know. This section 10 did not appear in that Act; it was first placed on the Statute <span class="col_5309-5310" refersTo="page_1068"/>Book in 1952. As the hon. member knows, section 10 replaced the old section 5 of the Act, and that section 5 provided that the State President could declare an urban area, by proclamation to be a closed area, to which Bantu would not be allowed. Sir, I want to issue a warning in this regard, with all the earnestness at my disposal. The few rights which the Bantu think they have in our urban areas are incorporated in section 10, and I can think of no greater irresponsibility than a proposal made from within this House that they also be deprived of those rights under section 10. I say with all the earnestness at my disposal that if we ever want to create circumstances through which dissatisfaction will be rife in our urban areas on a scale which we cannot foresee, then we must tamper with the limited rights of those people under section 10. Sir, in a subsequent speech, I shall come back to the ideological basis of the kind of attitude which was displayed here by the hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke, the hon. member for Innesdale, and others. I should like to come back to the proposals made yesterday. There are certain positive proposals which I should like to make to the Government in this connection. In my last speech I was saying that consideration should be given to making loans available to Bantu in the form of building materials. I also want to express the hope that few restrictions will be imposed on the negotiability of premises, because it is essential that we establish a decent middle class among the urban Bantu, wherever they may be. Furthermore, I want to suggest that the relevant authorities, i.e. the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards in this regard, should make building plans available to Bantu&#x2014;this happened in the past, and I can see no reason why it should not be done again&#x2014;-with complete specifications and costing, so that the prospective Bantu builder will know precisely what it will cost to build a specific house. Obviously I agree that since we are going to allow the Bantu to build their own homes, arrangements should be made timeously in those areas for the provision of the necessary services in the form of water, electricity, sanitation and street lighting, so that we shall really get urban areas in which these people will be proud to live.</p>

<p>But in the final analysis it will depend on the Government. In other words, what I want to say is that this measure will not be sufficient to solve the extremely urgent need which exists for urban Bantu housing. More specially, energetic steps will have to be taken by the Government, probably through the Bantu Administration Boards, if we want to meet the housing needs of the urban Bantu areas. In this connection I want to say that I am convinced that it will sometimes be necessary, probably here in the Peninsula as well, to reconsider the introduction of a site-and-service scheme as it existed in specific cases in earlier years. Furthermore, I want to say in this connection that it will be essential to begin once again with the re-introduction of building teams. You know, the tremendous progress which was made with Bantu housing in the &#x2019;fifties was only possible because the municipalities developed their own large building teams. Those building teams, however, disappeared with the course of time. They disappeared here and they disappeared elsewhere as a result&#x2014; let me say this immediately&#x2014;of the policy of the authorities.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Everywhere, here as well. The Cape Peninsula also had its own building teams to build Bantu houses. I feel that if we are really going to tackle this programme, it will be necessary for the administration boards and the other bodies to approach it in this way again. Then I want to add to that the necessary provision of capital will have to be made by the State in this connection. In this connection I want to reaffirm my standpoint that I think that it is wrong that the profits which are made from the sale of liquor&#x2014; I am speaking of White, Western varieties of liquor&#x2014;are not being utilized in the urban areas, and I want to appeal to the Government to reconsider its standpoint in this connection, because it seems obvious to me that those profits should be utilized in the area where the profits are made.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. I was not aware that an announcement in this connection had been made. But I am very grateful. We are making progress. Then I want to say that we welcome the concessions to the Black trader, especially the elimination of uncertainty about the <span class="col_5311-5312" refersTo="page_1069"/>annual renewal of licences, which was announced yesterday by the hon. the Minister. But we do want to recommend very strongly, with reference to the motion which we discussed here earlier, that Bantu traders be allowed at the same time to carry on a trade in more than one set of premises in a Bantu residential area and also in more than one Bantu residential area. The restrictions which exist at the moment appear to me to be completely unnecessary and unjustified. We also asked here, when we discussed the private motion, that consideration be given to the introduction of supermarkets, perhaps in partnership with Blacks, in the Black urban areas to protect and to help the Bantu consumer. As far as that is concerned as well, I want to ask that it be seriously considered by the Government. I also want to eypress my appreciation for the concessions concerning professional Bantu, but I want to ask whether it is not obvious that those professional Bantu should also be allowed to open branch offices in the so-called White parts of the urban areas. Let us consider the case of doctors, dentists, advocates and attorneys. If they are to have offices only in the Bantu residential areas, one can understand what it will mean for a Bantu to go to those people. It will mean at the very least that he will have to be absent from his job for the whole day, and to me it seems unnecessary to act to the detriment of the Bantu in this way. I also want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Houghton said yesterday in connection with section 10(1)(b). [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to turn at once to the hon. member whose name you have just mentioned, the hon. member for Bryanston. If an hon. member wants to be so noisy in this House and even wants to make cutting comments about my appointment, I want to give him the good advice that if one is a searching political soul, then one is usually reasonably confused, because then one does not actually know where one should link up. One should first find oneself a basis or a standpoint from which one can onerate and not expound United Party policy at one moment and Progressive Party policy the next.

<p>Then I want to rectify something which the hon. member for Jeppe said yesterday. He referred to the annual report of the department and said that, in his opinion, it contained far too little reference to the work done by the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards. The hon. member should read the report a little more fully. He will find that there are not specific chapters about that, but that there are many references to the work which they are doing.</p>

<p>I shall mention two such places to him forthwith and also give him the page references. On page 46, mention is made of their contributions to housing and on page 6, mention is made of the contribution which they are making in respect of Bantu beer. The work of the department is a unit, and the work of the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards is woven into the whole report. The hon. member must not merely read the headings of chapters; he must also read the contents of the chapters. If he does that, he will find plenty of references to the work done by the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards.</p>

<p>I want to come back to some things which the hon. member for Edenvale said. I think that the Administration Boards can help with the plans and specifications to which the hon. member referred. I merely refer to the fact that I had a meeting with some of the chairmen of the Administration Boards in respect of new building methods. We are going to carry out an experiment of using a method of building with modules&#x2014;i.e. completed units which can be joined in various ways. We are going to build a few houses as an experiment and see whether these are acceptable to the Bantu of the various ethnic groups. These methods may possibly produce plans which can be used by the people on sites which will be released. As far as building teams are concerned, I can say that there are building teams. Johannesburg still has its municipal building teams, the Resettlement Board still has building teams, and some of the Administration Boards also still have building teams which usually continue with the work as was done in the past. In connection with supermarkets and the provision of shopping <span class="col_5313-5314" refersTo="page_1070"/>centres, I have a few ideas, but I do not want to elaborate on that now. Possibly the hon. member and I can even discuss this matter over a cup of tea some time&#x2014;I seldom drink anything stronger&#x2014; so that I can hear what his plans are in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Schweizer-Reneke said that we have had a strange debate up to now. I want to agree with him. Hon. members who have been sitting in this House through the years, are witnesses to the fact that through the years we have managed to make the hon. gentlemen on the opposite side gain at least some insight and understanding. [Interjections.] I want to remind the hon. member who has just made that grumbling noise that they view homelands in a different light now and that these now form an important element of their policy. Before they would not even listen to the matter. The homeland leaders who were denigrated by them earlier on are now elevated to some lofty status and before long we shall still hear that the idea of homeland leaders was actually their brainchild and their creation.</p>

<p>An hon. member who surprised me yesterday, is the hon. member for Houghton. Now, after so many years, she, too, came forward with positive proposals which fall within the framework of the policy. I ask myself what the result would have been if the hon. lady, who has been sitting here for 14, 15 or 20 years&#x2014;or however long it might be&#x2014;had made positive proposals for at least half of that time.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>She often sounded quite enthusiastic in respect of the latest proposals. Therefore, it seems to me as if we are making progress, even if our progress is only gradual as far as the benches directly opposite me are concerned.</p>

<p>I want to get one matter off my chest. That is to tell the United Party that they are making one mistake. They do not see the policy of the National Party in its totality, i.e. as one great whole. From the level of personal relations to the eventual aim of our policy&#x2014;the aim of independent states which can exist inter-dependently and peacefully alongside one another&#x2014;our policy is one great whole. The United Party singles out the urban Bantu as if he is not part of that policy, with its aim of peoples who can eventually exist independently alongside one another. All our actions in respect of the urban Black are woven into this final aim of our policy of having independent, inter-dependent states existing alongside one another in South Africa. All our arrangements, whether in connection with housing, labour or ultimate political authority, form a part of this. The announcements which the hon. the Minister made yesterday do not upset the policy of the National Party. They merely reflect the development of the policy, which can be accommodated easily. We do this from day to day, and even if more announcements do come, perhaps in respect of what the hon. member for Edenvale asked for as well, they will not upset our plans either. These things fit into the great whole of National Party policy. However, we are also reproached for not treating the urban Bantu correctly in respect of certain standards, including standards of housing. The reproach is made that we do not show understanding<i>&#x2014;inter alia,</i> that we do not make provision for a better type of house for a Bantu middle-class, as the hon. gentlemen call it, which is arising. The Government takes a great deal of trouble in this connection in respect of family housing and also as far as single accommodation is concerned. We look after these people from the point at which they are normally engaged in their daily existence. As I have said, I have already had discussions with the chairmen of Bantu Administration Boards about the building of prototypes according to new building methods. However, there are also other proposals in connection with Bantu housing, in respect not only of family housing, but also as far as hostels and schools are concerned. I shall not elaborate any further about schools. As a result of rising Bantu wages, the rise in their general standard of living and the development of a sophisticated taste among these Bantu, it is necessary to see to these things. The department asked the Department of Community Development to institute an enquiry into a better type of housing Subsequently it was asked that that enquiry be extended so as to include schools. It is in the hands of my hon. colleague here next to me. Perhaps he can elaborate on that later. We know the type of house which has been built up to now. It is a standard four-roomed house, the 51-6A type with a cost limit of approximately R500. The Bantu Housing Board has already increased this limit as a result <span class="col_5315-5316" refersTo="page_1071"/>of increased costs, to R750. Community Development calculates the real cost at almost R1 000. There have been new proposals, and I want to mention a few of them. In cases where water sewerage facilities are available, the following is provided in that same original plan: Indoor bathroom with a water closet and a small bath, a sink in the kitchen, shelves in the kitchen, a pantry, inside doors to bedrooms and still four rooms as before. The unit cost in this case will be R200 more&#x2014;in other words, the full unit cost will come to approximately R1 200.</p>

That is what they are stuck with. The United Party was stuck with them previously, and I want to warn the Progressive Party that if they are perhaps to take them in, they will also be stuck with them. Those people are confused in their thinking. To get an idea, from the attempt which he made, of their approach to the urban Bantu, I can only come to one conclusion and that is that the hon. member&#x2019;s view is that&#x2014;and I believe that in this respect there is similarity as far as the views of the different parties on the opposite side is concerned&#x2014; there should be complete socio-economic, educational and political integration between the Black man in the cities and the Whites. From that must be created one vast entity on which the future must be built. The pattern is not separate structures in which each population group will retain its identity and in which the ethnic groups will remain linked to their homelands, but a co-ordinating or unitary structure, in which everyone will be herded together under one roof. That is their approach and point of view.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the picture which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana painted for us here yesterday. He held out to us a grim picture of the position&#x2014;as he put it&#x2014;of seven to eight million Bantu working and living in our urban complexes today. He said that the fact that they are still there is proof that the National Government has failed in its policy of separate development. That is so far from reality and the truth that it shows a total lack of understanding on his part and he is the leader of Natal&#x2014;and also one of the people who strives for the national leadership. Separate development and the presence of urban Bantu as such&#x2014; whether they be six, seven or eight million&#x2014;are as far removed from each other as the east is from the west. Separate development is a recognition of the identity of every population group which has to develop to its full status and which must be led to maturity within the guide-lines which are followed by the policy of the Government. One can talk a great deal about the urban Bantu and I have much experience of the interaction of labourers between the homelands&#x2014;the Bantu areas of that time and the cities. I worked among the Bantu for 30 years; I was in the Transkei for many years and in Pretoria for a long time as well, and an attitude which I have noticed throughout&#x2014; and I can emphasize this here today&#x2014;is that the urban Bantu has always maintained his ties with his homeland. If I had the time, I could quote to you a series of examples of how the Bantu maintains the cultural ties, the language ties and the family ties. The love of the Bantu for his homeland, for his cattle, for his way of life, remains strong even after generations in the cities. If one speaks to the older generation of Bantu and even with the younger ones in the cities, who have been there for two or three generations, there is still the desire and hankering for his homeland. It is proved by those in the urban areas, that blood is still thicker than water. One will find that a group of Bantu who worked together today and who consists of different ethnic groups and who were playing dice or who were cheerfully gathered together a moment ago, will clash and will grab each other by the throat the moment one of their tribal members is being so much as touched. If one of their members of a specific group is dealt with to his detriment <span class="col_5317-5318" refersTo="page_1072"/>or if a delicate quarrel is getting out of hand a little, a bloody battle can ensue. That proves how close their ties are. I want to try to refute the arguments of the United Party that the urban Bantu has been westernized and has adopted the Western forms of civilization to such an extent that he will no longer take any notice of tribal or homeland ties in future, because there is a great difference between the acceptance of Western forms of civilization and tribal customs. A Black man can put on the clothes of the White man and he can live in a house such as that of the White man, but in bis heart, in his bones and in his being, he remains a member of the tribe from which he comes. In this viewpoint, I am supported by people who have done important research in this connection. I read in <i>The Passing of Tribal Man in Africa,</i> an article of Colin Legum, in which&#x2014;this can serve for the edification of my friends on the opposite side&#x2014;he makes the following important statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tribalism is Africa&#x2019;s natural condition, and is likely to remain so for a long time to come&#x2014;certainly for the rest of this century and, possibly, for the next century as well.</block>

<p>To point out the superficiality of the acceptance of Western forms of civilization as against the depth of tribal ties, he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tribalism must be distinguished from traditionalism: traditional systems may pass away while tribal affiliations remain strongly entrenched in defence of ethnocentric interests.</block>

<p>In the same book there is an article by Leonard Plotnicov in which he writes, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Africa strong and extensive kinship ties, based on traditional forms, have altered little. Ethnic associations have not only persisted, in many cases they have increased in importance in the new towns and cities.</block>

<p>That is the basic premise of the National Party in respect of its whole approach. Plotnicov even made a study of the Xhosa in South Africa, and what does he write&#x003F; The following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are even extreme cases of conservatism &#x2026; found with many Xhosa in East London. There, migrants remain traditionalistic in all possible ways as far as they are able, despite their long periods of urban residence.</block>

<p>Therefore it is of no use the Opposition trying to paint a picture of the future in which the urban Bantu will gradually be integrated. Their idea of permanency differs from the idea of permanency of this side of the House. This idea of this side of the House of permanency is based on the fact that there will always be Bantu but only as long as we need them in our industries. On that basis, therefore, there will be permanency, but not in the sense of permanency which ends in political integration. The picture which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana painted, is really the dark picture of the future we will be heading for if the policy of the opposite side were to be realized, viz. that the Bantu will be in our urban areas on a permanent integrated basis.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. D. McINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to begin by taking a phrase from a speech made by the hon. member for Innesdal a few days ago. I, as a young member&#x2014;I think I speak at least on behalf of all young members on this side&#x2014;am sick and tired to the bottom of my heart of the fact that we as young members are continually admonished and given advice to the effect that we should know our places, by hon. members on the opposite side. I want to remind this House that all members of this House are equal. The Ministers merely bear greater responsibility. That is the only difference. I shall not allow my constituents being discriminated against because they had the insight to elect a young man to represent them. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I should like us to discuss together, in this House, this whole matter with which we have been dealing this morning. I believe that all of us in this country realize that we are faced with a dilemma in respect of our race relations. The one horn of the dilemma, which we in the United Party accept completely, is that there are different communities in our country, that people want to retain their own identities, <span class="col_5319-5320" refersTo="page_1073"/>and that it is the right of every community to plan its culture, its identity and its own progress itself. That we accept. That is the one horn of the dilemma. The other horn of the dilemma&#x2014;and it is also a fact&#x2014;is that we in South Africa have the situation that we all live together in one economy and in one country, that we are dependent on one another, that I am dependent on a Black servant at certain times of the day to look after my child, that I am dependent on my farm on Black tractor drivers, and that we are all dependent on one another in some way or other. That is the position, whether we want it that way, or not. The problem now is to bring about a reconciliation. The Progressive Party seeks this reconciliation, on the one hand, by standing for our becoming a mixture, our becoming an integrated community. That we do not accept. The National Party adopts the traditional 1948 standpoint, which they impose on everybody, that every community should have its own FAK, its own academies, etc., so that every community should have a sort of colonial appearance of the Afrikaner Nationalism. The result is that we continually have this extreme emphasis on apartheid. Sir, we must try to reconcile these things. Allow me to say that we agree with the hon. members on the opposite side that the homelands should be developed. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana said last year that the Minister would tell us about the development there, about how many bridges and dams had been built, etc., and that is precisely what he did. But, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana also said, the actual point is that of political rights. As I have said, we are agreed as far as the homelands are concerned. We want them to be developed. We do not want rural slums here in our country. But, Sir, the actual problem is the urban Bantu, and hon. members on the opposite side must be honest about this. I do not think it helps us if we get the sort of nonsense which we have had from the hon. members for Vereeniging and Schweizer-Reneke.</p>

<p>No, I can answer no questions, because I only have 10 minutes. We are dealing with 80% of the population, and we only get eight hours for that. Sir, suppose we were to apply the thinking of the hon. member for Vereeniging in South Africa. In the first place, the hon. member for Waterberg would be affected. Where is the hon. member for Waterberg&#x2019;s homeland&#x003F; It is against the slopes of the Piketberg mountain range. He must come and stay here in the Cape, because that is where he was born and grew up. What is he doing up there in the north&#x003F; He must come and stay here in Piketberg, because that is his homeland. That is where his culture and his community are. And what about the former hon. member for Worcester&#x003F; Where is he&#x003F; What is he doing in Middelburg in the Transvaal&#x003F; He should come and stay here in his birthplace together with the hon. member for Tygervallei. And, Sir, what about the hon. member for Johannesburg West&#x003F; What is he doing up there in the north&#x003F; Is he of any use up there&#x003F; I do not know, but he comes from Bellville. Then we come to the hon. member for Rondebosch. Where is his homeland&#x003F; His homeland is in Pietersburg, and here he is sitting in Rondebosch. So we can continue. The point is that the urban Bantu still have strong links with their tribes. We all know that. We do not say that the urban Bantu is another nation. Of course we do not say that; we are not so stupid, but the point is that the urban Bantu are also entitled to a dispensation which is just, which gives them permanence and which accepts them as people able to realize themselves fully. If the urban Bantu cannot have his family with him, how can he do this&#x003F; If we want to prevent the situation which developed in the Western Cape recently in respect of the urban Bantu, from developing, we shall have to do what the East German Government in Berlin did, because no single person will stay in the rural areas and starve while he knows that there is a possibility of work here in Cape Town.</p>

<p>No, wait a moment. I am not referring to the Free State. Rather let me say the homelands. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, but everything is so compartmentalized on the opposite <span class="col_5321-5322" refersTo="page_1074"/>side. Let me put it this way: Nobody will stay in Cofimvaba, in Mahlabatini, in Lebowa or in Gazankulu to starve there. They will come to the cities. And, Sir, we are not going to stop that, unless we introduce the same sort of entrenchment that the East Germans did. This Government must accept that. Every year half a million offenders come before the courts as a result of this very problem. As a result of influx control, half a million people are prepared to be fined every year, and now I am not even speaking of those of whom we do not know. Of course these people will come to the cities, and we shall not be able to stop them.</p>

<p>What can we do in this connection&#x003F; What is the solution&#x003F; Recently, over the past 15 months, we had an excellent example of how such a situation should be handled. Over 10 000 Portuguese streamed into this country. Where are they now&#x003F; The whole problem has virtually been solved. A few hundred, who were not acceptable, have apparently been sent back to Portugal, but over 10 000 people have been treated properly, looked after and accommodated within a year. Why can we not have the same sort of approach in respect of the non-Whites&#x003F; I want to remind this Government that our Black population is going to double over the next 18 years. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana speaks about a period of 25 years. In 25 years&#x2019; time I shall be 56, and if I am possibly still in this House, or in any other House, I hope that we shall still have to struggle with the very problems which we have now. But, as I have said, the Black population of this country will double itself over the next 18 to 20 years, and I can assure you, Sir, that they are not going to remain in the homelands. The squatters&#x2019; problem which we have here in the Western Cape, will grow purely as a result of the population explosion, let alone the drawing power of economic circumstances. What is going to happen to all these people&#x003F; Are we going to develop Saldanha without Bantu&#x003F; Of course not, Sir. They will all go there. We solved the poor White problem properly in the &#x2019;thirties. Where is the White population of the Free State rural areas today&#x003F; They are all in the cities. They have decent houses. They do not live in slums. Why can we not do that for our Black people&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I do not have time for children now.</p>

<p><span class="col_5323-5324" refersTo="page_1075"/>I want to turn to a subject concerning which there should be a high degree of consensus among us, viz. the development within the homelands. I want to refer in particular to the enormous role played by the Xhosa Development Corporation in the development of the Transkei and the Ciskei. Towards the end of last year, a few members of each party in this House had the opportunity of visiting industrial and agricultural projects of this corporation. Now, I do not want to single out the role of the XDC today at the expense of other bodies which have also carried out major tasks in the other homelands, but it is natural for me to discuss the XDC because I was able to observe it in practice and therefore had the opportunity of forming a better idea of what was being done in those homelands. Consequently I do not wish to pepper my observations with statistics today. Suffice it to say that in my opinion, all the members of the various parties were enthusiastic about and impressed by the tremendous development that has been achieved in so short a period by the XDC. Since it is the avowed policy of the Government to establish similar corporations for the various homelands, this really inspires confidence that, as regards the future of the development of the Bantu homelands, we are going in the right direction.</p>

<p>I want to say without fear of contradiction that one of the biggest single factors to which the success of the XDC may be ascribed is its human material&#x2014;in other words, the staff of the XDC. I think you will allow me to say that under the inspired and dynamic leadership of Mr. Franco Maritz the managing director of the XDC, and Mr. Frans Meisenholl, the general manager, we have a team of absolutely dedicated people as far as the development of the homelands is concerned. I think that the person who will be the first to acknowledge that I am right will be the hon. member for Parktown who also had the opportunity of seeing this. Apart from this sphere, these men have now done well in another sphere, too, in advertising their products, the opportunities they create, etc., at the Rand Show. I am told that up to Saturday evening, 373 000 people visited the Rand Show, 146 000 of whom visited the XDC pavilion. In other words, 40% of the visitors viewed the pavilion. This year the XDC won six gold medals at this show, plus one of the first merit awards in the history of the Rand Show for their contribution to the success of the show. I think that there are probably many members who would agree with me when I congratulate the XDC on this exceptional distinction.</p>

<p>Basically, one can summarize the task of the XDC in three main points: In the first instance, their aim is to create employment opportunities in the homelands; secondly, they are concerned with the provision of training in a very wide series of occupations and trades; and thirdly, they attempt to ensure a higher income and an improved way of life for every individual in the homelands. You would be justified in asking whether the Corporation succeeds in achieving these three objectives.</p>

<p>The initial investment of R1 million in 1967 has grown to R15 million in 1974. The employment opportunities that have been created amount, at this stage, to 11 000 direct employment opportunities for Xhosas. At Butterworth alone, which, seven years ago, had a Xhosa population of only 300, there is today a population of 25 000, all of whom have a regular income. Take, for example, the name Dimbaza, which has been used as a term of abuse against South Africa. Do you know that on 27 February this year there were only 60 unemployed persons registered in Dimbaza, many of whom were women&#x003F; From being a term of abuse, Dimbaza is becoming one of the shining examples of industrial development in the Ciskei. Already there are employment opportunities for 400 men, 842 of them are working at King William&#x2019;s Town, 17 km away, where they are conveyed by bus. 470 women are working at King William&#x2019;s Town.</p>

<p>A large number of pensioners are also living at Dimbaza. Those of us who were there noted that the Bantu children at Dimbaza shine, and that is always a sign of prosperity. 3 000 of them are already accommodated in seven schools there. Each simple and humble little house has a small vegetable garden, and where the people are unable to afford the seed, the Corporation provides the seed. The pattern one finds at Dimbaza is also to be found at Sada. At Umtata, too, vast industrial development is taking place. In the sphere of agriculture, too, I could almost say, in the sphere of agriculture in particular, the Corporation, under the inspired leadership of Louis Steyl, the district agricultural manager, is showing tremendous progress. If we take into account that these people have <span class="col_5325-5326" refersTo="page_1076"/>to deal with traditions and customs and prejudices among the Black people that have to be overcome before certain projects can be made to succeed, one realizes what a difficult task this is.</p>

<p>I also want to mention to hon. members a project such as Occupation Post near Queenstown, which the hon. member for Transkei, too, might find worth a visit. At the moment there are 450 ha under irrigation there. There are already 200 milk-cows in a dairy industry there that will eventually be capable of meeting the dairy requirements of the entire Transkei. I want to refer, too, to the Tyumie citrus farm where they are also engaged in the fattening of cattle on a large scale. At the moment there are still only 130, but eventually they will be able to fatten 600 there.</p>

<p>Oh, really, Vause, busy yourself with something else. Lante is another of the Corporation&#x2019;s farming projects. It has 308 ha under irrigation. It is a fact that the Bantu farmer&#x2019;s average yield from irrigation is only in the region of R70 per ha. Here the Corporation has proved that with an ordinary crop such as cabbage, they can earn up to R2 600 per annum per ha. Agriculture plays a cardinal role in the economic development of the Transkei and the Ciskei. I think that Chief Minister Lennox Sebe and Chief Minister Kaiser Matanzima are probably very well aware of this, so much so that Chief Minister Sebe has said on occasion that economic progress must not only be measured against smoking chimneys as a symbol of progress. The point of departure there&#x2014;and the XDC is helping to create that tradition&#x2014;is that the homelands must meet their own food requirements, not only in order to create employment opportunities in these farming projects, but also to meet their own food requirements. Experience shows that it costs between R700 and R900 per employment opportunity in the agriculture sector, whereas it costs between R7 000 and R9 000 to create a single employment opportunity in the industrial sector.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is considerable talk at all times about the problems which Black people experience in respect of their incomes, and appeals are repeatedly being made to employers to pay their workers more&#x2014;I think correctly so. I should like, in the initial portion of what I have to say, to refer to the present consumer price index and to indicate that in our view the consumer price index gives no indication whatsoever as to the position of the Black people in this country. Sir, the consumer price index should relate to all the people in South Africa. It seems fairly clear that the consumer price index is calculated on the basis of the requirements and the needs of the White population. To give you an example, Sir, if you refer to the basis of calculation, you will find that when the loading is worked out we take into account the White population in the major urban centres only. We do not take the Black population in these areas into account whatsoever. It is fairly clear also that when reference is made in a survey of income to determine the consumer price index to an income of R6 999 per annum, that figure does not refer to the average income of the Black community at all, or to the average income of the community of South Africa as a whole. When we compare the loading that is contained in the consumer price index with the actual expenditure of Black people who are living on the poverty datum line, we find an even more serious position. In the last survey done in November 1974 by the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce in respect of Soweto, it was found that the basic poverty datum line requirement would be an income of R99-50, and that taking into account certain additional expenditure, that figure would be lifted to R110-78. Of that amount R58-45 has to be spent on food alone. The loading which is used for the consumer price index, which is the guide for people as a whole in South Africa, is 23,9%. But for people living on the poverty datum line that figure is about 50%. Sir, there are other examples which I could give, but it is quite clear that the consumer price index is entirely unrelated to the needs of the Black population in South Africa. It gives the employer no guide as to what he should do in respect of the Black people employed by him. The appeal that I want to make to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;I do not know which of his Deputies deals with this, so I appeal to him&#x2014;is that he and his department should see to it that there are statistics available which indicate how the Black man is affected by increases in the cost of living, so that this can serve as guide to people who have to determine salaries and wages. <span class="col_5327-5328" refersTo="page_1077"/>I think one of the problems which arises and which is demonstrated by this attitude towards the consumer price index, which might be regarded as a non-contentious matter, is the attitude which is displayed in South Africa towards the Black people as such. Sir, we had the announcement which was made here yesterday by the hon. the Minister and which is acclaimed as a dramatic breakthrough, when all it does, with regard to home ownership, for example, is to go back to 1967. It is now regarded as progress in South Africa in the year 1975 if you go back to what the position was in 1967. Nobody has given an explanation, for instance, as to why there was a change in 1967 and why in 1975 the hon. the Minister has to go back to where he was in 1967. The concept which has been adopted by the Nationalist Party in South Africa is that they are entitled to decide for other people what should happen in respect of their destiny. They apply a consumer price index which applies to White people only, and they ignore the existence of the Black people in the determination of that. They are the ones who decide that a man who is a South African citizen today should become a citizen of another country tomorrow. They are the ones who are deciding that; he who is affected is not deciding that. They talk about self-determination, but they are the ones who decide how in fact they should determine and where they should determine their own future. They are the ones who decide that there should be Bantustans. It is not the Black man who has a say in the determination of whether that is to be his policy. The question that has to be asked is whether it is in fact the Black man&#x2019;s desire that unilateral decisions made by a party which represents admittedly the majority of the White electorate should be applied to him without his having a say in the making of these decisions. This is not a matter of concensus; this is a matter where the Nationalist Party decides that self-determination means &#x201C;we will decide for you where you will determine your future and how you will determine it.&#x201D; There is a fundamental difference of approach in regard to the attitude towards people in South Africa. Is it enough, as I think has been indicated by other speakers that we make small gestures as we go along, that there are small changes, that there are a few palliatives, and that there are a few tokens which are in fact made, while essentially South Africa remains the same in respect of the relation-chip between Black and White in the future&#x003F; Sir, we as White people in South Africa take for granted a particular way of live, but must we not also accept that other people are entitled to the same sort of life and the same quality of life&#x003F; Is it correct that we should take running water for granted when in Soweto only a quarter of the people have running water; that we take hot running water for granted when in Soweto only 3% of the people have hot running water; that we take electricity in our houses for granted when only 15% of the Black people in Soweto have electricity in their houses&#x003F; So we can go on. We take baths and showers for granted, and yet only 7% of the people in Soweto can enjoy those benefits. Our attitude towards the Black people of South Africa is that while we have one way of life, we regard those people quite differently. The issue which I see in South African politics is the issue that we have one set of values which applies to us as Whites in South Africa, and that we have another set of values which we apply to other people in South Africa who are of a different colour. While that exists in South Africa, while we engage in tokenism, while we engage in small gestures, there will be no solution to the problems of South Africa in so far as the relationships between Whites and Blacks are concerned.</p>

<p>Let me come back to the announcements which the hon. the Minister made yesterday. In regard to home ownership, we go back to 1967. When we talk about trading, it is a dramatic breakthrough in South Africa to say that these people need only renew their licences once a year in the same way as Whites, instead of accepting it as a reality. But not a word is said about the fact that there is still a limitation on the number of businesses that you may have there, and not a word is said about the size of the businesses which may in fact be owned in these places. [Interjections.] I not only listened, but I checked it in writing. The Minister said that they could enlarge the scone of their businesses, but not the size, and there was not a word on the question of whether they can now have supermarkets or whether they can now extend to two or three stands. Not a single word was said in regard to the matter. We can only hear what is said; we cannot hear what is perhaps in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind. When it comes to influx control, we are told that there is going to be talk <span class="col_5329-5330" refersTo="page_1078"/>about it, but not a word is said as to whether the separation of families is going to be put an end to. The simple issue is that this question of tokens, of gestures, offers no solution to the problems of South Africa. The real situation is that you have to accept that the quality of life that you want for yourself is what other people are entitled to as well. Sir, the price that White South Africans must be prepared to pay for their survival in South Africa is to allow Black South Africans to enjoy the same quality of life, and that everybody who, is prepared to make a contribution towards society should enjoy that quality of life.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Yeoville came here with a lot of objections without trying to penetrate to the basis of his arguments. We on this side of the House recognize that the quality of life is important and that ultimately, the quality of life for each population group in South Africa can only be determined if each population group is put in a position to govern its own people. If this is not done, then the quality of life will likewise be threatened, and we want to prevent that on the basis of separate development, the pattern in accordance with which we not only want to give every population group a say over its own people, but in accordance with which we also want to develop the homelands for the various population groups to the maximum extent.</p>

<p>It is in view of this that I should like to express a few ideas this afternoon. The programme of land purchases and consolidation is probably one of the most comprehensive programmes ever tackled by this Government. Its execution is going to keep the department intensively occupied for many years yet. In a certain respect we could say that this programme has now just about reached its peak. The heat has left it, the emotion has left it and I get the impression that even the United Party is starting to vote for this programme. I therefore want to plead that the second programme, viz. homeland development, which is going to be of a far greater scope than the programme for consolidation, should now be taken up and imparted with a spectacular degree of momentum. Everyone is aware that the hon. the Minister and his department have already been intensively engaged in establishing a development programme for the homelands for a number of years and that they have already made phenomenal progress in that sphere. Time does not allow me to mention various facts in order to spell out the scope of the project, nor does it allow me to give an indication of the successful progress already made. However, the fact remains that through this department, the Government has already attempted to expedite this matter in various ways. It has also been announced recently that a new and improved formula on which the budget of the homelands is to be based has been drafted, a formula which I believe will greatly benefit the various homelands. Undoubtedly this, too is an aspect deserving of further discussion in this House.</p>

<p>The Government has attempted to set in operation various programmes to develop the homelands further. There are the BIC, the XDC and the various national corporations that are now being envisaged. Then, too, there is the Bantu Mining Corporation and various councils and corporations which have as their object the further development of the vast potential of the homelands. What a vast potential they have! The hon. member for Tygervallei has already referred to that this afternoon. Just consider the agricultural sphere. In this sphere the homelands are not only capable of providing their own people with food, in future years but will also be capable of providing the whole of South Africa and Africa with food. To mention but a single example&#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member does not take note of what has happened around him. One need only consider the possibilities of a homeland like Bophuthatswana with Africa at its doorstep and with a railway line from the middle of its territory to the north. I can also furnish the hon. member for Durban Point with amazing figures indicating the progress that has already been made in the spheres of agriculture, mining and industry as well. The fact is that the Government is engaged in a comprehensive development programme. This includes the establishment of towns, the provision of housing, the establishment Of an infrastructure, the provision of water, electricity, transport and so on. The training of the vast reservoir of human potential, the utilization of natural resources, <span class="col_5331-5332" refersTo="page_1079"/>the exploitation of minerals and many other factors are of importance here. In fact this programme embraces so many diverse activities that, taken together, it is often of so complicated a nature that the organization and particularly the co-ordination of the various projects are of decisive importance for the success of the enterprise as a whole. To mention only a few: There are for example, various Government bodies involved at various levels of these projects. One calls to mind the Departments of Health, Water Affairs, Transport and many others. In the second instance, there is the large number of Government bodies or councils concerned with this development at various levels. Here one calls to mind the Decentralization Board, the Growth Points Committee of the Department of Planning, Escom, the provincial councils and so on. Then there are the homeland governments themselves, too, which are starting to play an ever-increasing role in the development of the homelands. Surely it is of vital importance to bear in mind that the development must be effected in co-operation with the various Black communities and homelands governments, and not merely on their behalf. Consequently the homeland governments are also consulted in regard to these projects, and there is co-operation with them. The Bantu Affairs Commission, with its economic committee and its agricultural committee under which B.E.R.B.D.&#x2014;the Bureau for Economic Research into Bantu Development&#x2014; and also C.O.R.I.B.A.&#x2014;the Co-ordinating Committee on Research into Bantu Affairs &#x2014;also forms part of this whole picture. Each of these diverse ramifications is concerned with homelands development at some level and is doing outstanding work in this regard. However, I want to ask the hon. the Minister this afternoon to give serious consideration to establishing a development board for the homelands, a development board in whose hands the diverse ramifications may be united, a board which could give this whole project even greater momentum in that it could co-ordinate the various aspects of development, a board on which the private sector, together with experts from the public sector, could be represented, a board that would aim in particular at co-ordinating and tackling the development of the homelands in such a way as to capture the imagination of the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not have the time to go into that now. I do not want to venture many ideas concerning the composition and operation of such a board this afternoon. However, we could look at various other boards in order to find an example. The Resettlement Board could be mentioned in this connection, and even the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council. Perhaps a very well-known and good example is the Tennessee Valley Basin Authority, which formed part of President Roosevelt&#x2019;s so-called &#x201C;New Deal&#x201D;. The fact remains that the Government, under the able leadership of the hon. the Minister, his deputies and the department, laid the foundation for homeland development courageously and across a broad front. I am convinced that now is the time to throw everything into the struggle in order to tackle this task further in a spectacular fashion, with daring and determination, and to make it one of our highest priorities in South Africa, because it is in the interests of all the peoples in South Africa that the homelands, too, should be made vigorous. I do not think there is any doubt that although prophets of doom and alarmists often maintain that the homelands cannot be made vigorous, there is ample evidence&#x2014;for the hon. member for Durban Point as well&#x2014;to prove that these homelands are in fact viable and will, in fact, be capable of growth.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, with reference to the speeches by the hon. members for Johannesburg West and <span class="col_5333-5334" refersTo="page_1080"/>Tygervallei, I should like to discuss this report of the Commission of Inquiry into certain matters concerning the Bantu Investment Corporation, the BIC, this afternoon. The BIC was established in 1959 and commenced its activities in the subsequent year. Thus it has been in operation for almost 16 years now. The aim of this Corporation was to promote, to maintain and develop the economic viability of the homelands&#x2014;in other words to help the people there to help themselves. All efforts are aimed at economic progress in the homelands. What, however, has occurred since the beginning of last year&#x003F; Since the middle of last year there has been a campaign of suspicionmongering directed against this Corporation. To start with, it was confined for the most part to the newspapers. Some of our newspapers tried to give the public a distorted image of the BIC, its staff and its activities. For example, in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 28 July 1974 we had headlines like &#x201C;BIC man lent R15 000 to Heyns&#x201D;; and &#x201C;Top official aided dagga smuggler&#x2019;s curio business&#x201D;. In <i>Oggendblad</i> and <i>Die Transvaler</i> of 29 July 1974, too, we had banner headlines concerning the BIC and its activities. All these reports reflected a negative attitude. The same goes for a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 11 August 1974. In the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 11 September 1974 we read &#x201C;BIC inquiry&#x2014;another top man quits&#x201D;. At that stage a commission of inquiry had not yet been appointed, but the public began to ask questions. They wanted to know what was wrong with the BIC; what was the reason for all these newspaper reports concerning the BIC&#x003F; Had there been embezzlement of funds, had there been corruption: in fact, what was going on in the BIC&#x003F; It was very clear that these reports were sensation-seeking. The matter was put to the public in this way in order to create the impression that large-scale corruption was taking place.</p>

<p>On 10 September 1974 the hon. the Minister issued the following statement (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a statement dated 4 September 1974, Dr. S. P. du Toit Viljoen, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the BIC, put it to me that in the light of manifest and continued efforts in public to discredit the name and good work of the BIC, it would be appreciated if the Government were to appoint an impartial person to investigate the affairs of the Bantu Investment Corporation.</block>

<p>This request, therefore, came from the chairman of the BIC, but in spite of that the hon. member for Houghton&#x2014;I am very sorry she is not present this afternoon &#x2014;also tried to foment this suspicionmongering. She commenced with a series of questions which she asked in this House. The hon. the Minister furnished very clear replies to the questions and in some cases, where he did not want to mention names, invited the hon. member to pay a visit to him at his office and look at the names herself. However, all the hon. member&#x2019;s efforts were aimed at sowing suspicion and in spite of the fact that she had the opportunity to clear up these matters, she continued with her suspicionmongering. In fact, she made allegations in a very amateurish way without making sure of the facts. I want to draw the attention of hon. members to what the hon. member said in the House last year. Among other things, she said of the hon. the Minister that he ought to have been honest enough to have said that he knew that he was instituting the investigation because&#x2014;listen carefully now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; there have been a number of very disquieting transactions carried out by the BIC over the last few years.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We shall defend the right of any hon. member to exercise criticism, but that was not criticism; those were allegations, a blatant undermining of the BIC. If the hon. member had come up with positive, responsible criticism, we should, of course, have welcomed it, but that she did not do. In point of fact, she further discredited the BIC and caused people to entertain doubts in that regard. The worst of all is that all her accusations and allegations were based on <i>mala fide</i> hearsay evidence. She had no concrete facts to submit to the commission of inquiry. All she had was a few newspaper cuttings. I do not think that that is the degree of responsibility that should be displayed by a hon. member of this House. The Commission&#x2019;s terms of reference were <span class="col_5335-5336" refersTo="page_1081"/>very wide. I want to read to you what the Commission felt about them. Chief Magistrate Prins was the chairman and only member of this Commission. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bearing the contents of paragraph 7 in mind, the Commission understood the terms of reference to mean that an investigation had to be instituted concerning the following:</block>

<ol>

<li>(A) whether allegations which</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(1) have already been made,</li>

<li>(2) have been made in public, and</li>

<li>(3) concerned</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(a) alleged irregular conduct on the part of serving and ex-officials of the BIC,</li>

<li>(b) irregular practices in the BIC, particularly with regard to possible irregularities in connection with</li>

</ol>

<ol>

<li>(i) acquisition of business interests by officials of the BIC, and</li>

<li>(ii) awarding of tenders by the BIC,</li>

</ol>

<p>were well-founded, viz. whether there was a strong likelihood that they were true in view of the known facts; and</p>

<ol>

<li>(B) into any matter which, in the opinion of the Commission, was connected with (A).</li>

</ol>

<p>What is important is what the findings of this Commission of Inquiry were. I should like to read them to the House. The Commission found, <i>inter alia,</i> the following &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#chairman">

<speech by="#herman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. HERMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Now that the line is open again, I should like to read to hon. members what the Commission&#x2019;s finding was. I consider this to be very important since we must clear the air around the BIC, this well-meaning corporation with such fine aims. The findings were the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No evidence of irregular action by serving officials was submitted; at the same time, where such allegations or suggestions existed, the evidence submitted proved them to be unfounded. No irregular practices in the BIC, including possible irregularities in regard to the acquisition of business interests by officials of the BIC and the awarding of tenders by the BIC, were proved or found in regard to the BIC. In two instances where former BIC officials acquired irregular business interests, effective action was taken when the top management of the BIC had become aware of it, as was also done in other cases where proof or allegations of irregularity occurred. Your Commission is convinced that the managing director, Dr. Adendorff, and the secretariat of the BIC have at all times diligently endeavoured, and still endeavour, to preserve the unimpeached good name of the BIC at all times.</block>

<p>In my opinion it is no less than fitting that at this point, after the report has been published, the hon. member for Houghton should come and tell us whether she is now satisfied that there is nothing irregular about the management of the BIC or anything connected with the BIC. I think that the officials, viz. Dr. Adendorff and his staff, deserve the highest praise and credit for the sound and able way in which they manage the affairs of the BIC.</p>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the hon. member for Potgietersrus to excuse me if I do not refer to the problems of the BIC. I would rather prefer to leave it to the hon. member for Houghton to do that. I would like to assure him that we on this side of the House definitely appreciate and recognize the need for the BIC and that we are fully aware of the work which it is doing in the Bantu areas. We sincerely hope that it will grow from strength to strength. In this particular regard, I would like to refer to the comments which were made by the hon. member for Tygervallei and also the hon. member for Johannesburg West, when they talked about the work that is being done by the XDC. I was fortunate enough to have been on that trip last year during the recess and I must say that I was impressed with what I saw happening in certain parts <span class="col_5337-5338" refersTo="page_1082"/>of the Ciskei and the Transkei. There is no doubt that the XDC is progressing with the agricultural development of these areas and also in the field of industrial development. I would, however, like to submit that the work that is being done, is really&#x2014;let us face it&#x2014;a flea-bite in comparison with what is developing in South Africa as a whole. If it is this Government&#x2019;s honest intention to use these development corporations to project these Bantu areas into modern industrialized States, so as to make them viable States, I firmly believe that these particular corporations are going to have to be given a lot more support than they have been given in the past and I sincerely hope that this will happen. One thing that bothered me as far as the XDC is concerned was that, with the exception of one business, everywhere we went we found that all the management personnel and most of the people who were doing the planning and the thinking were not Bantu, but were White South Africans. The only person we found that was managing his enterprise, was the manager of a hotel in Umtata. I must say that it was a pleasure to be entertained by this gentleman, to be told what he was doing and also to find that he had travelled overseas to learn about the hotel work in the United States. I think that all members on this side of the House&#x2014;in this party at any rate&#x2014;will agree and sympathize with and support the Government in this particular work. In fact, I believe that I can speak for my colleagues when I say that we sympathize with the hon. members on that side with the problems which they are facing in trying to develop the Bantu homelands and also in trying to solve our urban problems as far as the Bantu are concerned. I would like to assure the hon. members on that side that we on this side of the House are aware of these problems. We are not stupid and there are lots of people on this side of the House who have had experience of having to cope with urban slums, of having to deal with underdeveloped Blacks and of trying to get these people to project themselves into a modern industrial or agricultural community. I would like to assure the hon. the Minister and the hon. members there that we on this side would like to solve these problems which are facing South Africa. However, the only area where we differ is in the matter of direction and of attitude as to how we should go ahead in this particular campaign. We are extremely sympathetic with the hon. the Deputy Minister, who I see has just come in, in the manner in which he expressed himself earlier on today. In fact, if I read the feeling or emotion correctly, I would say that that hon. Deputy Minister is experiencing a great degree of frustration with the problems which he has on his hands at the present time. There are problems not only with the Bantu, but rather with those members of his party who are unable to grasp the problems and the reality of the situation which is facing this hon. Deputy Minister at the present time. I got the feeling towards the latter part of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech that he was not speaking to us, but rather that he was speaking to the other members on his benches &#x2026; [Interjections] &#x2026; especially when he made the comment about the changes that have to come and how South Africans will have to start rubbing shoulders with people in the cinemas and on the streets. The dilemma and frustration which that particular hon. Deputy Minister is facing results, I think, from his inability to come to terms with the feeling of, let us say, another of his colleagues like the hon. the Minister of Labour. I would like to quote from the hon. the Minister of Labour&#x2019;s Hansard when he said on 5 May 1972&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall never allow a White person to work shoulder to shoulder with a non-White person in the same employment situation.</block>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister now if this is one of the things that is frustrating him. Is this the problem which he is running into&#x003F; Is it on his side of the House, because I can assure him that he need not worry about the hon. members on this side of the House. We will support him when it comes to &#x201C;rubbing shoulders&#x201D; with the Blacks in South Africa in order to make a greater South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister also happened to say that he would have to bend the economy in order for South Africa to achieve the objectives which it has to achieve in the near future. I would like to suggest to him that it is not the bending of the economy that <span class="col_5339-5340" refersTo="page_1083"/>has to be done but rather the bending of the Verwoerdian dogma which is hamstringing that particular party. [Interjections.] In fact, I would like to suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he bends it to the point of breaking so that we in South Africa can have a whole new look at the whole problem which is facing us.</p>

<p>I believe this is extremely necessary if we are ever to achieve what the hon. member for Innesdal said we have to achieve in Southern Africa, namely a revolution. I agree with the hon. member for Innesdal that Southern Africa is requiring a type of revolution to project it into the situation where we shall be able to meet the needs and aspirations of all our people. I believe that the hon. member I referred to is correct when he says that a practical and realistic approach is needed to the problems of Black development. That is exactly what we are trying to project here. In order for him to appreciate this&#x2014;I do not think he was here when the hon. member for Pinetown spoke&#x2014;I would like to ask him to read in Hansard the speech which the hon. member for Pinetown made here earlier today.</p>

<p>Until what he said is accepted, we are just skirting around the issue; we are not facing the reality of South Africa. What is the result of this situation which has been created by hon. members on that side&#x003F; The result is petty politics. That is what is going on in South Africa today. We are not facing the real issues which confront us in South Africa at the present time. I honestly believe that we have to face the realities of this situation today. We have to face them as the hon. the Minister has done, but we must go further and do more than what he announced here yesterday. In fact, we find that the Government is now going backwards to 1967. I believe this was to be expected. I am afraid that this Government will have to go backwards before it can go forwards. It has to get rid of a lot of hang-ups which are now out of date. It is a pity that, in so doing, some of the hon. members on that side have to hide their own deficiencies by trying to project our policy in the wrong light. I refer now to the comments of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development on what the hon. member for Umhlatuzana had to say yesterday. I believe he was just setting up a smoke-screen behind which to hide the deficiencies of the National Party&#x2019;s policies in respect of the Bantu.</p>

<p>I have got to know the hon. the Deputy Minister and he is not a fool. He knows our policy. He understands our policy. He knows that our federal policy accepts and can accommodate the ethnic differences of the people in this country. He knows that our federal policy accepts the idea of a self-governing regional community. It also accepts regional self-development and regional self-expression. He knows that this is entrenched in the federal policy of the United Party. He also knows that we are not committed to multiracialism as the Progressive Party is. I believe it is a pity that we have to waste so much time in this House on petty politics. It is a pity we cannot get down to some of the basic problems which are facing us.</p>

<p>I believe hon. members on that side are beginning to think along our lines, although they may not admit it. I would like to refer to an article by the hon. member for Klip River which appeared in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> a few weeks ago. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And who knows, in 50 years, more or less, there might even be progress towards closer federal unity between the various States of Southern Africa.</block>

<p>That is what he said about three weeks ago. I would like to suggest to the hon. member for Klip River that it will not take 50 years. We know what is happening in South Africa. We know that the Government has now gone back to 1967 with respect to home ownership in the Bantu townships. I am quite sure that the verkrampte elements in the benches on the other side are really going to get a shock when they find out what is going to hit them in two to three years time, and it will come largely from the hon. Ministers here because they are beginning to see the truth of what the United Party has been saying all these years. This has got to happen if one considers what is happening on our borders and what happened recently in the Far East and elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>There is one last matter I should like to raise, namely the question of pay discrimination. I should like the hon. the Minister and his deputies to follow the example set by an industry in my constituency. I have a cutting here that states: &#x201C;Black workers get pay boost. Some Africans now earning R348 per month at African <span class="col_5341-5342" refersTo="page_1084"/>Explosives.&#x201D; This is because that company is following the policy of paying the rate for the job. The problem as I see it is within the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own department with some of his own employees. I should like to talk about the present Black manager who is running KwaMakuta township. This township was managed by a White administrative officer who was earning between R5 340 and R7 380 per year. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Amanzimtoti spoke about petty politics. If ever there was a party that has indulged in petty politics over the past 27 years, then it is the United Party. [Interjections.] I just want to refresh the memory of some of those hon. members over there. When we were trying to do something about homeland development those hon. members went to the platteland and spoke about the &#x201C;kafferboetieregering&#x201D;. [Interjections.] That was petty politicking. Those were the petty politics in which they indulged.</p>

<p>*Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to the hon. member for Edenvale. The hon. member for Edenvale spoke of section 10. Having listened to his speech on the provisions of section 10, one is surprised at the change for the worse that has taken place in him, because in 1961, when he adapted radio talks on the provisions of section 10, he still understood the positive connotation of section 10. At that time he still realized that section 10 was in fact aimed at making the Bantu homeland orientated and not city orientated. The conclusion to which the hon. member came in connection with this accurate and positive interpretation of section 10 was (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We can undoubtedly say that by far the greater part of the White population firmly believes that this policy is not only essential for its political and economic survival, but is also based on the principles of right and justice and that the Native population should show proper gratitude in the light of everything the White man has meant and given to them.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Edenvale went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I further make bold to say that if we had carried this philosophy through to its logical conclusion, we would probably not have had such a thing as a Native question today.</block>

<p>This was what the hon. member for Edenvale said in 1961, when he still understood the positive meaning of section 10 and had not been confused by the propaganda of the United Party in this regard. This propaganda has poisoned the real meaning of section 10. For this reason my plea to the hon. the Minister is that he should consider rewriting section 10 so that the Bantu will understand that section 10 does not give him those few rights to which the hon. member referred, but that section 10 makes him homeland orientated. He should realize that he is a citizen of the homeland and not of White South Africa. At this stage he is really to some extent not making proper use of the provisions of section 10, and this is due to the type of propaganda and arguments used by hon. members of the Opposition.</p>

<p>When we speak of the urban Bantu, it is important that we emphasize the good work being done by the Bantu Administration Boards. While the population increase has been so phenomenal, particularly in the five growth points, and where we speak of a growth factor of 6% for the whole country one can really say that the growth factor in the urban growth points is round about 20%. This is why the work of the Bantu Administration Boards is so important, and this is why it is in the interests of everyone, White as well as Black, to regard the urban Bantu boards as a great connecting factor, as a bridge which can be built between White and Black in South Africa. Sir, where I am concerned with the Bantu Administration Board for the East Rand, one of the two major Bantu Administration Boards, I think that some emphasis should be laid on what this board is able to achieve. I think, for example, of its budget for this year, which amounts to more than R41 million in round figures. Very few local authorities have a budget of this magnitude. Expressed in percentages, these two special grade boards, the East Rand Board and the West Rand Board, control 21% of the total number of Bantu in White South Africa, 36% of the Bantu in White urban areas, <span class="col_5343-5344" refersTo="page_1085"/>39% of the total operating revenue of all 22 boards, and 29% of the White population of South Africa lives within these areas. Sir, I just want to outline to you what this board does in various spheres of the community. I think, for example, of schools, where this board is jointly responsible for the erection of schools within its area of jurisdiction. From a careful survey conducted there it has appeared that there are 1 541 class-rooms in the area at present and that there is a shortage of 394 class-rooms at the moment. In the course of this year, the Bantu Administration Board of the East Rand will be spending R500 000, in round figures, on supplying additional class-rooms.</p>

<p>As far as accommodation is concerned, they are budgeting for an expenditure of more than R2 million in the new financial year on accommodation for single Bantu persons. Two old locations, Charterston and Payneville, have been evacuated without any fanfare and the inhabitants have been peacefully resettled in Dunduze and Kwa Thema respectively. In addition, satisfactory progress is being made with the removal of the Brakpan location. Sir, I want to comment these boards very highly for the good work they are doing in order to implement our policy successfully. They are also helping the farmers to build decent housing for Bantu farm labourers. Sir, R1 million is being spent on the provision of electricity this year; this is a matter which must receive serious consideration in the fight against air pollution. But, Sir, I am coming to another very important factor in the activities of the East Rand Bantu Administration Board, and this is the assistance it is rendering in the establishment of Leboa-Ghomo. An amount of R4&#x00BC; million is being appropriated this year for the continuation of the Leboa-Ghomo project. The access road from Zebediela is being tarred. Water and sewerage services for a further 2 000 residential plots are already being completed there. The necessary steps are being taken to finance the provision of 20,45 million litres of water a day from the Olifants River, for which permission was recently granted. Sir, the hon. member for Amanzimtoti described the work already completed as &#x201C;flea-bites&#x201D;, but does he realize that this city which is growing near Pietersburg will be twice as big as Pietersburg&#x003F; More than R100 million is going to be spent on the establishment of Leboa-Ghomo, 360 000 people will be housed there in a total number of 72 000 houses. When this city, which is being built on the area of 18 farms, has been completed, it will possess 120 primary schools, 80 higher primary schools, 20 secondary schools, eight high schools, 20 community centres, 40 trade centres and 20 academic buildings. Sir, this is only one project which is under way in one homeland. How much more tremendous a project it is when one sees it in the light of all the homelands which are being developed to the same extent! [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. A. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the hon. member for Brakpan rightly said, one almost concluded from the speech of the hon. member for Amanzimtoti, when he spoke of &#x201C;flea-bites&#x201D;, that unduly disparaging remarks are still being made about the set-up and the development in the homelands.</p>

<p>This morning we had another performance by the hon. member for Bryanston. He wanted to speak for the whole South Africa, and one got the impression that he would do so in his capacity as the temporary, acting, assistant deputy leader of that party. What one could infer from his speech was that he advocated a White area, Black areas and mixed areas. I think it is time he realized that it is simply a fact that there is already total political separation in South Africa. That is an accomplished fact. Total geographic separation of the Bantu homelands has already been mapped out and is in the process of being finalized. The separation of the various peoples has already been accomplished, and it is no use for him to keep moaning about it any longer, because this Government will persevere in the course it has adopted.</p>

<p>I should like to express a few thoughts about the set-up of the department. This department is really a public service within a public service. In actual fact it handles and administers everything which is dealt with in terms of national economy. The set-up of this department is particularly interesting. It is divided into what I want to call four main sections: firstly, Bantu affairs administration; secondly, homeland affairs; thirdly, departmental administration; and fourthly, finance. These sections are not suspended in a vacuum, but deal with practical matters every day.</p>

<p><span class="col_5345-5346" refersTo="page_1086"/>I want to refer in particular to one main section of the department, the one which deals with homeland affairs. Apart from a section for political planning, there are five branches in this particular main section which deal with, firstly, development work; secondly, homeland territories; thirdly, community affairs; fourthly, agricultural advisory services; and fifthly, ethnologists. I shall give a brief analysis of the various branches. In the branch dealing with development work there are seven subsections: firstly, civil engineering services; secondly, electrotechnical and mechanical services; thirdly, surveying services; fourthly, agricultural services; fifthly, quantity surveying services; sixthly, town planning services; and in the seventh place, drawing services. The branch dealing with homeland territories has two main sections, the first being planning with a metropolitan and regional planner, and two subsections, namely area planning and area potential. The second main section deals with land matters, with a subsection for land tenure. The third branch is community affairs, and this has three sections, namely (1) political development, with subsections for Bantu authorities and homeland liaison; (2) social development; and (3) health services. The fourth branch is known as the directorate for agricultural advisory services, and this covers economics and marketing, extension services and training, crop production and livestock production. This is apart from the work which is done by the BIC, the XDC, the Bantu Mining Corporation, etc.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it is clear that in all facets of a national economy the department is supplying guidance, training and advice which will enable a homeland to be truly self-sufficient, so that when it achieves full independence, it will really be able to operate on its own. In this way, as progress is made, services are continually being transferred for which the homelands accept full responsibility. It must also be kept in mind that there is not only one homeland, but eight, each of which is in a different stage of development. The homelands are not all progressing to the same extent; their needs also differ. Each one has its own priorities and, of course, each homeland government is sharing to an increasing extent in the development of its area. Every day the department creates and constructs in a positive way, in the process of withdrawal as well. Although the Whites are being withdrawn, advice and information remain available. Matters are not taken up to a point and then just left in the air as happened in other African areas.</p>

<p>I want to refer in particular this afternoon to the important tasks performed by the officials on the various levels of this department. We keep hearing from the other side of the House that there is not enough consultation with the Black people. Almost 90% of the department&#x2019;s activities must consist of advisory services, and precisely on the basis of consultation. It is not being done by way of instructions, but by way of guidance and advice. Every day our officials are engaged in some form of consultation in the various fields. Every day consultation takes place between the officials of the department and those of the homelands. There is constant interaction between the officials of the department and those of the homelands. This consultation penetrates to all levels of the national economy. It reaches the individual in the homelands and is of value to him. It does not only reach the homeland governments or the officials, but directly or indirectly it reaches every member of the population. I firmly believe that great appreciation should be expressed to the officials, not only for the work they do, but also for the way in which they promote the relations between people and nations and for the way in which they help to train people, to prepare and advise them, so that they may be able in time to govern their own countries quite independently. They also help to make each person in a homeland a full and economically active citizen of his country. Guidance is continually being given to those who ask for it. The best people are obtained to guide these people. More and more in&#x002D;service training is taking place to enable the people to replace the White man in their areas in the future. In respect of ordinary staff, various courses are offered regularly, and these are followed by others, so that their value may not be lost. The people are not left to their own devices, but are trained in the skills which will enable them to accept and to practise self-determination in the full sense of the word. In fact, there is permanent consultation, to use that word. We are satisfied, too, that these attempts are producing results. The growing enthusiasm of the Black man for his country can no longer be <span class="col_5347-5348" refersTo="page_1087"/>suppressed and pride in his own heritage has already become a source of great inspiration to the Black man. In this way, as we have heard from other hon. members as well this afternoon, we may look at the results which appear from the annual reports of the department, of the BIC and XDC.</p>

<p>The homelands and the Black people may rest assured that they will always be able to depend on the advice and the guidance of this Government, as in the past, and that they have and will always have a reliable adviser in this Government and its officials.</p>

<p>I wish to deal primarily with one of the classic ideological snarl-ups caused by the policy of separate development. This classic situation occurred in my constituency, and being severally critical of it does not mean that I am playing petty politics. It was one of those classic snarl-ups involving three departments, the Department of Community Development, the Department of Planning and the Environment and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>This classic snarl-up involved the proclamation of the Fingo village in Grahamstown, one of the last areas of freehold for Blacks in South Africa, as a Coloured group area, and the apparent subsequent planning of a new Bantu township at Committee&#x2019;s Drift some 32 km from Grahamstown. The proclamation of the Fingo village came with Machiavellian timing, in the middle of a crucial by-election which I was fighting against a member of the Government party, when the constituency was not represented in Parliament and without consultation with any of the people involved, except a handful of misguided city councillors who hoped that by playing ball with the Government, the Governmental goose would lay the proverbial golden egg. These people bitterly regret their actions today. On being elected with an increased majority. I found that the web of interdepartmental red tape and legislation had created a puzzle so wrapped in enigma and disguised by ideological rigidity that it was almost impossible to comprehend in relation to the Fingo village and its proclamation as a Coloured group area. There are no legal means, once a Black area has been declared for another race, to redress a wrong which has obviously been done. I agree that there are faults in the Fingo village. I agree that there were slums in Grahamstown; I also agree that there was a shortage of housing in Grahamstown; but the fact is that the building of new houses in Grahamstown location and the Grahamstown area was frozen by this Government in 1961 and not a house has been built since. Having reached this impasse, we began to get reports of the proposed model town at Committee&#x2019;s Drift and the people of the Fingo village, the people in Grahamstown and the Ciskeian Government became concerned and began making representations, originally through Dr. Koornhof, <span class="col_5349-5350" refersTo="page_1088"/>the then Deputy Minister in charge of townships, and subsequently through the hon. Punt Janson, who took over from him. The former visited Committee&#x2019;s Drift and the Fingo village and just as he was beginning to see how tragically impracticable the whole scheme was, Mr. Janson took over from him in a Cabinet reshuffle. Mr. Janson was twice prevented by circumstances from visiting these areas, and just as he was becoming sympathetically and realistically involved in the situation, having announced a review of the whole matter, he was relieved of the responsibility for new townships and the hon. W. M. Cruywagen was appointed in his place. Mr. Cruywagen almost immediately became seriously ill, and I cannot blame him for that. During his illness it was announced in the Press that the Committee&#x2019;s Drift township would be proceeded with and that R2 million had been voted for this purpose in the current financial year. I sincerely hope that this hon. Deputy Minister will come and visit this site before beginning to spend this amount. I can state categorically&#x2014;and I know a little about road building and bridge building because I have served on bodies that do this sort of job&#x2014; that this amount of R2 million will not build a decent road with proper bridges even halfway to the site of the proposed township. I doubt whether it will be sufficient to build a bridge capable of carrying commuter traffic over the Fish River alone. Without an adequate road and bridge link with the main Grahamstown/Fort Beaufort road, the construction costs at Committee&#x2019;s Drift will be trebled and the costs were estimated last year at R48 million (Hansard, vol. 53, col. 43). Where is the industrial area which, it was alleged would be planned at Committee&#x2019;s Drift in a letter written at the direction of Dr. the hon. P. G. J. Koornhof on 3 March 1972&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Planning and the Environment knew nothing about that when questioned by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central in August 1974. This can be checked in Hansard, vol. 53, col. 47. Where are the rights under section 10 of Act 25 of 1945, which are spoken of so glibly in this same letter written under his direction&#x003F; The Deputy Minister, the hon. Punt Janson had forgotten them on 13 August 1974. When asked by me who would be moved to Committee&#x2019;s Drift, he replied (Hansard, vol. 53, col. 42)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Bantu residents of the Fingo location, industrial workers of Grahamstown and families from Port Elizabeth and its environs.</block>

<p>Most of the people in the Fingo location, and most of the industrial workers in Grahamstown, have rights under section 10. Does this mean nothing and must they be moved&#x003F; The letter concluded by stating that the Bantu would be happier living in the area of their own government and thus enjoying the rights not afforded them in the White areas. Whom did the hon. doctor consult&#x003F; No Fingo villager will be happier at Committee&#x2019;s Drift. The Chief Minister of the Ciskei is totally opposed to this scheme as is his representative in Grahamstown. So too are all thinking White people in Grahamstown. Furthermore, the hon. the Minister announced similar rights in the White areas yesterday. This is going to make these people even more unhappy to move. It has been proved by means of questions put in the House that this is bureaucratic and unilateral departmental planning of the worst possible kind as it is obvious that no other departments were consulted before the planning of this township. There are two options open to the Government. Either they scrap the Committee&#x2019;s Drift scheme and build the minimum requirements of 3 000 houses at Grahamstown immediately or they must commit themselves unequivocally to spending at least R200 million within the next two or three years to create the necessary infrastructures and industrial development at Committees and Grahamstown. Without this the scheme is utterly worthless and can be dumped on the dumping ground of ideology.</p>

<p>However, to return to the report which was tabled so timeously, I want to say that I note on page 16 under the heading &#x201C;Ciskei&#x201D; that the drafting of a socio-economic plan of the Ciskei is to be undertaken by Prof. Page of the University of Stellenbosch. I have nothing against either the professor or the university. They have done excellent studies in regard to the Coloured people. They do very good socio-economic studies. However, we have an adequate university in Grahamstown and we have an adequate university in Port Elizabeth and there is a Bantu university serving the Ciskei and the <span class="col_5351-5352" refersTo="page_1089"/>Transkei. I want to mention that Rhodes University at Grahamstown had a very eminent economist at the head of its department, Prof. Hobart-Houghton, who served on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Advisory Council and who drew up many papers on the socio&#x002D;economics of the Ciskei and particularly on the Fingo village and Committee&#x2019;s Drift. He was succeeded in that department by an extremely able young man who is now a Senator, none other than Prof. Denis Worrall. Let us give these jobs to the people in the closest proximity to the problems. Let us give them the chance; they also have the ability and the desire to serve South Africa.</p>

<p>Also under the heading &#x201C;Ciskei&#x201D; on page 17 of the report, I note this&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, although I am rising to speak now, I shall probably not be able to discuss all the matters I should like to discuss, and the rest will simply have to stand over until Monday. Consequently I only want to discuss certain aspects now, aspects which have been raised so far in the debate. Right at the outset I want to say that for two reasons it is very easy to reply to this debate. The first is that apart from a few extravagant statements here and there on the opposite side, the tone of the debate in general was far more pleasant and perhaps even far more constructive than it has been in the past. This applies to both sides of the House. Perhaps this was because my hon. friend, the hon. member for Griqualand East, did not speak first. I do not know what the reason was which played such an important part on the opposite side.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member should wait just a moment. However, there is a second reason as well. This time, a little differently to the procedure I have adopted on previous occasions, I concentrated on every hon. member on our side and tried to write down the essence of his speech in a few sentences. Apart from the three Deputy Ministers who participated in the debate and who naturally, as very competent people, made very positive contributions which I do not even wish to comment on, 13 other hon. members on our side have up to now participated in the debate. Each of those 13 speeches was a positive speech in that the activities relating to the vast programme we have to carry out were spelt out to this House and to the public in general in each speech. It was a splendid contribution from this side which, as I have said, spelt out our work and alleviated my task and that of the Deputy Ministers because it is not necessary for us to say the same thing over again. I have here a long list of things I wrote down, but to save time, I am not going into details, since I assume that hon. members listened to the hon. members on our side who spoke. In each of these speeches, from that of the hon. member for Lichtenburg, who began, to that of the very last member, the hon. member for Klerksdorp&#x2014;incidentally, while I am mentioning his name, I want to say that I am very fond of Klerksdorp since one of my children is there, although that is not the only reason, but I want to say thank you very much to the hon. member, before I perhaps forget, for the fine words about and references to my department. I can testify that every official of the department deserves every word of appreciation which the hon. member expressed for the department. Unfortunately the Opposition did not achieve the same standard today as far as the contributions of individual members were concerned, although there were individual contributions on the opposite side of the House to which one could listen and from which something constructive could perhaps result. I want to refer at once to the first speech made by the hon. member for Edenvale&#x2014;not to his second speech. The hon. member&#x2019;s second speech was on the wrong wavelength.</p>

<p>The third one will probably be below ground. The first speech was useful and good, but the second one, I fear, was not. Then, too, there is the tragic case of the young member for whom I feel <span class="col_5353-5354" refersTo="page_1090"/>very sorry, precisely because he is young. One was waiting to see what his potential would be, but the speech made by the hon. member for Amanzimtoti a moment ago was merely one great bombastic spate of words; that was all it was. [Interjections.] It was exaggerated political sentimentalism.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words with reference to the speech made by my hon. friend, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. This hon. member raised quite a few matters which speakers on this side of the House have in fact already dealt with. However, I should like to refer more specifically to two aspects of his speech.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Umhlatuzana as well as a few other hon. members on the other side had much to say in connection with our departmental report which was available yesterday or the day before. [Interjections.] All right, yesterday; I accept it. I already had mine before yesterday. [Interjections.] Well, make it today, if it suits the hon. members better. I wish to point out that this is a most important report on the activities of a very, very big department, as the hon. member for Klerksdorp has pointed out. Hon. members must realize that for the report to be a meaningful one, the department accepted that the figures which should go into this report, should be for the period under review. That means that everything concerning the whole financial year should be included. It is of no use publishing a report very soon after the financial year has ended, if it does not include vitally important statistics. The report contains financial and other statistics which usually are not available until after it has been audited and not before permission is given for the closing of the books. That comes about approximately in July or August, after the financial year has come to an end. I inquired about these matters and am not talking just out of the air. In addition the report contains a summary of homeland development. We had to get information from all the various homelands including those in South West Africa for this purpose. It takes quite a while to get that information, because these people also have to wait for certain statistics and particulars to become available. The department has also attempted to improve the appearance of the report and will in future always endeavour, as was the case in the past, to expedite the publication bearing in mind the foregoing facts which I have given and also remembering that a period of about two months is needed to translate the report and another month or more to print it. The hon. members on the other side must make provision for these matters. Nevertheless, I can give the assurance that from our side we wish to do as much as possible to expedite the appearance of the report because it is an important report.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I say, Mr. Chairman, it must be appreciated that Bantu persons are allowed in the White homeland to do work which they can do here and not because they have equal claims with Whites to be present here. That was written by the hon. member for Edenvale when he was still a professor <span class="col_5355-5356" refersTo="page_1091"/>many years ago. It was written in a brochure which I have here.</p>

<p>I proceed. Conversely, the same principle applies to Whites in the Bantu homelands. Equally, they are not there because they have equal claims with the Bantu persons. In so far as the Bantu have been admitted into the White areas for employment, provision has therefore been made for the separate Bantu communities with due allowance for their ties with their own nations and homelands and for the well-known different ways of life. The Bantu persons who have been admitted into the White areas are here in terms of our policy of separate development. They are secondarily here in the White areas in an unattached or a casual capacity.</p>

<p>No. That is to say, of their incorporation as equals in a common society or context. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Green Point may put his question later. In the same way those Whites who render important services to the Bantu in the Bantu homelands are not permanently placed in a position of equality with the Bantu in one context. Instead, suitable Bantu are systematically trained and assisted to reach the topmost positions in all the areas affected and to replace the Whites there. There can therefore be no question of discrimination because a distinction made between people who do not have identical claims in a particular area constitutes differentiation and not discrimination.</p>

<p>After all, discrimination means making a distinction between people who have identical claims in one and the same context. Something along the same lines was written some years ago by my hon. friend on the other side, the hon. member for Edenvale when he was still a professor at Stellenbosch.

<p>They can do so in their own homelands. In fact, many of them have done so already. However, in terms of our policy they are not allowed to do so here.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to return to the question that was asked. The question was: Are the Bantu permanently in the White areas&#x003F; As I said just now, it will be very superficial simply to reply &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Against the background of what I said just now, it is very clear that Bantu persons in the White areas are secondary to the Whites. [Interjections.] Also, as I said just now, they are here in a casual capacity. Therefore Bantu persons as groups are not permanently connected with our White area. Bantu persons cannot therefore enjoy all the rights of permanency in the White area as these apply to the Whites. Therefore, although it may be so, and we accept it, that there will always be Bantu persons in the White area&#x2014;of course, not always the same individuals&#x2014;it will not be on the same basis as the Whites who as a group are definitely permanently connected with this, our White area. In principle, of course, the same thing applies to the Whites in the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have said these things many times before. Many of the hon. members on this side have also said them. What I should like to see is that hon. members opposite understand these things properly. There is a mistake which my dear friend, the hon. member for Umhlatuzana, makes every year. I have told him this before. The hon. member does not do what the hon. member for Houghton tried to do yesterday, viz. to argue with us in terms of the outlines of our policy. Fundamentally the thinking of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana is integrationistic throughout, and then he calls us to account because certain things which have to take place in terms of his integrationistic approach are not taking place. Sir, these things have to happen in terms of our approach of multi-national development. I said in parentheses a moment ago that the hon. member for Edenvale, in earlier years, displayed this same kind of approach in his writings. The hon. member should simply be prepared now to accept responsibility for the things he was responsible for earlier. For example I can quote from a Sabra publication, of which he was a member. Sir, I have never in my whole life, before I entered politics or since, and particularly since I have been working in this Ministry, said that the Bantu are temporary people here. But what did the hon. member for Edenvale write&#x003F; [Interjections.] Yes, I say that they are here in a casual capacity. The hon. member for Edenvale wrote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Outside the Bantu areas, the Bantu is only a temporary inhabitant who cannot claim permanent rights of any nature.</block>

<p>Sir, it sounds as if I took my words of this afternoon from him. This is the hon. member who now thinks the opposite. It reminds me of what happened when the late Gen. Smuts said something in the course of a speech in the Eastern Transvaal. A person stood up and asked him: &#x201C;But, General, you said so-and-so today, and last year you said the opposite somewhere else. General, in all fondness, did you lie today&#x003F;&#x201D; Gen. Smuts&#x2019;s reply to him was that: &#x201C;My dear friend, who says I was not lying last year&#x003F;&#x201D; Now I wonder whether the hon. member was telling the truth today or whether he was telling the truth in 1953. What standpoint does the hon. member wish me to accept as his real standpoint&#x2014;this standpoint of 1953, or the standpoint which he is adopting in this year of Our Lord&#x003F; Sir, I have quite a number of the writings of the hon. member here&#x2014;useful writings, as well as writings on discrimination and land tenure and matters of that kind.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I now want to reply to certain points which were raised in the course of the debate by hon. members here. I think the hon. member for Umhlatuzana may be satisfied now that I have replied properly to his question.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I want to reply to just one point raised by the hon. member for Houghton. She raised the question of the rights of Bantu <span class="col_5359-5360" refersTo="page_1093"/>women in South Africa. In this connection she referred to the Natal Code and to the position of Bantu women in the other provinces.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but that is the only point to which I would like to refer. Other hon. members on this side have already dealt with the other points. Perhaps I could come back again to these points on a later occasion. Sir, I have said before and I want to say again that the question of the status and the rights of Bantu women is a matter for the Bantu nations and the Bantu Governments themselves. I am not going to define the rights of the Bantu women. That is a matter for the Bantu chiefs, the Bantu tribes and the Bantu Governments. They all have their own Governments. It is for the Bantu Governments to make their own legislation with regard to the status and the rights of Bantu women in South Africa.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Jeppe had a good deal to say about the greater powers which the boards should have, the boards which the Bantu elect in the urban areas such as Soweto. For a long time the hon. member was a leading member of the Johannesburg City Council. That is where I met him for the first time, in the Johannesburg city hall, when he was a member of the Non-White Affairs Committee. Subsequently he became mayor, a bigwig, but the hon. member was probably, I think&#x2014;I am speaking under correction, because I cannot remember in which years it was now&#x2014;still a member of the City Council when the Urban Bantu Councils Act had already become law in 1961.</p>

<p>Oh, but other loyal companions of the hon. member remained behind.

</speech>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Please keep quiet now. The urban Bantu council of Johannesburg has just found its feet, and yet attention is already being given to these matters. The question has also been put in this regard, I think, <i>inter alia,</i> by the hon. member himself. During the conference of leaders we merely raised this point, and the Bantu had in fact thought of it. This is a very drastic and perhaps even a difficult process, but we are now devoting attention to it, together with the Bantu. Naturally the Government will consult them in this regard to see to what extent it is possible to reform the council system which exists in the White areas for the Bantu, so that the urban Bantu council and the councils of deputies, i.e. the councils which the Government representatives may establish, could perhaps be united into a council with other and more powers in the White area. But this is a matter which will require time, and we shall give attention to it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Edenvale was quite constructive in his first speech and he enumerated matters to which we could give our attention. <i>Inter alia</i> he mentioned the question of financing for housing for Bantu who wish to build their own homes on the land which belongs to the local authority. This is an important point and we shall certainly give attention to it. Actually it goes without saying. I may just say here, by way of interruption, that I should really like this matter to be rectified. Yesterday I took a great deal of trouble to state the matter as precisely as possible. It deals with the possession of houses on the land which belongs to the local authorities. Now, I have already been reading in certain newspapers this morning, and I heard it over the radio, and people have been telephoning me and have been making inquiries and saying that mention is now being made of possession of property. Sir, the word &#x201C;property&#x201D; is a dangerous word to use, for it is as all-embracing as God&#x2019;s mercy; it includes everything. Therefore, do let us define these things precisely. It is not that hon. member who made the mistake. I am speaking in general now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vryheid put a question to me in regard to the political parties in KwaZulu. He asked whether I could throw any light on the reports which he had read to the effect that the Government of KwaZulu, under the leadership of Captain Gatsha Buthelezi, had asked us to play our part and contribute our share in a proclamation being drawn up, or in legislation being introduced by them, to prohibit <span class="col_5361-5362" refersTo="page_1094"/>political parties among the Zulu people. I caused the matter to be discussed with them and also replied to that in writing, and I should like to quote the relevant portion of my letter here to demonstrate what our standpoint in that regard was, i.e. the request of the Zulus to the effect that at this stage already, even before they have held an election there&#x2014;and to my mind there is also a little uncertainty here as to why they do not want to hold the election now&#x2014;they want to prohibit political parties. At present, of course, one other political party, as far as I know, has already been established there. I wrote the following in my reply to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The formation of political parties and the participation by the people in the activities of such parties, are natural corrolaries of democracy and are tolerated in all democratic countries except in so far as a particular party or particular activity may be subversive of duly constituted authority, and it is not alleged that such a situation has arisen in KwaZulu. It should be pointed out that the holding of free elections, of which the chief executive councillor has often spoken, is hardly reconcilable with the banning or control of political parties in general.</block>

<block name="quote">In the circumstances the hon. the Minister cannot accede to the request.</block>

<p>I think that all the hon. members in this House&#x2014;it seems to me with the exception of one perhaps&#x2014;will agree with me that it was right that I did not want to help to prohibit political parties, which were not going to be subversive, in the Zulu area. I would not want to do this in any Bantu homeland, for I think that our tradition is a democratic one. Even our Western democracy can be adapted beneficially to the Bantu democracy, as this developed traditionally among them. We have proved this in the Transkei in particular.</p>

<p>Then I want to correct the hon. member for Edenvale a little as far as section 10 of the Bantu (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act is concerned. The hon. member referred to this in his second speech. He was discussing section 10 and he ostensibly warned us about this. Now I want to warn him in turn. The hon. member might as well read section 10 again, although he has probably read it many times in his life.</p>

<p>Yes, I know that, and I am not going to argue about it. He probably quoted it more often to students than this Opposition has alleged that I have adopted a pedantic attitude towards them. Section 10 is not a section which grants civil rights to people, for if it had granted civil rights, why should these be granted only to people in prescribed areas and not to people living in urban areas which could be larger than the prescribed areas, and why not to the people in the entire magisterial district, which could be even larger&#x003F; Why then only in prescribed areas&#x003F; Section 10 deals with one matter, and one matter only, viz. a concession and a large-scale exemption from influx control on certain conditions. That is what section 10 is. I have told the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other hon. members before, and I am doing so again, that if they continue to present section 10 as though it grants civil rights, then they are provoking us into a fundamental reconsideration of section 10.</p>

<p>It makes no difference what kind of &#x201C;dadigheid&#x201D; it is. It is in any event not complicity (<i>aandadigheid</i>) in the destruction of White authority, as the hon. member advocates.</p>

<p>I should like to compliment the hon. member for Tygervallei on the splendid reference to the activities of the XDC. The hon. member, together with other hon. members, acquired a knowledge of the activities of the XDC, and he also referred in very fine words to the XDC exhibit at the Rand Easter Show. I saw this myself on Monday, and I can inform the hon. members that it was really first-rate. I also want to associate myself with everything the hon. member said in congratulating them.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me a question, in my opinion quite a good question, relating to events at this time. He asked what is happening in regard to independence for the Transkei, which they have requested. <span class="col_5363-5364" refersTo="page_1095"/>A preparatory framework has been constructed in regard to independence. In addition a working committee has been constituted which consists of three persons appointed by us and three persons appointed by the Transkei. It is under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development. A substitute was appointed for the chairman, if that should be necessary.</p>

<p>This committee is working on a full-time basis on all the preparation which is required, for example, preparations in respect of constitutional matters which have to be cleared up, preparations in respect of physical services which have to be there, and preparations in respect of treaties which will have to be concluded between the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the Government of the Transkei. The individual members of this committee are proceeding with their work. On the basis of what the Secretary has told me, they have already had formal sessions. I think they will soon have another formal session in Umtata. In this constellation of preparations, provision has also been made for what we called a joint ministerial committee, to deal with certain fundamental and important matters. That committee consists of the hon. the Prime Minister as the chairman and convenor, and I myself, on our part. On the part of the Transkei there is the chief minister of the Transkei, and I think his brother. Minister George Matanzima. These are the four people who are serving on this ministerial committee.</p>

<p>I can inform the hon. members that I have already, during the past few days, been in contact with the Transkei. Arrangements are being made for a meeting. This will be the first meeting of this ministerial committee, after the provisional talks which we held on ministerial level. It is hoped that this meeting will take place in August. Through the hon. the Prime Minister and I myself on the one hand, and Mr. Kaiser Matanzima and Minister George Matanzima on the other, fundamental matters in regard to independence will be gone into. I do not think it is desirable or necessary for me to comment at this stage on specific matters in regard to independence, because these are matters which are to be dealt with jointly by the Transkei and us. I should prefer to say something at a subsequent opportunity about the questions asked by the hon. member for Johannesburg West and other members.</p>

<p>I now want to confine myself to what was said by the last member who spoke on the opposite side, the hon. member for Albany, in regard to Fingo Town and Committee&#x2019;s Drift. I just want to tell the hon. member that he is not making any impression, apart from an extremely ridiculous impression, when he comes forward with such fantastic figures here, for example that one requires R200 million just for the infrastructure at Committee&#x2019;s Drift. He must not come here and tell me things like that. I have not only &#x201C;heard&#x201D; of one town which has to be built, I have dealt with more than 100 as Minister for 14 years. Therefore the hon. member should not come and tell us things like that. The infrastructure has to be established. We know that. However, there is not a town in South Africa, from Johannesburg, from Cape Town, our oldest city, down to our youngest town, which began with an infrastructure. This had to be established for all of them. Does the hon. member think Jan van Riebeeck found an infrastructure here in Cape Town when he arrived here &#x2014;beautifully lit streets and everything&#x003F; The hon. member must not be crazy. Those are crazy ideas.</p>

The hon. member himself described Fingo Town as a slum area, and it is a slum area. We know that. The hon. member said this is the only place in our country where these people still have freehold. That is not the case. All the Bantu homelands are full of examples of people who have freehold. He probably means in the White area.</p>

Whether he wishes to reside where he will have freehold or wishes to do something else with it, is his own choice. The second thing I want to make very clear to the hon. member is that we will not cause anyone who will have to leave Fingo Town to lose his legitimate work in Grahamstown. We do not want to cause anyone to lose his work. That is one of the reasons why the closest possible place is being sought for the alternative town so that, when they are living there, they can still travel to work every day. It is for that reason that a place is being sought where they can live with their families so that there need be no separation of families.</p>

I have said this time without number, also in reply to the misrepresentations made in regard to many of the people who were at Dimbaza, Sada, Madikwe, Lime Hill and many other places. People who are dependent and who are not working, are resettled, but the people who are working in Grahamstown, will not, with the removal, be deprived of their work. The hon. member should not, in his zeal to achieve certain objectives, make representations in regard to such basic facts, misrepresentations which could irritate people and could antagonize them unnecessarily.</p>

I myself had an appointment with the Government of the Ciskei to discuss this question with them, but then certain unforeseen duties or matters kept me in Cape Town and it was not possible for me to keep the appointment.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, yesterday the hon. the Deputy Minister referred to the agricultural potential of the Bantu homelands and emphasized that the homelands had a vast potential. I fully agree with him on that score. The hon. the Deputy Minister added that those inhabitants of the homelands who were not agriculturists should preferably settle in towns rather than occupy agricultural land which could otherwise be more productively utilized. With that, too, I am in full agreement. If we bear in mind that there is an acute world food shortage and that the annual population increase in the Republic alone was 3,06% for the period 1960 to 1970, as against an increase of 2% in the world population, then it is very clear that no agricultural land that can be effectively utilized, may be allowed to remain unproductive.</p>

<p>I want to mention the existing production, the potential for the future and the development that has already taken place in the field of agriculture as far as the homelands are concerned. The homelands have a vast potential which contribute greatly towards their own economy and towards their provision for their own people. Statistics concerning the potential of all homelands are not available, but I want to mention two examples, namely Transkei and KwaZulu. According to calculations, 15% of the arable surface of the Transkei can produce 5 220 kg of maize, 33% of it can produce 3 690 kg per hectare whereas 52% has a potential of 2 070 kg per hectare. This compares very well with the best arable land in the White areas. In fact, I think it is almost better. At present, unfortunately the average yield is still only 446,6 kg per ha. As a whole, the Transkei has a production potential of 526 860 metric tons as against the present production of <span class="col_5367-5368" refersTo="page_1097"/>193 721 metric tons. Sorghum production is estimated at a potential of 19 530 metric tons as against the present production of 5 135 metric tons. This is the position as regards the Transkei.</p>

<p>As far as KwaZulu is concerned, the present potential and the calculated potential are as follows&#x2014;I am combining all the branches, viz. animal production, sugar, field husbandry, fruit, vegetables, forestry and fibre: The revenue per annum amounts to R17,1 million as against a calculated potential of R100,7 million. For years a great deal of attention has been given to the planning of agriculture in the homelands. Anyone who knew the homelands 15 years ago can attest to the dramatic progress that has been made with projects very closely connected with this, e.g. soil rehabilitation, soil conservation, the orderly settlement of people, the establishment of an agricultural infrastructure, <i>inter alia</i> the erection of fences, the provision of water, dipping troughs&#x2014;there are too many to mention. After 1966, when the programme of soil rehabilitation had already been largely concluded, a great deal was done to develop the agricultural infrastructure. Already in 1973, 52 000 km of grass strips had been planted, 7 700 km of contour walls and weirs had been built and 105 344 km of fencing erected. For years, too, intensive attention has been given to extension and training of Bantu farmers. This is a cardinal point, because it serves as proof that this Government is prepared to do what it says it will do. We are not prepared to create the homelands and put farmers there without their knowing how to farm. Thus it can be mentioned, for example, that in 1974 the number of agricultural extension officers in the homelands was 1 008. Today there are already five homelands with agricultural colleges, at which, for the most part, extension officers are trained. Regular courses for farmers are offered and there is tremendous interest on the part of the local communities. The degree of utilization of the arable land in dry land farming in the homelands has increased from 54% in 1968 to 76,7% in 1974. Furthermore, 24 683 ha of irrigation land has already been established in the homelands with an extensive production potential. It is unnecessary for me to say what irrigation land is worth today. In fact it is priceless. I want to refer to the KwaMata scheme in the Transkei which, on completion, will comprise 3 566 ha and on which 1 177 farmers have already been settled. The scheme will cost a total of R8,2 million. I could continue in this way and mention one irrigation scheme after another. Among other things, an irrigation scheme in the Klein Letaba River, which will eventually comprise 6 500 ha, is at present being planned for Gazankulu. Particular attention is also being given to the establishment of agricultural co-operatives, of which there were already 28 in 1973, and also to the establishment of the necessary marketing channels and facilities. For example, I could mention that the establishment of auction pens to assist these people has resulted in the revenue rising from R1,7 million in 1959 to R5,8 million in 1973. Particular attention is being given to the creation of credit facilities in order to make it possible for the Bantu to develop their farming enterprises. The investment corporations, viz. the BIC and the XDC, are major contributors in this regard. I could just mention that in 1973-&#x2019;74 the budgeted expenditure of the agricultural divisions of the two Corporations mentioned came to R2 131 million. For 1974-&#x2019;75 it already amounts to R8,9 million. In view of the vast potential of the homelands it is realistic to expect that the Corporations&#x2019; activities on this level will soon make a comprehensive contribution towards increasing agricultural production in the homelands. Since local communities are constantly being involved in this dynamic project, it is also becoming possible in this way for employment opportunities to be created for a fairly low investment. I do not doubt, therefore, that the homelands are viable and I want to urge the homeland leaders to seize the opportunities being created for them with both hands and to encourage their people to contribute their share towards South Africa&#x2019;s production, but also towards their own production and their own benefit.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Ladybrand will not take it amiss of me if I do not react to his very interesting speech. I should have liked to do so, but on this occasion I want to give priority to certain remarks which the hon. the Minister has just made here. In the first place, I just want to say that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation of the late appearance of the report is, in fact, unacceptable. If one compares it with <span class="col_5369-5370" refersTo="page_1098"/>the report of the Department of Bantu Education &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, until March 1974. The explanation furnished for the fact that this report was only available 24 hours before this debate is not one which, viewed objectively, is acceptable in the light of the scope of that report, of which I made a very thorough study last night. We can differ on that score, but I am simply unable to accept it.</p>

<p>In the second place, the hon. the Minister said that he had replied effectively to the speech by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. I want to say that in no single respect did the Minister furnish a reply to the difficulty sketched here by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana concerning the inevitable and inexorable urbanization that is going to take place and the implications of that urbanization.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>What he stated here were no visions, but facts. Nor did the hon. the Minister reply to his charge that the policy of independence for the homelands, with the exception of the Transkei and perhaps the Ciskei, have no potential feasibility. The hon. the Minister did not get to that. However, we can elaborate on that later.</p>

<p>As far as the political parties in KwaZulu are concerned, I want to say that I agree with his attitude. I am just very sorry that last year, when we objected here to the powers of detention given to the homeland Governments, the hon. the Minister did not agree with us at that stage that it was a &#x201C;natural corollary of democracy&#x201D; that those powers ought not to be exercised.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Chairman, but that does not apply in the case of the wide powers granted last year in this regard. I am only sorry that the hon. the Minister did not emphasize democracy last year as strongly as he does now.</p>

<p>As far as section 10, to which the hon. member referred, is concerned, I want to say that it has nothing to do with influx control. Section 10 concerns the presence of people in urban areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>But that is news.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>The original section 5 of the Urban Areas Act which became section 10 in 1945 had to do with influx control, but this section 10 has nothing to do with it. It provides for the right of the Bantu to remain in an urban area for longer than 72 hours without a permit. That is what it means. That is the difference between the old section 5 of the Urban Areas Act and this section 10 introduced in 1952. I am sorry that I had to correct the hon. the Minister, but those are the facts.</p>

<p>I also want to object to the Minister telling us that when we talk about section 10, we are provoking the Government. In the first instance, the Government&#x2019;s responsibility is not to this Opposition. The Government&#x2019;s responsibility is to the country and to the urban Bantu population. If the Government is going to act irresponsibly because the Opposition provokes it into doing so, I want to say that the Government ought not to be a government. I cannot imagine any government being so irresponsible as to act in a way harmful to the country merely because an opposition provoked it into doing so.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Your &#x201C;cool&#x201D;. In other words, the hon. the Minister became unnecessarily emotional and excited.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows what I mean. It was unnecessary for him to react in such an emotional way. The hon. member for Albany spoke about the slum conditions there, but the hon. the Minister in no way indicated why those slum conditions in Grahamstown could not be improved and why those people should have to be resettled at Committees Drift. If the hon. the Minister objected to the hon. member&#x2019;s estimate of the cost of the provision of the infrastructure, then it was the duty of the hon. the Minister himself to correct him. It was his duty to say: Really, that is a hopeless over-estimate and it will not cost that much. He should not have reacted as he did.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the hon. the Minister has the advantage of being able to speak for as long as he likes. I should very much like to reply to the hon. the Minister in connection with the things he said about me personally. I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. the Minister spoke. Thus far, I have been at pains in this House to refrain from replying to that kind of thing, because I hoped that I had a positive contribution to make in regard to these matters. The hon. the Minister accused me of having said one thing then, and that I am now saying another. I hope that, like the hon. the Minister. I possess a reasonable degree of intelligence. I hope, too, that I possess a reasonable degree of intellectual integrity. I make no apology when, in the honesty of my intellect and my conscience, I arrive at certain opinions &#x2026; [Interjection.] &#x2026; yes, or change them, and when, in the honesty of my conscience, I expound that standpoint. [Interjections.] Let me finish. I also want to say that I expect nothing different from the hon. the Minister himself because if he is to be honest, he must admit that we are continually faced with new situations, which may mean that we are not always necessarily able to persevere with the standpoints we have adopted in the past. I am being quite honest when I say this. I want to continue. I, too, could have said that there was no change; there was only an &#x201C;unfolding&#x201D; of things, a development of standpoints, as is the case with the Government, too. I just want to point out to the hon, the Minister that in 1952 or 1953, when I said those things, the world situation was entirely different. The situation in South Africa, too, was entirely different.</p>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows it. Yes, I shall come to the hon. member for Brakpan later. We did not have independent countries in Africa then, nor did we have all these other things. The Government itself realizes this and acts accordingly. In 1956, when we had the Tomlinson meeting, the National Congress in Bloemfontein, the then representative of the Minister of Native Affairs, Mr. Daan Nel, refused to address that congress because reference was to be made in a lecture to &#x201C;The Possibility of Independence for the Transkei&#x201D;. Mr. De Wet Nel said that that policy was basically so much in conflict with this Government&#x2019;s policy that he was not prepared to sit at that congress while Professor Sadie said those things. And what happened then&#x003F; Three years later there was a fundamental change of policy. Again, yesterday afternoon, we had a fundamental development here of the policy of that party. I do not know if it was the present Minister, but I think it was he who said in 1967 that the Government was going to drop that principle of 30-year leases. He himself said that we were no longer going to allow the Bantu to own their houses on premises owned by the municipality. Sir, I did not want to drag this in, because I am grateful for this change. It is a necessary adaptation to the circumstances of the times, and I am very grateful for it. But the Minister must not <span class="col_5373-5374" refersTo="page_1100"/>come here now and state that other people have changed their standpoint as well. Sir, let me add this: In 1952, when those things were said, the Tomlinson Report was under consideration. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that I was a member of the technical staff of the Tomlinson Commission. We all assumed that the Government was in earnest about carrying out the recommendations of that commission.</p>

<p>Sir, most of the hon. members sitting here were not present at that time when the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission were rejected on every fundamental point. In other words, the entire concept that existed at the time of the development of the Bantu areas so as to meet the requirements of the time, went up in smoke, and for 15 years, until 1969 when there was a change in regard to the activities and the powers of the BIC&#x2014;for which I give this Government credit&#x2014;there was a grey patch as regards to the development of the homelands.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have a great deal of respect for the hon. member for Edenvale, because I was a student of his. It was he who, as an academic, taught me the basic principles of separate development. Admittedly, he did not make me a Nationalist, because at that time I was already one, but that hon. member taught me the scientific principles of the policy which I still stand by today.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#krijnauw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. J. KRIJNAUW</person>:</from>

<p>I find it strange, Sir, that the hon. member should say that times have changed since those years when I was one of his students. Times have changed. The hon. member refers specifically to Africa, to what has occurred in Africa and the attainment of independence and the &#x201C;Uhuru&#x201D; that went with it. But. Sir, we on this side have grown with the times. It is those very event in Africa that have assisted the National Party&#x2019;s policy in unfolding and developing so that today we have reached the point at which we state that the homelands must eventually be granted full independence. Why, then, did that hon. member perform an about-face&#x003F; I have here notes which he gave me then. I still have all his lectures, too. I have one here which he will remember very clearly, &#x201C;The political rights of Natives in South Africa.&#x201D; Sir, do you know what the hon. member said then in this regard&#x003F; I quote from his introduction on the first page (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no doubt that this will eventually lead to politics in South Africa being dominated by the Native. Such an unfavourable numerical ratio can only lead to the Natives eventually&#x2014;and this process would necessarily be a very gradual one&#x2014;ousting the Whites from the political stage and taking control themselves.</block>

<p>I shall also quote what he said on page 2 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Domination in the political sphere will eventually lead to domination in all other spheres as well, and this could eventually cause South Africa to become a large Native state in which the power and influence of the Whites would gradually dwindle.</block>

<p>He then continues by stating that once there is sharing of political power, this will give rise to social equalization and that the Whites will lose their identity. He ends by saying (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be borne in mind that as far as can be foreseen, the Whites in this country will never give up their White identity and political domination without a protest. It is therefore debatable whether this policy of equalization would lead to anything but violence and possible bloodshed.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] I ask the hon. member whether what was true in 1950 is not equally true or even more true in the year 1975&#x003F; [Interjections.] That is why I say we have grown. We have adapted and developed those things which the hon. member taught me. Now I am unable to understand why the hon. member performed an about face. [Interjections.] The basic difference between our point of departure and that of that side of the House is that we want to apply our policy of separate development like a spearhead of totality throughout the White area and in the homeland territories as well.</p>

<p><span class="col_5375-5376" refersTo="page_1101"/>Sir, I should like to draw your attention to a vital aspect, and that is the new dimension entered by Bantu administration when the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards were established in 1973.</p>

<p>I want to say today that these Bantu Affairs Administration Boards have tackled their duties in great earnest. These Boards took over the tasks that had previously rested on the shoulders of local authorities as the agents of the Government, e.g. labour bureaux, influx control, registration, the administration of Bantu towns and now, in addition, these Bantu Administration Boards undertake not only urban Bantu administration, but rural administration as well. In fact, therefore, we can now no longer refer to urban Bantu administration; we should now really refer to Bantu administration in the White area as such. The policy which we on this side of the House advocate is one of accommodating the Bantu physically present in the White area as workers and, on the other hand, to see those same workers as citizens of homelands and in so doing, to assist the process of nation building in the homeland. This sounds like a contradiction, but I want to tell you, Sir, that from this so-called antithesis a mighty synthesis will be built and we are already doing this. The Bantu Affairs Administration Boards and their officials, to whom I want to pay great tribute, are fully aware of this task. I should like to quote to you, Sir, what the chairman of the Institute of Administrators of Non-White Affairs said recently at the biennial gathering of officials concerned with urban Bantu administration. I might mention that this person is also the chief director of the Central Transvaal Bantu Affairs Administration Board in Pretoria. He said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are two idealistic tasks for Bantu Affairs Administration Boards: (1) that each board should ensure that Black workers be justly and respectfully treated as members of peoples while they are in the White area; and (2) that each board should act as co-architect of the process of nation building in South Africa.</block>

<p>This is how these people see their task. In this regard I should also like to refer to an outstanding lecture delivered by Professor B. van As, head of the department of Native Administration at the University of South Africa, at a similar congress held in Cape Town in 1973, entitled &#x201C;Guidelines for urban Native administration in Southern Africa&#x201D;. I want to quote the final paragraph of that outstanding lecture. If I remember correctly, the hon. member for Edenvale was also present at that congress. He may therefore remember it. Prof, van As said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, all this implies that on the basis of inter-state relations, citizens of one country will be received and treated as guests with the necessary respect and recognition of their human dignity by citizens of another country. The facilities necessary for this will also have to be provided. In this way, correct mutual human relations and the correct attitudes between White and Native, between people and people, between employer and employee and from individual to individual will serve as a stimulus to harmonious national relations. As Southern Africans, all of us, irrespective of colour or race, must respect each other as people, each having his own cultural heritage and possessing a soul. Deeds carry far more weight and conviction than words.</block>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Koedoespoort attempted to take the hon. member for Edenvale to task by quoting from a document which the hon. member for Edenvale had given him during his student days. It is quite obvious, however, that the hon. member never paused to think that what the hon. member for Edenvale said at that stage was quite consistent with the attitude that he adopts today, because it supported the federal policy of this party which is designed precisely to maintain the sovereignty of each individual group in that federation and to surrender only to the central assembly what is necessary to have a common structure to be able to govern the country as a whole. That is entirely in consonance with what the hon. member opposite read out. I think that the hon. members should go back and think a bit more deeply and attempt to understand what this party has been saying over these years. If he does that, he will realize that it is in fact the case.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. Here we have had an hon. Minister attempting to answer the case which was <span class="col_5377-5378" refersTo="page_1102"/>put forward by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana by trotting out again the old mastodon of a policy of the National Party. A mastodon is an antique elephant which walks around with its hair in its eyes, and that is what we have had here today. It cannot see for the problems which it has before its eyes. The hon. the Minister claims that the figures given by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana about the 20 new cities which are going to be created here in our country in 25 years, are not accurate. He maintains that there is not going to be integration even though all those people will toe living here in White South Africa. He says that there is no identical claims between them and that artisans, apprentices, and all such people&#x2014;Black people and White people&#x2014;will have no identity and will not be rubbing shoulders with each other. What he does not realize is that the entire economic future of this country is going to depend more and more upon the Black people during the next 25 years. Of course the identity of interest is not going to be the same between Black and White artisans because as soon as there are not enough White people to fill these posts, the Government merely changes the name and calls it something else and then Black people do the job. So there is absolutely no identity of interests between a Black person who works in one particular capacity on the Railways and a White guy who is doing exactly the same sort of work under a different name. The whole scene is one of absolute bluff, an attempt to put something across to the voters of this country in order to create a sort of illusion that in 25 years&#x2019; time the 20 new cities which are to be built and which will be inhabited by people who will be living in White South Africa and upon whose shoulders every single effort that we are going to make will depend, are going to be run and staffed toy Black people while the share of the White people is going to get smaller and smaller. If you eliminate the grade and the posts which the Whites are occupying every time there is competition between Black and White, what is going to toe left in terms of the Government policy in 25 years&#x2019; time&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister talks about bending the economy. We have to bend the economy to make sure that the whole future of this country in the field of economic development takes place within the Bantu areas. What sign is there after 27 years of Government policy that this has even started&#x003F; There are a few growth points inside the Bantu areas whose share of the total gross national product of this country is absolutely infinitesimal. The hon. member for Johannesburg West will agree with me that after 27 years of having this Government in office, the contribution that comes from those areas in infinitesimal. They have only just now started to scratch the surface with the sort of development that ought to have taken place already. They still have a long way to go, a long way to catch up, and they have no chance to do it in the 25 years postulated by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. The hon. member for Johannesburg West was talking about agricultural development, and I agree that that is basic to the development of the homelands. If foreign exchange is to be built up, and if reserves are to be built up, those homelands cannot afford to spend the money which they have garnered from outside their borders in order to buy food to feed their population. Only now one can see that any sort of momentum is being built up in the development of agriculture in the homelands. Recently, in a debate in one of the Bantu Parliaments, the system of landholdings amongst the Bantu was referred to toy one of their members as &#x201C;barbaric&#x201D;, and this after 27 years of having this Government in power. Up to this day they have not yet left square one when it comes to the realistic development of agriculture in those areas. Here we have people who are talking about the food position, the population position and the viability of the homelands, yet they have not even left square one when it comes to basic aspects. They are today not even able to feed themselves consistently; they are today basically still consuming areas because they draw in food from outside, from the White areas of this country.</p>

<p>I am not even going to reply to that kind of rubbish. I shall return to it later if I get the time. Of these Black people who are the leaders of the Bantu communities in this country, the only one who accepts the policy of separate development and independence wholeheartedly is Chief Minister Matanzima, and yet he himself has gone on record as saying that he accepts it for one reason only, i.e. because it is the only way in which the Black people in South Africa can obtain recognition of their basic human rights and dignities; it is the only way in which they can do it. In fact, people who have been born South Africans have to become guests and strangers to this country before the thinking of the National Party is able to extend to them ordinary basic human rights. They have to become guests and strangers&#x2014;people who were born among us and who are part of our country until such time&#x2014;a time which is still to come&#x2014; when that hon. Minister, as he has mentioned just now, is going to consult with the Prime Minister and the two Ministers Matanzima about the date of independence for the Transkei. Although the hon. the Minister is not going to talk about details, he owes this House at least an indication of what difference the date of independence is going to make to the status of Transkeians living in South Africa and whether they will then have the status of guests and strangers here, in this country of ours. The other leaders reject the policy, and quite rightly so. They reject the policy because it constitutes a denial by the National Party of what their people&#x2019;s contributed to the development of South Africa, an outright denial. What is happening today&#x003F; One sees an attempt by the Prime Minister and other Ministers to cast some sort of tattered mantle of respectability over the basic thinking of the National Party, over the attitude of mind that governs the National Party in respect of the Black people in South Africa. One can sum that up in two words; &#x201C;Get out!&#x201D; That is the basic thinking of the National Party in respect of the Black people: &#x201C;Get out! Get out of our lives, get out of our country, get out of our economy, get out of everything!&#x201D; That is what the basic thinking of that party is.</p>

<p>Of course it is true. Everything is based on the desire to have separation. There have got to be completely separate identities. How can this possibly be&#x003F; The Minister has said nothing about it. He has waved his hands in the air and sketched a few pictures, but he has never come to this basic point. He has never yet been able to separate the Black man from the White man in this country, and he never will.</p>

<p>We have not got a Black problem in South Africa. Our problem is not a problem of d&#x00E9;tente. Our problem is merely the National Party. The National Party is the problem; it is this party with its specific ideology which has become a vested interest in South Africa. That is what is wrong with this country. The National Party is interested only in remaining in power and one sees the shifts, the dodges and the stratagems to which the National Party is being forced to this end. They have got to recognize that things are changing but the Minister says it is not a new policy. Oh, no, this is the &#x201C;ontplooiing van die ou beleid wat al die jare nog gevolg is&#x201D;. What happened in 1967 when they decided to buy all the houses back from the Black people&#x003F; What was that&#x003F; A de-&#x201C;plooiing&#x201D; of the policy&#x003F; They have had a policy for years whereby Bantu could own houses.

There is an onus resting on the supporters of the Nationalist Party to have a look at them, to have a real long, hard, cool look at them and to realize that they are seeing there, masquerading as a political party, the biggest political charade that the world has ever known. Right now one can see them sitting there in the seats of power acting out a part that is meaningless. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can quite understand the outburst of the hon. member who has just spoken. To me it is the symptom of a party which is getting panic-stricken, together with its supporters, because in one election after another they find their way blocked by the wall of solidarity and the progress made by a dynamic National Party Government. When I say that the Government and the National Party are dynamic, I say this because the Government and the party are dynamic in every facet of the implementation of their policy. The National Party has made phenomenal progress with its Bantu policy over the past 27 years. Within the short period of 27 years&#x2014;27 years in the life of a people is as a year in the life of an individual&#x2014; the National Government has given the Bantu peoples an identity of their own again, it has given them pride in themselves, it has given them land and self-government, and now it is leading them to independence in the economic sphere. When I speak of independence in the economic sphere, it must be remembered that every country which wishes to be economically self-sufficient must have industries because industries are so essential for prosperity at home and so essential for earning foreign exchange, and thirdly, which is most important, because industries provide employment for the country&#x2019;s inhabitants.</p>

<p>There appears to be little industrial development in our Bantu homelands, but if one knows the background as we know it and if one knows that these are young countries, one realizes that the progress being made in the industrial field in the homelands is very good. We Afrikaans&#x002D;speaking people are able to say this because of our own background, because we know what we are talking about. The Afrikaner, who has been in South Africa for more than 300 years, has only been moving into commerce, industry and mining during the past 40 years. The Reddingsdaadbond was established in the thirties to enable the Afrikaner to enter those fields. For this reason we know the background and the circumstances of the Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>We know that the Bantu homelands are supported by the Government which actively promotes their interests, the Government with its organization such as the BIC and the XDC. In addition there is the agency system, by means of which Whites are doing a great deal to help the Bantu in the homelands with industrial development. I want to dwell briefly on the BIC and the agency system. The agency system has proved to be very successful. Up to 31 March 1974, no fewer than 112 businesses had been established under this system and in co-operation with the BIC. These businesses are distributed as follows among the homelands: Bophuthatswana, 56; Transkei, 17; KwaZulu, 16; and the rest in the other homelands. On 31 March 1974, these 112 businesses employed 11241 Bantu and 364 Whites&#x2014;an excellent proportion, for the Whites constitute only 3% of the total labour force. Almost 50% of these 11 241 Bantu were employed by businesses at Babalegi. Up to 31 March 1974, the two corporations had spent approximately R19,1 million on buildings, loans and share capital, while the industrialists themselves had contributed R39,2 million. Between March 1974 and March 1975 the growth was remarkable. Twenty-five new concerns were established, which employ 2 543 Bantu. This means that by 31 March 1974, the number of business enterprises had grown to 137, and that they employ 13 694 people.</p>

<p>The greatest provision of employment has taken place in the textile, clothing and leather industries, namely 43 %. Employment provided in the timber industry comes next with 24,8%. The percentage for metal products, machinery and equipment is <span class="col_5383-5384" refersTo="page_1105"/>18,8%. The rest is in respect of other products. In addition, 97 703 job opportunities for Bantu had been made possible by June 1974 through the approval granted to contributors by the Decentralization Board.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister and the men of his department. I want to tell them that fine chapters are written in the history books of the Afrikaaans-speaking people about the thirties, the days of the Reddingsdaadbond, particularly about the part played by men such as Dr. Nic Diederichs and Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd in uplifting the Afrikaans-speaking people and enabling them to enter the sphere of industrial development, commerce and mining. I want to tell the hon. the Minister and his men: You are engaged at the present moment, as you have been in recent years and will be in the years to come, in writing chapters in the history books of neighbouring peoples. In years to come those peoples, our neighbours, will page back in the history books and will read that the Hon. M. C. Botha and his men were largely responsible for making them politically and economically independent. This side of the House, this National Party, wants to tell the hon. the Minister and his men: &#x201C;Carry on the great work. You have our support at all times.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Meyerton has virtually canonized the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration. For that reason I do not know whether I should refer to the hon. the Minister as St. Michael, although that is what it really amounts to. Really, after 27 years of Nationalist rule we still get this talk thanking everybody! Obviously the Afrikaner people ought to be admired for the way in which they lifted themselves up by means of the Reddingsdaadbond, but, then, everybody was poor in those days. I was a Government servant and I remember what my pay was. In those days the Commissioner of Police was getting what a constable of the Police gets today. We all are happy with the progress South Africa has made but that has been so in spite of the Nationalist Party and not because of it. The hon. the Minister &#x2026; I very nearly said St. Michael; he must be St. Michael, because if his Vote had come on the day it should have come, this annual report would have been three days too late. For this reason he must be St. Michael.</p>

<p>This report deals with finance and sketchily with sports and recreation, health services, Bantu beer&#x2014;it is funny that Bantu beer always has to come into this debate &#x2014;social services, data processing&#x2014;we had screeds on data processing which I found rather dry. I would have preferred Bantu beer&#x2014;the reference bureau, the Transkeian High Court and the XDC.</p>

<p>Then, from page 14 onwards, we have the political advancement of the various homelands, with one exception, KwaZulu. I would like to know why KwaZulu was left out. KwaZulu is the biggest of the homelands and has the biggest budget. It comprises the biggest single ethnic group among our Bantu people and yet it is completely ignored. I think that this is a shame. It is something which the hon. the Minister needs to explain to the Zulu people&#x2014;as to why they were ignored in this annual report, this <i>vade mecum</i> of St. Michael for the year ended 31 March 1974. Then it was late! What happened then&#x003F; This report does not anywhere deal with law and order, either in the homelands or in the urban Bantu areas; in other words, crime and delinquency which are plaguing not only South Africa but the whole world. Those of us who know what goes on in the urban Bantu townships know that the position there is anything but healthy as far as crime is concerned. This, is indeed a sad admission. I expected this report to make at least some reference to the prevalence of crime or otherwise in the Bantu townships and what is being done to combat it. Without law and order, there can be no peace, progress or prosperity.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is viewed by the Bantu people as the Great White Father, &#x201C;Ngongqoshe&#x201D;. <span class="col_5385-5386" refersTo="page_1106"/>They call him the Great White Father and he accepts their plaudits, their gifts and their leopard skins &#x201C;Hau Ndaba-zete&#x201D;, but what does he do to see that law and order is maintained in their homelands and/or cities in the White areas&#x003F; He is the man who is responsible for their welfare, progress and happiness. They are over 18 million people&#x2014;the great majority of the people in South Africa&#x2014;and he should be the one who should be prodding the hon. the Minister of Justice, the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, the hon. the Minister of Health, the hon. the Minister of National Education and everybody else to do at least something about this because upon the safety of our people in the townships depends the safety, future and well-being of South Africa. I am glad to say that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development did have pangs of conscience. On page 22, under the heading &#x201C;Eastern Caprivi&#x201D;, we are told&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A total of 47 Caprivian policemen were successfully trained during the year and are being used to serve the tribes in the administration of justice. There are now altogether 64 of these trained men.</block>

<p>Then we come to criminal cases dealt with for the Eastern Caprivi which number 45. On page 23, under &#x201C;Owambo&#x201D;, we are told&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About 300 Wambos have been recruited and trained as tribal policemen. These tribal police are known as the Owambo Police and serve at the tribal offices and with chiefs and senior headmen in the respective tribal areas.</block>

<block name="quote"><i>Traffic Officers</i>: Three Wambos have been recruited and trained as traffic officers for the promotion of road safety in Owambo and the testing of applicants for driver&#x2019;s licences.</block>

<p>On page 41&#x2014;I am now looking for sections dealing with crime prevention and the safety of the people in the towns; I want to see how the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s men are being trained&#x2014;I find under &#x201C;symposiums&#x201D; on page 41&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Crime prevention (misdaadvoorkoming): The number of officers sent was two;</li>

<li>(d) Focus on metropolitan areas (fokus op metropolitaanse gebiede), three.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then, on page 45, all I can see about Police is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Border posts, police stations, 25.</block>

<p>Those police posts were put up by the Police and not by the department. My complaint is that this department is not doing something positive about combating crime in the Bantu areas. After all, apartheid or separate development&#x2014;call it what you like&#x2014;is a policy, and a policy must find answers to situations which it creates. Sir, looking back I observe a constant reference by Ministers and by this particular Minister to the mass of legislation which has been placed on the Statute Book affecting the Bantu peoples, and to the fact that each community was to be self-sufficient and independent of the other. Is the Minister aware that according to the annual report of the Commissioner of Police for the year ended 30 June 1973, the report which we dealt with during the short session last year, the authorized establishment of Bantu Police was only 13 260, and the actual strength was a mere 13 128; in other words, one Bantu policeman for every 1 369 Bantu. There were 37 police stations run by Bantu police, and we were told in this report of the Commissioner of Police that in the Transkei there were 587 non-White Police, and that in Soweto there were 1 033 non-Whites. We were not told how many Coloureds and Indians there were. Nowhere do I see that the Minister has decided, in order to combat crime, to bring in compulsory schooling, together with the provision of free books. Sir, schooling would to a very large extent do away with the undesirable situation that children and young people roam the streets doing nothing except to indulge in pocket-picking, <span class="col_5387-5388" refersTo="page_1107"/>shop-lifting and other activities. No wonder, Sir, that gangs terrorize the townships to such an extent that no person is safe on the street or even in his own home. Agitators who do not want to work&#x2014; and three are many&#x2014;incite the law-abiding Bantu and exploit him and intimidate him for their own ends. Such is the vengeance of gangs and the influence of agitators that residents of townships are reluctant to assist the Police in the fight against crime. Responsible Bantu welcome the establishment of a reserve Police Force. According to the report of the Commissioner of Police for the same year, the police reserve consisted of 3 695 non-Whites, of whom 2 833 are active. Sir, I make a plea to the Minister to do something through his department to assist the Police to enlist more men for the reserve Police Force. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am always glad to be here when the hon. member for Umlazi gets up to speak. He never disappoints me. There is always action and there is always life when he speaks. Sir, a few weeks ago the hon. member and I travelled together in a bus and we had a pleasant singsong together. I want to tell him that this is what he really does best. He sings far better than he speaks here in the House.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say here emphatically that while I was listening today to the hon. members of the official Opposition, I was extremely disappointed in their general attitude as far as our homelands and the Black peoples are concerned. I say this because they made every endeavour to detract from the great importance of the development of the homelands. I am thinking, for example, of the hon. member for Pine-town who tried to create the impression that whatever development is taking place in the homelands, is insignificant. We also heard by means of interjections from the hon. member for Durban Point that the developments which are taking place there, are not of great importance. But what the hon. members over there forget is that the economic development is extremely important. They say that it is a good thing that this development takes place, but that is merely lip service without any positive contribution or positive criticism about what the Bantu Investment Corporation or the Xhosa Development Corporation is doing in the homelands. Reference was only made to it in passing and then they spoke with great erudition of the other theoretical aspects and the political developments, but the economic development in the homelands, which they apparently accept, was ignored completely. This development is of the utmost importance, and we must remember that the agricultural activities in the homeland, notwithstanding the low productivity, is still the major contributor to the domestic product in the homelands. This House has heard a great deal from this side about the excellent work which is being done by the Bantu Investment Corporation and by the agricultural departments of the homelands themselves. All this is commendable work.</p>

<p>I want to refer, however, to another facet, a facet which we may welcome here, and that is the contribution the private sector renders to the development of agriculture in the homelands. Here I am referring particularly to the South African Sugar Association. I think we should commend their actions in every respect. The South African Sugar Association, as hon. members will know, had to borrow R16 million in 1967 to stabilize the price of sugar. But fortunately the position improved in subsequent years and they regarded it as their duty to make a contribution of their own. In 1972 this Association established a fund of R5 million, with the purpose of encouraging the smaller sugar growers to raise their productivity. A large portion of this is utilized on behalf of the Bantu sugar growers in the homelands. The fund is administrated by the White sugar millers, and White sugar growers. They do this quite of their own accord and this is an excellent example of good neighbourliness to the whole of South Africa. We should encourage this and at the same time try to do it on a larger scale in other parts of South Africa as well. These White farmers and these White millers spend their free time and money to assist the smaller Bantu <span class="col_5389-5390" refersTo="page_1108"/>producers and growers. This takes place for the most part in the sugar zone in Natal, which adjoins the constituency of the hon. member for Umhlanga. We have already seen that good progress was made during the past 18 months. This is not an easy task, for the Bantu farmer is not always willing to relinquish his traditional agricultural methods, but success is achieved with this to an increasing extent. It takes place on the basis of loans which are raised. For the first four years the money is lent at an interest rate of 3% and for the next six years it is lent at an interest rate of 5%. Therefore, this fund will accumulate and it will be used to an increasing extent for Bantu farmers. The KwaZulu Government welcomes greatly this step taken by the South African Sugar Association. They co-operate most closely with the agricultural department of KwaZulu and it is clearly appreciated that financial assistance alone is not enough, because this is short-term assistance. It is clearly appreciated that the Bantu farmer should also be taught the technical know-how. Consequently this Association decided further to establish three farmers&#x2019; centres in the sugar area in order to create facilities where farmers can acquire the technical know-how and where lectures can be given to the farmers not only in the field of sugar cultivation but also in the field of bookkeeping, agriculture economics, the repair and maintenance of tractors and everything related to farming. This is being done by the private sector. It is commendable and it is a matter which should be kept in mind by more branches of the agricultural sector.</p>

<p>Finally I want to refer to the annual report of the department. The hon. member for Umlazi complained because the report did not contain particulars about KwaZulu. I am trying my best to tell him as much as possible about it now. He referred to KwaZulu and if he looks at this report of the BIC, he will see that the BIC has done tremendous work with regard to the livestock marketing scheme, for example, in order to enable Bantu farmers to market their cattle. They employed a method&#x2014;unfortunately I do not have the time to explain it in detail&#x2014;the number of cattle which resulted in a 72% increase in the number of cattle sold in 1974 in KwaZulu as compared with 1973; the turnover increased by 171% and the average price per head of cattle by 57%.

<p>Mr. Chairman, if I were asked what word had been used most in this House since this session of Parliament began at the end of January, I would say, without any shadow of doubt or fear of contradiction, &#x201C;d&#x00E9;tente&#x201D;. It is a word that has stood out in most speeches and discussions in this House. Added to the word &#x201C;d&#x00E9;tente&#x201D; there is the word &#x201C;dialogue&#x201D;. I cannot help thinking back to the days when Dr. Verwoerd started with his idea or philosophy of Bantustans, separate independent Black States. I think back to the Tomlinson Commission report. I have looked through the report, having heard so much recently about d&#x00E9;tente. I see there were 11 members on this Tomlinson Commission, all White. There was not one Black man. After many years of trying to iron out its policies, trying to bring them to their logical conclusion, it is not surprising that today this Government has not succeeded. We have heard the terms &#x201C;first phase&#x201D;, &#x201C;second phase&#x201D; and now &#x201C;third phase&#x201D;. We all know that the Government started with the first phase which was the Bantustans and their development. No Black man was consulted or asked what he thought about the Black man&#x2019;s destiny, either in the homelands or in terms of separate development relating to the so-called White areas. The Black people were never consulted at that time. No wonder we still have today, after 27 years of Nationalist rule, an incomplete Phase 1. It is nowhere near completion. While engaged in this, we had to deal with Phase 2, which I regard as the phase relating to the urban Africans, a phase we are now discussing. We have also heard so much from members opposite about Phase 3, which was heralded by Mr. Pik Botha&#x2019;s famous or notorious speech at the United Nations on discrimination or differentiation.</p>

<p>We heard the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s new policy statement yesterday. While it is welcomed, it is long overdue. His statement related to urban Africans. He mentioned home ownership or freehold ownership, trading rights and transport. These are all issues that we have raised on this side of the House over the years. We in the United Party accept the fact&#x2014;and we always have accepted the fact&#x2014;that Blacks are here to stay in the urban areas; in other words, that they are here as a permanent body of Black people. Having listened to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s revealing statements yesterday concerning his new policy, I do not believe the system will work unless or until the Government accepts the permanency of the Black people in the urban areas. Why they still hang on to phrases such as the one used by the hon. the Deputy Minister here yesterday, i.e. &#x201C;permanent op &#x2019;n los basis&#x201D;, I do not know. Why cannot the Government simply say those people are here permanently and they accept the fact&#x003F; Why use a phrase such as &#x201C;permanent op &#x2019;n los basis&#x201D;&#x003F; These were the words used by the hon. the Deputy Minister yesterday. Unless the Government accepts the fact that those individuals are here as a permanent body of people, the Government will not solve the problems we are faced with in relation to the urban Bantu. I remember the years when the late Mr. Blaar Coetzee stood here and said that by the year 1978 every Black man would be either turning towards the homelands or already on his way back there. Well, that is something we know has never materialized; in fact, what he forecast has now been reversed. Hence the revealing policy statement by the hon. the Minister yesterday. I agree with the hon. the Deputy Minister who said this morning that criminals are not always born and bred. I also agree with his words that some people are made criminals by force of circumstances. Because the Government will not accept that these people are here permanently, we are faced today with many problems. We are faced with the so-called repatriation of the Black people from the urban areas to the homelands or the borders of the homelands such as the Eastern Cape and the East London complex in particular. Many problems have been created by this philosophy. In our area it has created wholesale unemployment. We have had many arguments across the floor of the House with hon. Ministers about the number of unemployed. Some say 40 000, some say 60 000 and a Deputy Minister said in East London not so long ago that the figure was a mere 4 000. It does not matter how many thousand unemployed there are; the fact is that there is unemployment, overcrowding, crime and delinquency in the East London complex. These are all problems that have been caused mainly by this Government and its policies. There are many problems facing us in the Eastern Cape caused, I repeat, mainly by this Government&#x2019;s policies. If the Government would only accept that the Bantu are here permanently and if it would stop this nonsense of repatriation, we could possibly try to deal with the natural increase of our Black people in the Eastern Cape.</p>

<p>I was looking through some figures a day or two ago on the crime rate in South Africa. The figures were very revealing and, I believe, shocking. At the present time on an average day there are approximately 98 000 South Africans in gaol. Each prisoner is costing the taxpayer and the Government R1-82 per day. The total daily cost of maintaining our prison population is over R178 000 per day. That is a lot of money. We know that of the 98 000 prisoners in our prisons daily, are not all Black people. However, the majority are, and very little is being done to rectify the crime rate throughout the country. The cost of maintaining prisoners is enormous and we are not achieving anything. In fact, the position is becoming progressively worse. Only recently we had the privilege of having two Ministers in East London, namely the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, Mr. Janson, and the present Minister of Justice, Mr. Jimmy Kruger.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the theme of the opening speech of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana was that a substantial number of Blacks would always reside outside the homelands and that the Government&#x2019;s refusal to face up to this fact meant disaster as far as he was concerned. I say that this is certainly also a potential source of conflict in South Africa because the young Blacks will certainly not be as patient as their elders have been. A few years ago the hon. the Minister said that it was almost 12 o&#x2019;clock.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>For coming to an agreement to try to settle the problem. Sir, I am not going to be distracted by the hon. the Minister. He said it was almost 12 o&#x2019;clock and we know that since then there has been a change of emphasis in Government policy largely, I think, as a result of the influence of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. There has been a more sympathetic administration of the policy.</p>

<p>We have an example of this change in the statement made by the hon. the Minister, the first meaningful act we have seen on the part of this Government towards better consensus, viz. a statement on a reversal of policy with regard to home ownership and the trading rights of the urban Bantu. Quite rightly, every sane person welcomes this. Only a fool would not welcome it. What has the hon. the Minister done&#x003F; He has merely reversed a mistake made by his Government eight years ago. As one editor has asked: Why must there be so much agony before the Government sees the error of its policy&#x003F; We are told that this reversal has come about because of dialogue between the hon. the Prime Minister and the leaders of the homelands. Had the hon. the Prime Minister done what we have done, viz. consulted with the leaders of the Africans in the urban areas, it would not have been necessary for him to find out from the homeland leaders what the grievances of the urban Africans were. It would also not have been necessary for him to wait so long to realize that the Government blundered in 1967. It is idle for Government members to deny that section 10 of the Urban Areas Act gives rights to the Bantu in the urban areas. Specious reasoning that the Blacks are here in a temporary permanent capacity or that &#x201C;hulle is hier vir altyd maar in &#x2019;n los hoedanigheid&#x201D; or casually, as the hon. the Minister himself said, does not alter the fact that the Black man is here. As the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education has said, he will be here for as long as the Opposition likes to state and that we, the Whites, will always be rubbing shoulders with him and attending the same cinemas. I think that <span class="col_5395-5396" refersTo="page_1111"/>we can expect a change in the law again one of these days.</p>

<p>D&#x00E9;tente at home is more important than d&#x00E9;tente abroad. Why not face up to the fact now that the Black man is in the so-called White areas permanently&#x003F; Why does the Government not implement the whole of the United Party&#x2019;s urban Bantu policy before it is too late&#x003F; [Interjections.] It is going to have to do so sooner or later so therefore it is better that it be done as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The change in 1967 was made because of the contention that the Bantu were not in the urban areas permanently and that their families were unnecessary appendages, as one hon. Deputy Minister said. If that is not the reason why the alteration was made, the hon. the Minister must tell us. If it is true, then the reversal now of the policy to what it was in 1967 is an admission of the fact that the Bantu are here permanently.</p>

<p>I want to remind hon. members of the fact that in 1952 Dr. Verwoerd was responsible for giving the urban Blacks rights in terms of section 10. Since then, the provisions of that section have been amended and made more restrictive in their application in an effort by the Government to prevent applicants from qualifying in terms of that section.</p>

<p>In view of this concentration of the position of the urban Bantu I hope that hon. members are not going to be gulled into believing that everything outside the urban garden is lovely. Except for Chief Kaiser and possibly Mr. Sebe no other homeland leader accepts the Bantustan policy as enunciated by this Government. [Interjections.] It is a fact. Even in the Transkei which is a homeland supporting Government policy there is criticism of Government policy. The very aspect which they detest most is the application of the labour policy of this Government&#x2014;the recruitment of contract labour. This application of the labour policy is once again an effort to prevent Africans qualifying in terms of section 10. Therefore they are allowed to come here only for one year at a time. The Transkei objects to the whole system of labour recruiting which is so open to abuse. In the debate last year in the Transkeian Legislative Assembly all the members who spoke, Government and Opposition alike, condemned the whole policy. They spoke of the tragedy and misery of unemployment.</p>

<p>No matter what the hon. the Minister of Finance may say, there is unemployment.</p>

<p>The other day the hon. the Prime Minister was scathing in his reference to the budget of Lesotho as compared with that of the Transkei. I do not know whether he was trying to prove by this means that the Transkei was more viable because it had a bigger budget. Besides, the budget has nothing at all to do with viability unless, of course the State is paying its own way. What is the position in the Transkei&#x003F; The last budget of the Transkei showed an expenditure of R87 million and our Government subsidized that amount by R60 million. In addition the Government paid the salaries of the senior officials, the Secretaries of the Government departments, except for the Secretary for Education.</p>

<p>Dealing with expenditure, may I ask the hon. the Minister who is paying for the house that is being built for the judge in Umtata&#x003F; According to the hon. the Minister the house is going to cost R206 000. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The architect is getting R15 000, the quantity surveyor R5 000, no amount has yet been assessed for landscaping to put the garden in order, no value has as yet been given to the land and we do not know what the cost of curtaining and carpeting is going to be. By the time this house is finished it will probably cost close to a quarter of a million rands. I do not know who is paying for it. <span class="col_5397-5398" refersTo="page_1112"/>I can find no reference to the expenditure in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to remind the hon. the Minister that once the Transkei gets its independence, it will have a president. That president will have to have a better house than a judge. And what about the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers and future judges&#x003F; Are they all going to be housed on this scale&#x003F; Sir, two years ago, in the course of a speech in the Assembly, in which he told his people what was meant by independence, the Chief Minister of the Transkei, Chief Kaiser Matanzima, defined independence as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Not being dependent on another; being exempt from external control or support; not dependent on the actions of others; refusing to be under an obligation to others.</block>

<p>Sir, when this Government set the Transkei on its way to independence, it should then have taken steps to see that there was meaningful economic development in the Transkei. What did it do&#x003F; It rejected the recommendations of the Tomlinson Commission. Dr. Verwoerd refused to allow White capital into the Transkei. Now at last an effort is being made, because the Development Corporation is certainly doing very well under the circumstances. But, Sir, I would like to point out to the hon. the Minister that even in the agricultural sector there could be no development and the Xhosa Development Corporation is now taking that over as well. Whereas we used to have three agricultural colleges in the Transkei, there is only one now; two were closed down. Is this &#x201C;progress&#x201D; by this Government in setting a State on its way to independence&#x003F; I say it is not. Many years have been wasted and now it is too late. The effort being made now by the Xhosa Development Corporation is not sufficient when one considers the people who have to be catered for. The development which is taking place now cannot even cater for those presently living in the Transkei. What about the natural increase&#x003F; Where are they going to be accommodated; where are they going to find work&#x003F; They are going to find work here in White South Africa, and the Government must face up to that fact and apply a policy in the so-called White areas which will satisfy these people and make them true and loyal citizens of the Republic in which we all live. It is no good treating them, as the Government is doing now, as a continual source of embarrassment. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat told the same story we have heard <i>ad nauseam,</i> except that he exaggerated somewhat on matters he knows very little about. Sir, I just want to refer to the attitude of the homeland governments towards the Government&#x2019;s policy. The hon. member said it was only Paramount Chief Matanzima and Mr. Cebe who supported the Government&#x2019;s policy. Sir, allow me to quote to you from the <i>Transvaler</i> of Saturday, 3 May (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;I do not think any political party that tries to undo that which has been built up in terms of the policy of separate development, will survive,&#x201D; Chief Lucas Mangope, chief minister of Bophuthatswana, said here yesterday. &#x201C;Any party that wants to go back on the homeland road is doomed to failure.&#x201D; Chief Mangope addressed a group of 30 people from a European business school near Paris, in France.</block>

<p>Sir, that party on the opposite side is doomed and they know it; that is their problem. The hon. member is trying to create the impression here that that party knows what goes on in the minds of the Black people. I want to tell them that the United Party policy, which was rejected by the electorate for the umpteenth time last year, is also being rejected by the Black peoples in this country, and I fail to understand how hon. members on that side can come back stubbornly for more punishment with stories such as these. It is only people who have got into a rut as they have, who can come back to this House so many times with the same nonsensical statements.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member complains about a house which is being erected for a judge. He complains about the costs attached to it, and so on. If they do not complain about that, they complain that we do too little, or that what we do is not good enough. We hear these sad tidings and negative statements continually from all the groups on that side of the House. I want to point out to them certain further misconceptions in their approach where they see only a group of Whites on the <span class="col_5399-5400" refersTo="page_1113"/>one hand and a group of Blacks on the other hand and where they do not stress the ethnic concept as this side of the House sees it. In this approach of theirs, they fail to recognize the smaller ethnic groups. What about the Venda, the Shangaan, the South Ndebele and the Swazi and even the Pedi&#x2019;s under their policy&#x003F; No, they only see the importance the Black man has for the White man in a global context. But they go even further. They are forever referring to the urban Bantu. The hon. member did so again this afternoon. The fact that article 10 Black people have been granted certain concessions under the Bantu Urban Areas Act is now being regarded by them as an indication of permanency. What would happen if the Government were to repeal article 10&#x003F; Then those people would no longer have any arguments. But what are they in fact doing here&#x003F; When referring to the Black man in South Africa, they only stress the urban Black man and they never refer to the 3,5 million Black people on White farms. They do not plead the cause of those people. The hon. members are undermining the smaller groups and the Black people as a whole as far as their cultural heritage and their independence are concerned, those things which this National Government wants to give them and wants to develop and with which we are concerned. But how little appreciation do we get from that side of the House for what is being done&#x003F; It is their duty to criticize, but we ask that their approach should be a little more positive.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to associate myself with hon. members on that side who referred to the excellent work of the department with its wide ramifications extending into the farthest corners of the homelands where these people are making major sacrifices. But when that side of the House is afforded the least opportunity to criticize, they come along and raise a hue and cry. While reference has also been made to the corporations, I specially want to emphasize the directorates of these corporations, and the enormous task they fulfil for which they are never even thanked. Then I want to refer in particular to the investigation the hon. Minister had to order on account of the suspicions that had been cast on the BIC. The investigation was ordered at the request of the chairman of the directorate of that corporation. How many of those people who are sowing suspicion all the time, like the hon. member for Houghton and the nosey parkers of the liberal Press, came forward and admitted that they were wrong&#x003F; All they try to do is to nose about and cast suspicion. If one reads the newspaper articles, as has been indicated here by the hon. member for Potgietersrust, of what that hon. member did, one will see that all that hon. member does is to cast suspicion and to nose about only to come and squawk here or wherever she gets the opportunity to cast even more suspicion. A report has just been published. Let her get up here and at least express her appreciation and say she regrets that she has made a mistake. Nothing she or the liberal newspapers suggest is substantiated in that report we had from the magistrate, the one-man commission. Sir, I think this is scandalous attitude which is adopted by people who pretend that they want to help the Black man in this country, because when institutions are established and people sacrifice their time for the sake of the Black man, to uplift the Black nations in particular, they are undermined and suspicion is cast. People ask that investigations should be made and when an investigation has been carried out and a report is published, no one comes forward to say he is sorry that he was wrong. It is this negative attitude we find among all groups on the other side, particularly so on the part of the hon. member for Houghton. All she does is to come along and squawks afterwards, and she only creates problems. I think she should have the courage to get up and say she is sorry for saying what she did. [Interjections.] it is not only she, but also the liberal newspapers. Last year, while this investigation was being conducted, the <i>Sunday Times</i> tried to suggest that serious problems were afoot&#x2014;and that while the evidence was still being led. The report was published last week and I went through the <i>Sunday Times</i> of yesterday twice to see whether any reference was made to it. But there was not a word about it in the <i>Sunday Times</i> although it was mentioned in other newspapers. This is the one-sided approach of the liberal groups who try to cast suspicion, not only in this country, but overseas as well. That is why we find that a homeland leader like Chief Minister Mangope comes forward and says: &#x201C;We accept the policy&#x201D;, together with those who said so before him. But then we only get this negative approach instead of their making a contribution. <i>The Cape Argus</i> at least stated: &#x201C;BIC inquiry <span class="col_5401-5402" refersTo="page_1114"/>finds no malpractice&#x201D; Hon. members can read it. They say there was a measure of mismanagement, but what did those hon. members suggest&#x003F; No, Sir we have reached the stage where we should ignore people such as these who not only push the Black man into the background as far as his national interests are concerned, but also thwart in every way all the attempts on the part of the Government to effect development, and that we should act on our own. I think the time has come that they should realize that it is in the interests of South Africa that they should give support where support is needed, and their support is in fact needed, but then they should have the interests of the Black peoples of this country at heart. We are optimistic about the future&#x2014;it does not matter what those people and their liberal fellow-travellers have to say.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to the speech of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana in which he mentioned the cities that will develop. I want to tell him that cities will develop in these homelands during the next decade. The Government will continue to help them for the sake of the continued existence of those nations as nations&#x2014;not only as Black people, Sir, but also as nations. Those cities will develop, not only to promote the economic strength of those people and to provide for them, but also for the maintenance of the cultural rights and the development thereof&#x2014;as well as for the sake of the self-respect of those nations as nations, and not simply as Black people who that side of the House want to see as an entity and want to treat in this manner. I want to state here that as far as South Africa is concerned our future is one in which we shall have the confidence of Black leaders and in which we shall have the confidence of Africa and the world. The only people who do not have any confidence in themselves, in their country or in the future of Black nations are that side of the House. If they want to continue with this negative attitude, things will be worse for them than they were in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooirivier has asked us: &#x201C;What has been achieved in 27 years time&#x003F;&#x201D; If one looks at the performance of that party over 27 years, one can quite rightly ask what they have achieved. They are deteriorating by the day, but then they still want to know what has been achieved in the homelands. They are in such a predicament that they can think of nothing else but their misery. It has actually become a psychosis with them, so that they only see misery and deterioration everywhere around them and in South Africa as well, because it has become part of their existence.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister took it amiss of the hon. member for Griqualand East because he had criticized the expenditure on a judge&#x2019;s house. May I just point out to the hon. the Minister that there is a difference between productive expenditure and unproductive expenditure. We are dealing here with unproductive expenditure. The hon. the Minister further occupied himself with the pipe dream policy of the National Party. I do not want to go into that pipe dream any further today, because to me it is only a pipe dream policy. White, Black and Brown will for all times be interwoven in this country&#x2019;s future. Whatever we say here, will make no difference to the matter.</p>

<p>Therefore I want to deal with another matter today, a local matter, namely the community of Philipstown, a community in which I grew up and in which I am interested. Although it is a local matter, it is nevertheless an important matter for the people living in that area. It concerns a number, six or seven, Bantu in that area. It does not however only affect those six or seven Bantu, but it affects the future of that whole community as such. These six people were practically all born in that area and practically all of them grew up there. These are people who have risen above their community and who are held in high esteem in that community. We have seen these people working as builders, cartage contractors, wire-manufactures, etc. Suddenly those people were told to discontinue their activities this year. With one stroke of the pen their work was taken away from them and now they have to be registered as labourers. To illustrate this matter more clearly, I will mention individual cases. The first Bantu&#x2019;s name I may just as well mention since it will make no difference. It will in any case place the hon. the Minister in a better position to check the facts.</p>

<p>We have seen how this Bantu saved his money until he could by himself a three ton truck. He used that lorry to convey Bantu on picnic outings on Saturdays and to transport school children. During the week he transported sand, bricks and sheep for the farming community. At that time when the instruction was put into effect that the Bantu had to register, this man had himself registered. On his labour card it was indicated that he was self-employed. The man had thus been registered all these years as being self-employed and through the years it was accepted as such. Last year the inspector of Bantu Affairs suddenly informed this man that a letter had arrived from Graaff-Reinet, the headquarters of the Bantu Administration Council, to the effect that he had to discontinue his work and move to King William&#x2019;s Town to conduct his business there. Why these people should be off loaded at King William&#x2019;s Town, where there is no employment I do not know. This is a very decent man.</p>

<p>Nothing, but this man was born in Philipstown and have been living there his whole life. He does not know King William&#x2019;s Town at all. His grandfather might possibly have lived there, and I am not even sure whether this person can speak a Bantu language. This person is a law-abiding person and then went to King William&#x2019;s Town. However, he returned and told the inspector that he was unable to make a living there. This inspector was sympathetic and promised to state his case, because he wanted to help him. This inspector also grew up in Philipstown. In February of this year the new inspector, however, told this man to discontinue his activities immediately. This Bantu received his certificate to become a conveyancer in Kimberley. The ordinary Police do not worry him at all. The inspector however now tells him that he is not allowed to continue his work. However, there is no other cartage contractor in the district. He is not competing with any White or Coloured person there. When this man conveys sheep for a farmer, the farmer has to go to town in the morning to register him as a labourer. In the afternoon another farmer has to register him again and the following day still another farmer. The result of this is that this person cannot continue his work.</p>

<p>The second case I want to mention, is that of Lodewyk Bambis, also a Bantu who was born and grew up in that district. He started by building labourers cottages on farms. Later he started building houses. There is no White building contractor in that town. There is not a Coloured builder in that town either. The man therefore does not compete with anyone and simply renders a service. Last year he was told to have himself registered as a labourer. This year he continued his work on the sly, as any normal man would under the circumstances. While he was painting a house, the inspector of Bantu Affairs arrived there and fined him R15 on the spot. The question I now want to put to the hon. the Minister is whether these inspectors have the right simply to fine people without taking them to court.</p>

<p>I now come to the third case, that of Swartland Joseph, the brickmaker of the town. He is the only brickmaker in the town. [Interjections.] It is no joke. I wonder what that hon. member would do if his work is taken away from him. If circumstances were to change one day and he is treated the way these people are treated, I wonder how he is going to feel about it. There have always been a good relationship among White people and the Brown people in Philipstown. These people had confidence in the fairness and the decency of the White man in that area. This is being disturbed now. This man had made the bricks which were used in the district. Also this man was told to discontinue his work immediately. What is happening now&#x003F; Now one has to get bricks from De Aar, which is between 50 km and 100 km away. One load of 1 000 bricks costs R30. The bricks themselves cost R21. While people could buy the bricks from this person for R17 it now costs them R55 per 1 000 bricks. The people can therefore not continue with their work and this person is not allowed to work.</p>

<p><span class="col_5405-5406" refersTo="page_1116"/>There is also the case of Kleinbooi. Kleinbooi used to manufacture wire. He did not worry anyone. He has been manufacturing wire for the farmers his whole life. He was told to have himself registered as a farm labourer. Here the same thing happened. I can continue in this vein and mention all these six cases. However, I just want to mention a letter one of the Bantu has received. It reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since your application to operate as an entrepreneur was refused by the Chief Bantu Commissioner of the Western Cape on 16 April 1974 already, this office has to abide by the decision of the Chief Bantu Commissioner of the Western Cape. Your attention is drawn to the fact that, in terms of the Bantu Labour Act, it is an offence to operate as an entrepreneur without permission, and you are requested to report at the local labour bureau immediately in order to have yourself registered as a work&#x002D;seeker, and that attempts can be made to find employment for you.</block>

<p>This man is not a work-seeker. He is a person who renders a major service in that community. I want to state that these people were born in this area. They have established rights. These are not new applications. They do not compete with anybody. They do not compete with a White person and not even with a Coloured person. All they do is render a service and they do not worry anybody. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member must forgive me if I do not join him in his wire manufacturing. I shall leave that to Iscor. Last Friday the hon. member for Umlazi turned out here to be another spokesman on South West Africa, the new &#x201C;Japie&#x201D; Von Keyserlingk. The hon. member held up the report of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development here and threw it down with contempt. I wish to suggest to the hon. member that he and I would both gain by studying this report. Accordingly I should like to congratulate the department on a very neat report. The hon. member also referred in a sneering and disparaging way to the recently established tribal police of Owambo and Kavango. The question arises: Why should our homelands-to-be, these peoples-to-be, always be referred to in a disparaging way&#x003F; The hon. member, who is a former police officer himself, should welcome a step such as this. Since the establishment of such a Police Force is being criticized here by the United Party, it is probably as well to take a look at the recent past as well, at what happened a few months ago, when the United Party raised a hue and cry about actions taken by the Owambo Government in their own area. Clergymen and spiritual associates of the United Party, all of them people of a flamingo-like colour, even went as far as to ask for an interdict against the Owambo Government. Demands were made here in the House&#x2014;the hon. member for Bezuidenhout took the lead&#x2014;that the Government should intervene and forbid the Owambo Government to take action to maintain law and order according to their own tribal traditions in their own areas. The hon. member for Umlazi should know that the Ovambos will always try all crimes except capital crimes and will deal with punishments within their own area and their own law&#x2014;an area delimited by themselves and not by the Whites. The question arises of what the United Party wants. When the Owambo Government takes action within its tribal context it is criticized. When they establish their own Police Force, they find fault with that also and they refer to it in disparaging terms.</p>

<p>The incidence of crime and violence is extremely low in Owambo as a result of the strong action the Owambo Government takes. The hon. member speaks of agitation which is on the increase, but when action is taken against agitators, that Government is pilloried and their domestic affairs are interfered with. Because hostile and ignorant people level all kinds of reproaches at the Government with regard to South West Africa, I believe that I shall be allowed to refer to the unselfish service which the Government and its officials render to the people of this area. If one takes a look at Owambo and the Kavango, one is struck by the network of schools, hospitals and clinics. We think of the canal scheme of Owambo which runs like golden arteries through the area and opens up a hinterland which has remained virtually unutilized up to now because of the lack of water. A new and modern abattoir, with an adjoining meat canning factory, has been established at Oshakati by the BIC, which is such an unsatisfactory <span class="col_5407-5408" refersTo="page_1117"/>body according to those hon. members, at a cost of R223 000. The capacity of this abattoir is 300 head of cattle a day. Do the hon. members realize what this market means to the farmers of Owambo&#x003F; We have also heard that considerable progress has been made with the planning of abattoirs at Runtu, Ruacana, Khorixas and Katima Mulilo. Then there is the impressive scheme to which the hon. the Minister referred, where the BIC is establishing cattle farming on an unprecedented scale for the Kavango Government. All one hears from the Opposition side with regard to the BIC is criticism. We have heard no word of approval for what is already being done there. I also want to refer to the medical services. No attention is ever paid to medical services. In the Budget which is before hon. members, provision is made for an amount of R6,46 million rand for medical services in the Northern homelands. The South West Africa Administration has also voted an amount of more than R7 million for medical services in the southern sector. These amounts do not include capital works. As far as the northern sector is concerned, we find on analysis that there are 9,49 beds per 1 000 persons. With regard to the southern sector, 11,96 beds are provided for every 1 000 Whites. The number of beds for all the other population groups is 9,92 beds per 1 000. Compare this with the 0,33 beds per 1 000 persons in Ethiopia, 1,89 per 1 000 in Tanzania, 0,67 per 1 000 in Mali, 1,37 per 1 000 in Liberia, 0,34 per 1 000 in Nigeria and 1,32 per 1 000 in Senegal. These figures were obtained from the statistics of the World Health Organization. In the budget of the South West Africa Administration we find an appropriation for the next five years amounting to R7 million for Owambo, R2 million for Kaokoland, R275 000 for Hereroland, and R4,7 million for Damaraland. The amount appropriated for Damaraland includes an amount of R2 million for a new hospital at Arandis and R1,5 million for a new hospital at Khorixas As far as these two towns, Khorixas and Arandis, are concerned, I want to appeal to the hon. Minister and his department to think carefully before undertaking major development works. It is true that Khorixas is the main centre at the moment, but I believe that Arandis will soon become the main centre. It has everything in its favour. It is the ideal border industry with the mining of uranium next to it. Walvis Bay and Swakopmund are situated close by and railway, road and telephone communications are readily available. Electricity is also available, and money and community development facilities will not be a problem. These will not be lacking, and I believe that they will be the decisive factors which will tip the balance in favour of Arandis. The inhabitants can go to work in Swakopmund and Walvis Bay and own their own homes in their own area. I trust that the hon. Minister will give careful consideration to this. As a further aid to these particular areas, I want to ask that this scheme of border area development and the establishment of industries within the areas should be made applicable to South West Africa as well. I quote from a letter, dated 16 July 1974, which was addressed to the Town Clerk of Omaruru [translation]:</p>

<block name="quote">With reference to your letter dated 17 June 1974 in the above connection, I regret to inform you that the border area development scheme is not applicable to South West Africa.</block>

<p>I believe that it is of vital importance and I trust that the hon. the Minister will give attention to that.</p>

<p>To return to medical services. I should like to refer to preventative services.</p>

<p>It was somebody who weighed less than you. As far as preventative services are concerned, there is, for instance, the combating of malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, small-pox, polio, etc. It is interesting to take notice that the incidence of malaria in the Kavango and Owambo has decreased from 27,1% and 16,2%, respectively to 3,01% and 0,29%. It is equally important to note that at some of these hospitals and clinics, up to 30 of the patients come from Angola. What other country in the world could improve on this&#x003F; What other country in the world could boast of such unselfish service&#x003F; Therefore I should like to pay tribute to the unknown workers who perform this enormous task in difficult circumstances. I want to tell the enemies of the Government that they should take another look at what is being achieved. Imagine what would happen if the White man should withdraw from there. Now the question arises why the United Party is always negative and does not join us in telling the world that a very great <span class="col_5409-5410" refersTo="page_1118"/>&#x2022;deal is being done there. Why do they not have a change of heart such as Prof. Chris Barnard has just experienced&#x003F; Do they have no love for their own&#x003F; Are they not also prepared to emphasize the good aspects of South Africa instead of pointing only to the negative aspects&#x003F; [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sure the hon. member for Omaruru will understand if I do not follow him with his particular theme. As this debate draws to an end, I want to raise a particular subject with the hon. the Minister. It is a subject that is of tremendous concern to a great number of people throughout South Africa. I refer to the expropriation of the Federal Theological Seminary. The hon. the Minister has issued a very long statement in this connection quite recently. Nevertheless, because of its importance and because it touches on the lives of so many people, I want to raise this matter again in this House. Let it be clear that I am naturally in favour of any development which takes place at the University of Fort Hare, whether it be at Alice itself, at Umtata, King William&#x2019;s Town or anywhere else. Secondly, it is obviously clear that one possibility for the necessary development was the take-over of the Federal Theological Seminary itself. Thirdly it is clear that adequate compensation has been offered and obviously will be paid in due course. There is no question about any of those three points. That the offer made by the department was made as long ago as 1971 is also very clear, as is the fact that this was finally turned down by the federal council itself in April 1973. These are some of the facts of the matter. The major factors are that the University of Fort Hare wanted this land, that the seminary did not want to sell the land or Dart with it and that, as a consequence, the Department of Bantu Administration and Development chose to expropriate in November 1974. At that time it gave the seminary 30 days&#x2019; notice. To understand some of the concern in the minds of the leaders of that seminary it must be understood that a theological seminary has a specific responsibility. It has a very large staff; it has well over 100 students coming from many parts of the country and it serves a very large area throughout South Africa. If one wanted to try to equate this, it would be like asking whether the theological school at Stellenbosch would not be directly affected, and very significantly affected, if its college or land were expropriated and they had to go somewhere else. It is not easy to take up, not only the buildings, not only the chapels, not only the colleges, not only the library, but also the community spirit which has been built up there over 15 years. A considerable amount of money has been expended. To begin with, well over R500 000 was spent as far back as 1961. It is a college which has been known throughout the world for its high standards, its excellence and its contribution to theological and philosophical debate in South Africa. It undertakes the training of Black, Coloured and Indian ministers who serve hundreds and thousands of people in the homeland areas, the rural areas and in the great cities of our land. Therefore the federal council, after having weighed it all up, having taken consultation with is member churches, decided that it did not want to sell the land, that it wanted to stay where it was and that it was content with the situation and the work it was trying to do there. The land on which the seminary was based was given to the church more than 100 years ago by Chief Thyali for the work of education and Christian development. As a result there is a feeling in the minds and hearts of many of the people in that area that it is very sacred land because it was specifically given over to the church in order that it could do its work. This was expropriated in terms, I understand, of the Bantu Trust and Land Act.</p>

<p>There are a couple of questions that I would like to put to the hon. the Minister in this connection. First of all, it has been suggested in many parts of South Africa by the council, by the principal, by the president, by many church leaders, by many people from different walks of life, and by the Black students who have been studying there, that the fact that Fort Hare needed extra land on which to develop and that the only possibility was to take over the federal seminary, was not the only reason for the expropriation, but that Fort Hare regarded the seminary as an alien island, if yon like, in that particular area, a source of embarrassment to the Fort Hare authorities, because by the very nature of its life&#x2014;whether the Government accepts it or not&#x2014;the federal seminary was and is a Christian community where there was a great deal of multi-racial contact not only amongst the students but also amongst the staff and the families living there. There are people in Alice, in <span class="col_5411-5412" refersTo="page_1119"/>the seminary and people in many parts of South Africa in top leadership in some of the major churches, the Anglican Church, the Methodist Church, the Lutheran Church, the Congregational Church and the Presbyterian Church, who have come out and said that although this would obviously be a desirable part of the land on which to develop, it was not the only part they could develop and that there were other reasons for the expropriation. I would like the assurance from the hon. the Minister that this is not true, that it is unfounded and that there was no other reason involved.</p>

<p>The second question I would like to ask the hon. the Minister is which Black social, political or religious leaders were consulted before this very far-reaching decision was taken. For my own part, I cannot find any such record of any consultation which was taken. Indeed, some Black leaders are on record as having said that they do not want that federal seminary moved.</p>

<p>The third, question I should like to ask is this: Bearing in mind that the federal council of the seminary, the highest body of that seminary, turned down this offer in April 1973, why was it necessary, in November 1974, to give that seminary, a fully-fledged theological training seminary and a major institution, only 30 days&#x2019; notice&#x003F; Why could this major teaching institution not have been given 12 months&#x2019; notice, once the final and irrevocable decision had been taken, so that they could plan their move, find some other place to go to, and erect other buildings&#x003F;</p>

<p>Finally, now that the deed has been done and the people have left the federal seminary and are in temporary quarters in Umtata, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will allow the seminary to train all its ministers, including Black, Coloured and Indian ministers, together in one situation, as was done in the past, if that is the wish of the seminary, and if not, why not&#x003F; Would he even go so far as to agree to a new scheme, if it is the wish of these major churches, in terms of which all their ministers, including their White ministers, can be trained together in one institution&#x003F; Mr. Chairman, these are important questions. They do affect hundreds and thousands of people in many parts of South Africa. They affect the ministry of the Church. They affect the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa, and therefore I hope that we will get these answers. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to reply briefly to What was said by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. I want to thank him for having raised this matter in the way he did. I may just tell him that the matters he referred to were also mentioned to me by the hon. member in whose constituency these particular people live, the hon. member for De Aar, and that there is merit in what he said. In fact, I told the hon. member for De Aar that I think it is only fair, if people have been enjoying a privilege for years, that their case should be considered as sympathetically as possible. Provision is being made in the Act, in terms of which it will be possible to do this in a proper manner, and I think the hon. member may rest assured that the Deputy Minister of Bantu Affairs will deal with these matters in that way.</p>

<p>Sir, perhaps I should say a few words about the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards at this stage, now that the debate is drawing to a close. I say this because the possibility exists, as a result of the machinery created by means of these administration boards, that a very great service may be rendered to all South Africa&#x2019;s people, and particularly to the Black people served by these boards, if the matter is regarded with the necessary respect and this work is approached with the necessary seriousness. I do not want to bore hon. members with a long account of the introduction of these boards, but I do think that when criticism is expressed, hon. members should be reminded of the fact that the first of these boards was constituted in September 1972. That was not even three years ago, and within that period some of these boards have had to find their feet. In fact, the latest one was only constituted in September 1973.</p>

<p>I want to avail myself of this opportunity to express my thanks to the officials and the members of those boards, who belong to various political parties, for the work they have done. They have laid foundations which will serve as the basis for a great deal of constructive work in the years to come. It will be possible to do this work outside the atmosphere of the party-political arena, where feelings sometimes run high. There are certain qualifications in this regard, and I want to make an appeal this <span class="col_5413-5414" refersTo="page_1120"/>afternoon that these administration boards should be given the necessary assistance, bearing in mind the difficulties they have to contend with. As far as their composition is concerned, you will know that an attempt was made in the first place, apart from the chairman, who I said would be and would remain a political appointment, to compose these boards of representatives of municipalities, on the recommendation of the municipal councils, representatives nominated by commerce and industry and representatives of the organized agricultural sector. Consequently all employers are represented on these councils, and as far as the executive committee is concerned, provision has been made by an amendment to the Act for proper representation there as well.</p>

<p>Now criticism has been expressed about the salaries of the officials, and I want to reply to this again briefly by saying that the officials who were taken over from the municipalities and other bodies were taken over in accordance with the legal provision that no officials who have been employed by local authorities should suffer in respect of their salaries and benefits when they are taken over. This is simply what happened there. Any other additional benefits resulted from the fact that officials who were drawn from the areas of certain boards were sometimes offered greater benefits elsewhere and these had to be adjusted.</p>

<p>But I want to emphasize one important matter in regard to these administration boards this afternoon, because I think it will be necessary next year to consider certain amendments to the Act, which are already under consideration, and because I think it is urgently necessary for us to reflect very seriously on where the administration boards are to go, in the interim period as well, when we shall find it difficult to get the work done. I want to remind you of the fact that the funds of these Bantu Affairs Administration Boards, with which they have to perform their task, are obtained, in the first place, from levy funds for registered labour, in the second place from profits on Bantu beer, and in the third place from house rentals, which, as you know, are simply not a profitable factor. Where local authorities have the benefit of the sale of electricity, property rates, etc., as additional sources of income, the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards do not, and you heard the hue.and cry that was raised, for example, when rentals were increased to bring them into line with rising costs of living and construction.</p>

<p>We should not like to penalize the Bantu, particularly the Bantu who work for our people in the cities and in the rural areas as well, but we shall have to face the fact that the boards cannot succeed in their task if they do not get the necessary funds. I was glad to learn from many people on both sides of the House that consideration would be given to a greater allocation from other sources than those which exist at the moment. But in the meantime the levy funds are there, and I have now learnt to my regret that some municipalities&#x2014;fortunately these were the exceptions&#x2014;have adopted the attitude that they now want to try to make a profit from these Bantu residential areas. Where those municipalities have referred to this matter, even in the municipal associations of the provinces, in terms which implied that these boards were leading a kind of parasitic existence, and threatened to suspend health services and other services, I want to appeal to the inhabitants of South Africa, particularly to the White inhabitants, to tell these municipalities that those Black people have been living there all these years because they have been working for the Whites in those particular prescribed areas, and that any such act would be a disservice, not only to the Blacks, but also to the White employers who make use of those services.</p>

<p>But in the second place there have been protests against these levy fees. I know there is a case to be made out for the fact that our agricultural sector, for example, is protesting against these levy fees, which they have never paid before. I have heard the argument, for example, that no services are provided for people in the rural areas for their Bantu. Sir, I just want to make it quite clear that people who provide accommodation as well, the city dwellers and the mines, have to pay a levy fee which is much higher than the fee paid in the rural areas. The lowest fee is 80 cents, as against the 40 cents which the farmers have to pay. Furthermore I want to say that there are many services which have to be provided for the farming community in respect of recruiting, etc., and which have to be regulated in order to organize them properly, which cannot be done without the competent officials to which the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town referred. Satisfaction cannot be created if they are not prepared to pay for <span class="col_5415-5416" refersTo="page_1121"/>those services. For this reason I want to state as a fact that these levy fees were fixed after thorough consultation with the farming community, led by the Minister of Agriculture, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and the S.A. Agricultural Union. Only then was the 40 cents per labourer in the rural areas, fixed. The S.A. Agricultural Union agreed to this, but now I find that there are protests from every side and that farming communities ask: &#x201C;What services do we get for this&#x003F;&#x201D; I want to tell our farming community, which I consider to be an essential sector, that the services which are not yet being provided properly will be provided properly. I want to tell them, too, that their complaints that the mines, for example, are enticing the labourers away from the farms are receiving attention, since at the behest of the Minister I have personally issued the instruction, which I repeated two weeks ago, that if mines or other groups in non-prescribed areas were to entice labourers away from the farms, all the most stringent methods available to us should be used to nip this in the bud and the mines should be punished for it.</p>

<p>The people on the farms have to be provided with better schools and other facilities. These fees are levied not only to do the usual routine work, but also to make better provision for people in their old age, the elderly Black people in the rural areas. Assistance must also be rendered in regard to school facilities and farmers must be helped to provide other facilities for their labourers. I want to make an urgent appeal to all employers to pay these fees, which are indispensable for the proper organization of our labour pattern, so that we may go about creating a properly organized labour pattern in the country in a calm and reasoned manner and in the best interests of employer and employee, and so that people who are unemployed&#x2014;such as those to whom the hon, member for King William&#x2019;s Town referred&#x2014;may be helped by competent officials to find work, and so that the employers who are unable to obtain employees may be helped to obtain the necessary labour in the interests of the economy of South Africa as a whole. I plead with every one to give the Administration Boards a proper chance and valued assistance in the future for the sake of White and non-White. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to return to a few members who spoke prior to today, so that I can reply to certain points which were raised by those hon. members. The hon. member for Yeoville raised a certain matter. He informed me that he could not be here today, something which I can understand very well. In particular the hon. member discussed the statistics which are used in regard to the recalculation of wages, and such matters. In this regard he referred in particular to the consumer price indices. Quite a lot of what the hon. member said, was correct. The Department of Statistics&#x2014; naturally under the guidance of the Minister of Planning, with whom we are in close contact&#x2014;are at present engaged in an investigation&#x2014;according to the information I received&#x2014;to see to what extent it is possible to make proper surveys and separate calculations in regard to the consumer price indices of the various income groups. It is hoped that these could be used in future. However, I must point out to the hon. member that, according to a wage survey which was carried out, it has been shown that during the period 1971 to 1973 there was an increase of 26,9% in respect of Bantu wages, while the consumer price index over the same period increased by a lower percentage, viz. 21,6%. We realize of course that these matters are very important. Departments other than mine are in fact working with these things, but the hon. member may rest assured that the Government will display the necessary sensitivity and consideration in this regard. As the hon. member for Yeoville knows, there are various economic research bureaux, apart from those which the Government has at its disposal, which are going into these matters. In this way there can always be a kind of comparative interaction between the various bureaux and their findings.</p>

<p>I should like to compliment the hon. member for Johannesburg North on being the only member who referred to the fact that we are for the first time now, in this Budget, applying the new financing formula, in respect of which a Bill was piloted through this House earlier this year. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development dealt with this legislation at the time. I would have thought that the Appropriation Committee would have been the first and most appropriate opportunity to at least draw attention to this fact. I readily <span class="col_5417-5418" refersTo="page_1122"/>understand, and I am not going to take it amiss of the hon. members opposite, if they do not try to discuss the intricacies and complexities and the application of that financing formula, for it is very technical and difficult and one could very easily say the wrong things about it, without in any way wishing to do so. Nevertheless I think that something could have been said about this in general. I want to compliment the hon. member for Johannesburg West on having referred to this, even though it was only by way of a question. Actually it was the duty of the Opposition at least to have raised this matter, even if only by way of a question, but this is simply the kind of Opposition we have. We are struggling to grow accustomed to them, but will simply have to grow accustomed to them as the years go by.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few things with reference to this new formula which has come into operation. I want to express my great appreciation to the Treasury and the Secretary for Finance for the major accommodation and assistance which we received from them in being able to apply the formula so soon after legislation (had been passed, i.e. in the first ensuing Budget, or&#x2014; let me put it in another way&#x2014;for their having compiled the Estimates knowing that we would only be able to finalize the legislation so shortly before the time. Thus helps us a great deal, because it is possible in this way to lay the new foundation for the future as quickly as possible. Because it is of such importance, I want to place on record that the new financing formula for the homelands is being applied for the first time in this Budget. The basis of this financing is the legislation which, as I have already said, was piloted through this House earlier this year. Actually this formula affects only the one component of the entire series of components which comprise this financing, viz. the component which is usually called the &#x201C;statutorily determined components&#x201D;. In regard to this altered basis for the financing formula, I should like to point out a few important matters, for I think it is fitting that this be placed on record in the discussion of this Vote, so shortly after the legislation came into effect.</p>

<p>The first point I wish to state is that all the Bantu homelands in the four provinces, those which already have their own governments, are being brought on to one and the same base year of calculation, i.e. 1973-&#x2019;74, the latest finalized financial year before this Act with its new formula could be applied. This, as a base, results in a better balanced, uniform system of comparison among the various Bantu homelands. A second point I should like to mention, is how this statutory appropriation is calculated. Included in this calculation are all moneys given by the Republic of South Africa from Republican sources for the relevant base year 1973-&#x2019;74, as well as a new element which we are introducing for the first time, i.e. a growth rate for the amount of that base year, a growth rate which has to be determined every time in consultation with the Minister of Finance and in accordance with which the basic amount is then being adjusted, firstly for the ensuing year, 1974-75, which we were unable to use as a base year because we are still too close to the period. Secondly, the growth rate is being applied to the year for which money is now being voted, viz. 1975-&#x2019;76. The growth rate which we agreed to provisionally, was 7<i>%.</i> How long the figure will remain at 7&#x00BD;% we now have to leave as a matter for consultation, as prescribed by the Act, between the Minister and the Minister of Finance. Another important point is that all calculated, indirect duties, i.e. customs, excise and sales duties, etc., which are realized in the Bantu homelands, are according to this formula calculated to the credit of those Bantu homelands. Of course this will constantly have to be recalculated, for these things fluctuate, as we know, and because one has this fluctuation, one eventually achieves a more precise calculation.</p>

<p>I want to mention another important point in regard to these appropriations. It seems to me that although the hon. member for Jeppe is tremendously interested in these things, he is now sitting there, holding a conversation. He would probably wish to know the following point as well. He should listen when I say this, instead of asking the hon. member for Griqualand East. As the indirect taxation is included in the calculation, so, too, all the taxation realized by, shall I say, White companies and branches of companies operating in those homelands is included. This is the point he wanted to know about, not so&#x003F;</p>

He was, however, discussing the previous year. I wonder whether he realizes, as he ought to, that the position is already different now. The staff which are being loaned to the homelands by the Government of the Republic are, as from this year, being loaned to them at the expense of the Republic. This expenditure is no longer being deducted from the grant which they receive.</p>

<p>In future this amount, the total remuneration of all these loaned officials, will no longer be deducted from the amounts which were calculated in the past in accordance with the Act. As a result of this adjustment of amounts in this new financing formula&#x2014;what it really amounts to primarily is an adjustment and an inclusion of certain elements which were previously not there&#x2014;it so happens that the statutory amount is greater and the additional appropriation&#x2014;the last element which is included for the homelands&#x2014;is less than before. The statutory amount has increased now&#x2014;the amount of which the calculation is statutorily determined&#x2014; and the additional amount which we have to give according to available funds, is now less than before. The two together are approximately the same as it has always been or perhaps slightly more. The growth rate to which I referred a moment ago, is not included in this. The additional appropriations are therefore less throughout because the indirect taxation and the other revenue from each homeland is now being added to the statutory amount which I mentioned to hon. members a moment ago. I he new formula therefore makes it possible, with all kinds of financial analyses, for a better picture to be obtained than previously of how self-sufficient each Bantu nation is in financing its own homelands, and also for obtaining a better picture of how much additional assistance the Republic of South Africa should allow to accrue to the Bantu homelands in each Budget. This financing formula is, as many of these formulae are, in a certain sense experimental. It has to be determined experimentally how matters are going to develop in future, as we have seen in past years with regard to the old formula. If it becomes necessary from time to time to revise matters, we shall probably have to do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg West spoke very enthusiastically in favour of a development board, and the interests of the private sector in this. He also mentioned the great economic progress which had been made in the Bantu homelands. One can in fact, on the basis of all kinds of data and criteria, indicate the extent of the economic development of the Bantu homelands. I do not want to tire hon. members with an enormous burden of figures, for I could drown the hon. members in figures from all angles. I simply want to mention a single series of figures from Estimates for the years 1973-&#x2019;74, 1974-&#x2019;75 and the present financial year 1975-&#x2019;76, and refer to the economic development which has been accomplished by the three corporations through which this is being channelled. I shall furnish hon. members with these amounts in a moment. We must realize that the economic development in the Bantu homelands is not being undertaken only by the Bantu Investment Corporation, the Xhosa Development Corporation and the Bantu Mining Corporation. Much additional economic development is being made possible, too, by the South African Bantu Trust, by departments of the various Bantu homelands themselves, and even by certain other departments which are functioning directly and in their own right there. In this way there is, for example, the South African Railways which also operates there in its own right, and the South African Department of Posts and Telecommunications. The three corporations alone have jointly <span class="col_5421-5422" refersTo="page_1124"/>spent R133 700 000 over the three years. To indicate to hon. members how the amounts which were spent rose from year to year, I want to mention the following: In 1973-&#x2019;74 almost R24&#x00BD; million was spent; in the next year, 1974-&#x2019;75, almost R46&#x00BE; million was spent, which was almost twice as much as in the previous year; and in the present year of appropriation almost R63 million will be spent. Jointly, therefore the three corporations spent an amount of R133 700 000. There are other criteria as well with which we can measure this. The entire Budget is there, with the phenomenal figures of which we are aware. When we consider the Budget in its entirety, we see that the spending of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development alone indicates an increase from R137 million to an amount of R575 million for the 1975-&#x2019;76 financial year. Included in this amount is the spending in respect of South West Africa. If we look at Bantu Education, the Vote which will be discussed after this one, we see that the amount in respect of Bantu Education amounts to R72 million. South West Africa is included in that. The total amount for the four provinces and South West Africa is, therefore R647 372 000 for the present financial year, as against R499 590 000, or almost R500 million, for the previous financial year. Therefore, there has been an increase of more than R147 million for the two departments together. These are phenomenal figures.</p>

<p>How can we find all those figures in this Budget&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall give the hon. member a copy of the summary I have here. One can summarize it very easily by simply adding the two columns together. Of course, this could also be done with the previous year&#x2019;s figures. I know that the hon. member does not have the figures for last year and the year before last in front of him, but I will gladly let hon. members opposite have copies of these figures. The hon. member for Edenvale will also want them, for I know he is interested in this matter. I shall gladly furnish these copies after this debate, this evening or tomorrow.</p>

<p>I now want to say something with reference to what was said about the Development Board. Up to now the BIC has been the overall development board for virtually all the territories, the two Xhosa territories excluded, for they are dealt with by the XDC. But we have now decided on a reorganization, as I have already announced. According to the new dispensation the various Bantu homelands will each be given a separate national corporation, with a separate directorate on which, apart from the people nominated by me, people nominated by the governments of the homelands concerned, in other words, citizens from their own ranks, will serve. We will therefore have more concentrated attention on each homeland. I think that it will be conceded that greater concentration by the people of a homeland on their own problems in their own area, in other words, greater decentralization in the approach to the economic task, could be extremely valuable and useful. In addition there will of course still have to be an overall, reorganized Bantu Investment Corporation. We also know that in the private sector&#x2014; that is why I am citing the idea advanced by (the hon. member for Johannesburg West&#x2014;there is talk of a general development or financing bank. I am not referring now to the bank which the Black people themselves wish to establish. As far as the Government is concerned, the Government has, as you will know, already expressed itself in favour, quite some time ago, of such a development or financing bank established by the White private sector of South Africa, a bank for which funds could be mobilized and by means of which funds might even be attracted from interested parties beyond the borders of our country.</p>

<p>With reference to what was said here by the hon. member for Potgietersrus, I should like to say a few things in regard to the BIC. Part of my obligations in this regard have already been carried out this afternoon by my hon. friend, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development, Mr. Raubenheimer. The hon. member for Potgietersrus&#x2014;and I want to thank him for this&#x2014;gave attention to the investigation which was instituted at the request of the BIC into the supposed and alleged irregularities or, to use the ugly term which was used so liberally by all irresponsible people, including certain people sitting on the opposite side in the front benches of this House, to the &#x201C;corruption&#x201D; of which there was mention. We have received the report of the investigation and, although I have already said this in private, I now want to say this in public, too: I express my greatest appreciation to Mr. Prins, the chief magistrate of Pretoria, who found it possible to publish this report very soon after <span class="col_5423-5424" refersTo="page_1125"/>he had completed his investigation. It was published so quickly that we only have it available in one language. The translation into the other language was not yet ready when this report appeared. I regarded it as being so important that I overexerted myself to get the report into the hands of members on the opposite side and on this side, after it had first, of course, been submitted to the State President. With the appointment of a new President, I had to wait for it a few days. I should like to say here that I endorse every word which the hon. the Deputy Minister said here, that, if necessary, I endorse it twice over. It is extremely regrettable that the hon. member for Houghton did not devote a fraction of the attention to his report which she devoted previously to all kinds of stories she picked up. [Interjections.] The hon. member is cackling again. She should listen now, for she has indulged in enough cackling about this matter, and has in any case not laid any eggs.</p>

<p>In all fairness I should quote the entire page which appears at the beginning of the report, the portion in which the magistrate sums up this entire matter. However, it is not necessary. In his report the magistrate states on page 3 that he invited people by way of notification&#x2014;I also did so by way of an appeal and in all kinds of other wavs&#x2014;to come forward and give evidence before him.</p>

<block name="quote">Except for a few members of the BIC internal audit division, and Mr. Gordon Hill, a shopkeeper who at one stage traded with the BIC, no one reacted to this.</block>

<p>In other words, two people reacted to the public invitation and request that they should come forward with their evidence in regard to irregularities and corruption. The hon. member for Houghton did not react to that, not even after I had, from this very bench, made an appeal to her during last year&#x2019;s session to go and; give her evidence before that commission. I maintain that it is extremely reprehensible, unexemplary and unsavoury to adopt this approach to one&#x2019;s obligations as a representative of the people.</p>

<p>Could we have it placed on record now that the hon. member says that this is not true&#x003F; However, we know which of her assurances can be accepted. I looked at the verbatim evidence of the investigation, when the hon. member was participating. There she was in an even greater state of disorganization than the one she is sometimes in in this House. She arrived there with newspaper clippings only, from which her story was put together. She was not even able to put these into proper order; they had to grant her an extension to furnish some of these things at a later stage. She collected some of these things at a later stage. [Interjection.] Oh yes, Sir. They even had to adjourn for a few minutes to give her a chance to rummage for these things in her handbag. Sir, I repeat: The hon. member comes out of this <span class="col_5425-5426" refersTo="page_1126"/>report in a dilapidated state, if not stark naked, and what a spectacle that is!</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As my hon. friend here is saying, the hon. member streaked past this commission. We have a term for it in Afrikaans, i.e. <i>&#x201C;kaalhollery&#x201D;.</i> Sir, while I am dealing with the hon. member now, I want to finish saying what I have to say to her. The hon. member did not present a single piece of evidence here. She came forward with newspaper cuttings, and fabrications of her own. The hon. member ought to have learnt, for once in her life in this House, what the responsibilities are of such a person as she who is a public representative, and the Press, too, ought to realize that when one is dealing with public matters, when one is dealing with such tremendously delicate and sensitive matters as economic affairs, one should not refer in such an irresponsible manner to officials and personalities who cannot defend themselves here and who cannot always, for business reasons, produce the facts at certain times, and that one should not carry on in such a suggestive and reckless manner with the truth, as the hon. member for Houghton did here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>All the questions that I put were answered by you in this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, every person or body involved in public life has to comply with this responsibility. The hon. member should know that there is an enormous difference between real suspicion which one can present in regard to people, and mere gossip, which frequently comes from frustrated, disappointed applicants themselves. The hon. member had a half hour in which to speak. It is true that she did not avail herself of the full half hour, but it is pathetic that she did not, in her entire speech, have a single word to say about the report. She could at least have said: &#x201C;I have taken cognizance of the report,&#x201D; but she did not even say that. This is behaviour of a reprehensible kind which is worthy only of a person of her mentality.</p>

<p>Sir, in contrast to what I have said about that hon. member, I should like to express my greatest appreciation here to the board of the Bantu Investment Corporation for having been voluntarily prepared to throw everything open to scrutiny and to ask for a proper investigation into these subversive stories which were being spread. Sir, I should like to express my personal appreciation, not only to the board and the staff in general, but also to the managing director, Dr. Adendorff&#x2014;my personal appreciation and I hope the appreciation of this House as well. Dr. Adendorff was the founding official of the Bantu Investment Corporation. From the very first day, he has been building the Bantu Investment Corporation. He sacrificed a very certain, Stable career in the Public Service&#x2014;in one of the control boards, if I remember correctly&#x2014;and he went to be of assistance in building this organization, from less than nothing to what it is today. He has already been attached to the Bantu Investment Corporation for 15-16 years, and that the commission was able to write what it did write about him in the last four lines of its report, is a wonderful compliment to Dr. Adendorff. The commission wrote as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your commission is convinced that the managing director, Dr. Adendorff, and the secretariat of the BIC at all times assiduously endeavoured and are still endeavouring to ensure that the good name of the BIC remains unimpeachable at all times.</block>

<p>Sir, we know that one sometimes finds troublesome people working in such a big organization; we know that one is sometimes confronted by troublesome situations; we know that there will sometimes be losses, and we know that sometimes irregularities may even occur, but the people at the top, the people who have to take the initiative, the people on whom one has to rely&#x2014;for neither I nor the department can maintain supervision over those things; this is a separate organization&#x2014;are unimpeachable. I am grateful for this commission&#x2019;s finding in regard to them, and I can only hope&#x2014;I know that this will be the case&#x2014;that this will spur them on to even greater achievements and even greater efforts and good service.</p>

<p>But, Sir, there is also a message in this report. I have already said that in this report there is a message for the hon. member for Houghton, but there is also a message in this report for the Press. The Press ought to know that they, as a responsible public media, cannot simply accept as gospel the views of anyone they encounter. I could entertain you here, Sir, with the enormous banner headlines concerning these <span class="col_5427-5428" refersTo="page_1127"/>matters which appeared in certain English-language newspapers, particularly in two of them, but now, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, there is not even the briefest of reports on this matter, I do not expect those two English-language Sunday newspapers to say &#x201C;we beg your pardon&#x201D;, because they do not have the decency which is harboured in the breast of a person who will apologize. But they could at least have stated that the report had appeared. But they did not even do that. I hope this is because they are utterly ashamed of their behaviour, although I am afraid that it is a kind of sadistic pleasure which they derive from these things, rather than shame, and this applies to the hon. member for Houghton as well. Sir, there is also a message in this for the Bantu, Bantu Affairs officers, Bantu bodies, Bantu Governments and Bantu individuals, viz. that there are business principles which have to be respected and that one&#x2019;s goal should be honesty, and that self-interest cannot be tolerated. This is an important lesson which still has to be learned in so many cases. With that I have now dealt with the report on the Bantu Investment Corporation.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Albany. The other day the hon. member for Albany made a speech here, to which I have already replied. Towards the end of my reply the hon. member put a question, and on that point I wanted to quote my Hansard to you, and then say a few things about the doubtful part he played afterwards, in which he was assiduously aided by one of his cohorts, the <i>Eastern Province Herald.</i> The hon. member for Albany asked me whether he might put a question. The Chair allowed him to do so, and so did I. I said: &#x201C;Please, ask me.&#x201D; I am now quoting from the Hansard, which I have not yet revised. I only received it this morning&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. W. H. D. Deacon: Will something then be done about the present housing shortage in Grahamstown&#x003F;</block>

<p>Then the Minister replies as follows. I am reading every word of the reply. These were the very last words I spoke&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The present housing shortage in Grahamstown will receive the necessary attention as far as the people of Fingo Town are concerned, who have to be assisted with alternative accommodation, and also in so far as other people who are entitled to housing are concerned. I do not want to go into this matter in detail now. It is not necessary. We have already had talks, quite recently in fact. I myself had an appointment with the Government of the Ciskei to discuss this question with them, but then certain unforeseen duties or matters kept me in Cape Town, and it was not possible for me to keep the appointment. However, it is still my intention to discuss this matter personally with the Government of the Ciskei and I shall do so as soon as an opportunity presents itself. I shall try to expedite this.</block>

<p>I then resumed my seat, and then the hon. member for Ladybrand spoke. That is what I said. What happened then&#x003F; Who first contacted whom, I do not know, but a conversation then took place between Mr. Deacon, the hon. member for Albany, and a person whose name I shall, for the sake of fairness, rather not mention now, for I have always had respect for the person, a person who is a representative of that newspaper, the <i>Eastern Province Herald.</i> The next morning, Saturday morning, a tremendous front page report appeared in the <i>Eastern Province Herald,</i> which stated: &#x201C;New Government concessions on Drift issue.&#x201D; Then the following was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, Mr. M. C. Botha, said yesterday that all Africans who qualify under section 10 of the Urban Areas Act would be provided with housing in Grahamstown.</block>

<p>In my entire speech the only words I spoke in regard to Grahamstown are the words I quoted to you a moment ago, and that was with specific reference to the question, apart from the general things I said about the matter. Where did I say these things in that speech&#x003F; Nowhere. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This important concession appears to mean that thousands of Africans with freehold ownership in Fingo Village, may have been given a reprieve.</block>

<p>So it continues and quite a number of things are said to give a completely false picture of my statement, and to arouse even falser expectations among many people. The only thing I can credit this journalist with in the entire report is that at I least he did not omit to say from whom <span class="col_5429-5430" refersTo="page_1128"/>he learnt this or where he received his inspiration from, for I do not know who first approached whom. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Deacon said afterwards &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is after the debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that Mr. Botha&#x2019;s statement indicated that people who were born in Grahamstown, or who had worked there continuously for the past ten years or who had lived there continuously for 15 years, would be allowed to stay.</block>

I think it is a great pity that a journalist of status and experience, knowing what I said, should run to a member of the calibre of the hon. member for Albany, with his ignorance in regard to the matter. The hon. member for Albany is completely ignorant in regard to this matter, and why the journalist ran to him, I do not know. I was here, and could have been approached. The three Deputy Ministers were here, and they could have been approached. There my departmental head is seated, he is available to anyone; so, too, are his senior officials. But not one of them were approached and no attempt was made to find out from anyone of them what all this meant. I do not know why the hon. member for Albany should be used. I want to make it clear here that I do not consider the hon. member for Albany in any way competent or able to interpret my words.</p>

<p>I want to repeat very clearly what I said the other day. I think the newspaper owes this House and me an explanation, for it published false reports from this House, and put words into the mouths of people in this House which they never uttered. This newspaper owes it to this House and to its reading public, which read that incorrect report, to state that it had published an incorrect report, and to state what I did in fact say. In the first place, I replied in principle by saying that the Black people who owned land in Fingo Town would, with their removal from Fingo Town, be cared for so that they would be able to receive freehold rights elsewhere. I said &#x201C;elsewhere&#x201D;, and did not specify where. As far as I am concerned they will even be able to exercise a choice in regard to the matter. Secondly, I stated explicitly&#x2014;and I am saying this again now &#x2014;that we do not want a single person, who has to be removed from Fingo Town and who is legitimately working in Grahams-town, to lose his work through his moving from Fingo Town. I said this here on Friday, and I am saying it again now. I added that we are trying to find the nearest possible place in which to get these people settled, so that a third thing might also happen, viz. that if people are legitimately working in Grahamstown and they are moved, they will not be separated from their families in the new place in which they have to go and live. Even before that I said that there are probably people who are living in Fingo Town who are dependent on people who are working somewhere else altogether. It is not in regard to them that I gave these assurances. I stated it so clearly that a child could understand it, except an ignorant one; an ignorant one would not have understood it in any case. I want to say nothing further about this matter. I want to tell the hon. member for Albany and the journalist that I will reply to nothing further from them before this matter has been rectified.</p>

<p>The hon. member ought to know that there are laws such as the Urban Areas Act, and as far as the homelands are concerned, the Bantu Trust Act and various other acts, as well as regulations, relating to this. In a certain sense the Group Areas Act is also applicable here. Hon. members opposite are simply trying to wriggle out of their own dilemma now.</p>

<p>This will all be done in terms of the Urban Areas Act, but that does not mean to say that they already qualify under section 10.

<p>It may include them, but I did not refer to section 10. The hon. member knows that.</p>

<p>I now want to conclude by replying to the questions put to me this afternoon by the hon. member for Pinelands. During November/December I issued a statement when the notification was served on the Seminary. Recently, after a great many distorted things and misrepresentations appeared in the Press, I again issued a long statement, giving the entire history of this case. Today the hon. member for Pinelands put a few questions to me, to which I want to react. The hon. member wants to know why we only gave 30 days&#x2019; notice. Why did the hon. member sot say what the notice was for&#x003F; It was not to vacate the premises within 30 days. The hon. member nods his head. Apparently he knows that this is so. Why did he not mention it then&#x003F; What does this 30 days&#x2019; notice mean&#x003F; It is a provision of the Expropriation Act that we have to give these people notification of intention to expropriate. We may then, after this period which is prescribed by that Act,&#x2014;I think 30 days is the shortest period&#x2014;as expropriater take freehold ownership of that land, or whatever else it may be. However, this does not mean that the people must, at the same time, vacate the land, that they have to get off the land within 30 days. On the contrary. I think that, in point of fact, we waited a little longer than 30 days before we took over the land, for it was over the Christmas/ New Year period, which is an awkward time, what with all the holidays, etc. We assigned the University of Fort Hare, in whose interest the expropriation is being carried out, to take over the place. Before the time I had had extensive discussions with the rector and other people from the university, and had said that they should not require these people to vacate the land immediately. I had asked them to arrange for the commissioning of the building, because we knew very well that the buildings were not being fully occupied or utilized by the Seminary. I have said that they should arrange the commissioning of the buildings so that Fort Hare could utilize part of the buildings and the other people another part of the buildings. Then, in the course of time, new arrangements could be made for the Seminary. This was the case. The rector of Fort Hare told the Seminary that they could remain in the buildings until a given date. He said that after the given date he only wanted two of the hostel buildings of the college. However, that Seminary did not want to comply with this request on that basis and voluntarily vacated the entire premises themselves. We did not compel them to leave the premises. They could still have been there today, or they could still have been there towards the end of this year, or they could still have been there towards the end of this <span class="col_5433-5434" refersTo="page_1130"/>year, or they could in any case have occupied the remainder of the buildings until a later date which had been agreed on. However, they vacated the entire premises voluntarily, and went to Umtata. The hon. member should therefore understand very clearly that we did not give them notice to leave within 30 days. The notification only indicated that after 30 days we would be the people who would be in charge of those premises. That is what the 30-day notification indicated.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member also asked me whether the reason we gave, viz. that we needed more buildings and more land for the University of Fort Hare, was the only reason for the expropriation or whether there were other reasons as well. The hon. member was not present at a certain interview. A deputation from that institution suggested to me in my office what they thought was another reason. The hon. member, too, virtually stated it this afternoon. I shall come to this in a moment. We gave this as our reason, and this is the real reason why those buildings were required, and the hon. member can go there and he will see that the buildings are in fact being used by the University of Fort Hare. Further development is also going to take place on those grounds. Does the hon. member have easy obscure suspicions that there may be other reasons&#x003F; Then he must say so.</p>

<p>No, I am simply asking.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that there is one other additional little reason. Yes, there is another additional little reason. The hon. member must realize that this institution never used the University of Fort Hare for the ostensible purpose they mentioned to us in 1959, 1960 and 1961. They told us they wanted the land so that their people could be close to an academic university, at which their students could study. Over all the years up to the present I do not know whether a total of 12 to 15 different students have ever been enrolled at the same time. Last year there were none, and the year before last was one. A supplementary and a comparatively speaking unimportant reason is therefore that they never used the institution for the purpose for which they requested it. We have no other place to which to extend Fort Hare, and we therefore need those buildings and that land. Now the hon. member comes forward and states that he wants to tell us that there has always been &#x201C;multi-racial Christian contact&#x201D; at that university. Yes, I know that, that &#x201C;multi-racial Christian contact&#x201D; occurs at other places as well, and has already occurred at other places. At some places it has taken an excesive form, and may perhaps have had to be controlled, but at many places we are satisfied with it. We realize that it can occur. The hon. member asked me what Black leaders had been consulted. I see that the hon. member is laughing now. An old fox does not allow himself to be caught so easily by a young fox! One of the members of the deputation that came here, a clergyman, a serving clergyman and not a former clergyman, also asked me at the conference table to give the names of the Black leaders who were in favour of our actions. I merely laughed and told him that he knew what names he had, and I knew what names I had. I will not make the names public, but we know they are there.</p>

<p>Why not&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not done. I receive these things in a confidential position, and I know how to maintain my confidential position in regard to the Black leaders and the Black Governments in South Africa, and I am most certainly not going to reveal those names for the purposes of those hon. members and perhaps other members as well. The hon. member also asked why we had not allowed the bodies concerned a longer time, and why we had decided to expropriate at this juncture. There were protracted negotiations between the University of Fort Hare and them, and then we had a few problems&#x2014;let me admit it openly&#x2014;for if the expropriations had taken place earlier, we would have had to find the necessary money immediately. We therefore had to wait a while, and we had to take the academic year into account. We did not want to do this in the middle of an academic year. It would have been better if we could have done this between two academic years. That is why we did so at that juncture. I should also like to reply to another unasked question. It is alleged that in 1971 a solemn agreement was concluded that we would never expropriate that property. Those words are contained in the minutes of talks which were held between my two predecessors, Messrs. De Wet Nel and Willie Maree, and the late <span class="col_5435-5436" refersTo="page_1131"/>Mr. Bruce Young, on the one hand, and the representatives of that institution on the other. In the early sixties they discussed this matter with one another. They asked at the time whether they would perhaps have to leave the premises at a later stage. Mr. Young then replied to that. I am sorry that I did not know that this point would be raised, otherwise I could have had the document in front of me. But I shall nevertheless be able to supply the hon. member with it shortly. Mr. Young stated, with reference to a question, that even though the State had the right to expropriate, it did not like expropriating. This is the policy which we have adopted from as far back as I can remember until the present, and one which we shall also adopt in future. We try in all cases to obtain properties which we require through negotiations between a willing buyer and a willing seller. We like reaching an agreement on the price. If we cannot obtain the land in that way, the law allows us&#x2014;this has been the case all these years&#x2014;to expropriate that land. This is precisely what we did in this case. We allowed the University of Fort Hare to negotiate for a long time, but nothing came of it. Since we had to have the land, we then expropriated it. I should like to quote a passage from a statement which I issued recently on this same point, and which I have just received. I think it is worth while placing this on record here. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Seminary authorities and others have repeatedly alleged that the Minister gave a solemn assurance during the interview on the 21st of June 1961 [the Minister concerned was my predecessor] that the property would never be expropriated. According to the record of the interview, the then Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development, Mr. Young, with regard to concern expressed by the church&#x2019;s legal adviser as to the manner of compensation in a then or future expropriation said: &#x201C;That the Government would not wish to exercise its right of expropriation even if it had the legal right to do so.&#x201D; It was not the Government&#x2019;s wish to expropriate the property.</block>

<p>I repeated the same words here today. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For that reason an attempt was made to negotiate with the Seminary in order to conclude a more amicable transition. Expropriation was in fact only considered after it became evident that these negotiations had failed.</block>

<p>That is the point there. I just want the hon. member, and other hon. members as well, to understand this very clearly. I should also like to tell the churchmen&#x2014;and I am not referring now to the hon. member on the opposite side&#x2014;that they, more than any other, should adhere to the true facts. This has not always been done in this case. This brings me to the end of what I wanted to say.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in my short speech I did put one other question which I hoped the hon. the Minister might respond to. I asked him whether, now that the Seminary has been removed from Alice, the hon. the Minister would agree that they be allowed to find a place where they could still operate with African, Coloured, Indian and even perhaps White ministers for their training.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Right from the beginning I gave the assurance to the authorities of the Seminary that I would be quite prepared to offer them other land in a Bantu homeland where they could erect a new institution. I also made that offer to them when they were here earlier this year. I even offered them the assistance of officials to accompany them on trips through Bantu areas to find such land. So far, nothing has materialized but I think they did write to us that they would be prepared to look for such land. What the nature of the new place should be, is not a matter which, in terms of the hon. member&#x2019;s question, is a matter for me only. I am of course concerned with the Bantu persons and not <span class="col_5437-5438" refersTo="page_1132"/>with the Indians, the Coloureds or the Whites in this connection. In other words, in respect of the other race groups, the question of the hon. member must not be put to me.</p>

We were not over-hasty in getting them out there. It was they who were over-hasty about leaving.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I rise to mention that my hon. friend, the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, will take charge of this Vote. While I am on my feet, you must please allow me to make one or two announcements which I think are of importance. In the first place, I want to make an announcement which also arises from the meeting the hon. the Prime Minister and I and others had with the Bantu leaders earlier this year.</p>

<p>&#x2020;This matter concerns the medium of instruction in the White areas.</p>

<p>Careful consideration was given to the suggestion made during the discussions between the Chief Ministers and the hon. the Prims Minister during January of the current year that the medium of instruction in Bantu schools in the White areas should be the same as that in schools in the corresponding homeland. For educational, practical and general policy reasons we cannot accede to this request. Over and above the sound educational principle of mother tongue instruction which receives universal recognition, including that of Unesco, it must be realized that the heterogeneous composition of the population in White areas will cause utter confusion in the schools if differing systems are to be introduced according to the wishes of the various different homelands. In addition the Government of the Republic of South Africa cannot approve the use of only one of the official languages as medium if this should be the wish of some of the homelands. The Government of the Republic of South Africa holds the view that both official languages must be used as the medium of instruction if the relevant Bantu language is not used for this purpose.</p>

<p>*I also want to make a second statement and then I shall have finished. This concerns medical, dental and veterinary training for Bantu persons in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the past years, the Department of Bantu Education and I have, in co-operation with the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and also with the Department of Health and other experts, investigated the desirability of and the necessity for making provision for the establishment of a university institution for the training of Bantu students as medical practitioners, as dentists and as veterinary surgeons. It is being appreciated that there is a definite need for trained Bantu professional people in these three groups. Now I am pleased to be able to announce that the Government has given its approval to the establishment of a university institution which will provide for these three faculties. It is the intention that such an institution be established near Ga Rankuwa where a reasonably large and new hospital has already been established. The hospital and <span class="col_5439-5440" refersTo="page_1133"/>the academic institution will then form one autonomous unit under the control of a statutory board. I want to emphasize that from our side, the co-operation of the existing three universities of the Bantu, of the Bantu governments of the homelands and of the two universities with similar faculties which are situated nearby, viz. the University of Pretoria and the University of the Witwatersrand, is desired. The Government is of the opinion that at this proposed university institution provision should be made for the training of Bantu students from the ranks of all the Bantu peoples of South Africa, and for that reason we should like all the Bantu governments to participate in this undertaking, so that the institution will really belong equally to all the Bantu peoples. Everything possible will be done to institute the necessary planning without loss of time and to make a start with the training of the students.</p>

<p>I hope it will be understood that it is not possible to give full particulars, at this very early stage, about dates of commencement, for example, and several other matters.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I ask leave to make use of the privilege of the half hour, although I shall not use it fully. I want to say immediately that I took note of the announcements made by the hon. the Minister about the question of the language medium with great interest. In this connection, I just want to say that our criterion should obviously be what the Black people want themselves. Just as one would like to recognize the equality of the two White languages, so the request of the homeland leaders in this connection should also be decisive. Sir, it was with joy that I took note of the decision to establish a separate medical school near Ga Rankuwa. I think it is high time that proper provision be made for the training of Bantu in this direction. I cannot judge the full implications thereof at this stage, but the pattern which we know in South Africa, is that a medical school is usually linked to a particular university institution, with the exception of Onderstepoort, as far as veterinary science is concerned. Therefore, in respect of the South African pattern of medical training, a new system is being introduced which has wide implications &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to indicate that it is necessarily an incorrect development. I am merely drawing attention to the fact that it is an innovation for South Africa, because the location of a medical school is usually determined by the availability of hospital facilities, a sufficiency of cadavers and similar facilities.</p>

<p>Sir, in connection with Bantu education, I want to express my appreciation for the availability of this report at this early stage, and for the great wealth of information which is included in the report. I want to say immediately that this side of the House is appreciative of the dedication of the officials and of the great task which they are doing in this connection. For the edification of the hon. member for Omaruru, whom I do not see in the House at this moment, I just want to say that there is certainly appreciation from our side for the progress being made in the field of Bantu education. In this connection I want to mention especially the increase of 201 000 in the number of children at school; the increase in the number of aspirant teachers from 11 173 in 1973 to 12 793 in 1974; the establishment of new training schools and the planning of a further six which the department envisages; the larger percentage increase of pupils at secondary level, viz. over 28 000; the in-service training of teachers (3 500); the progress with the establishment of the departmental industrial training centres&#x2014;four of the envisaged eight&#x2014;and the private industrial training centres of which one has already started functioning in Bloemfontein; and also the establishment of a permanent committee for the financing of the Black universities. Mr. Chairman, other speakers after me will deal with specific aspects, but, at this stage, I just want to say this: While I express my appreciation, on the one hand, for the progress which has been made, it is nevertheless very clear that serious bottlenecks in education do exist&#x2014; and it must not be held against me if I point out those bottlenecks. On page 4 of <span class="col_5441-5442" refersTo="page_1134"/>this report, it is very clearly and honestly admitted, as one would expect of the type of person who is in the service of Bantu Education, and in fact, as we would also expect of the hon. the Deputy Minister, that there are serious bottlenecks and shortcomings. The Government is not fully responsible for some of those bottlenecks, but it is responsible for others. The hard fact that for many years the allocation for Bantu education from the Treasury was pegged at R13 million, is most certainly a serious factor in this tremendous backlog which we have today in respect of teachers, schools, pupils, etc. We cannot get away from that. Hon. members must not get excited when I say that, as if it is something which I am sucking out of my thumb. In this connection, I just want to point out &#x2014;I shall be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister will give this his attention&#x2014;that I have received complaints from schools here in the Peninsula in connection with the non-delivery or the late delivery of school books. I need not give the details. I shall be grateful if attention is given to that. It is an impossible situation in respect of those books which are delivered that as many as four children have to work from one book. Apart from that, I want to point out that here, as elsewhere, the accommodation problem is really untenable. For 670 children in the primary school at Guguletu, there are only nine classrooms, with the result that they have to hire a church hall especially, for which they have to pay R21 a month from their own funds. I can mention more of these problems. I do not think they are unknown to the department. But I do want to say, none the less, that I think that the school situation here in the Peninsula requires special attention.</p>

<p>The hard fact is that the total expenditure <i>per capita</i> for Bantu education simply compares so hopelessly with that of White education, that we cannot accept this situation resignedly. It does not get us anywhere to offer the excuse and to make the comparison that so much more is done in respect of Bantu education than in the rest of Africa. It is an argument which we hear time after time in this House, but it is an argument which really does not hold water. It means nothing, because it is only within the framework of this society, in respect of the funds which this society has at its disposal, in respect of the comparison which exists here between Blacks and others, that we can make these comparisons, and not with other societies, where these factors do not apply.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question&#x003F; I want to ask the hon. member whether he thinks that it is possible for us to provide for all these needs, as the hon. member puts it, taking into consideration the amazingly rapid population growth among the Bantu.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#olivier">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the reply to that is very simple. If we utilize all our manpower to the full in the economic development of this country, it will certainly be possible to provide precisely the same facilities for those people over a period of time&#x2014;I do not say immediately&#x2014;as the Whites enjoy. It is not from a lack of appreciation that I say these things, but the <i>per capita</i> expenditure in 1973-&#x2019;74 for Bantu was approximately R29 as against, for Whites, R387 in the Transvaal, R490 in the Cape Province, R557 in Natal and R495 in the Orange Free State. I actually say this to help the hon. the Deputy Minister and the department to encourage the Treasury to be much more generous in their allocations for Bantu Education than has been the case up to now.</p>

<p>I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to inform us on a few points which I want to outline in brief. These are matters which were before the Advisory Board for Bantu Education. I refer in particular to the reduction of the admission age of pupils from seven to six years, mentioned on page 94 of the report; the question of apprenticeship&#x2014;because we have often discussed this&#x2014;and job opportunities for pupils trained in vocational and technical schools; the training of secondary teachers; and the advisability of the introduction of compulsory education. I must say, Sir, I had hoped that this would have been the sort of announcement which the Minister would have given us here, and that they would have decided in principle to begin with compulsory school education for the Bantu, at least in the urban areas. And, finally, there is the need for a medical school, but we have now been told of this and I have expressed my appreciation for it. We have taken cognizance of the high percentage of unqualified teachers on the staff of primary schools, viz. 17,6%, and the admission on the part of the department that this percentage is far too high. Therefore, it is one of the bottlenecks which must be removed. As long as there <span class="col_5443-5444" refersTo="page_1135"/>are a large number of children who drop out, we cannot have a proper system of Bantu education in South Africa. In this connection, I should like to point out the particulars contained in the report on page 94. The number of candidates for Std. 6 examinations was 178 795. That number decreased, in the case of the Junior Certificate (Form 111) to 39 302, and in the case of the Senior Certificate and matriculation, to a mere 6 420. It is very clear that we in South Africa cannot continue to make provision only to this extent for the training of pupils and of teachers, if proper development is to take place in the Bantu society. In the limited time at my disposal, before I continue with further particulars, I should like to propose that consideration be given&#x2014;and this can only be done by means of expert inquiry&#x2014;to what the needs in the South African community for trained Bantu will be in the course of the next ten years. It is totally inconceivable for us to continue on this scale. The training of the Bantu, in terms of the economic development of the country and the necessity for the provision of the necessary professional people, and for the training of the necessary technicians and semi-technical people to cary the economic and social developments, can simply not be done on the basis on which we are continuing here. I want to suggest earnestly&#x2014;we have had examples of this in other countries&#x2014;that the time has arrived for planning to be undertaken on a ten-year basis. We must try&#x2014;and I assume that the HSRC and the CSIR and other bodies will be only too pleased to participate in such an inquiry&#x2014; to draft a plan, in terms of the needs of this community over the next ten years, of what we must achieve in these ten years in the training of people and in respect of school facilities which have to be provided for Bantu children. It is not enough that we merely add an <i>ad hoc</i> amount each year in respect of the needs which exist. In other words, I feel the necessity for long-term planning in this connection.</p>

<p>I also want to put particular emphasis on the pre-school child for whom, as far as the Bantu are concerned, very little has been done up to now. It is a recognized fact that the intellectual ability of a child develops, for the largest part, within the first seven years of his life. If that intellectual stimulus is lacking in those seven years, it is virtually impossible for a normal child to make up that lost ground properly, in spite of facilities. That is one of the primary reasons why we have such a high percentage of children at the non-White schools&#x2014;this applies to the Coloured and the Bantu&#x2014;who cannot progress beyond Std. 2. Experience has taught that many of these children are not even in a position to understand the teacher properly, because their vocabulary is simply not sufficient for them to be able to make full use of the facilities in the school. It is very clear that if we want to bring about proper development and especially if we want to curb the high rate at which children leave school at an early stage, we shall have to give serious attention to the training of the pre-school child. In this connection, I specially want to emphasize that the introduction of television can be a tremendous additional aid. I should like to suggest, as I know some of the officials have already done, that special attention be given to the introduction of a scheme similar to the <i>Sesame Street</i> programme, which has made such a major contribution to the elimination of illiteracy among the American population, especially the American Black population. In the third place, I want to repeat what I said earlier, viz. that the time has now come for us to give really serious consideration to the introduction of compulsory education for children in all our urban areas. When I speak of urban areas, I do not mean only those urban areas which are situated outside the homelands. Places such as Seshego and others certainly have as great a need for compulsory education as other places. The time has also come for this policy of not building more high schools in our cities, to be taken into reconsideration. On an earlier occasion, I already asked the hon. the Deputy Minister earnestly to revise that policy. It is very clear that concentration on the building of hostels in and the shifting of children to the homelands, is a policy which will not succeed and, in fact, in my opinion, puts obstacles in the way of the development of proper Bantu education. Now I must not be told that we are strengthening the people&#x2019;s identity ties thereby. One hears here every day, in any case, that the urban Bantu does maintain his identity. In that case, surely it is not necessary to say that he must go to his homeland. We can surely not use both arguments. If it is so that we need not fear that the Bantu in the city is going to lose his identity and cut off his ties with his own national context, then we cannot <span class="col_5445-5446" refersTo="page_1136"/>also use the argument that we must take him there to strengthen those ties.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. J. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>I have never said that the urban Bantu does lose his identity. Time does not permit, but if one looks at the number of people who qualified at our Black universities, and compare that with the need which exists, it is simply an impossible situation. This is especially true when one looks at the possible future development of the Bantu population. If I am right, there were 442 Bantu students who received degrees at the various Black universities last year. There were 91 at For Hare, 129 at the University of the North, 94 at the University of Zululand, 106 at the University of South Africa, and 22 at the University of Natal. It is calculated that by the end of 1973 there were only about 5 097 Bantu who had received degrees through the years in South Africa. To that one can contrast the 13 904 degrees and diplomas which had been awarded to White students in South Africa in 1973. When one keeps the relative numerical strength of the different population groups in mind, it gives one an indication of the tremendous backlog which we have in this connection and of the necessity that we move much faster than we have up to now. Unfortunately, time does not permit me to go into further details, but I do must want to say that if there is one overwhelming realization, apart from the progress which has been made, then it is that we, when we look at these particulars, are not coming anywhere near doing what we ought to do in this field.</p>

<p>Chairman, it is interesting to speak after the hon. member for Edenvale in this House, especially if one not only takes his political career into consideration, but also goes reasonably far back into his public career. Then one cannot but come to the conclusion that the hon. member is suffering from loss of memory. When one reads what the hon. member wrote in the forties and fifties in respect of this same policy, and what logic there was in his arguments, one sees that they are such we would be able to make use of those writings today&#x2014; even I would be able to do so&#x2014;in the unfolding of our policy. The problem is, however, that the moment one becomes a United Party supporter, one begins to suffer from loss of memory. Only when a man comes over to this side of the House, and becomes a thinker who bases his thinking on principles, does logic return. The latest thing is that we may not compare circumstances prevailing in South Africa to those prevailing in Africa or in the rest of the world. That is an absurd sort of reasoning.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bryanston must keep quiet. He received his first hiding in public life from me and he will also get the second one from me. Surely this is absurd reasoning. The liberalists are the very people who say every day how badly things are going in Africa and in South Africa. Then we should compare Africa and South Africa to the rest of the world so as to become enlightened. We must look at what is happening in the rest of the world. We are the people who are always accused of having a laager mentality. We cannot move out nor can we be expansive in our thinking. We on this side of the House, who follow a policy of separate development, however, are the very ones who have the right to compare ourselves to the rest of the world and the rest of Africa. We are specifically accused of not treating people in accordance with human dignity. The hon. member for Bryanston always says that we think these people are not people. If we then make comparative analyses, we are wrong. From the point of view of the liberalists, a Nationalist can simply never be right. He is always on the wrong side.</p>

<p>One cannot really argue the population issues and Bantu education today if one does not see these in an historical light. That hon. member has not been on that side of the House for a very long time. He must go back and look at the origin of Bantu education in South Africa. He must look at what the National Party inherited from the imperialists and the United Party, when it took over Bantu education. We had nothing. We simply stated as our basic premise that there are a variety of peoples in South Africa and that in that variety, there are people who had a pattern of education of their own, whether this was modern or primitive. Our basic premise was that those people have a particular <span class="col_5447-5448" refersTo="page_1137"/>culture and educational system and that we should link up with that. We started on a small scale. When we started at the primary level&#x2014;the hon. member spoke of the preschool level, the first seven years&#x2014;there was a standpoint about education on that side of the House in terms of which they only looked at the tertiary level, only at the universities. All they fought about was our taking the Bantu students away from the White universities. They did not concern themselves at all about the broader basis of the pyramid which we had to build. This report is proof of the success of the National Party. If we boast of this today&#x2014; and we can indeed boast of it&#x2014;it does not mean that there are no shortcomings. We who began Bantu education, and struggle with it daily, are the very ones who know the problems. Therefore the Secretary for Bantu Education could write the following, on page 2 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From an analysis of the task of this department as reflected in the annual report it is immediately clear that education is basically a long-term undertaking. On the other hand there is the well-nigh phenomenal development of the various nations to be served, with the resultant abnormal, urgent educational needs. In such conditions a situation making high demands upon an educational system naturally arises. It must then also be accepted that certain bottlenecks are inevitable.</block>

<p>We realize all too well what bottlenecks there are in Bantu education. But I want to deal with a different point today. I want to tell the hon. member for Edenvale that I wish that he and I had a day longer to talk about these matters. As an ex-minister of religion, I would be able to convert that hon. member back to the straight and narrow path.</p>

<p>Perhaps he is an ex-elder; I do not know. There are quite a few other hon. members whom I shall also like to get at. I want to say today in this House that the ingratitude on the part of the liberal world amazes me. Here in South Africa we have a Bantu education policy which is stimulated and planned by the so-called suppressors of the Black people. Prof. Jackson, a well-known academic, made a speech at the University of South Africa on the occasion of a graduation ceremony. He comes from the University of the Witwatersrand and as far as his politics is concerned, I do not want to link him, because in my opinion he gives a completely objective view. His view is not that of this side or that of that side, but one can see that he is a man who has a certain insight in respect of Bantu education and in respect of tertiary education. In his speech he said:</p>

<block name="quote">A great deal of money and energy have been devoted to building up these separate institutions.</block>

<p>He is speaking here of the separate universities. He proceeded:</p>

<block name="quote">These facilities are admirable and the non-White universities have attracted to their service a group of persons, mainly Afrikaans-speaking, who have served the cause of non-White education with notable devotion and diligence. Their roles have not always been easy or happy.</block>

<p>Today I should like to pay tribute to those Whites who have continued calmly under the most difficult of circumstances to bring the modern educational principles and ideas home to the Bantu population groups. When they commenced their task, their work was made tremendously more difficult, or as is said in this speech, &#x201C;Their roles have not always been easy or happy&#x201D;. This &#x201C;easy&#x201D; and &#x201C;happy&#x201D; is determined by the fact that we in South Africa have had not only liberalists, but also vandals, people who simply never saw what the realities were and who came forward in a spirit of perversity to change the basic structures in South Africa. The fact that it was neither easy nor happy, had its origin in the fact that we were dealing with people who did not have any conception of cultural identities and in that way made the work of these people more difficult. Therefore the monument for Bantu education is even more worthy because we have achieved so much success against the onslaught of these people. Bantu education has been much belittled by the liberalists. In the book <i>Trends and Challenges in the Education of the South African Bantu,</i> W. M. Kgware wrote several things which I want to quote. The book is somewhat dated&#x2014;it is about three years old&#x2014;but he wrote the following in an article under the title, &#x201C;The present revolution <span class="col_5449-5450" refersTo="page_1138"/>in Bantu education and its implications for the future&#x201D; on page 65:</p>

<block name="quote">There was a time when African education was thought to have the same objectives as the education of the Western countries that had come to colonized Africa. The aim of African education then was stated in unequivocal terms, viz. to christianize and to westernize the African, to make him a Black Englishman or Black Frenchman &#x2026;</block>

<p>or Black Progressive, or whatever we want to call it. I quote further:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and we in South Africa are involved in this change. Education has become a major if not the major concern of the new independent States of Africa. For the teeming millions of middle Africa in particular education is regarded as the key that will open the door to a better life socially, economically, culturally and nationally. But it is not any education that the Africans are yearning for. What they want is an education that will help them realize themselves as Africans. It is African education, education that will help develop what former Pres. Nkrumah of Ghana has called &#x201C;the African personality&#x201D;.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. W. MILLS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rissik should have been a propaganda stooge. He oozes such self-satisfaction and brag. I am afraid I cannot agree with the extreme praise he loads on the department because, where he sees monumental achievement, I see a monumental vacuum which makes the big hole of Kimberley look like a pinprick in the ground. Almost every section of this department is plagued by shortages. Despite the efforts which are being made to bridge the gap between supply and demand, the gap is not being closed. Shortage is the key word. We have shortages of classrooms, books, teachers, matriculants, and university graduates. Technicians and artisans are in short supply. The amount of money that is voted to this department is also meagre. In fact, there is only one thing that is not in short supply and that is the number of Bantu who want education. In this respect there is a glut. There can be no doubt that the hon. the Deputy Minister is well aware of the difficulties. His departmental report openly admits that there are problems and that it must be accepted that bottlenecks are inevitable. Of course, if the Government continues with its present policy, these bottlenecks will continue as well. When it comes to the stage where we as an Opposition do not have to battle to discover the problems as they are openly admitted in the report, we feel a crisis situation has developed in this department. I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister is going to effect some dynamic changes to meet this crisis. For instance, if one examines the figures for pupil enrolment, one see that the average annual increase in the enrolment of Bantu pupils taken over the past seven years has been approximately 200 000. The Bantu population during the previous seven years, from 1961 to 1967 showed an average yearly net increase of 320 000. The conclusion one must come to is that thousands of Bantu applicants are being turned away from schools. In other words, they do not get a formal education. It is denied them and they have to face the prospect of a life of poverty on the outskirts of society where, as I think the hon. the Deputy Minister knows very well, crime is an easy next step.</p>

<p>If, again looking at this report, one considers the position in regard to teacher training, one sees that the average number of teachers trained over the past four years was approximately 4 000 per year. That makes the average pupil: teacher ratio 50:1. Approximately one-fifth or 11 673 of these teachers are involved in double sessions at which over one million Bantu pupils are taught. Of the total number of teachers of 62 879, 17,6% have no qualifications at all. These figures of pupil involvement and teachers trained show, firstly, a picture of thousands of Bantu children who just cannot be given formal schooling and, secondly, that those children who can get into a classroom often experience crowded conditions of 50 pupils to a class. I ask you, Mr. Chairman, whether this cannot be considered a critical position. I want to ask <span class="col_5451-5452" refersTo="page_1139"/>the hon. member for Rissik if he still thinks it is such a wonderful position.</p>

<p>I should like to go further and refer again to the 11 673 teachers who at double sessions teach over a million Bantu children. In my opinion we have another Victorian treadmill situation here except that the victims are teachers who overworked and under-supplied toil dismally to impart the rudimentary scraps of education to children who are eager for enlightenment. That is the morning shift. In the afternoon there is a fresh batch of 50 or more children eager for knowledge that this poor teacher has to accommodate. I feel that the double session system is a soul-destroying abomination and must be removed. In its report released in 1975 the commission on education appointed by the Transkeian Government commented that very little is achieved except that the drop-out rate increases. Rebelliousness, poor health and lack of incentive among the pupils exist and disillusionment and resignations among the teachers are the unhappy consequences.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Bantu education is in need of massive reorientation. There was some indication on the part of the hon. the Deputy Minister this afternoon that there might be some news for us in this connection. It would seem that a reexamination of policy, of approach and of finance is an urgent necessity. The hon. the Deputy Minister made an impassioned plea to the House last week. He said that Nationalist policy was not one of the suppression of people. We accept the fact that the hon. the Deputy Minister is a man of sincerity. I hope that he was referring in his statement to a re-direction of policy in Bantu education. Progress is undoubtedly being made. Schools are being built. This year five new teacher training colleges are to be opened and I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister in his reply to tell us how many teachers it is envisaged will be trained in these five new institutions. Audiovisual aids are being introduced where there is electricity and the new central library scheme is in operation. However these to us are incidentals. What in our opinion is required is free and compulsory schooling, equal salary scales and merit promotion. The hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Development also said last week that it was time the Bantu got on to helping themselves. This is a laudable comment except that I want to say that one has to give them the tools with which to help themselves. I should like to refer to an article which appeared in <i>The Star</i> headlined &#x201C;No books so no education&#x201D;. This report states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Books and uniforms are the biggest burdens on Africans struggling to provide an education for their children. Their education is neither compulsory nor free in that they have to buy most of the books themselves whereas these are supplied free in White schools. Without books the pupil cannot learn; explained one principal.</block>

<p>I am sure they want to get on and do the job and they must be assisted to do this in the same way as Whites are. So much for policy changes.</p>

<p>I want to refer in the second instance to revised methods. It is no longer acceptable that the Government openly confesses to the fact that there is a shortage of teachers, that there is a backlog in the training of teachers and that 11 000 plus are unqualified while at the same time it continues with a system which obviously generates this problem. In this next year we will have the advent of television, and I want to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that here is an opportunity where, in conjunction with the hon. the Minister of Health, he could benefit. Not only will communal TV sets in every village decrease the birth rate; TV can also act as a teaching aid to supplement the teacher shortage. If programmes like <i>Sesame Street</i> in the United States are televised, the word-power of the pre-school-going child will be developed. Such progress will help considerably towards avoiding the communications gap which stunts the pupil&#x2019;s later advance and contributes largely to the dropout rate in primary schools.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to deal with the question of finance. It seems to me that if the Government is to avoid the danger of this deteriorating situation&#x2014;the lack of education for the Bantu&#x2014;the Department of Bantu Education must be given a higher rating in Cabinet priorities when the Budget is prepared. What can be achieved with an increase in expenditure of only R9 million&#x003F; I submit that the figure should be more like R90 million. To a large extent the Government is reaping the fruits of the dark ages of the sixties. During the period 1960 to 1969 the expenditure on Bantu Education crawled up to only R23 million. The hon. the Deputy Minister is aware of the financial demands in this regard. He <span class="col_5453-5454" refersTo="page_1140"/>himself said last week that we must bend the economy to prevent people turning into rapists and murderers. These are powerful words. He does get support from the private sector in his comments, but I feel that he has left out an acknowledgment to the English Press for its outstanding contribution towards Bantu education. To date the figure is R1&#x00BD; million. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. J. LE ROUX (Hercules)</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. members for Edenvale and Pietermaritzburg Central accused the Government of something of which it is entirely innocent. They took it amiss of the Government that the education of the Bantu was not equal to that of the Whites. They also stated that the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on Bantu education compared poorly with that of the Whites. We must go back to see where this comes from. There are two problems in particular. The first was the backlog which the National Party inherited from the United Party. There was an enormous backlog in this connection. In the second place there is the tremendous population increase among the Bantu. They do not refer to that. According to the mid-year estimate by the Department of Statistics based on the censusses of 1960 and 1970, the population increase among the Blacks for 1971-&#x2019;72, for example, was calculated at 2,83%, and that of the Whites at 1,45%. That makes all the difference. However, they do not look at that. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg Central also said that we should give the Bantu the tools and let them undertake their education themselves. Surely they have the tools. They can make a major contribution to their own education by improving the <i>per capita</i> expenditure by means of controlled population increase. That they will never discuss.</p>

<p>When discussing family planning and control of the increase in the population, we must bear two basic principles in mind, principles which do not concern statistics as such. The first is the economic welfare of the family and the second is the personal welfare of the family. There is nothing wrong with taking these two basic principles into account when dealing with family planning and a population explosion.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with a matter of which this hon. House must take cognizance. I should like to pay tribute to private bodies. In the first place I want to say that as regards the farming community, which has been much criticized here by the Opposition, that community is responsible for 3 800 farm schools which are established at the moment and which accommodate about 400 000 Black pupils. On a basis R1 500 per class-room, the farming community in our country has already spent R7&#x00BD; million on education for its Black farm workers. This is a praiseworthy achievement. The hon. Opposition would do very well to follow this example.</p>

<p>I now come to the study trust fund. This is a fund established last year from the heart of the Afrikaans-speaking section, a section which experienced the same problems in regard to its education in the past. At the beginning of this year this study trust fund had already made 60 bursaries available to students to the value of R7 000. Hon. members who are interested in contributing to the study trust fund may contact the hon. member for Johannesburg West or me. Then, too, Sir, there is <i>The Star</i> fund. <i>The Star</i> established its fund with a contribution of R2 920 out of its own pocket. Two months later this fund had been boosted to R15 000. Work has now started on the first school of 12 class-rooms at a cost of R18 600. Momentum was imparted to this fund when a prominent Johannesburg businessman donated R1 500 to the fund&#x2014;the cost of one class-room&#x2014; and others asked to do the same. In its first one and a half years, this fund has paid for the construction&#x201D; of 13 primary schools and the completion of one secondary school in Soweto. In 1973 <i>The Star</i> donated R25 000 to this fund to provide for a 12-classroom primary school. To date, 13 companies and one anonymous businessman have donated R25 000 for schools on the East and West Rand. Over the past 3&#x00BD; years, since the inception of the fund, at least 50 primary and junior secondary schools have been constructed in co-operation with the local authorities. In this way school facilities have been provided for more than 18 000 pupils on the West Rand. One can only convey one&#x2019;s appreciation to the donors. White, Brown, Black and Asian businessmen have contributed, and English-and Afrikaans-speaking individuals as well. Others, too, Sir, have been inspired by <i>The Star&#x2019;s</i> action and today this fund amounts to R1 138 000. Apart from <i>The Star&#x2019;s</i> fund, there is <i>The Argus</i> Teach Fund, the <i>Daily News</i> Learn Fund and the <i>Pretoria News</i> Learn Fund. Altogether, these four Teach and Learn Funds have collected almost R2 million. This is an achievement of which we must take cognizance. <span class="col_5455-5456" refersTo="page_1141"/>In three years, <i>The Argus</i> has collected R245 882 for the establishment of five schools, accommodating 5 000 pupils. The <i>Pretoria News</i> Learn Fund was established in May 1974 and has already collected more than R60 000. The biggest donor was the South African Citrus Fund. It would perhaps interest hon. members to know that the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education, Mr. Janson, has also contributed to this fund. Sir, the school for the Zulu community in Mamelodi is to be completed within a few weeks&#x2019; time and will accommodate 600 pupils. This school is being financed by the <i>Pretoria News</i> Learn Fund. Sir, when we consider these achievements on the part of private initiative, then we want to invite the Opposition, too, to consider what they can do. We know what the Department of Bantu Education has achieved in this regard. [Interjection.] Sir, the attitude of hon. members of the Opposition is that more and more services must be provided, but they are not prepared to pay the higher tax that must be lcvied if those services are to be provided. That is the mentality of the Opposition. I want to urge them to take more a positive interest in matters of this nature; to be more helpful to the Government and to level less criticism&#x2014;undeserved criticism&#x2014;at this National Party Government, which has done more for Bantu education than any of its predecessors, and more than the party on that side would do if they were ever to come to power. Sir, the Department of Bantu Education has succeeded in effecting phenomenal growth in the sphere of Bantu education, and we owe them a debt of gratitude in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I want to begin by congratulating the hon. the Minister and the Government on the important announcement the hon. the Minister made here this afternoon in respect of the establishment of a special medical, veterinary and dental school at Ga Rankuwa. Sir, this is a very long felt need of all Black universities, and I am speaking here as a member of the council of one of those universities. I think the Government is to be congratulated on the method it is using to supplement the appalling shortage of doctors among our Blacks. In this way considerable duplication of staff and facilities, which is naturally expensive, is eliminated, and I believe that we shall give our Blacks the best service in respect of this particular training too.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Sir, I wish to refer, however, to a speech made earlier here this afternoon by the hon. member for Pinelands. I daresay that he was more responsible in his approach here this afternoon than he was when he reacted in the Press to the expropriation of the federal theological seminary at Alice, because this is what the hon. member said on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The take-over of the federal theological seminary was described yesterday as an act of piracy, because it was an embarrassment to Fort Hare. This description came from the former president of the Methodist Church and present M.P. for Pinelands, Dr. A. L. Boraine, who was reacting to a statement issued this week by the Minister of Bantu Administration.</block>

<p>The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Boraine said it was astonishing that the Minister should make a statement at this late stage.</block>

<p>Sir, why did the hon. member for Pinelands have to resort to this type of comment&#x003F; Either he was intentionally objectionable, or he was not aware of the true facts. Sir, this statement was issued on 25 April of this year.

<p>Sir, I want to object most strongly to this type of statement being mads in the public Press by people who are supposed to hold responsible positions. But, Sir, one does of course have this problem with the hon. member that one does not know whether he is posing as a minister of religion in this House or whether he is posing as a politician outside. Not for a long time, Sir, <span class="col_5457-5458" refersTo="page_1142"/>has such a climate been created around an event as has been created in this case by ecclesiastical bodies and people in the service of churches. Sir, I want to make it very clear that I have the highest regard for churches. I am not attacking any church, but when bodies such as these make derogatory remarks and misrepresentations and spread half-truths under the cloak of churches, I revolt against it, and I do not want this to be interpreted as a revolt against the churches. Sir, what did the Bishop of Johannesburg have to say about this event&#x003F; I quote from the <i>Cape Times</i> of 26 April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It rather looks like a major attack on the church and is certainly at variance with the claim that we are a Christian country.</block>

<p>Sir, I reject this man&#x2019;s opinion on our Christianity in this country with the contempt it deserves. Obviously he does not know what is happening in this country. But this type of remark is made because there are hon. members sitting here in this House instigating and helping these people to make this type of remark. In this connection I want to refer to another little publication, <i>Outlook,</i> which says the following about itself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has sought to place its readers in possession of facts and opinions which bear upon the lives of all the people of this subcontinent.</block>

<p>But then the publication goes and devotes an entire edition to this expropriation of the seminary at Alice. Sir, let us have it placed on record. The hon. the Minister pointed out this afternoon that this expropriation was done purely for educational purposes for the benefit of the Fort Hare University, and that there were no other motives for this expropriation. I think hon. members feel guilty, because it is strange that this seminary had just left Alice <i>en bloc,</i> bag and baggage, and moved to Umtata, when the Chief Minister of the Transkei found it necessary to react in his Legislative Assembly in the following way. This report comes from the <i>Daily Despatch</i> of 9 April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A threat to close down the Anglican Diocese in the Transkei and expropriate all its mission stations, unless the Church expels the Federal Theological Seminary, was made here yesterday by Chief Minister Kaiser Matanzima. The theology students had come to Umtata not to learn, but to engender ill-feeling between Blacks and Whites in the Transkei and to incite people to change by revolution.</block>

<p>Sir, this is not what was said by us and this is not what was said by the hon. the Minister. These words about the seminary were used by Chief Minister Matanzima after they had been in the Transkei for only a month. Let us understand one another. In this case, too, a climate was created. Then it was said, in the same newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Transkei Government moved against the Anglican Church over the seminary issue, there could be international repercussions.</block>

<p>Sir, it really is strange that there are always threats, that the aid of foreign countries always has to be called in when it is suspected that action is going to be taken against the church. But I want to come back to the so-called truth propagated by this publication <i>Outlook</i> in respect of this matter. It is ridiculous to see the reaction. Their final paragraph in the introductory article reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In expropriating the seminary, the Government is breaking its word. It is taking by force, nay, violence, land which has belonged to the Black community since long before White men came to this country. It is marching with hobnailed boots over the history of people. It is hijacking the Church. Lovedale, Fort Hare and the seminary were to Black South Africans what Stellenbosch is to Afrikaners and Oxford is to the Englishman.</block>

<p>Sir, is this expropriation being done in the interests of a White university, or is it being done for the benefit of the Blacks, for the benefit of the Xhosa people&#x003F; And allow me to say that Fort Hare University is a source of great pride to the Xhosa people. Training of the highest quality is given there, and to allege that this land is being stolen, as has been alleged here, for the benefit of the White man, is a devillish lie. This publication then goes further. This rumour was spread all over South Africa, <span class="col_5459-5460" refersTo="page_1143"/>and was also repeated by the hon, member for Pinelands, who said at one stage that there was more than enough land the University of Fort Hare could use for expansions. Now other things are being dragged in. The University has an experimental farm of 500 morgen four to five miles from there, which is actively used for its agricultural students. It is being suggested that they should have used that land for their expansions. Then certain land under irrigation is also referred to and it is said that they could have gone there. Another piece of land on the other side of the river is referred to, but it happens to be the same piece of land on the other side of the river which is now being used for the provision of badly needed sports fields. In 1961 the same piece of land was offered to the seminary for them to settle there, but then it was not regarded as suitable. For Fort Hare, however, it is suitable for expansion. Sir, I have raised this matter because I felt that the arrogance of certain bodies in this country who allegedly act on behalf of churches should come to an end and be exposed in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock will pardon me if I do not follow up on him. I am quite sure the hon. member for Pinelands will reply to his accusations. I just want to come back briefly to the hon. member for Hercules. I must say the hon. member for Hercules is a level-headed member. He made a very positive speech here at the beginning. He spoke mainly on organizations making financial contributions for the advancement of Bantu education. Sir, this is something we all support. He spoke about Learn and Teach and other similar organizations. I hope I misunderstood him, but I must say I found it regrettable when he tried to imply the following towards the end in connection with Teach and Learn: &#x201C;Just look at what the Government and the people are doing, but what are you in the Opposition doing&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, many of the contributions to Learn and Teach come from the ranks of the Opposition, and I do not think the hon. member meant it that way.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Last year I made a plea for the greater use of White teachers in Bantu education and I asked the Minister and the department to launch an appropriate scheme. Unfortunately nothing has happened about this and I only want to express my disappointment, because I still believe it has tremendous merit. But what I want to raise today with the hon. the Minister is the apparent prohibition on White teachers to help on a part-time or even a fulltime basis in farm schools and community schools. I have a particular case in mind, which has been referred to the department. This is the case of a teacher, the wife of a farmer. She lives on a farm and has had eight and a half years of teaching experience. She is a qualified teacher, and when she wrote to the department offering her services on a part-time or a full-time basis, this was the reply she received&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I regret to say that White teachers are not permitted to be employed in Bantu farm and community schools.</block>

<p>Now this, I believe, is an extremely shortsighted policy on the part of the department, and in fact I believe it is acting irresponsibly if one takes the circumstances into consideration. There must be many qualified female teachers, farmers&#x2019; wives, who would be prepared to assist on a part-time basis, and I would appeal to the Minister that in respect of Bantu farm schools or community schools, a more sensible approach should be adopted.</p>

<p>Whether we regard ourselves as living in a multi-national or a multi-racial country, or whether we regard ourselves as citizens of one country or as the citizens of many countries, the fact remains that in South Africa there should at all times be equality in educational standards. The people of South Africa, Black, Brown and White, will progressively compete with each other more and more on the same labour market, and this will happen in spite of the fact that a facade is being created that job reservation is strictly adhere to, because we all know that it is being circumvented to an ever-increasing extent by exemptions. From time to time in the past we have heard rumours that the educational standards are not the same. I want to put the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind at rest. I believe, as far as my knowledge goes, and up to the present time, that these accusations are completely unfounded. At the present moment Bantu education is organized on a 13-year school structure, with eight years in the primary school and five years in the high school, as compared with <span class="col_5461-5462" refersTo="page_1144"/>the 12-year school structure you have in White education. Prior to differentiated education, a child had seven years in primary school and five years in the high school. Admission to form I, in other words to Std. 6 in the high schools, is subject, first of all, to obtaining a Std. 6 continuation certificate which comes at the end of primary school. This certificate, obtainable after eight years of schooling, is a prerequisite, not only for formal secondary education but also for formal artisan training, for instance, in the building, carpentry, bricklaying, and plumbing trades. A four year post-Std. VI course has been introduced. The very fact that Std. VI was repeated twice, so to say, and the fact that it came at the end of a particular phase of schooling, was a sufficient safeguard for the compatibility and comparability of standards of education. One can also look upon this present arrangement as being an admission, on the part of Bantu education, that the Std. V of the Bantu primary school cannot really be compared with the Std. V of the White primary school. As from next year the department will change over completely to a 12-year school structure to bring it into line with the other education departments. I have nothing against this as I believe it is necessary. It is also commendable that the department is prepared to accept this challenge. The department is also abolishing the Std. VI certificate. I have nothing against that as such because in terms of the new syllabi and curricula Std. VI indicates the middle year of a phase, a junior secondary school phase, which commences in Std. V and ends in Std. VII. This means that there is no end point in Std. VI as far as educational advancement is concerned. Now, however, the Std. VI certificate is to be replaced by a higher primary school certificate which will be awarded at the end of Std. V; in other words, after seven years of formal schooling and after the completion of one year of junior secondary schooling. By doing this, I believe that the department is making a very serious mistake which could possibly re-activate accusations of inequality in standards, and more important, that this decision will lead to an earlier drop-out from school. The moment a certificate is obtained it unfortunately acts as an incentive to many students to leave school. At present this happens after eight years of formal schooling; in other words, after the Std. VI continuation certificate has been obtained. In future this will happen after seven years of schooling. At present there is a negligible drop-out between the seventh and eighth years of schooling; in other words, between Std. V and Std. VI. There is, however, a dramatic drop-out between the eighth and ninth year of schooling; in other words, at the end of Std. VI and the beginning of form I or Std. VII. In 1966 there were 104 000 pupils in Std. V. In 1967 that 104 000 became 99 000 in Std. VI. This means a negligible drop-out of 5 000. The following year, 1968, only 42 000 of these pupils were in form I or Std. VII; in other words, after they had obtained a certificate. This means that there was a drastic drop-out of 57 000. I would like to quote more recent figures. In 1972 there were 176 000 pupils in Std. V. In 1973 the figure went up to 181 000 in Std. VI. After having obtained a certificate, however, there was a drop-out of 101 000. This means that there were only 80 000 the next year. With this new arrangement you will in future find that many more Bantu in South Africa will have some kind of education certificate, but in real educational terms this certificate will not have the same value as was the case in the past when the Std. VI continuation certificate could be obtained. The problem is that it has no counterpart in the educational system of either the Whites, Coloureds or Indians. Confusion will be created. Another point I want to make is that Std. V no longer comes at the end of the primary school phase. Std. IV is the end in terms of the new syllabi. Naturally the department did not want a certificate to be awarded at the end of Std. IV because that would have meant a drop-out after six years. Therefore it decided to come to some kind of compromise, namely to have a dropout after the seventh year. It is, however, a meaningless one as it comes in the middle of an orientation phase in the form of the new syllabus and curriculum starting in Std. VI. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I find it amazing that the hon. member who has just been chatting&#x2014;I cannot express it in any other way&#x2014;and who does, after all, have practical experience of education, can come along this afternoon with the proposal, which to me is a ridiculous one, that we should use White teaching staff in Bantu schools. It is very clear that in practice, when, one is dealing with young school-children, <span class="col_5463-5464" refersTo="page_1145"/>one can certainly not use the services of White teachers because the practical implications are simply too far-reaching. I do not have the time to go into this but I am quite sure that the hon. member knows this himself. Why he should come here this afternoon with such a lot of rubbish is beyond me.</p>

<p>I want to refer to what the hon. members for Edenvale and Pietermaritzburg North had to say. I find it striking that these two hon. members should have adopted such an absolutely negative viewpoint in regard to the report of the Department of Bantu Education. Admittedly, the hon. member for Edenvale mentioned a few cases of progress which he emphasized. I should have been able to quote a great many more cases of progress from the report. Immediately afterwards the same hon. member advocated free education, on the one hand, and on the other hand he referred to the shortcomings. It is very clear to me that the hon. member does not, in fact, realize what he is advocating when he advocates free education or compulsory education.</p>

<p>It is very clear to me that when compulsory education is advocated, there are certain implications that we shall immediately have to bear in mind. The first is that there is undoubtedly a legal implication in the sense that as soon as we have compulsory education, the onus will be transferred to the parent and the parent will therefore have to see to it that he delivers his child to the school, irrespective of the distance between the parent&#x2019;s home and the school. The other important point is the fact that the child himself will, to a large extent, have to have the sense of responsibility to realize that he has to attend school. I now want to ask the hon. member for Edenvale and Pietermaritzburg North whether they believe, in all honesty and fairness, that the Bantu parent and the Bantu child are capable of grasping that responsibility today. After all, it is pointless to establish something with which these people are simply unable to cope.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect too, Sir. If we want to introduce compulsory education, then a responsibility rests on the Government, too, to put the necessary educational facilities at the disposal of the Bantu. Surely that is very clear. The Opposition complains that at present there are insufficient facilities. I refer again to the hon. member for Edenvale who referred to sufficient schools and classrooms. His argument is that there is an insufficient number of schools. The fact is that last year there were 57 592 classrooms for 3&#x00BD; million Black pupils, which works out to about 66 pupils per classroom. However, there is another very important aspect, too, which we must bear in mind. About 20% of the total Bantu population viz. 3&#x00BD; million, attends school at present. But the fact to be borne in mind is that about 27% of the Bantu fall into the age group that should really be attending school. This means that there are about one million Bantu children who are not at school at present. If there is already a shortage of classrooms and we were to compel another million children to attend school under a system of compulsory education, then surely it is very clear that this acute shortage of classrooms would become more acute. This is something which I shall come back to shortly. The other matter that we must bear in mind is that there must definitely be schools for Blacks that compare very well with the White schools, otherwise the criticism will be levelled at us by the Opposition that we are fobbing these people off with penurious little schools. Educational aids must also be provided in respect of free education. This means that if we want to implement fully a system of free education, we should also have to provide text books entirely free. The present system, in terms of which the class readers are provided free to all pupils in primary schools, and most textbooks are provided free from Std. 3 onwards, already costs R1&#x00BD; million per annum. It is calculated&#x2014;this is with reference to a question which the hon. member for Houghton asked the hon. the Minister&#x2014;that if free education were to be implemented in full, it would cost an estimated R5 million per annum.</p>

<speech by="#clase">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. CLASE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, for free books and stationery. Surely it is very clear that at present those funds simply do not exist. The hon. member must not fall over there. He must take care, because before long he is going to fall over.</p>

<p>When we have compulsory education, then we shall have even more of a problem as far as teachers are concerned. At present, according to the criticism levelled by the Opposition, we have too few Bantu teachers. If we were to introduce compulsory education, and there were to be an additional one million children, this short-age <span class="col_5465-5466" refersTo="page_1146"/>would become so much the more acute. At the moment the teacher/pupil ratio at the Bantu schools is about 53:1, and in the homelands it is even somewhat worse than that. Taking all these things into account, and bearing in mind the financial implications, it is calculated that if compulsory education were to be introduced, an additional 67 000 teachers would be required. This would therefore mean 67 000 extra classrooms as well. That being so, an estimated R376 million per annum would be required for primary education alone, as against the R150 million that is at present being spent on all Bantu education. Surely it is unthinkable that this could be brought into effect immediately. It is no secret that it is definitely Government policy to introduce compulsory education in the long term. The Government is not flinching from that and the hon. member for Edenvale said that too, but immediately after saying so, he came up with these claims of the day. In my opinion, Sir, this was really stated too negatively.</p>

<p>I want to refer to another aspect. In my opinion there are other priorities in Black education to which we must give attention. At present the education of the Black child starts at age 7, whereas for the Whites it starts at age 6. According to all educational research, it would have a beneficial effect if these pupils could start attending school at the age of 6. That aspect could be rectified first. Secondly, it is calculated that about 10% of the schoolgoing population of all pupils requires special education. As far as the Bantu are concerned, this means 400 000 pupils. Nothing is as yet being done about this, but now the Opposition comes along and advocates compulsory education. Double sessions, to which reference has been made here, are undoubtedly not the ideal situation at the present moment, but the Government is aware of this and is doing everything in its power to solve this problem as well. The same goes for platoon education. However, there is insufficient time to go into that in detail now. There is the matter of adult education. As yet, nothing is being done about that, either &#x2014;although it is an extremely important aspect of education.</p>

<p>I should like to bring another matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Would it not be possible to give consideration to the establishment of certain institutes to train technicians for use in the Bantu homelands.&#x2014;perhaps along exactly the same lines as the envisaged medical school under the auspices of the Bantu universities&#x003F; I believe that technicians too, are a presssing need in the Bantu homelands.

<p>Mr. Chairman, as this debate progresses, and the more we have to listen to the same arguments raised by the Opposition every year, the more we realize that the United Party with its satellites on the other side of the House is finding itself in a more and more unrealistic situation. As far as the education of the Bantu is concerned, all three parties on the other side of the House have the same problem, viz. they do not want separate development to succeed. We have said this before. If separate development fails, the only alternative, in the view of those three parties, is integrated education and integrated schools. However, I have yet to hear one of those parties advocate this because they do not have an alternative that lies between those two educational directions. What, then, do those people advocate&#x003F; They advocate better education under the present administration. In other words, they do not see their way clear to advocating the alternative, which forms part of their educational policy, viz. integration. They are now in the strange situation of having to advocate an improved system within a system that we stand for. I want to tell the hon. Opposition that I do not believe that the National Party Government will be ploughed under as a result of its education policy, its Bantu education policy in particular. Consequently, anything said by the Opposition in this House or said or written outside this House can only harm them. One of the things the Opposition must not do is try and create the impression among people outside that this Government is unsympathetic towards the Bantu, his education and his children because in fact, the opposite is true. In contrast to this Government, which has succeeded for the past 27 years in providing education for the Bantu, by the Bantu, through the Bantu, we have the tragic history&#x2014;we can prove it with facts and statistics&#x2014;that when the United Party was still in power, it really neglected the Bantu child. It is really atrocious history if one were to go into the merits of the matter. [Interjections.] I accuse all three parties of this because we are not aware that the parties split on the issue of their Bantu education policy. Although two of the parties <span class="col_5467-5468" refersTo="page_1147"/>must still take part in this debate, the three parties talk the same language.</p>

<p>One of the priorities the Government set itself in 1948 in regard to Bantu education was to bring the school within reach of the Bantu child and the Bantu child within reach of his school. In this regard there were a number of problems of which I could mention five. We admit today that we experienced a number of problems. One of the first and biggest problems we were faced with, was to establish a sound education policy and sound educational legislation. What we have on the Statute Book today was only passed in the face of the greatest resistance from that side of the House. At a time when we could have been engaged in this for five years, this House had to sit right through to the small hours to put something on the Statute Book with which we could continue. There was an acute shortage of adequate buildings and adequate Bantu schools to which these children could go. Worst of all&#x2014;hon. members opposite are continually referring to this&#x2014; is the shortage of teachers. We shall discuss this matter shortly on the basis of statistics. Probably the biggest problem was the tremendous population explosion which occurred to a greater extent among the Bantu than among the other population groups. In spite of the most bitter resistance which the Government had to face in 1953 in its efforts to uplift the Bantu from their inferior position, in which respect we have had no assistance, from the Opposition, progress has nevertheless been made, and today we can reveal some interesting statistics. I have before me the statistics for 1950 and I want to compare them with those for 1974. In the first instance there has been an increase of 127% in the number of schools, but perhaps this coincides with the increase in population. The increase in the number of teachers has been 242%, which is entirely out of proportion to the increase in the number of schools. In other words, this Government has done its duty.</p>

<p>I come back to the teachers. The number of pupils for whom provision had to be made rose by more than 400%, whereas during the same period, from 1950 to 1974, the Bantu population increased by only 91%. In other words, the backlog inherited by the National Party in 1948 had to be eliminated in the face of a population increase among the Bantu of almost 100%. What is more, over this period the National Party increased its expenditure on Bantu education by more than 600%. In the past year alone it was increased by almost R10 million. That is the factual position.</p>

<p>That hon. member is constantly interrupting. If he were to make a study of the statistics instead of interrupting, I could perhaps assist him. The fact is that 71% of the Bantu teachers who taught in 1974 were not even 14 years old in 1948. That is how young those teachers still are. Seventy-one per cent of them are undoubtedly the product of this Government&#x2019;s teacher-training. At present we have 63 000 teachers teaching the Bantu. About 860 of them are Whites. The Whites need those 860 teachers themselves. Therefore I cannot see how the hon. member for Durban Central can make the plea here that still more people should be drawn from the White community to teach the Bantu. If that party had done its duty before 1948, we should have had the necessary Bantu teachers today, even though the hon. member for Durban Central were to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;, a hundred times over. It must be borne in mind that if people are trained for a specific type of work, that work must be provided. That is why we should not be obsessed solely by Bantu education in the way that the Opposition parties are. They only see one facet, viz. that which corresponds with their federal viewpoint. My question to the Opposition parties is: &#x201C;Can one have education developing in isolation, without all the other things&#x003F;&#x201D; They will probably tell me: &#x201C;No, these things must go together.&#x201D; That is why we had to make a start with resettlement here. The first major task we had to perform was the task of resettlement, viz. of first creating order in respect of the Bantu residential areas. The provision of accommodation and the whole process of community development coincided with resettlement. This could only take place concurrently with the development of the economy of the country for which the Government has made very thorough provision, and all this within the framework of the population increase. If the United Party wants to make us believe that they are not to blame for the difficulties we are faced with today, then I say that they do <span class="col_5469-5470" refersTo="page_1148"/>not know their own history, and then I say to the other two parties sitting beside them that it is high time they asked the United Party where they stand in regard to a Bantu education policy.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place, Mr. Chairman, in the few minutes at my disposal I should just like to express my thanks for the calm manner in which this matter, a vital one for our fatherland, is being discussed. I just want to say a few words this evening concerning two minor matters. I hope to elaborate on them further tomorrow and in addition, to reply to the matters that have been raised. In the first place, I just want to say that what has been said by both sides concerning the acute shortages of classroom space are, quite simply, true. I can inform you that we have funds available, funds offered voluntarily and other funds, too, which we have been unable to utilize recently. The reason is that over the past few years, since about 1967, a fixed amount of only R1 500 per classroom has been allowed by the Department of Community Development for the construction of school buildings. This often resulted in our having tenders submitted to us, only to be warned that the tenders exceeded the fixed amount, and we were simply unable to come out on that figure. This caused excessive delays. I can now inform you of the good news that after long negotiations with the National Housing Commission, the Department of Community Development has increased that unit cost per classroom from R1 500 to R3 400. This makes it possible for the available funds to be utilized shortly in order to provide the necessary space which is so essential in the residential areas. It will remain the responsibility of the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards to find funds.</p>

<p>I want to repeat the appeal I made this afternoon under another Vote, viz. that we should really give the Bantu Affairs Administration Boards our co-operation so that they may have the funds to construct these buildings. The approval of a larger amount is pointless if funds enabling them to make use of this are not available. A 16-classroom building for a junior primary school, for example, will cost approximately R28 000; a senior primary school and its accompaniments will cost R98 000; a 16-classroom building for a junior secondary school&#x2014;because it includes laboratories and other things will cost R124 000.</p>

<p>Hon. members will therefore be able to grasp the enormous expense involved. I just want to mention that in the Cape Peninsula, for example, where a large amount is available owing to the voluntary fund of a local newspaper, the Argus group, it is now possible to start eliminating the backlog immediately. In the second place, I just want to announce&#x2014;I think it is necessary for me to do so&#x2014;that the hon. the Minister has conducted negotiations at the highest level with the officials of other departments, too, and that a review is taking place at the moment of ways in which all the funds in the homelands and elsewhere can be channelled in such a way as to bring about the greatest possible utilization of available funds, to avoid wastage or duplication and ensure proper utilization of the funds that will be made available to us. These matters are being considered and discussed at the highest level at the moment. I can say, too, that even while they are being discussed they are being implemented, too, as is being announced.</p>
