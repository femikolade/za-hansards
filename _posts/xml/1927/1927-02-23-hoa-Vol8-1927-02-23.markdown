<from>&#x2020;Col.-Cdt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COLLINS</person>:</from>

<p>I would like the Minister to explain how the allotments are made in the case of these oudstryders and exactly on what principle they are made. I may say I have come across some very hard cases in connection with this matter, and where these old people have come to one and said &#x201C;Why does so-and-so get this pension and I not,&#x201D; it has been very difficult to explain. I understand that the Minister has laid down one principle, that where these oudstryders have got children they do not get the pension. I remember one special case where a man is almost starving. He has a son somewhere in the Government service and he does not get this pension. That is evidently the only ground on which the pension is refused to him. This man cannot help it if his son will not support him. It means he has to go to court and he has not a penny to do it with. There are very hard cases in connection with this matter. The Minister made a remark as to how could he distinguish in the case of the old republican officials. It seems to me it would have been much easier to differentiate in their case than in the case of these oudstryders. The Minister will say that if he does not make any differentiation the amount will probably be doubled. I question whether that is a fair proposition. It seems to me that if there is not a distinction in the matter of the old republican officials there certainly should not be any distinction made here. I put it to the Minister whether he will not consider the question of giving every oudstryder the pension, because I assure him they are in great hardship. It seems to me he should perhaps accept another principle and say they should all get it, but the Minister should have the right to refuse in certain circumstances where clearly they did not need this pension. Many men have been assisted, and very greatly assisted.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>This is a matter in which many members take an interest and let me at once explain what the position is. As the hon. member will see it is simply a question of money. We commenced by granting a certain scale of assistance in especially hard cases. We started with that idea and during the first half of the financial year we made about £7,000 available. It was never the intention through this temporary measure to arrive at general old age pensions for every one who had taken part in the war. It was clearly said that we were engaged on the necessary enquiry and that we hoped later to lay proposals before Parliament by which everybody at all needy would get a pension, but that pending the enquiry with reference to a general old age pension scheme something should be done in cases of absolute poverty of needy old people. Last year £30,000 was put on the Estimates for this purpose and on these estimates a further sum of £31,000 appears. Hon. members will therefore see that the treasury without the authority of Parliament went so far as to ask the Governor-General to specially authorize it to disburse that special amount. When the main estimates are dealt with this year hon. members will see that we propose going still further and to expend £90,000 for this purpose by which three thousand old people can be assisted. And now the hon. member and the other hon. members want to go still further. Well, we can extend the system if Parliament will vote a further amount. Hon. members will see that the expenditure is constantly going up for the required services and that I have to ask for more money for the current financial year. In the payment of allowances to oudstryders the limitation has been made that when they have children and it can reasonably be expected that these should contribute something for the maintenance of the old people, they shall be excluded. If the House wants to abolish that restriction then it is another matter. That would considerably simplify the work in the matter, but it would already amount to a general old age pension for those people. The method followed is that we have a certain form drafted by the department giving the information required from the applicants. They must state how old they are, what they possess and how many children they have. Then the report of the local magistrate is obtained. Of course there are cases where a magistrate says that a pension should be paid, although the Pension Commission finds that there are children who possess something and are able to do something for the support of those persons. In such cases the application is often refused. If we do not do so we shall have to spend much more money. The hon. member said that I stated that we could make no distinction between needy people and non-needy people in the payment of pensions. Yes, I said that and Parliament resolved to grant pensions to the old republican officials as a right and no distinction was made between needy and non-needy people. Parliament decided to put them in the same position as Union officials and the existing Pension Acts were taken as a basis. The hon. member will see that it is still more difficult to make a distinction between needy and non-needy persons than between people who are entirely without food and needy people. If that distinction were made the dissatisfaction and difficulties would he much greater still than they are to-day, and hon. members have quoted cases of people who have children but who will contribute nothing. I think that the existing Acts contain sufficient provision to compel such a dependant to contribute to the support of a father, grandfather, etc. The law is there and can be applied. There will certainly be cases where people can go to the Pension Commission and where steps can be taken.</p>

<p>But then surely the State cannot be held responsible. I know of cases where parents have the right of user over a large farm and where they can send their children away, but the parents come to the Government and say that they are in want and that the children remain on the farm and do not provide for them. But if the parents are not prepared to take the necessary steps to protect their rights how can it be expected that the money of the taxpayers shall be used for payments that are not necessary. I know that everyone in the House sympathises with the old people, therefore the Government felt justified without authority of Parliament to assist in certain cases, but a line must be drawn and many of the people must have a little patience while enquiry is being made into a system of old age pensions.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NATHAN</person>:</from>

<p>There are cases reported in the Transvaal Law Reports where children have been compelled to support their parents; but I rise to ask for information with regard to the large sum of £309,000 under the heading (c) and under another head, L. I think the House should be furnished with a list&#x2014;to be laid on the Table of the House&#x2014;of the people to whom these payments are made at the sweet will of the Treasury the country should be furnished with a list showing all the details under head (c) and (1). I do not know how it is done&#x2014;I have never occupied the Treasury benches yet&#x2014;but it undoubtedly leaves scope to favouring friends. I do not make any charge against this or any other Government, but it is perfectly clear that these are public funds, and the public have a right to know how these moneys are expended.</p>

<speech by="#rood">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROOD</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the Minister quite understood the hon. member for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins). It does not only concern the general question of payment of pensions to oudstryders, and it is not merely a question of money, but it concerns the system which is being followed, the system by which some people are given pensions and others not. There are cases where old people have sons and where the ground e.g. belongs to the father and where undoubtedly the sons ought to see that their parents suffer no want. There are, however, many cases possibly recommended by a magistrate where the parents have three or four sons who are possibly much poorer than the parents themselves who are refused pensions because they have sons. In the case of many old people the sons are possibly married and are employed as foremen or white labourers and earn a wage so small that it really cannot be expected of them to contribute to their parents&#x2019; support. There is e.g. another case where an old father and mother board with a son who earns 6s. 4d. per day. Of that 4d. is deducted for rent and then the parents are told that they have a son who can provide for them. There are many cases where the magistrate recommends the granting of a pension and the head office refuses the application. It is this kind of case we want to bring to the notice of the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>&#x2020;*Lt.-Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. S. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to what the Minister has said I just want to refer to a letter which I received from him in answer to a petition of seventy-one people of Bethal. The Minister in his reply referred to the Act which provides that oudstryders authorized to receive pension must be at least 70 years old or widows at least 65 years. There is a line fixed. It is possibly right but I just want to say a few words about what was previously done in the House and what is now being done here. The 5s. payment did not take place but I can assure the Minister that there is great dissatisfaction on account of payments which are being made to ex-officials under the Act of last year. Unfortunately I cannot say anything against the Act because we all passed it tacitly. I frankly admit this, but we did not understand the effect. If I had known what the effect would be I would never have voted for it. I can, however, assure the House that in Standerton, Bethal, Ermelo, etc., there is great excitement about the payments to the ex-officials. There are many people who sacrificed everything in the war and who are today in difficulties, and they cannot be assisted and they are dissatisfied that the people who were in the offices while they were outside in the field should receive payments. The Act provides that they can only be aided when they are 70 years old and half dead from hunger. I think it is not right. We know that the country cannot stand the great expenditure to all the oudstryders but we must be fair and just and take account of what has been done and what should be done, and as there are these two classes of the population both of whom have suffered we must take care that we do not do justice to one section and injustice to the other. Therefore I say these few words and express the hope that the Minister will consider how the grievance of these people can be removed.</p>

<speech by="#swart">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SWART</person>:</from>

<p>We quite appreciate the difficulties of the Minister in connection with the oudstryders&#x2019; pensions but we feel that there has been some arbitrary action in making the provision that one must be 70 years old for qualification for an old age pension, or if he is under 70 that he has to be sickly. Now I want to instance an example of the hardship to which this leads which I have personally investigated in my constituency. There is an oudstryder of 68 years and his wife of 64 They are old and worn out, not sickly but cannot work and cannot get work. That worn out man has four children of whom the oldest is 48 and the youngest 23. All the children are feebleminded and backward. Not one of the children can wash his own face and put even a piece of food into his mouth. They are practically no better than animals in their civilization and entirely feeble-minded. The man applied and he was told that the department regretted that he could not be assisted <span class="col_627-628" refersTo="page_0383"/>because he was under 70 years and could not obtain the doctor&#x2019;s certificate that he was sickly. He and his wife arc worn out people and not able to earn their bread themselves.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SWART</person>:</from>

<p>My argument is that it works out so unfairly. In this case the two parents are worn out and they have four afflicted children who cannot even wash their own faces. This is actually a very hard case and I investigated it myself. When I left there I felt ashamed that we as a nation permitted these people to live in that way and that there was no help for them. Therefore I say that I am very sorry that the conditions for obtaining pensions are a little arbitrary and I should like to ask the Minister&#x2014;seeing that he has already made exceptions&#x2014;whether in such extraordinarily hard cases something cannot be done.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reitz">

<from>&#x2020;*Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>I think there is an anomaly in the Act as regards the payments to ex-officials. I have two cases I should like to tell the Minister about because I think these two cases of ex-officials of the Transvaal Republic are precisely the same, although under the Act they are treated differently. They are the cases of Mr. one-arm Smit and of Mr. Roos of 42, Market Street, Pretoria. Both received a pension in 1908 and they both capitalised it for the sum of £500, but now payment has been refused to Mr. one-arm Smit, while the other has received £750 and £40 per annum. I regard the two cases as practically identical because the one was in the republican service for 15 years and the other 14 years. Then I should also like to call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the position of various Free State ex-officials. The Minister told us last year that the Free State ex-officials were better off under the old Free State law of 1904 than what they would be under last year&#x2019;s Act, but it now appears that some of them are worse off. There are three cases I can name, viz.: Mr. de Kock (ex-landdrost), Mr. Borman and Mr. Bouman, and there may be other such cases.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>I agree that things have occurred which are open to criticism. In the district of Vryburg no less than thirty-four persons applied for oudstryders&#x2019; grants and they were only granted to nine. I think that some of the nine were better off than some of the others whose applications had been refused. It is said that old people with children are not assisted. I, however, know of cases where the children are just as needy as the parents themselves and I should like the department to come to a decision according to whether the people are needy or not. It must not be said that a grant is refused when the old people have children. I am not satisfied with the position. There ought to be a committee in every division to go into the cases and to assist the magistrate because I do not want the old people to be left to the mercy of the police and the magistrates. Some of these people live from 100 to 150 miles from the village and it makes a difference if someone lives close by where the magistrate can personally look into circumstances. We must see to it that those who did their best for their country and people are well treated. A child who is able to support his parents will not permit his father or mother to go to the department to ask for grace. It happens, however, in many cases that the children are not able to support their parents and the department should in such cases be prepared to grant help.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#collins">

<from>&#x2020;*Col.-Cdt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COLLINS</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister said that there are many cases where magistrates recommend the granting of allowances but that the Pensions Department subsequently refused them That is one of the reasons of my complaint. I have great respect for the Pensions Department for it contains many capable officers, but I think that where a magistrate or senior Government official who personally knows the case makes a recommendation the grant ought to be made. I think it is going too far that officials who do not know the circumstances do not carry out the recommendations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>That is done when it appears from the document sent in what the children possess. It is just to get uniformity that the department does that because one magistrate may have a different view from another.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#collins">

<from>&#x2020;*Col.-Cdt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COLLINS</person>:</from>

<p>I think the Minister must provide for a clear statement of the reason for disallowance because I think much injustice is being done. It would be better to adopt another standard. I do not say that that will be satisfactory but it will give more satisfaction and possibly no more will be expended than according to the recommendations of the magistrates. As the hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Rood) said, many of the people who apply for grants actually have children but they are usually people who are not able to support their parents. Therefore I think that the condition made is not right. The payment to oudstryders ought to be left to the discretion of the magistrates and I think in the long run that would give more satisfaction.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hugo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGO</person>:</from>

<p>When one wants to do good it often happens that you get into trouble and that is the case to-day with the Government which intended to do good and is in difficulties. In the payments to the oudstryders unequal treatment took place. There are hard cases where oudstryders who are very needy did not receive the grants although they are in a worse position than those who actually receive them. That is the great cause of dissatisfaction. Now the Government had better stand firm and see how far assistance can be given. Another difficulty is that the information obtained by the magistrates is often not sufficient. If the magistrate is informed that a man, e.g., has <span class="col_629-630" refersTo="page_0384"/>two sons earning a certain amount then it should be enquired into whether they are able to provide for more than their own requirements. I think the information should go further to ascertain what the cost of living of the children is because there are cases where they are fathers of large families and cannot assist their parents.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hattingh">

<from>&#x2020;*The Rev. Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HATTINGH</person>:</from>

<p>On the Rand there is a very large number of oudstryders and if there ever was a place where there are many difficulties and grievances then it is there, because one has not only oudstryders from the Transvaal and the Rand, but from the whole Union All meet there to look for work and sometimes they find it. As the hon. member for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins) has rightly mentioned adequate enquiry is in many cases not made. A policeman, e.g. is sent out to enquire how many children a man has and he returns to the magistrate without any further information and the latter then makes his report to the department in Pretoria. Sometimes even when the magistrate reports favourably the application is refused by the department. I should like to know what further information the department has in Pretoria to reject a recommendation when the local man who has made the enquiry recommends the grant. In Johannesburg and in the large towns there are other channels along which the Minister can make proper investigation to get information about the needs of the people. Now we come to another point and it is said that the children ought to be responsible for the maintenance of their parents. We all admit that this is a very good and sound principle but although the Government says that the principle must be applied it is left to the parents to take steps against their children to compel them to fulfil their duty. This I disapprove of. If the Government finds that children do not fulfil their duty towards their parents the Government should take steps to compel the children to do so. The Government can receive direct what the children can pay and then there will be much less difficulty in applying the law. There are possibly children who merely fail to pay and then the parents get nothing from the Government. Therefore many people suffer great want. I should like the Minister to consider this placing of the onus on the Government to compel the children to contribute their share. There is a case which I specially wish to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. An old gentleman, a Mr. du Plooy of Krugersdorp, who did his duty in the war is still under 70 years of age but he has had one of his legs amputated high up as a result of sickness caused or rendered worse during the war. His only work is going from house to house repairing chairs. In that way he possibly earns 15s. or £1 a month and that with great difficulty. The Government now refuses to give such a man a grant because the doctors say that he is still well in body although incapacity does not permit him to make a proper livelihood. Such cases which are brought forward ought to be considered. Then I shall be glad if the Government would give more attention to private and confidential information and to recommendations by members of Parliament whatever party they may belong to. When a member of Parliament to-day brings up a case then he sometimes receives a reply from the department that the matter is receiving consideration and subsequently perhaps he is informed that the request cannot possibly be complied with. I should also like to know from the Minister whether it is right that when a person gets a grant it must be exactly £2 10s. per month. Cannot possibly less be given to someone if it appears that he only needs e.g. 30s. a month? In cases where he does not need the full amount he to-day gets nothing. By authorising the payment of less to some people many very hard cases will be met, where a child can only contribute from 20s. to 30s. per month. Where the child to-day is able to do this little bit the parent receives no grant. I think there ought to be a sort of system of making up such a sum received by an old man or woman to £2 10s. per month, and I think that the money for disposal can in this way be distributed more widely among people entitled to support.</p>

<p>I would draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to Section C, compensation allowances for loss of office owing to re-organization and retrenchment, £329,000. I would like to know from the Minister whether this amount includes persons who are covered by the resolutions passed last year&#x2014;ex-burgers of the old republics. The country feels that, wittingly or unwittingly, we have been committed to a very serious obligation. The case was represented to this House as being only a small matter. It was said that the aim was to do justice to a few individuals, and that the amount involved would only be a few thousand pounds at the uttermost.</p>

<p>That is what was understood. The mover of the resolution said that it was only a small matter. Now we learn that, instead of being a few thousand pounds only, it has run up to £250,000 and probably £500,000 will be involved in this matter. That is a very different thing from what was represented to us. It was pointed out, and very correctly too, that all parties in the House were responsible, that they all concurred in supporting that measure, but the Minister of Finance who, after all, is the custodian of our Finances and is above all men responsible to the people for the expenditure incurred, should have made it his duty to acquaint himself with the conditions that might arise out of such a resolution. The Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am prepared to accept the motion, but want to warn the House to be a little careful. The hon. member who has just spoken <span class="col_631-632" refersTo="page_0385"/>wants to dispose of the question on a basis of justice. Let me remind the House that it is impossible at this period to put right all the injustice done in the second war of independence. It was not only old officials who suffered damage. There are thousands of private citizens who suffered, yes, lost everything, and it is impossible to make good the damage. Therefore, the question cannot be put on that basis.</block>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SEPHTON</person>:</from>

<p>I am prepared to read anything that comes further on. What I have quoted at any rate, shows that the Minister was apprehensive of the lengths that this matter might lead to and, being so, I think it was especially his duty to have tried to ascertain the true position of the case. It has been said that everyone in this House concurred. I would like to refer to a warning that I gave during the course of the debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot see that any object will be gained by re-opening a question of this magnitude. I believe this aspect of the matter was brought before the Transvaal Government in 1908 and they found that they could not deal adequately with it. I say that the people of the Union who are not concerned in these particular matters naturally have strong objections to being taxed for something in connection with these people when their own Government, when they had a Government, were unable to adjust it. I sympathise with the mover, but I do not see how it is possible to meet these special cases without doing an injustice to the many people whose cases cannot be gone into. I think it will be much better to leave the matter where it is.</block>

<speech by="#marwick">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister will make clear the definition of the people who are entitled to receive grants under the category of aged or infirm ex-soldiers or their dependents. Will the Minister tell us whether that definition is laid down in any Act or whether it is purely a departmental definition arrived at for a purpose of deciding this matter. I ask that because it is a very wide definition and it makes these payments possible in the case of a large class of people who may, or may not, be entitled to them. It has prompted people throughout the Union who fought in the previous wars, the Anglo-Boer war for instance, to raise the question as to whether they are entitled to participate in these benefits. I understand that in one day alone upwards of £20,000 was paid away to aged and infirm ex-soldiers or their dependents in Pretoria. If that is so, I should like to know whether these payments were confined to people in the Transvaal or the Free State or whether they are available to people in the other provinces as well, because in our own particular province it is generally supposed that the people who fought in the Anglo-Boer war were well-provided for. The contrary is the case; only a few of the Natal volunteers who fought in that war received any pension at all. Pensions were only granted in the case of persons permanently totally disabled, and in the case of dependents of people who were killed. Outside that very limited number is the large class of people who to-day are aged and infirm ex-soldiers and who receive no relief whatsoever. I want to point out that if these payments are available to such people the Minister will have to provide very much more next year to meet the claims of people throughout the Union claiming to be paid on the ground of being aged or infirm ex-soldiers or the dependents of such ex-soldiers. I hope the Minister will make the position clear, because if it is confined either to the people who fought on one side or to people who live in certain provinces then a very great deal of dissatisfaction will be aroused.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has raised the question now as to whether these payments apply only to the ex-soldiers who fought on the Republican side. Hon. members will remember that when we originally decided to ask Parliament to sanction expenditure in connection with this matter it was as the result of the report of the select committee of this House which dealt with the question of what had been known as the five shillings a day which was promised by the Transvaal Government to the burghers. That select committee made two recommendations which the House accepted, and it was then thought that that disposed of the question of the five shillings a day. The one recommendation was that the Government should take into consideration the provision of a House in Pretoria, some sort of central institution where the worst cases among these poor old people could go and be cared for by the State. The other was that these oudstryders in the case of allotment of Government land under Land Settlement schemes should get a certain amount of preference. When the present Government took office we were called upon to implement this undertaking, in connection with the House, given by the previous Government in 1923. We found that this scheme of a central institution was altogether impracticable because the expenditure would have been too great. It would not have cost the State £30 per head per annum but very much more. We thought it would be much better to give a small grant to these people and leave them in their homes <span class="col_633-634" refersTo="page_0386"/>instead of collecting them in a central place. So this scheme was substituted; we found that this was a better scheme. The intention was to deal with the ex-burghers who fought on the Republican side, but then, after Parliament had decided to agree to the placing of this amount on the Estimates last year, it was represented to the Government that it was an invidious distinction which Parliament was making; it was inequitable that these benefits should be confined only to those people who fought on the one side, and that we were pressed to make it of general application. Well, we agreed to that. I gave instructions to the department to admit to the benefits of this scheme the people who complied with the same conditions and who fought on the other side. If they were over 70 years of age, old and infirm, they were to be entitled to these benefits. The Government took the responsibility and it is for Parliament to approve of it or not. At present the scheme is that it shall apply to both classes of persons. The hon. member says that this is a rather loose and vague definition. He is quite right. It would have been more satisfactory if we could have introduced an Act of Parliament laying down minutely the classes of people who would benefit, but it is purely a temporary measure to give a certain amount of relief in the meantime pending the establishment of a general old age pension scheme. We got the best information possible, with the aid of magistrates, to find out the class of people to whom the benefits should be given. It is suggested that in order to do away with dissatisfaction here and there I should institute elaborate machinery. I wish to inform hon. members who raise this question that originally I informed the House that Parliament was entitled to avail itself of the machinery of the oudstryders themselves. They have their own organization&#x2014;the Oudstryders Bond. We soon found that there were so many complaints about the granting of these benefits that we were forced to substitute the magistrates instead of these committees. Now hon. members want me to go back again to a committee of Oudstryders or other people. I do not think it is worth while for the sake of a few cases where there is dissatisfaction. If hon. members will bring to the notice of the department any really hard cases they will go into those cases but, of course, we must be guided by the general rules laid down, and now I am being urged to extend the scheme. Of course that is a matter for Parliament: I have pointed out that we should have to make provision for a much larger amount. The hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Nathan) said this money was being disbursed at the sweet will of the Government. That is not so. In the case of subhead &#x201C;C&#x201D; of the vote to which he refers, compensation for loss of office, all that is paid out under Acts of Parliament. The hon. member will see that the biggest portion of that amount had accumulated under the previous Government from time to time. Under the previous Government officials were retrenched and, in terms of the existing legislation, they are entitled to compensation. Of course it is true that under the same practice officials have been retrenched by the present Government. If the hon. member wants further information about who these people are he can get it. The major portion of this amount is in connection with this Act 49 of 1926; only a small portion of that is due to regular retirements effected by the Government during the year. In the ordinary course he will realize that certain officials who, in certain circumstances, have their services dispensed with are entitled to compensation.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>No, these people left the service in 1902, and under the legislation they are entitled to compensation. That is also the reply to the hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton). The hon. member has read what he said at the time when the Act was under discussion last year. He is quite right. I remember quite well that his was a voice crying in the wilderness. He is the only member in this House who, as a taxpayer in the Cape Province, did not like the idea of granting compensation to officials in the Transvaal, but no one else supported him. He read my speech, but, of course, that speech was received in a very chilly way; I got no further support. When it went to the select committee the report came out unanimously that this should be done&#x2014;and more&#x2014;and when the legislation was introduced the hon. member was the only member who raised his voice. The others attacked me because I had not gone far enough in accepting the resolutions of the select committee</p>

<p>&#x2020;*The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) has mentioned two cases where he contends a distinction has been made, viz., those of Messrs. Roos and Smit. In reply I want to say that if a distinction has been made then it could only have occurred because the two cases are not identical. Payments are only made according to law. Perhaps in one case there was a break in service which cannot be calculated for pension purposes and in the other case not. In such event Parliament alone can rectify the matter, if a petition is presented. But let me add this, that payments are made according to the Act, and if an official does an injustice and the department withholds certain rights from an applicant, then he can summon the department and obtain his rights in court. There is no question of the discretion of the Minister. It is not a case of arbitrary distinction, but of carrying out the law. Hon. members are pleading here for persons under 68 years of age, and who have children, who are feebleminded and cannot support them. Do hon. members then wish that the age limit should be altered from 70 years? Where shall we stop then if the line is not drawn? There are individual cases where an exception is made for persons who are entirely unable to provide for their own needs, persons who have bodily incapacity. But the case which the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Swart) mentioned does not come under the exceptions, because <span class="col_635-636" refersTo="page_0387"/>the man who is not 70 cannot get a certificate from the doctor that he is bodily infirm.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Then we might just as well abolish the age limit. If the request of the hon. member is complied with it means that the limit must be completely abolished. It is not a fact that the department acts arbitrarily. The hon. member will see that this case does not fall under the regulations in force to-day. But if there are hard cases where the department has acted too sharply and where persons ought to come under the regulations the matter will be gone into again if it is brought to the notice of the department, and if the department is convinced that they ought to come under the regulations that will, of course, be done. The hon. member for Bechuanaland (Mr. Raubenheimer) complains that a comparatively small number of persons had received help in his constituency. Let me say at once that we never ask, in dealing with this matter, where any one lives&#x2014;in what constituency or in what province. When applications come in each is dealt with on its merits, and there was never any question of any apportionment according to provinces, constituencies or districts. The hon. member is not right when he says that all the people with children are excluded. Where there are children who can contribute to the maintenance of their parents the grants are not made. The hon. member for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins) asked why recommendations by magistrates were turned down. The hon. member will see that all magistrates, unfortunately, do not follow exactly the same policy, and the department must be there to see that more or less the same policy is followed. If it appears from the information on the forms that the person is excluded by the rules, then no grant is given.</p>

<p>The hon. member will understand that it is impossible to administer the Act without there being people who think that they are being unfairly treated. There will be a difference of opinion. The hon. member for Krugersdorp (the Rev. Mr. Hattingh) said that we ought to consider the possibility of making a smaller grant than £2 10s. per month where such was justified. The hon. member will see that we already have difficulties enough. If a further distinction is to be made, and one person gets £2 10s., while another receives £2 or £1 10s., then there will be still greater dissatisfaction. The man who gets £2 will ask why he does not get more. If the suggestions of the hon. member were carried out, then the administration of the Act would cost very much more.</p>

I hope hon. members will see that whatever is done there will necessarily be complaints from time to time, because certain persons are not assisted while others are. With the means at our disposal, the department has tried to do justice as far as possible. If Parliament is prepared to vote much more money then more can be done. Now I feel that we should continue in the present way, and must meet all the cases that we can.</p>

<p>I just want to mention another small matter. We hesitate to speak again about the Act passed last year for pensions to ex-republican officials. No one feels disposed to spend more money, but I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice how hard the Act is with regard to a few people, viz., ex-officials of the Orange Free State, who did not return to the service of the Free State after the war, but entered the service of the Transvaal. I think there are only a few cases, I believe only two. They do not come under the Free State Act of 1908, nor do they receive consideration as Transvaal ex-officials, because they were not in the Transvaal service a year before the second war of independence. They are, therefore, entirely excluded, while their colleagues from the Free State and the Transvaal obtain a pension. I hope that the Minister will go into the matter and, as there are only a few cases, he will, perhaps, be able to grant relief for them, so that they also can enjoy the privileges of which they have been deprived through extraordinary circumstances.</p>

I have recently seen it stated that a good many officials below the age of 60 were still competent, and could, have been employed in the public service, but have been retrenched and pensioned.

<p>Those are the cases to which I am referring. It would be very interesting to know how many have been retrenched, who they are, and the circumstances of the case. The Minister will be the first to admit that the public have a right to know, through their representatives, the reasons which prompted the Government to retrench these people and spend money in the form of pensions. I am not blaming the Government, but, in order to have a check, a list of the cases should be laid on the Table of the House. With regard to Item &#x201C;L&#x201D; the Minister has given no information whatever. I believe the Minister is virtue personified&#x2014;at least, that is the general opinion about him&#x2014;but he may not always be the Minister and, therefore, lists of the recipients should be supplied.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN BROEKHUIZEN</person>:</from>

<p>My motion, passed last year, with regard to pensions of ex-republican officials has been so much referred to that I feel I must say a few words. If hon. members refer to the original motion in Hansard they will see that in the first instance mention was only made of ex-republican officials still in the service and it therefore only referred to a small group of ex-republican officials. The hon. member for Aliwal (M. Sephton) only spoke last year on the original motion and did not say a word about the Bill that was subsequently passed. In the original motion the idea was only to do justice to a group of ex-officials, possibly 150. The only idea I had with the original motion was clearly to assist the group of people who presented a petition to this House. The Minister of Finance, however, or the Treasury, cannot pass an Act for certain people only, but must pass a general Act. That is the reason when the Act was passed and the other people were also included and on that Bill not a single member in the House said a word and each one is responsible for it. But let me say that I am not ashamed at all personally. Just let us refer for a moment to the report of the Pensions Committee. What do we find? In 1920-&#x2019;21 the pensions account was increased by £1,273,000 and in 1922-&#x2019;23 by £1,038,000, and so it continues, and now we are doing justice (because it is a question of justice) to a group of Transvaal ex-officials; we ought rather to remain quiet about it. They are a group of people who did their duty in the war and we ought not to make such a fuss now that justice is being done to them. The original motion was only intended to make provision for the group of officials, but the Treasury thought it necessary to also include the other people.</p>

What has been done is only right. Pensions have been paid to the people who were engaged under the Milner regime and why then should we make a fuss about the pensions of the ex-officials.

The ex-republican officials of the Transvaal laid the foundations for the official world of the Union and they are only receiving justice. I frankly admit that I did not appreciate when I introduced the motion how the matter would end, but as the pensions have now been paid, pensions to which the people are entitled, we ought not to make so much noise about it. We are all responsible for it and let us therefore let the matter rest and not go and tell the public outside that it is a proof of the extravagant manner in which this Government deals with money. Everybody is responsible, and hon. members, when they speak about it out of Parliament, should be honest and say that they are equally guilty.

<p>I am glad to hear that the department will be prepared to reinvestigate special cases where there is dissatisfaction. I can assure the House that dissatisfaction is fairly general. The Oudstryders Bond was the body first used in making <span class="col_639-640" refersTo="page_0389"/>enquiries, but it was only the head office of the Bond. My feeling is that the branches of the Bond in the outside districts ought to act jointly with the magistrates. It will cost nothing, but the magistrate can consult that body for information. It is felt to-day that that body is disregarded and that consideration is not given to recommendations of the chairman and secretaries thereof. Even when members of Parliament make recommendations little attention is paid to them. The hon. member for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins) mentioned that magistrates had made recommendations which were disregarded by the department. I can confirm that. The rejection was not on account of the fact that new information had been obtained from which it appeared that a grant ought not to be made, but the person who applied merely received a letter that in his case a grant could not be made. When the department refuses a grant I want to enquire if special mention cannot be made&#x2014;even if it is not in detail&#x2014;why it is done so that persons can know the actual reason Then use can be made of the letter. Now it is merely said that the person does not come under the provisions of the Act and the magistrate and the person do not then know the reason. If the reason is given, then the people will be able to use it and in this way their case will be met. The granting of the allowances amounts to this, that the old people who formerly received the poor grant from the Provincial Administration would now get it from the Union Government. The only difference is that while the people used to receive 20s. or 30s. they now get £2 10s.</p>

<p>I should be sorry to think that we should economize at the expense of the old people living in poverty. I am in favour of economy, but I think even the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) will not raise any objection in this case. I only ask that people in great poverty should receive something. There are hundreds to-day who will die if they are not assisted. It surely was the intention of the House when the amount was voted that people who are in poverty, although they are not exactly dying of misery, should be helped. I want to bring a few cases to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. There is an old man living at Pietersburg whose young son of 19 or 20 years earns a few shillings a day in the railway service. Because he receives say 4s. per day his father cannot get the grant. Surely the son must also save something. Surely it was not the intention of the House that such cases should be excluded. There is another case where a man has his father and step-mother living in his house. He earns £15 a month as dip inspector, but he has his children to maintain besides the two old people living with him. The latter can do nothing for themselves. It is the unsympathetic treatment which causes dissatisfaction and I am glad that the Minister promised to reconsider special cases. Then I should like the Minister to explain why certain Free State officials do not come under the old republican law. There are cases in Pietersburg of which I know where Free State artillerymen receive nothing. I understood from the Minister last year that provision had already been made for them in the previous Act, but it does not appear as if they knew of it.</p>

<p>With reference to a few remarks made here, I want to say something which in my opinion is no more than fair. As regards my experience of the administration of the Act, I am convinced that there are officials of the department who have shown that they like assisting the public. I do not know if all the officials are like that, but I may mention the name of Mr. Ayres, with whom I constantly came into touch. He administered the Act as sympathetically as possible, and I should not like the House to create an impression which would do an injustice to the good intentions of the officials. Further, I think that the Minister, in addition to all the sympathy he has shown, must go further, not only in the cases which have been mentioned, but also in other existing cases. I should like to have assistance for people who are in needy circumstances and require food, but have not yet reached their seventieth year. The officials ought to be empowered to also assist such persons. I know of a few cases where persons under 70 were assisted because they could prove that they were unable to work. There are, however, cases of people who are, e.g., 68 years old but can practically do nothing but light work bringing in 5s. to 10s. per month. Because, however, they can earn this and can move their hands, the officials have to say that they cannot be assisted. There are also other cases where sympathy ought to be shown. There are some artillerymen and police who fought like lions and only entered the service a few months before the war. Just because they entered the service two or three months too late, they have now to go without a grant. They are people who lost everything in the war, and to-day have no means of existence. There are also cases of teachers&#x2014;a small group&#x2014;who were requested by the republican governments to fight, and who were promised that instead of their salary they would receive an allowance of £7 10s. or £10 a month. Of that they, however, got nothing. It is due to them because they were in the field.</p>

<p>The question of this increasing pensions vote is one we shall have to consider. On page 16 of the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report it states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another disquieting feature is the pensioning of efficient public servants before they have reached the age of 60 years, throwing an additional burden on the revenue for added years of service, in addition to the salaries of the new incumbents.</block>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Pretoria (South), who said that we on this side of the House raised no objection to granting pensions to men&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">as, for instance, Mr. Robinson,</block>

<p>I say that we do object strongly to pensions that have been given to these men. For instance, there is Mr. Robinson, who had four years&#x2019; service before him, and I want to know why the country did not retain his services for that period. Then there is Mr. A. B. Hofmeyr, who had two-and-a-half years before him; Mr. H. C. Fleischer, one-and-a-sixth years; Mr. Lane, a robust young man with many years of useful work before him, had five years of equally useful service for the State before him. Mr. Robinson was on the Public Service Commission; Mr. Hofmeyr and Mr. Fleischer were the same. Mr. Lane was secretary to the late Prime Minister. Then there was Mr. Good, with one year; Mr. Jacklin, secretary of the Public Service Commission, with five years; and Mr. C. W. de Villiers, Attorney-General of the Transvaal, had a few years to go. I consider these cases were a waste of public money by retiring men at too early an age, who had many years before them for valuable public service to the country. I ask the Minister for the proportionate amounts out of this £329,000 which are due to reorganization and retrenchment respectively, and I want to know if he can give the House an idea which departments have found it necessary to undertake such reorganization as to account for this heavy additional expenditure? I would suggest the best way to deal with the public service is not to go on increasing its numbers and the pension list, but rather to have a smaller public service&#x2014;</p>

<p>Well, we took too much for granted, and did not for a moment have reason to think that such use would have been made of the funds we voted as has been done, in giving fat pensions to men not even in this country, not now in the service. I cannot help remembering that, in a previous session, when the question of pensions was mentioned, it was repeatedly suggested from those benches that any Civil Service pensioner who left South Africa or who failed to make his domicile here should forfeit the pension. I think the remarks of the hon. member for Pretoria (South) were uncalled for, and have created a state of feeling we did not want to see revived.</p>

<p>Two days ago we had a debate about pensions, and I must say that the &#x201C;Pensions Vote&#x201D; is growing tremendously, but the attack on the Minister of Finance for something which the whole House approved of and which he was instructed to carry out is not fair. A section of hon. members wants to throw all the blame on the Minister, but when the matter was under discussion, the Minister specially pointed out that we could not go too far, because it would cost too much money. We all from time to time heard the Minister&#x2019;s warning, and notwithstanding this, hon. members come here to-day and want to throw the responsibility for something they themselves did on to the Minister. Let me honestly say that the only way to remove all grievances is for this House to authorize the Minister of Finance to expend just as much money as is necessary to pay all people over 70 years a pension, irrespective of the merits of his claim. If that is done, the person of 68 years, however, will come with a grievance. So it will go on. No, the Minister used his discretion, otherwise much more money would have been spent. Then voices would have been heard in the House. I <span class="col_643-644" refersTo="page_0391"/>should just like to ask the Minister whether other persons who have already applied but have not yet been assisted will now be assisted out of the amount which we are asked to vote?</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the House will not be prepared to vote an unlimited sum to the Treasury to pay out. It appears to me, if I may venture to say so, that the demoralization of this country is going on at such a rate that in a very short time we shall have to pay out pensions to every poor white in the country. It is no credit to South Africa or the people of South Africa that this spirit should exist as it appears to exist, because, after all, most of these cases which have been brought up, as far as I can understand them, are cases of poverty. This is not the proper place to come to with such cases. Let me point out what the Auditor-General said about these matters&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By the South Africa Act the care of charitable institutions was entrusted to the provinces. By the Financial Relations Act the distribution of poor relief ....</block>

<p>It is largely poor relief you are asking for here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">. . . is one of the matters the control and legislatory power with regard to which may be transferred by the Governor-General to the provinces. By proclamation 115 of 1914 the transfer duly took place. One would expect that thereafter no payments partaking of the nature of relief of distress would be charged against Union Votes and that the incidence of all such payments would be found in the accounts of the provinces.</block>

<p>By law it is the provincial administrations that should be looking after these people. I suppose hon. members think that the Treasurer is very much more soft-hearted than the provincial administrators and provincial councils and so they come to him. The Auditor-General adds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Not only are such payments still being charged to Union Votes, but they are increasing to such an extent that I deem it my duty to draw the attention of Parliament to the fact.</block>

<p>At page 24 of the report the Auditor-General gives a list, amounting altogether to £568,000. That is the rate we are going at. No wonder the Minister has got to put his foot down. This state of things is not good for the people either. It is demoralizing to the people of this country that they should always come whining at the door of the Treasury asking for relief. As I say, it has come to such a stage that one can very safely foretell that every poor white in the country will be expecting a pension before long.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I agree that if that is the case it would be domoralizing. When a man, however, has reached the age of 70 years and is in need because he has sacrificed everything for the country and people, then it is another matter. I agree with the hon. member that we must be careful with pensions nor do I wish the Minister to go outside the Act. I, however, go so far as to say that I do not think the intention was for the Act to be administered the way it is being administered to-day. It was rightly mentioned that a man or woman who is already worn out and in needy circumstances will not receive support from a child who is only earning 4s. or 5s. a day. Now I ask the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) whether he expects a child to contribute to the support of its parents when he earns so little. He will have to answer No, and it is just such cases that we want to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice. I can assure the House that there is much dissatisfaction in my constituency because in many cases justice has not been done, and I agree with hon. members who said so. The best person to judge whether a man or a woman ought to receive the grant is the man on the spot, the magistrate, who knows, the circumstances. It should not be the office in Pretoria which knows nothing about the matter. In many cases the magistrate has made a recommendation but it is rejected and an answer sent that nothing can be done. What is demoralizing is that the parents who are worn out must go on their knees to their children for support when the latter cannot afford it. I know it is the child&#x2019;s duty, if he is able, but he often is unable to do so. There is possibly a young man who has got possession of ground, but who has bought it on credit.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. M. L. Malan) makes a general assertion that the officers of the department are unsympathetic. He says that numbers of applications are rejected after they have been recommended by the magistrate, because the department is unsympathetic. The hon. member, however, ought to give specific cases and then I shall see to it that the reason for rejection is given. The hon. member mentioned the case of a settler who is in debt for his ground and has to support his family. If the parents of such a person are in needy circumstances then even he ought to be able to give his parents something. If the position is as alleged by the hon. member that the South African child feels a duty towards his parents then there ought not to be so many complaints as we get to-day. If they appreciate their duty the complaints would not be so general. The hon. member ought not to make a sweeping assertion about unsympathetic treatment. If he gives specific cases I can try and show from the form which was sent in what reason the department had in refusing the application. Then we shall see whether the House is willing to lower the age limit, and to make provision for people who are landowners who are in debt for the ground. If more money is voted we will see what we can do. The officials carry out the regulations and the blame should not be placed on sympathetic officials in Pretoria. If the House wishes we can find out what it will cost to give everybody a pension. Members of Parliament can also do much to assist the Government in this matter.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. I. E. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I also wish to say a few words about the matter because although the dissatisfaction in my constituency is not so general there are some cases. There is the case of a farmer who owns 200 morgen of ground and has a wife and seven children His mother is living with him. He, however, has a bond of £1,200 on his ground (it is near Leslie) and during the past three years his harvest has failed. Hon. members know how drought has tried those parts. He applied to the Government for an allowance for his mother but it was refused. This is really a hard ease because the man has to support his wife and seven children and his mother as well. The allowance of £2 10s. per month is surely not enough and even when it is given the children have to maintain their parents. Give £2 10s. to an old person and we shall see that he cannot possibly live on it. The child must take him under his roof and do his washing and also give him food because the £2 10s. is not enough. It is easy to say that there are many complaints but I can assure the Minister that the people who have received the grant are satisfied with the assistance given by the Government. There is, however, dissatisfaction where people over the age have children who are not able to contribute any support and applications for the allowances are refused for that reason. It is said that the parents can sue their children but if a civil case is brought before the magistrate then it is easy to see what the result will be where the child is not able to provide for his household. It is not a fact that we are dissatisfied with the grants and that we want them to be increased. The old people are satisfied with £2 10s. Before the money is given the position was very bad. I am glad that the Minister has provided for needy people. In the case I have mentioned the old mother did not get a grant because the policeman went to the farm and found out that the son owned 200 morgen. The constable, however, did not ask how much debt there was on the ground. I will not say that the department was unsympathetic because it was sympathetic towards the old people in my constituency who got grants, but there are many cases which have not been thoroughly investigated. I want the children&#x2019;s debts to be stated. Persons entitled to the grant ought not to be deprived of it. I do not understand hon. members wanting to give a grant to all poor people because that is impossible. The Minister had £30,000 voted last year and the department spent £60,000. I understand the department will get more this year to assist all the cases. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) said that we wanted to give this allowance to all the poor whites but that is not correct. We wish that the persons about whom the House decided last year, oudstryders above 70 and their widows above 65 years, should get the grant. It is not exactly the case that they should be so poor. I can, however, understand that the Minister cannot give the grant to everybody because some of them are rich people. I am not pleading for them but I think that the persons entitled to it, viz., who have attained the age limit and whose children cannot support them ought to receive the grant.</p>

<p>When the Act was passed last year the Government and hon. members did not think it would cost so much, and if I had known that the amount would run into £366,000, I should have thought before I voted for it. Now, however, it has been passed, and there is nothing to be done. There are, however, hon. members opposite who are trying to make political capital out of it, and I cannot understand it. The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Struben), e.g., comes and objects to the amounts which have been paid, but in reality he is only thinking of the case of Dr. Leyds. He says further that it has often been said from this side of the House that a pension <span class="col_647-648" refersTo="page_0393"/>ought not to be paid when anyone lives in another country.

<p>I say that it is not an honour to our country that such an Act is on our statute book by which comparatively young men can draw pensions of from £100 to £1,700. We can understand an old and worn-out official who has passed his life in the public service drawing a good pension, but a provision of that nature ought to be taken out of our pension laws. When are we going to cry &#x201C;halt&#x201D; in connection with pensions? We see that we have to spend more every year according to the Act in force, and I ask whether it is not time that the House should take the subject of pensions into consideration. I think it is our duty. We must do justice to the oudstryders because we have every sympathy with what they did, but we have not sympathy with people who have wasted their money. If one works and saves while he is young then he need not work when he is old. The question of old age pensions has been mentioned, and I have expressed myself against them I said that needy people should present petitions, but that old age pensions would undermine the thrift of the people. I ask the Opposition to suggest that we should amend the Pension Act because they are responsible for it. We all feel that the way things are being conducted to-day is absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>I think the great mistake in connection with pensions is the fact that hon. members from the countryside make too many promises to their electors. Whatever Government may be in power people are taking note of what is said inside the House and outside. I agree with the hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) that an amendment should be made in the present scale of pensions because the burden of pensions is more than the country can bear. I am glad that the Minister in many cases uses his own judgment because things are getting too bad. The hon. member for Albert now wants to put the blame for the pension laws on to the Opposition, but he forgets that the great objection is that young officials under 60 years draw a large pension. The case of Mr. G. R. Hofmeyer has been mentioned, and he is still a young man able to work. Why then was he retired and another put in his place? Further, all the members of the Public Service Commission were retired. Who is responsible for that? It is the Government and because politics have been too much dragged into the matter. As regards the Act of last year, I also wish to assume my responsibility because that is no more than right. We, however, were not responsible for the introduction of it. If we had known that some of the people, who get the pension to-day, would receive it, then I am certain that no one would have voted for the Bill, even a large number of members on the opposite side of the House. The Act was passed as a result of hasty legislation. It was introduced at the end of the session when hon. members were already tired. I do not wish to make the excuse that I was not here, because I was present, but I hope that the Government, and all of us, will learn a lesson that we must not allow legislation to pass so quickly through the House. I have listened, and every hon. member opposite has pleaded so strongly for the old people&#x2019;s pensions. I admit there are some who need them, but they want to take away all the responsibility from the children. That is a wrong principle, but it is defended here by the leaders of the people, and also at meetings outside. Let us stop making promises at election time that people will get 5s. per day. There is not a country in the world that can afford it. I was asked at my meetings if I would vote for a grant of 5s. per day, but I said, no. It is not fair towards the other provinces. I think that hon. members of the Cape are very patient in permitting all this amount of money to be paid out in the other provinces.</p>

<p>I am very sorry to hear the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) say that the members of the Nationalist party of the Transvaal made certain promises on the countryside and that on that account they are in trouble to-day. I deny most strongly that promises were ever made by members of that party of the kind mentioned by the hon. member. On the other hand promises were actually made by the South African party and they now are again occupied in making promises in the Transvaal and stating that when they come back into power the old burghers would get 5s. per day. Let us be honest and admit that the whole House is responsible for the amount which was voted for the officials. If I had known that the amount would be so large I would not have voted for it, but if ever there was a noble deed done by Government then it was the provision for the needs of poor people. The people have sacrificed everything, and if they are in difficulty to-day it is the duty of the Government to support them. The people can also quite freely come to the Government for support. The magistrate in our district has met the people sympathetically, but there are some needy cases, and I certainly think that the Minister&#x2014;who is always ready to give assistance in such cases&#x2014;<span class="col_649-650" refersTo="page_0394"/>will also grant the further necessary assistance in such extreme cases.</p>

<p>The sympathy of every right thinking man must go out to the Minister for the attitude he has taken up in this matter, and I would like to add my tribute to those already paid him. I think two of the most abused words in the English language in this House are &#x201C;sympathetic treatment.&#x201D; Someone has only to allege a hardship and without any evidence it becomes a hardship in the minds of certain people, and anyone who refuses to agree to that view is stamped at once as being unsympathetic and animated by racial or other discreditable feelings. In that way we are rapidly reaching the state of affairs when Parliament will become nothing but poor law guardians. I venture to support the warning given by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) against the dangerous tendencies which are revealing themselves in this House. Can the Minister give the House any information as to the number of requests granted, the number of applications received, and the number of totally unfounded applications rejected. I want to revert to Item C&#x2014;compensation allowances for loss of office owing to re-organization and retrenchment, £329,000. I wish to endorse the request made by the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Nathan) that information should be given showing how this amount is arrived at. When you look at the total additional estimates you see that they amount to £747,493, and taking off the savings of £400,000 the total additional estimates are thus £347,000, almost the whole of which is accounted for by the item of £329,000 to which I have referred. In other words, if Item C did not exist, there would be no necessity for additional estimates, except for a vote on the savings. The hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) made an attack on the principle of re-organization, and on the law which allows it. Perhaps he does not realize that re-organization is necessary in times of financial stress. What we object to, however, is re-organization being made an opportunity for increasing the pensions of retiring officials. We do not object to the power to re-organize, for on occasions it may be vital to the State to have such a power. What we fear is a very serious tendency to effect a mock retrenchment by making use of a section of the law which is intended to lighten the burden on the taxpayers. To what extent has this mock re-organization reduced the net cost to the country of the administration, and what number of officials have been retrenched? Take the illustrations given by the Auditor-General&#x2014;Messrs. V. G. M. Robinson, A. B. Hofmeyr and H. C. Fleischer, members of the late Public Service Commission. Three other gentlemen have been appointed in their places. Then there are the cases of Mr. G. R. Hofmeyr, late Administrator of South-West Africa, Mr. E. F. C. Lane, Mr. J. Good, Mr. S. Jacklin, Mr. C. W. de Villiers, and Sir R. Blankenberg. With the exception of Mr. de Villiers, late Attorney-General of the Transvaal, in every instance another man had to be put in the place of the man pensioned. Jacob has supplanted Esau, and there is no economy in that. We want to know the principle on which the Government has been going in this matter, for we fear that the economy in the administration has not been so effective as the Minister himself would have liked. If the service is liable to this re-organization and retrenchment not entirely in the public interests, you get a highly disorganized service, and injustice to the men and to the public. A great feeling of uncertainty will be created in the service. Is it a fact that in a large number of the cases mentioned by the Auditor-General of people retired with an added number of years to their service, yet despite the proverbial difficulty of old civil servants obtaining employment half-a-dozen of these men have been snapped up by people who know the value of £ s. d. Well, we have a great loss to the country because these men, with their valuable service, go off into new employment and leave the service of the country in which work they have spent a large number of years in acquiring proficiency. That is not a thing to the credit of the country.</p>

<p>I am taking the men who have been retired with years of service added to them. The age varies. For judges it is one age, for engine-drivers another age is taken. Even 60 is regarded as pretty young in the opinion of members who have got to that age. The Minister of Mines has missed my point. The point is why retired men, when they have to have years of service added in order to retire them and make the country pay for that retirement. All these cases referred to are before the age of retirement, whatever it is, and they only get the added years because they are retired compulsorily, and every one of them are good men. I should like to emphasize this one point. If they are not retired because they are inefficient or because the country has no use for their services, then what are the grounds for retirement? I feel regret that Messrs. Robinson, Hofmeyer and Fleischer were retired in the curcumstances they were retired. I do not want to say vindictively, but judging from the remarks made in this House by Ministers, it would appear the retirement of these three members was entirely based on political grounds.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Von Brandis (Mr. Nathan), for East London (City) (the Rev. Mr. Rider), and for Rondeboseh (Mr. Close) have asked me to give certain particulars in regard to these votes. I have never declined to give the fullest information, and I will see that a tabulated list is given to the hon. members in due course. With regard to the £31,000 payment made to aged and infirm people, hon. members will remember that I told the House there were between 2,000 and 3.000 of these people already on the books. We have no objection to giving the House the lists of these. All the other cases are dealt with by Act of Parliament&#x2014;<span class="col_651-652" refersTo="page_0395"/>with the exception of these payments to the old and infirm people, where we have merely paid the amount I have estimated, and they are being dealt with on general principles on which I have informed the House. The hon. member for Rondebosch has dealt with the question of reorganization and retrenchment before the officials have reached the normal age of retirement. Let me assure hon. members that the Government does not go in for the wholesale reorganization and retrenchment which is imagined. We have instances in the past where the previous Government, for reasons of economy, for instance in the post office, retrenched a number of officials and brought down the salary list. Afterwards the work of the post office expanded, and a lot of people had to be taken on again. I do not consider that is economy. That has taken place in the previous Government, but this Government has not gone in for that policy except for the Defence Department reorganization of last year. Hon. members will remember when the Minister of Defence laid his scheme of reorganization before the House, and, under that scheme a number of officers left the service and compensation had to be given. The hon. member bases his argument on the types of men given in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report this afternoon. There are not many other cases where that happened. Take the case of Sir Robert Kotzé. I do not know the circumstances, but in his case he had allready reached the age of retirement, and was going on from year to year. Eventually he left the service. In his case no years were added to his period of service, and he would not get any added compensation. Take other cases. He will find in all these cases we are not dealing with ordinary so-called public servants. The gentlemen happen to have been members of the public service, but at the time they were retrenched they were incumbents of certain offices, and the Government had laid down they should not be members of the public service. It must have been contemplated that when the new Government came into office, for reasons of policy, changes would be made.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The Act of Parliament contemplates that incumbents of that office would not be members of the public service. The law lays down if they eventually left they would be entitled to the compensation. I do not want to go into the reasons why, on the change of Government, the Government thought it necessary to make alterations. Take Mr. Jacklin. There was no reason why the Government wanted to get rid of his services. The previous Prime Minister had made representations to the League of Nations that they should give South Africans a chance, when there were any vacant offices, of appointment to those offices. When a post in the League of Nations fell vacant, it was offered to Mr. Jacklin. In fact, the Public Service Commission recommended Mr. Jacklin as a capable officer for the post, but Mr. Jacklin thought that the post would only be for a number of years and that in it he had no security of tenure, and that for it he would be giving up his appointment in South Africa. We decided that if he left the South African service, he should get retrenchment terms. There was no ulterior motive there. Take de Villiers&#x2019; case. That was the result of an Act passed last year which the hon. member supported. The Minister of Justice had given an undertaking that if any of the Attorney-Generals were affected, they would have the right to retire under the ordinary retrenchment terms. In the remaining case, that of Mr. Lane, the hon. member will appreciate the position. With the change of Government it was considered necessary that the Prime Minister should have an opportunity of having somebody to fill the post of private secretary, a post which required somebody peculiarly fitted for it, a confidential post. He wanted to make a change. The Public Service Commission was asked to find a position for Mr. Lane. It is not always easy to incorporate in the service officers who have held special posts. Unfortunately, it was found impossible to find a post for Mr. Lane, and he was allowed to be retired, again on ordinary retrenchment terms. I am sure the hon. member and the House will see that there has been no wholesale reorganization, as the hon. member seems to suspect. With the exception of the cases mentioned here, and perhaps one or two others which, I am sure, if they are mentioned, we can justify, and give adequate reasons for to the House, there has been no reorganizations, except in regard to the defence force, which was fully debated in the House last year.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The Public Service Commission that deals with these matters considered the whole question on its merits, and felt under the circumstances under which Mr. Jacklin was leaving the service&#x2014;a certain fixed post for something outside which nobody could tell how long it would last, and probably after a few years&#x2019; time a change would be made again&#x2014;that these terms were fair and reasonable. They made recommendations, and the Government accepted them. That was the old Public Service Commission. The hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) also asked me how many people had made application under this Act, and how many claims were rejected. I find that there were about 1,400 claims rejected for various reasons. <span class="col_653-654" refersTo="page_0396"/>I will mention them to the House. We have really excluded quite large classes of people who thought they were entitled to come in under this Act. The Treasury did not accept all the cases that were recommended by the select committee which sat on this matter. If there are still hard cases, the people concerned will have to take the ordinary course and petition Parliament, and their cases may be heard by select committee. I have no intention of amending the legislation which was passed in order to include classes of people who were excluded under previous legislation. That will be the reply in regard to the cases mentioned by the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Swart). He has mentioned two cases of officials who, because they were taken over from the service of one province to the service of another, are excluded from the benefiting legislation of both provinces. These cases are unfortunate, and all I can say is that those gentlemen should apply in the ordinary course to the Select Committee on Pensions. I just wish to give some information to the hon. member (Mr. Close) of the classes of persons who applied and whose claims were rejected, persons who fall under the 1,400. There were those people who, although they were officials, did not receive compensation under the principal Act of 1908. That is the reason also for the exclusion, for instance, of the hon. member for Standerton himself (Gen. Smuts), who, technically, although he was really an official and entitled to the benefits, did not for his own reasons make application. There are a few of those cases. They would fall under this category, where, if they like, they can petition Parliament, and the select committee can deal with the cases. Then you get a large class of people who have less than one year&#x2019;s service. That is the class under which the artillerymen of my hon. friend the member for Pretoria (South) (Dr. van Broekhuizen) fall. Then you get a number of people whose service was not continuous. You also get a class of person, widows, who remarried and were not widows on 30th June, 1926.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#close">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CLOSE</person>:</from>

<p>I am going on with this. There is rightly or wrongly among members of the public service a very grave apprehension that there is a great deal of smelling-out going on in the public service. Nothing could be more detrimental to the public service than that an idea of that sort should get about. Some hon. member over there called out &#x201C;wrong.&#x201D; Could a greater justification be given to that fear than the answer given by the Minister about the alteration made in the Public Service Commission when he said that I must realize that on a change of government the law contemplates a change of personnel in the Public Service Commission? I repudiate that doctrine as strongly as I can. I think a more grave misconception of the functions of the Public Service Commission as contemplated in the Act of Union and in successive public service acts has hardly ever been enunciated by a responsible Minister of the Crown. We regret above all that the Minister of Finance should be the one to be the mouthpiece of the Government in making this statement to the House and to the country. What was the whole object and idea of the Public Service Commission? It was that it should be there as a bulwark between public servants and the Government and politics and political ideas of the day. That was the whole idea. We all knew in coming together at the time of the Act of Union that one of the prime factors in a contented state is a contented public service. That is to my mind the fundamental and the true and real construction and conception of the idea of the Public Service Commission, and I challenge any member who was on that National Convention&#x2014;the Prime Minister is one &#x2014;to deny that the idea of the Public Service Commission was exactly as I have stated. But now we have a Minister of the Crown justifying the changes that were made, not on the grounds that these members were inefficient or <span class="col_655-656" refersTo="page_0397"/>partisan or in any way incapable, but purely on the ground that with a change of Government there must be a change in the personnel of the commission. That in essence is the doctrine of the spoil system. We have had numerous examples in great countries of the terrible demoralization in the public service and in the country where the spoil system exists. We know certain parts of the world, in great states, where not only the officials of the public service go out, but judges of the court go out; and those who have read books on certain aspects of judicial life in certain of the states of America know how the terrible demoralization and corruption brought about by the fact that a change of government meant a change in the personnel of the judges. Fortunately we have been so far entirely free from that, but when we touch on the service in this way I say we are doing the gravest wrong to the service and to the country when we set up a doctrine that a body that has most to do with the safety and honour of the public servants is a body which should be allowed to be changed at the will of any particular Minister. Does that mean that every candidate for the Public Service Commission has to pass an examination as to whether he is in agreement for instance with the doctrines of the Minister of Agriculture or the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs? God forbid! I have always regarded the public service as one of our most treasured possessions. Ours has always had a sound tone and good repute, but if anyone is going to tamper with its integrity, its reputation and its honour, it is to be done by means of the spoil system. I do feel the deepest regret that that doctrine should be enunciated as a justification for these particular three cases. The statement the Minister has made transcends in importance anything that has been said in this House during the session. We are getting to the bedrock of things. If the commission is going to be whipped about at the whim of the government of the day then God help the service and the country.</p>

It has been realized always that there are certain officers in this country where these gentlemen are appointed for a certain period and the Government will have an opportunity of saying whether they should be re-appointed or not. The position of this gentleman is analogous to that of the administrators. Where we, in the case of the Administrator of South-West Africa, did not consider it necessary to re-appoint him, where the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen.

<p>The attitude of the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) reminds me of a joke which took place before the magistrate of Heidelberg. An agent came and took an exception against a summons and set out the ground. Then the magistrate said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I dismiss the exception with costs because the exception is not an exception but an insinuation.</block>

<p>What the hon. member for Rondebosch has stated here is a pure insinuation and he cannot give a single instance. Before, however, he made the groundless accusation this afternoon he gave an example, on being passed thereto by hon. members opposite, that of Sir Robert Kotzé. I know what a fuss the hon. leader of the Opposition (Gen. Smuts) made about that and I hope the House will believe that I can judge fairly impartially about the case because it took place in my absence. The papers in connection with the matter have already at the request of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) been laid on the Table. The case of Sir Robert Kotzé is simply that he attained the age of 55 years and that twice thereafter he was appointed for a year. The question of the appointment of a chief inspector of machinery was under discussion but before the matter was concluded before the proper body, the Public Service Commission, Sir Robert Kotzé exhibited the questionable taste of writing a letter to the secretary of my department in which he requested the secretary to inform the Minister that if a certain person were appointed he would resign. I say that if an official takes up such an attitude he shows that he is no longer fitted to remain in the service, or he has given complete proof that he is no longer fitted to occupy such a post, and that he has not a proper appreciation of his duty towards his Minister, the Government and the country. When Sir Robert Kotzé made that threat, because it cannot be called otherwise, there was only one way open for any self-respecting Minister and the Government and that was to say to him&#x2014;</p>

I think that that is fairly convincing proof of the spirit of the commission and of its suitability to judge about such an important matter as the knowledge of the two State languages, an important point which arises in connection with appointments in the public service. The Public Service Commission had a dispute with the Government about that and the result naturally was what everyone could foresee having in view the importance of the matter.

<p>What did they say when they came to the appointment of the chief inspector of machinery? In the face of the protests of the Government Mining Engineer, they recommended a man who was not bilingual. When it comes to the question of appointing someone who for personal or other reasons it is desired to put into a job, then the matter of bilingualism does not come in. Another point I would like to mention. The Minister of Finance is technically perfectly right. The period of office of the Public Service Commissioners expired, and the Government had the right either to retain them or to appoint fresh commissioners. It looked a little suspicious, however, when the Government came into office, for it to be proclaimed by a responsible Minister that they were going to get these commissioners out. A complete change was introduced in regard to the functions of the Public Service Commission. That commission was appointed and its duties are laid down in an Act of Parliament. Those duties include, in the case of new appointments or promotions, the making of a recommendation <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_0399"/>to the Government by the commission. If the commission is to carry out its functions properly, surely it is its duty to make a recommendation to the Government before the Government has made up its mind whom it is going to appoint. But in the case of the Chief Inspector of Machinery, the Minister wrote to the commission saying &#x201C;I am going to appoint Mr. Mullins; whom do you recommend?&#x201D; It is part of the duty of the Public Service Commission to make a recommendation when an official is to be retired on superannuation. We are told that the retirement of Sir Robert Kotzé was because the Government was dissatisfied with a letter which he wrote. The Under Secretary for Mines, writing to the acting secretary of the Public Service Commission, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has now been decided to place Sir Robert Kotzé on pension as from November 1st, and I shall be glad of the commission&#x2019;s approval of his retirement.</block>

<p>It is an absolute quibble on the part of the hon. member. He put certain questions on the matter, and they were answered. He was told that Sir Robert Kotzé&#x2019;s appointment had been continued for a year. He could be reappointed only with the authorization of the Minister, and when Sir Robert wrote this unprecedented letter containing a threat, he was informed that at the end of that period he would not be reappointed, and that he could leave in November, because that would give him full pay for six months up to the end of his then current year in lieu of leave. It did not lie within the function or powers of the Public Service Commission to repudiate the decision of the Minister. I hope it is clear now.</p>

<p>I want to make clear what I mean. The hon. member was referring to this strange practice about the Public Service Commission being approached in regard to the filling of vacancies or promotions. I said that was the practice which I found to prevail on taking office. The head of the department knows his staff, and if a promotion is to be effected, and somebody to be appointed, he would write to the Public Service Commissioner saying he thought this was the man, Do you approve or not?&#x201D; That is the practice, but the hon. member thinks it is a wonderful new practice introduced by this Government. It has been quite free to the Public Service Commission, and they do so very often, not to approve of the wishes of the department, and that is nothing out of the common, and it is not an abuse of the functions or duties of the Minister or the department.</p>

<p>The hon. member will remember&#x2014;it is ancient history&#x2014;that during the war a certain quantity of wheat and flour was imported. The millers alleged that at that time a guarantee was given by the former Minister of Finance that they would be indemnified against any damage suffered owing to the direct action of the Government. After the importation of the wheat and flour the prices dropped, and the millers suffered damage. An action was instituted against the Government shortly before this Government came into office, and it was decided to defend the case, and the judgment went against the Government on certain parts of the claim. Then the matter was referred to an arbitrator who gave his judgment. It is as a result of that judgment that certain demands of the millers have now to be paid by the Government. So far I think three claims have been met, and certain further claims are still being considered.</p>

<p>In connection with this matter, I should like to ask a few questions. The Minister was particularly brief in his statement about the matter. An amount of £42,000 is mentioned in the report of the Auditor-General, but that states further that various negotiations are still pending in connection with the matter. Of course we get some details from the votes on the Estimates. £42,462 is brought up on this vote. To that must be added a sum of £27,500, which the Minister must have spent, in all a sum of £69,962, which has been paid in compensation. According to the Auditor-General, however, there are still various matters in this connection not yet disposed of, and I should like the Minister, in his reply, <span class="col_663-664" refersTo="page_0401"/>to tell us how much he thinks will further have to be paid in this connection.

<p>I would like the Minister to explain to the committee as fully as possible this amount of £42,462, payment of compensation for losses sustained by wheat importations in 1920. I would like that particularly to be put before the committee because my recollection is, when I first came into this House, of certain mismanagement in connection with the wheat importations and also some arrangement which had been made with the milling companies at that time. I remember that a committee sat and tried to come to some agreement with regard to the position. I think we ought to know that this tardy justice that is now being done to certain people is the result of either certain mismanagement or something that the House ought to know about, and I think the House ought to know who was responsible for the position, and that we should know exactly what we are doing. We have heard a good deal of comment upon other items which have been brought forward, and a great deal of excitement has been shown by certain members of this House. I do think that on an item such as this the House should be made fully acquainted, not only with the circumstances surrounding this particular loss, but also who were responsible, and why we have been such a long time in making good the wrong that was done by some previous Administration.</p>

Last year the loss according to the Auditor-General had amounted £588,000, and I should like the Minister to reveal the sin register a little, so that the House and the country can see how great the sin was and who the sinners were. Hon. members of the Opposition who live in glass houses should be careful not to throw stones. We have to do here with wasted money and the amount gets bigger and bigger.

<p>It is interesting to see how the old proverbs retain their value. The position of the supporters of the Government is that of a drowning man catching at a straw. Their Government has wasted so much money that they are thankful of such an opportunity of pointing to extravagance by the old South African party Government. Now one after the other talks about the importation of wheat, and raises as much dust as possible, but it will, anyhow, have no effect in the country. I do not believe that there is one supporter of the Government who will not admit that his Government makes mistakes, and I admit that the South African party Government made a mistake in importing wheat, but it was not done wilfully, nor with the object of giving a job to a pal, but with the best intentions to provide for the shortage that existed. I, however, trust that the present Government will learn one lesson from that mistake, viz., that Government cannot carry on business successfully, and that they will not try to establish a large and costly iron and steel factory.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>There is one highly-gratifying thing about this discussion, and that is we have awakened the other side to the question of extravagance. We have spent the last two days in trying to awaken their conscience and, undoubtedly, we have succeeded. This is one of the results of Governments going into business. Let the Government take a lesson from it, or they will make the same blunders as have been made here, and I have no doubt that we shall be regretting in a year or two&#x2019;s time the loss of some millions of money over this little steel and iron industry. I had nothing to do with this, nor had the right hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt). We were sitting on those benches at the time this <span class="col_665-666" refersTo="page_0402"/>transaction went through. I remember at the time that the Government were being pressed to provide food for the people, specially so by the Labour members.

<p>I don&#x2019;t want any defence. I was not a member of the Government and not responsible. There was nothing unbusinesslike about the transaction at all. What was done, and that was more through misunderstanding than anything else, was that too much flour was bought and, of course, the Government had great difficulty in getting rid of it. Had a moderate quantity been bought there would not have been this tremendous loss. I rise particularly to urge home the lesson. I hope the Minister of Finance will take it to heart. Here is a business transaction which the Government of the day went into in perfectly good faith and with good intentions. We thought we were going to be short of flour and we were persuaded, perfectly honestly, to import it ourselves. My hon. friend will learn that Governments always make a mull of things when they go into business, just as you are going to make a mull of the iron and steel industry if you go into that. I hope my hon. friend will take this to heart and see what are the results from Government interference with business.</p>

<p>I hope hon. members will not pursue the subject. The facts are well known, and there is no question as to who is to blame. I do not want to quarrel with the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) when he reads us a homily about Governments embarking in business. I am inclined to agree with him very largely, but I do not think he is quite right when he puts on a par this unfortunate transaction and our proposed experiment in regard to an iron and steel industry. If this was going to be an industry to be run by the Government, I think I would have strong objections too, but it is going to be a business undertaking. The hon. member need not be afraid. We have similar undertakings functioning very well. We have the Electricity Commission, where the Government took a share in connection with the establishment of that undertaking, and it is going to be one of the best things we have embarked upon. The treasury has had to find about four millions of money for that. The hon. member need not be afraid. This proposed venture is not going to be run by the Government. I want to give the House some information about the points which hon. members have raised. They have asked what the loss so far has been in connection with this transaction. The figures are as quoted by one hon. member from the report of the Auditor-General. About £588,000 has so far been debited to loan account. It has been regarded in the past as war expenditure and it was charged to that. We are now trying to wipe out the rest of the liability in connection with the cases that were instituted by various millers against the Government. Some of these claims have already been settled, and in so far as the liability has been ascertained up to now we are asking Parliament to vote the necessary amounts on our ordinary revenue estimates. Three cases have been settled. One is the Paarl Roller Flour Mills, the second is John Forrest &amp; Company, and the third is Daniel Mills &amp; Sons. The amount we have agreed to pay is what members find on the Estimates. In addition, on the other vote, we find the total amount of costs in all the proceedings, the original court proceedings and then the subsequent protracted arbitration proceedings, amounting to about £32,700. Other cases are being investigated, and the following claims have been so far submitted to the Government: the Natal Mill &amp; Elevator Company, Limited, they originally claimed £20,000; the South African Milling Company, Limited. £288,000; and Messrs. Pyott, Limited, £25,000. But, of course, I do not anticipate that anything like these amounts will be paid to them. We have been able to settle the other cases at a very much smaller amount than was originally estimated in the claims I am unable to provide on the Estimates now for the anticipated further loss, but very likely during the next financial year these claims will come in for settlement, and then I shall have to come later on and ask the House to vote the additional amounts. The total loss in regard to the flour that was purchased has already been debited, and is included in the amount of £588,000. I hope hon. members will not pursue the subject further, but will come to a vote.</p>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>I must say I am not quite satisfied. I do feel that hon. members on this side are to be congratulated on the very kindly manner in which the Minister has treated them. They spent the whole day in attacking the Minister for a mistake in which they were equally responsible with him, but now the Minister shows them how to be generous. I do not know whether I am to congratulate the South African party on the fact that the Minister agrees with them, or to commiserate with the Minister on the habit he <span class="col_667-668" refersTo="page_0403"/>has of agreeing with the South African party. I do say that the position, as far as the House and this committee are concerned, is very different from the point of view put by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). The mistake was not that the State entered into that enterprise, but the hopeless inefficiency of those who were responsible, in the first instance, and secondly it was due to the fact that they entered into the undertaking prejudiced against it, and not desiring to make a success of it. We should ask the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) what about the railways, roads, posts and telegraphs? Would he like the country to go back to the state of affairs when every person had to be responsible for his own sanitation? That is the logical result of what the hon. member has said. And the Minister of Finance is inclined to agree with it, which, I think, is due to the generosity of his heart. Experiments of a similar nature were made in Great Britain during the great war with the utmost possible success. They were successful to such an extent that Mr. Winston Churchill, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, detailed the works done by various Government departments which had taken over control where private enterprise had failed. The achievements of these Government enterprises and undertakings were such as to constitute the greatest argument for State socialism that had ever been produced. But the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) does not like to have Mr. Winston Churchill brought against him.</p>

The hon. member for Troyeville was a member of this House at the time, and he and his party were most insistent on this&#x2014;and I do not blame them for it. They were correct at the time. The Minister of Labour was a member of the Cost of Living Commission, which reported on the food supplies of the country, and particularly that there was a deficit with regard to wheat supply. It was shortly after the war, and the prices of all commodities were abnormal. My hon. friends on the cross benches insisted on the Government embarking on the world&#x2019;s market, and when the money was asked to be voted not a single Nationalist or Labour man objected to it. This wheat was bought in 1919-&#x2019;20, when every article was at an abnormal price. The Minister at that time might have over-bought, but that was on account of representations made to him about the needs of the country. It is admitted that there was a loss, but who got the benefit of it? The consumers of the country.</p>

<p>When this wheat was bought the farmers of Caledon got £5 a bag for their wheat, and many of them felt that prices were abnormal, and that consumers could never pay that price. Did the S.A. party control the prices of the farmers? We recognized one fact, and that was that this country did not produce sufficient wheat for its own consumption, and we had a deficit of 1,000,000 bags. Bona fide, on the reports presented to Parliament, it unanimously authorized the Government to embark upon the purchase of the wheat. There was a loss because a slump came after 1920, and the wheat had to be sacrificed at a lower price. The taxpayers of the country paid for it and the consumers got the benefit. Now hon. members on the cross benches get up and blame the Government of that day for embarking on that purchase!</p>

<speech by="#mostert">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) said that the former Government was such a good one. He said it did not wish to control the prices of the farmers, but if the farmers had enough wheat it was not necessary to import flour. We are not quarrelling about the importation of wheat or flour but about the guarantee given to the millers to indemnify them against loss. When the millers had the guarantee in their pockets they imported more flour on their own account and then the prices dropped. The millers then made the best deal that they had ever done. They did not deliver that flour to the Government but their own flour because their profit was certain on the flour for which the Government had given the guarantee. They just kept the flour in their warehouses and delivered that which they had obtained on their own account. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) says he was not responsible but he was a supporter of the see-it-through policy of the former Government and the members of that Government were as thick as thieves and the Government could not govern without the consent of the old Unionists. Let them admit it. Does the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) not yet know that we have to pay the world&#x2019;s price for flour? Now debt upon debt has to be paid but it is no use running away from the responsibility.</p>

The hon. member for Troyeville seems to have forgotten that at the time this matter occurred the biggest war in history had just finished, and the whole distribution of products was upset right throughout the world. The S.A. party Government of the time were in the predicament that they were warned, more particularly by members of the cross benches, that the food supply of the country was not sufficient for the demand, and that unless the Government would take immediate steps to remedy the matter there would be an enormous increase in the prices of the food supply to the people. At great cost they safeguarded that food supply. The only thing the Government could do was to take their courage in <span class="col_669-670" refersTo="page_0404"/>both hands and say that, whatever the cost, the people of the country had to be fed. The Government were out to see that the poorer classes were not exploited. The hon. member for Troyeville referred to the position with regard to various funds in England used for making various purchases. The hon. member could not have read the report of the English Auditor-General. At that time it was not a question of losing money, but a question of getting the goods. At the end of the war there was a report of the English Auditor-General that millions and millions of money had been lost in trading. To take one instance, the English Dye Corporation lost millions, and the judge who issued the order winding up the corporation remarked on the extraordinary way in which Government departments could lose money when they entered upon trade.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) has made a number of statements about the losses made by the British Government. I have here a copy of a report issued in 1920 by the British Minister of Munitions showing that by the sale of English wool of the value of £33,000,000 it made a profit of £6,000,000; colonial wool, £133,000.000 worth, net profit £25,000,000; hides and skins £13,000,000 worth, net profit £1,815,000; leather £4,500,000 worth, net profit £503,000: cotton fabrics £1,000,000 worth, net profit £78,000; chemicals £423.000 worth, net profit £24,000. The British Government handled foodstuffs to the value of £221,000,000 and made a net profit of £38,720,000. These figures show that properly administered by an efficient Government nationalization pays every time.</p>

<p>It is rather amusing to hear the fulminations and to witness the unctuous rectitude displayed by the other side, and to compare what hon. members said now with what they said when the matter of the flour purchase was originally before the House. The Minister of Defence is all smiles. When the matter was before Parliament he urged that the Government should import a sufficient supply of flour and make good the loss out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This shows that he expected that there was going to be a loss. In fact, he said that he realized that in order to go to the assistance of the public there was to be a loss, and he was quite reconciled to the fact. Does the Minister deny that he said this?</p>

The public had the benefit. We were pushed into this matter by the Labour party as it meant cheap food for the people.

<p>That is exactly what we say. I am sure he did not intend to be so sensible. The hon. member referred to the fact that the Minister of Defence stated definitely that he expected there would be a loss. That is perfectly true, and shows that the Minister of Defence knew the incompetence of the late Government, and therefore he naturally anticipated that there would be a loss. That loss, however, was occasioned by the Government making certain guarantees to the millers, and the people who benefited were not the poor people, but the millers. I feel that certain mistakes have been made which should be rectified. The hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) gave us an entirely wrong version of the position. I don&#x2019;t blame him for he was not in the House at the time. He was one of the gentlemen busy making snug. The hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige), who has given us some very wrong facts, was probably dozing in the chair at the time, and did not know what was going on. The late Government made a mistake in guaranteeing the millers against loss. The members of the Labour party advised the Government to sell the flour to private individuals, but the Government refused to do so.</p>

<p>I think that after the reasonable appeal of the Minister of Finance the discussion ought to end. It is anyhow only crying over spilt milk. There are members of the Labour party who now want to excuse themselves and therefore I cannot remain quiet. Some of the present members were not then in the House and I have noticed that they have had a good laugh. I can, however, assure them that the Government acted under pressure by the Labour and Nationalist parties because they were already then collaborating. The former Government made a mistake then, and it is useless arguing it away but sight must not be lost of the pressure. The hon. member for Pretoria (South) Dr. van Broekhuizen) enjoys speaking about the matter, but he felt bad to-day about the large sum of money which has been spent and of which he was the cause. He was glad now to have an opportunity to accuse the former Government of wasting money. It always happens that you have a number of birds of prey surrounding the Government and this Government will have the same experience. I more and more come to the conclusion that the principles of the South African party are the right principles. The hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. Mostert) has stated that we are the slaves of the Unionists, but at that time in the matter of the wheat transaction we were the slaves of the Labour party. That is the reason why I am so sorry for the Nationalist party because they are the slaves of the Labour party. The Nationalists will yet pay dearly for it. I hope that it will be a lesson to the present Government that the Labour party, who always wishes to poke its nose into the business of private people and wants to take away private property is not a desirable ally. I hope the Nationalist party will see that, and as we made a big mistake they will not make the same mistake again. It will be a good lesson to the Government to keep its hands out of the business of private people. There was a time in this country when everyone felt that there might be a scarcity of bread and the Government at that time acted with the best intentions. Hon. members opposite ought not therefore to abuse the South African Party to-night, especially as they said that they were going to put everything right.</p>

<block name="quote">Dear cars for High Commissioners.</block>

<p><span class="col_673-674" refersTo="page_0406"/>My mind has been going back to what happened some years ago when the wheat purchase was made. I remember when the Vote of the High Commissioner came on each year, it was made a field day by the Nationalists and Labour, and it was regularly moved to scrap the whole vote on the grounds that the High Commissioner was just an ornament in London, and the expenditure on him was wasted. We are not only asked now to perpetuate the office, but to purchase an expensive motor-car for the High Commissioner and pay for the upkeep. Normally I would not object to that. I think, following up the consistent policy of the South African party, to maintain the dignity of South Africa, it is right that the High Commissioner should be provided with a motor-car at State expense. But this request comes peculiarly from a party which has consistently grudged the existence of the High Commissioner at all. Remembering how the complaints went on, I have looked up the last year of the Smuts Government in office&#x2014;1923&#x2014;to see whether any signs of grace were shown by the Nationalists who are now asking for us to join in the provision of the motor-car. Mr. de Waal ( Nationalist) pointed out there were 32 clerical assistants engaged in that office at the cost of £13,000, which he thought excessive. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The time has come when the office of High Commissioner should be abolished.</block>

<p>He was in favour of a trade commissioner, and could see no justification for keeping up the office of High Commissioner&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every now and then he made a speech, but every time he opened his mouth he put his foot in it. That gentleman cost the country £4,000 a year, and the Clerk of the House could do the work better.</block>

<p>Mr. Pearce said, although he was opposed to the appointment of Mr. Spilhaus, he agreed he was carrying on his work well, but he thought the best course would be to abolish the office, and that when Parliament was not in session, they should be represented in London by the Cabinet. Dr. Visser was of opinion that the High Commissioner should be abolished, and we ought to have trade commissioners in the capitals of Europe. There seemed to him to be a great deal of snobbery associated with the office. Now we have my hon. friend coming forward asking for the provision of a £1,300 motor-car and the upkeep of the chauffeur. I take it he will wear livery, and that he will have the new flag on his uniform or somewhere on the car bonnet. Yet these Government members used to get up and talk about snobbery. It was a field day for the Nationalists, and I think the Minister himself used to join in that hue and cry. I see he shakes his head. Does he tell me he secretly deplored these annual attacks, and considered they were in bad taste? This request comes strangely indeed from the Nationalist Minister of Finance to keep up the dignity of the office of the High Commissioner in London by voting him a motorcar. Had the position been reversed, and we had been sitting on the Government benches, the House would have been kept for days debating it, and every drop in the backveld would have known all about the matter.</p>

<p>I quite agree that hon. members across the way have undergone a very considerable change at heart since they came into office in regard to the High Commissioner. I have been following the debates that took place when we were in power about the High Commissioner. I find that from 1918 onwards hon. members opposite tried to abolish the office, and they moved to reduce the High Commissioner&#x2019;s salary. In that year Mr. Fichardt <span class="col_675-676" refersTo="page_0407"/>moved in that direction. A certain Mr. de Waal moved to reduce the salary by £1,000&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">to signify once more the opinion of the House that the High Commissioner&#x2019;s expenditure should be reduced.</block>

<p>In 1920 Mr. Fichardt again raised the question. In 1921 Mr. Beyers, who I am afraid is the present Minister of Mines, asked the then Prime Minister what were the qualifications of the then High Commissioner.

<p>The Minister knows very well that I am not going to probe into this matter for the simple reason that we have too much respect for the dignity of our country. I am pointing out the difference between our attitude and the attitude of the Nationalists when they were in opposition. On this very vote they made a violent personal attack. The then High Commissioner was attacked on personal grounds, that he was incompetent, that he was a political favourite, and so on. He did this, that and the other. I am not going to follow the Opposition members of that time along that deplorable route.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>To carry on the continuity of the way in which the Nationalist party year after year attacked this very vote, I may say that in 1922 Mr. Fichardt, as the spokesman of the then Opposition, stated that the High Commissioner went on gaily spending money as he liked and that a check should be put upon his expenditure. In 1923, the year before the general election, a Mr. de Waal stated that the office should be abolished as too expensive. In the same year you find the hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce) making the brilliant suggestion that the office should be abolished and that a Cabinet Minister should go there occasionally. Mr. Pretorius saw no use in the office. The cream of the joke was that Mr. Munnik, our hon. friend from Vredefort, objected in 1923 to the High Commissioner calling for tenders for railway materials, as it would give rise to jobbery. The hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser) also objected on the same ground. You see the difference between the attitude in 1923, before the general election, and the present. Then there was nothing right about the High Commissioner&#x2019;s-office. The expenditure was criticized, the post should be abolished, railway material was not to be tendered for because it would give rise to jobbery. Statements were made by men who are now selling sleepers to the Government direct, and so on.</p>

<p>I deliberately disclaimed any intention to reflect on the High Commissioner&#x2019;s character. Did I not say repeatedly that I think too much of the dignity of our representation across the way to go into his private character? I repeated that twice at the least. I do not remember the Minister of Finance getting up to object at the time. At that time the present Minister of Mines and Industries made a personal attack, followed by other members, attacking the then High Commissioner, and the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) to his credit got up and objected to all this and the Minister of Defence got up and objected to this personal abuse being showered on the then High Commissioner.

If he would refer to the English Accounts and Papers 1922, vol. 11, page 104, he will see a list of losses there. On butter and cheese there was a loss of £1,945,000; dried fruits <span class="col_679-680" refersTo="page_0409"/>£716,000: bacons, hams and lards £2,183,000; vegetable supplies £403,000; and on the central livestock fund £1,711,000.

I would like a lead in this matter from the business men as to whether it is necessary to give all this statistical information.

<p>I understand the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty in regard to issuing the report in both languages, but I cannot see that the necessity for doing that will make the difference of more than a week in the issue of the statistics. It is only a question of setting up the figures in both instances. Previously this volume was read consistently by the commercial community because it was a guide as to the quantity of goods imported, but now, owing to the fact that the returns are three months behind&#x2014;on one occasion they were five months late&#x2014;they are useless as a guide to the course of trade. You don&#x2019;t want to know what people were importing last October, but last month. Now, as regards the question of detail, I rather agree with the Minister. I have always been under the impression that all this extra mass of detail was put in by the customs people and the Board of Trade to get data for their tariff figures, and if the Minister enquires into it, I don&#x2019;t think he will find the great mass of detail now appearing there comes by a demand from the commercial community. I think it rather comes from its own department, who want the figures for certain tariff suggestions of their&#x2019;s. I agree with the Minister, if you could guarantee the early issue of the statistics with a decrease in the details, it will be more valuable to the country than sticking to the details we have to-day, and issuing the publication so very long after the imports have appeared. I suggest to the Minister it does not mean a difference of a month in the publication of that journal simply because the same set of figures has to be put into the Dutch form.</p>

We should like to know whether the voluntary repatriation of Indians has increased, or whether the increase is due to the raising of the repatriation bonus. In connection with what the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Henderson ) has said, it seems to me that hon. members from Natal are still under the impression that the publications are only read in Natal, and that the Afrikaans-speaking people attach no importance to them. I can assure the hon. member that there are Afrikaans-speaking people who attach just as much importance to the publications as English-speaking people, and our taxpayers pay just as much for them as the people in Natal.

The number of English copies sold, and this return is up to date&#x2014; 18th February&#x2014;shows that 913 copies were sold in English and not a single copy was sold in Afrikaans, and that was for the publication of the 1925 annual report.</p>

What I want to know is this: Do these Governments pay their share towards the cost of this publication? If not, why should we pay the whole? I have looked through the publication. It extends over some sixty odd pages and at least one-third is taken up with the figures of importations into Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and actually some three or four pages are devoted to the trade between Southern and Northern Rhodesia.

Surely some arrangement could be made whereby those figures could be kept out of the Dutch copy. I am all with the Minister in trying to cut down our printing bill. I hope he will look into this question and see whether it is necessary to publish these figures for Southern and Northern Rhodesia at all and, if it is, whether they should not be left out of the Dutch copy, because they do not concern this country at all.</p>

<p>I think I will at once answer the two hon. members <span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0412"/>who spoke about the repatriation of Asiatics. The hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) asked for the figures which would show the increase in connection with the amount voted for repatriation. The figures are that last year there were about 14,000 Asiatics who left under the repatriation scheme, and this year about 2,200. The increase in the Vote is not the cause of the doubling of the bonus because that occurred even in 1924. The increase must be attributed to the additional number of Asiatics who have availed themselves of the repatriation scheme. The hon. member for Heidelberg (Mr. de Wet) asked from which provinces the Asiatics went. Most of them were from Natal, but I think some also came from the Transvaal. As the hon. member knows, the Asiatics in the Transvaal mostly belong to the trading class. Some are indeed called Arabs, but not because they belong to a different race than the Asiatic or Indian. It is only because they have a different religion and are Mohammedan. They come from Bombay and the others who are Hindoes and belong to the working classes come from Madras. They are all Indians.</p>

A great many want to go back, but they cannot get accommodation, and they are kept hanging about Durban often for weeks and weeks. If the Minister wants to make his repatriation scheme a success, he should provide steamers to take them away quickly.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I will just explain again in English what I said in reply to the hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals), that this increase is accounted for by the fact that a good many more Asiatics have availed themselves of our repatriation scheme. Last year it was 1,400, and this year it is 2,200. In connection with the point raised by the hon. gentleman, I can say that we have had great difficulties in the past to make suitable arrangements for transporting the Indians to India. We did the best under the circumstances, but owing to there not being proper arrangements with regard to the shipping, a large number of Indians did not avail themselves of repatriation who would otherwise have done so. They came to Durban and had to wait a long time, and before shipping facilities could again be provided they changed their minds. Under the agreement which has been entered into now between the Union Government and the Government of India, all that we hope will be improved in future, and in that, too, we are securing the co-operation of the Government of India. In future we will try to avail ourselves of the opportunity of sending a batch of repatriates to Bombay every fortnight.</p>

<p>These reports are published in other countries with much more promptitude than they are here. When I was in Australia I was struck by the admirable manner and the prompitude with which Government returns were issued. If the Minister of Finance wants to save money on printing it would be better to cease the publication of reports which are eighteen months or two years old, as there are very few members of Parliament or the public who take any interest in reading such belated information. It is really a waste of public money to publish reports which are out-of-date. What the public would prefer are shorter reports and to have figures as quickly as possible, even although they may not be audited figures. Owing to the delay in the issue of so many departmental reports many members do not think it worth while reading them.</p>

<p>This is an enormous increase, and I think we should have some information.

It had to be subject to the control, I think, of the Secretary of the Interior. Why cannot the same thing be done now? There should be some official who could say whether the printing was worth doing. Then another point. The duties on these things are very high. Has that not had some effect in sending this up?</p>

<p>I think we all agree with the hon. member that this vote is very high. £50,000 on the additional estimates is really very high, and I think this House and the Government generally should take steps to reduce the printing vote, but to appoint, in connection with this sub-department, an official who has got the veto with regard to printing sent in by different departments, is going too far. That will introduce the laying down of the policy in important matters to a subordinate official. I think that is a wrong policy. I give the hon. gentleman the assurance that the Cabinet is dealing with the whole matter of the printing vote, and during the first few months or so we are going into this matter to see if anything can be done to keep a check on the increase.</p>

<p>I believe the session before the import duty was raised from 25 per cent, to 40 per cent. I was informed by somebody who knew something about the subject that the printing houses were doing quite well with the 25 per cent. duty. Speaking as a farmer, farmers who desire to put their products on the market with printed labels of more than one colour, the cost in a case of 120 boxes comes to more than 1s. a box.

It is the view of a large number of fruit farmers in the country that the increased cost of the labels we have to put on our boxes and the individual wrappers on our fruit, to put them in a proper saleable manner on the London market, is of an extreme character indeed, and since the policy of the Government two years ago in raising the rates from 25 per cent to 40 per cent., the cost has been materially increased. I do not think anybody was more surprised than the <span class="col_689-690" refersTo="page_0414"/>printing establishments of this country when they found that the rate of 25 per cent., which was paying them very well, had been raised to 40 per cent.</p>

<p>I think it is very difficult to make an estimate as to how far the increase that is reflected in the estimates is due to the course which the hon. gentleman ( Sir Thomas Smartt) mentions. He can analyze the figures on the estimates as they stand here, and he will see that quite a number of those items have nothing to do with that particular source which he mentions. Let me say in general that the increase here on the estimates is mainly due to the increase in the volume of work done by the Government printing works. Take, for instance, A, Salaries, wages and allowances, £12,000. That is due to the employment of additional men and payment of overtime to meet the demands of departments. Overtime between April 1st, 1926, and January 31st last, alone, was £3,690.</p>

<p>The figure I have given shows that very largely the increase is due to an increased volume of work. Let me add that one of the chief sinners in connection with this is Parliament. The expenditure in connection with the printing of Parliament is included here, and the printing of last year compared with that of the previous year shows a very big increase. We, of course, as a Government, cannot control that, because the printing of Parliament is under the direct control of Parliament.</p>

I should like to know what the services consisted of, whether it was the appointment of sanitary inspectors and whether better work is being done there in regulating living and housing conditions.

<p>This sum is due to the necessity of spending a great deal more than we had anticipated in connection with the new diggings near Lichtenburg, which are an unexpected development. I visited the diggings mentioned by the hon. member last November; there is a great improvement. With big diamond diggings like that justifiable complaints were made as to the sanitary conditions. I visited them in November and on my return we sent from Pretoria an officer from the department and, taking advantage of my dual capacity, I also sent a most able sanitary officer from the Defence Department. He made a report and immediately steps were taken to ensure better sanitary accommodation. I think we owe to those steps the immunity we have had from an epidemic.
