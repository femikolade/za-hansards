<heading>Fruit Control Board.</heading>

<question by="#miller" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>Maj. MILLER:</from>

<p>Would the Minister of Railways and Harbours tell us for what reason the Fruit Control Board cancelled the arrangements made at considerable expense with the shipping companies at Durban for the export of citrus fruit at that port?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#miller">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE (for the Minister of Railways and Harbours):</from>

<p>The estimates of growers reflected a surplus of some 50,000 cases of fruit for June loading in excess of the shipping space available in the ordinary services&#x2014;namely, the Union-Castle service, the Australian via the Cape service, and the Holland-Afrika Line. For July loading a surplus of about 100,000 cases of fruit is reflected by growers&#x2019; estimates. To meet the requirements of shippers, and to avoid undue delays in shipment, the Board of Control, after a full discussion with the Executive Committee of the Citrus Exchange, chartered&#x2014;through the Union-Castle Company&#x2014;the s.s. &#x201C;Highland Enterprise&#x201D; which is due to arrive in Capetown today and is to load 50,000 cases of citrus fruit. The Board of Control also chartered the s.s. &#x201C;Edda,&#x201D; belonging to the Libera Triestina Line. This ship will probably arrive in Cape Town during the course of next week, and be at the disposal of the Board until the end of July. Both these charters were secured on very favourable terms. To send the chartered boats to Durban would involve citrus growers in a considerably higher rate of freight than if loading takes place at Cape Town, the first port of call. Moreover, if a chartered vessel has first to load at Durban, then to make the voyage to Cape Town and delay at Cape Town for eight or ten days to load fruit here, the fruit loaded at Durban would be in the ship&#x2019;s hold for a longer period of time than is thought desirable or safe. After consultation with the Executive Committee of the Citrus Exchange, it was decided to let both ships load at Cape Town only, both in the interests of economy and in the interests of the safety of the fruit itself&#x2014;which latter consideration must be the paramount consideration, and take precedence over port and local interests. It may be explained that fruit produced in Natal will be shipped through Durban and fruit produced in the Eastern Province will be shipped through Port Elizabeth and East London by the ordinary shipping services. The exercise of the powers conferred under section 4 (f) of the Perishable Products Export Control Act of 1926 is purely of a temporary nature to meet the exigencies of shipping.</p>

<p>In this schedule, which I have just received, I would like to know whether there is any mention of two or three pieces of land forming portion of the township of Pomeroy in the northern part of Natal. There has been some discussion going on between the Native Affairs Department and the Lands Department. I understand from the Minister of Lands that he is very anxious to have this land set aside for European settlement. It is not in, but it adjoins, a native location. The Native Affairs Department has put up a claim for this land, and so far there has been naturally a difference of opinion between the two departments.</p>

<p>It is one of the inherited cases. I immediately set about making the best inquiry I could to see that the interests of the natives are properly safeguarded. At the session before last I think it was, it was decided that a commission should be appointed by the Government to go into the matter again, and it was done. The commission, with Mr. Wheelwright, the chief native commissioner, again reported that it was favourable to the native interests, but at the same time there was some difference as to whether planters&#x2019; interests were looked up.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>I appeal to the Minister as he has increased the owner&#x2019;s rights to 220 claims in the Transvaal and to 400 claims in the Cape, O.F.S. and Natal, that he should go the whole hog and make the number 400 for the whole of the Union. This is a consolidating measure and the Minister has not hesitated to give away some State rights and to take away rights from owners simply to have equality. But he does not agree to putting the Transvaal on the same footing as the other provinces. When one remembers that there are 44½ claims in one morgen, and as my suggestion would only mean giving the Transvaal owner an additional 1½ morgen of his own farm in claims, what I ask is not a great matter.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>It is an absurdity to increase the number of claims as suggested by the hon. member. The 400 claims for the Cape apply only to a limited number of farms, but in respect of 94,000 farms the right remains at 50 claims. With that justification therefore, can we raise the Transvaal&#x2019;s number to 400 claims?</p>

<from>Col.-Cdt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COLLINS</person>:</from>

<p>There is a strong feeling in the Transvaal that this is the one province that has given more mineral rights and tremendous sums of money to the State than any other of the provinces, and here the Minister has an opportunity of levelling up and taking away part of their grievance. In 1908 we were both in the same Parliament and on that occasion owners&#x2019; rights were taken away to get a consolidating measure. He was as strong as I was in asking the Government not to take more rights away from the owners, yet year after year more rights have been taken away, and now for the sake of one-and-a-half morgen extra to the owners he sticks and says, &#x201C;No I will not make this.&#x201D; In the other provinces he gives away to get uniformity, but here he obstinately says &#x201C;no.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I hope the Minister will not harden his heart in this way, because, after all, section 73 is intended to preserve existing rights against the very drastic inroads made upon them in another portion of that clause. As the clause read without the word &#x201C;to&#x201D;, it referred only to actually existing claims. The word &#x201C;to&#x201D; was put in there to make it clear that what was preserved was not only the right to actually existing claims, but the right to get claims and make them come into existence. There are two classes of cases where people are perfectly entitled to take out their claims. They have complied with all the stages of the law and they are as much deserving of protection as the people who have been able to take out their claim It seems to me the Minister is unjustly depriving the people of this right The Minister has given no reason whatever why he draws this distinction between two classes which are equally deserving of protection.</p>

<p>I do not quite follow why the Minister introduces this amendment. Under section 74 the Minister can lease ground to companies and generally make exceptions. Now a licensed diamond buyer is debarred from getting a digger&#x2019;s certificate, and is debarred from competing for ground. I do not think that is the right thing to do.

<p>The simple explanation is this: it is obviously most undesirable that a person who is on the diggings as a diamond buyer should have any interest in a claim. Is it desirable to see a digger in the hands of a diamond buyer who can offer him any price he likes for his produce? If you go to the diggings you see 20 to 30 flags flying &#x201C;Diamond buyers&#x201D;: they have increased considerably now.

Persons in my department may be sent from the diggings, or to the diggings, and the information may be very valuable to a dishonest clerk. So we leave it to the Public Service Commission, in conjunction with the Advisory Council, to recommend to the Governor-General the issue of regulations dealing with the matter, and if those regulations are issued they will have the force of law and the penalty will apply. I think that is a very equitable arrangement. A prominent public servant who came to me with a deputation on this matter a considerable time ago, told me this morning that he was perfectly satisfied with this provision, so I hope it will now pass without any difficulty. I certainly feel that some provision of this nature should be made.</p>

<p>I would like to know whether the Minister has been approached by the people who produce these minerals which are to be graded, because it is a question, which I know from experience, has caused a certain amount of difficulty. Rhodesia I suppose, is a bigger producer of base metals than the Union, but they have not got any law of that kind there. So far as most of these base minerals which are exported in large quantities are concerned, the people who are concerned with the production of them do a vast deal themselves and they take care about the grading, etc. Take the question of mica I know that is an extremely difficult matter, because in most places mica is not produced from large mines, but by a number of small producers and it is extremely difficult to get this mica graded on the spot. I am not saying it is a bad thing to have this grading system, but I would like to know whether the Minister is doing this at the request of the people who are principally concerned with the production and sale of these products, or whether it is purely a Government measure, brought in at the instigation of the Trade Commissioner in America, because it may be that it will not have the desired effect.

<block name="quote">To add the following new sub-section, the existing clause to become sub-section (1):</block>

<block name="quote">(2) Whenever the Governor-General does any act under the authority conferred on him by sub-section (1), the Minister shall, within fourteen days after that act has been done, if Parliament is then in ordinary session, or, if Parliament is not then in ordinary session, within fourteen days of the next ensuing session, lay upon the Table of both Houses of Parliament a statement setting forth the reasons why that act was done.</block>

<p>I wish to say that I still disagree with this Bill and still think it unnecessary to impose this clause upon the Cape native, because, as the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) said last night, after more carefully considering this matter, the power we give the Government under our proclamation system is greater than the power conferred upon the Minister under this clause. In the speech that I made I told the Minister that, as far as our experience in the Transkei is concerned, the proclamation system gives them as much power as they are entitled to. I did not think it was necessary to impose this particular power in connection with the Cape Province and I am sorry that the Minister did not accept ray amendment then. It was turned down by the opposite party. The Minister says that this power is necessary and I understand that the department say that it is necessary, but I disagree with them, and I think that after this system has been administered in this province it will be found that that power is unnecessary and has been unnecessary. To my mind the only effect will be that it will instil a feeling of unrest in the minds of the natives of this province. My amendment is intended to ensure that this power shall only be exercised subject to the same restrictions and the same control as are imposed in connection with the proclamation system. I am sorry that the Minister of Native Affairs has not interested himself in this matter. I think that this is a wrong power, that it is going to react against the whole of the native policy of this Government and that it is going to create a feeling of unrest and dissatisfaction in the minds of the natives, which is absolutely and totally unnecessary. My amendment will, I believe, not only safeguard the native, but it will to a certain extent place a restriction upon the Government. I think that under the conditions there laid down the Minister, before he exercises these powers, will be extremely careful.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>I have taken the attitude all the time that this power is necessary in the interests of native administration. The argument is that this power is not necessary in the Cape although it is necessary in Natal, and it is admitted that it has acted beneficially in the past in Natal. It has never been abused; it has been used in the interests of the advancement of the natives. I would like to point out how we look upon the native administration of the Cape, so as to stress this point, that it is because of the weakness which is inherent in the administration of the Cape that that weakness is spreading to the north and, to a large extent, paralysing the power which one expects in the administration of native affairs When we talk about the Cape administration, what do we mean? There are three entirely different systems in the Cape. You have, for instance, the system in the Transkei, where the Government has greater powers than ever existed in Natal. On the other hand, in the Ciskei, you have no power whatever. There is no native law; the administration of native affairs is very haphazard, and native administration, because of the lack of powers is, more or less useless. In Bechuanaland there is an entirely different system of native affairs where the Government in no way interferes with native law, and native matters, and where administration is entirely carried on by the chief <span class="col_5799-5800" refersTo="page_1560"/>So we have three entirely conflicting administrations in the Cape. Obviously if the power of supreme chieftainship has been valuable in the Transkei, then it would be valuable elsewhere. The essence of administration by proclamation is&#x2014;you shall have a large unit of natives who can be ruled by one proclamation. Where you have different tribes scattered all over the place with different systems, it is necessary to have personal administration. Proclamation is applicable to large native territories, like the Transkei, where it can be spread over a large area of country, but in South Africa where we have different degrees of advancement amongst the natives, there is the necessity for personal rule where the system of proclamation cannot be applied in its entirety, and that is why we consider the power of supreme chief should remain with the Government. The system of proclamation in the Transkei is infinitely more drastic than is proposed in this Bill, because you can issue a proclamation which becomes law immediately, but in this Bill it is provided that a proclamation must be published in the &#x201C;Gazette&#x201D; a month before it becomes operative, and also there must be attached to the proclamation a report by the Native Affairs Commission, setting forth their opinions. The whole essence of government by proclamation is that it shall apply to the whole area. It is very undesirable to issue proclamations to deal with a very small section of people, therefore, I hope the Minister will adhere to the original clause.</p>

<p>May I ask the Minister, with respect to Section 10, whether he would consider the question of conferring upon the native commissioner the power to try divorces in cases of native marriage contracted according to civil or Christian rites&#x2019; In isolated districts, e.g., in Zululand, it would be a very expensive business for these natives, both in respect of law costs and in the way of travelling to have recourse to a superior court.

<p>It would&#x2019; be a very dangerous thing indeed to allow magistrates to grant divorces, whether in the case of natives or of anyone else. If a native wants a divorce, he has not to go to the capital town at all of a province. The hon. member has forgotten that there are such things as circuit courts. A native can also, if necessary, sue in forma pauperis, and he has only to present a petition to the court. You have all the safeguards.</p>

<p>I might tell the hon. member that is one of the points which was considered by the select committee, which came to the conclusion that it would be unwise to tamper with the existing law, and it would be laying down that native marriages, according to Christian rites, have less sanctity than European marriages. We considered there might be a case made for it, but, if so, it should be dealt with in an amendment of the marriage laws, and it would be unwise to put it into this Bill.

<p>With regard to sub-section (1) of 3, it has been represented to me that to confer on chiefs the power of dissolving marriages under native custom and native marriages registered under the native code in Natal would be an innovation of a very far-reaching kind, in so far as Natal is concerned. Hitherto, the magistrate has been the only authority competent to dissolve marriages of that kind, and, as these marriages are very effectively registered in every magistrate&#x2019;s office, and they often form the basis of litigation for the recovery of lobolo, it would be most confusing to let a native chief&#x2019;s court, which is not a court of record, have power to dissolve such marriages.</p>

<p>As the paragraph stands at present, any magistrate can have premises searched and take from those premises anything which may be regarded as calculated to cause hostility between natives and Europeans, and can order it to be destroyed. If the three words &#x201C;final and not&#x201D; are deleted from the clause it would be open to any person to go to the Appeal Court. No appeal is allowed, as the paragraph stands. I want the courts of this land to be open to everybody, whether they be black, white, yellow or green the courts of the land right at the very top to <span class="col_5805-5806" refersTo="page_1563"/>be open to all. The premises of any man might be searched, a man&#x2019;s house might be searched, and a sporting rifle might be found there or a heirloom. The magistrate, by writing, under this clause may authorize such articles to be destroyed. Now I want a man whose property has been seized in that way, to have the right to appeal so that the judges may decide whether this particular thing which has been discovered on his premises, should be destroyed or not. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment. It in no way interferes with the principle or framework of his Bill.

<p>I second the amendment. I hope the Minister will agree to this amendment. I trust that he will at last accept something from this little corner, towards which he has been obdurate. Take a case of books. You may have books dealing with the formation of trade unions. One particular magistrate may take one view, and another magistrate may take quite a different view in regard to such literature. I know of a case some time ago, which illustrates the divergent views which might be taken as to whether a novel was obscene. The magistrate considered that it was obscene. The case went to the Supreme Court, and the judges decided otherwise. The conviction was quashed. Power is given to the magistrate to authorize the destruction of evidence, and he may destroy evidence before the case comes on appeal, because, under this clause, you say that he may authorize the destruction of anything. If the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment is carried, it will not give any power of review or appeal against the warrant for the seizure of these things. What it is sought to bring under appeal or review is the order that these things are to be destroyed. I think there should be a review on the ground of irregularity in the proceedings, and an appeal should take place if desired as to whether a magistrate&#x2019;s opinion that these things are calculated to cause hostility is correct or not. That opinion may be held by a higher court to be entirely wrong. Then you will have some uniformity.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>If we allowed appeal and review, you would probably find that that is going to cost much more than the cost of the article destroyed. The article destroyed may be worth 10s., while the cost of proceedings on appeal or review may be £15. Where these administrative acts are concerned, I think it is much better that we should have finality. I have no objection to a section which says that the matter shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court. I certainly would not go further than that. I think we shall probably find that in hardly any case would advantage be taken of a right of this kind. I do not think this provision is going to assist anybody, but I am prepared to meet the hon. member, especially after the moving appeals made on behalf of the corner, but subject to the deletion of the words &#x201C;final and not&#x201D; and &#x201C;appeal or&#x201D;, so that the concluding words of the clause will read &#x201C;shall be subject to review.&#x201D; I am not moving that, but I am prepared to accept an amendment on those lines.</p>

<p>A case I would like to put to the Minister is that under Act 27 of 1913, certain townships which were specially set apart for sale to natives and coloured people, are specifically protected, and these townships&#x2014;there are only a few of them in the Transvaal&#x2014;have been carrying on, under the specific protection afforded by the Act, a perfectly legitimate business. Take a township where a company have sold off a portion of the erven. All the other erven lying there they have not been able to sell, or do not want to sell. If this unsold land is going to be taxed for light, water, etc., a heavy burden is going to be placed upon the company, and I submit that it would be fair to accept my amendment, whereby only the plot-holders shall be taxed, because, after all they are the only people who are going to get the benefit of these services.

<p>I am sorry to hear that, but leaving the department aside, is it fair to tax vacant ground which has nothing to do with the township? It might be inadvisable or unnecessary for them to sell anymore. A case has arisen where they could find no purchaser for it, yet the Minister proposes to tax this vacant land outside the township in order to provide the people within the township with light and water and other services. It seems to me an infringement of a very important principle. This company has no say over the money that is squeezed out of them. It is an elementary principle that if a man is taxed he is, at any rate, going to get the benefit of it himself. The very least tax they would have to pay is about £1,200. It will all go to these <span class="col_5807-5808" refersTo="page_1564"/>natives. It is a perfectly fair case, and I sincerely hope the Minister will accept my amendment.

<p>The trouble is that that is only one side of the picture. If a quarter of the surface of the township has been sold to natives it is not quite correct to say that the rates and taxes would only benefit the quarter that is being sold, because purchasers will be encouraged for the remaining township and will cause the value to increase. Take Rissik or Brooklyn, or any of these townships. The whole of the area is rateable for the benefit of the towns. The position with regard to the township my hon. friend mentions is that it is at present administered by a health committee. There is no intention to-day to call upon them for any rates but in case the health committee breaks down, and the Native Affairs Department have to do something more to prevent trouble occurring because of bad sanitation or something of that kind which might spread into Johannesburg proper, on that account the Department feels it is their duty to make provision for these rates and taxes. That power should not be confined to the actual land already sold, but also the other sold land. There is a percentage basis laid down, and it will not be more than 3d. in the £. That is the maximum. In case it becomes necessary by the present position breaking down, the department feels provision should be made in this Bill to meet any future emergency which may arise. The ordinary way in which rates are levied to-day is upon the owner, all over the country. If the department in this case decides simply to hit the owner, then it will be all the owners, even the owner who has bought land. Every owner is rated to-day. Why should the owner, simply because he is a speculative company, selling land to natives, not to be rated? It is very difficult to imagine why they should not be taxed in the same way. There has been no intention to make any discrimination between the native owner and the European owner. I should imagine the better course would be if the position should arise, to rate the owner and not the resident, but the department takes the power to choose one or the other.</p>

Under this clause which you have at present, the Governor-General may make regulations which will interfere with the power of these committees legally carrying on their functions as they do at present. The Minister, I think, ought to consider the position of townships which have health committees or similar local authorities functioning according to law. He talks about wanting to exercise his power only when the health committees break down. But that is not required in the Act. If they break down, the operation of the section would apply, but what you want to see is that these townships will not come under this section as long as you have health committees legally carrying on their work. I am assured that these committees have been carrying out local government work at very small expense to the natives. The Minister says the owners have no right to complain because the principle is the taxation of owners throughout the country. That is right, but owners are only taxed where they have a voice in the taxation, where they have power to register themselves as voters, and can put the people into the local administration who will levy the taxes. Of course, the principle is right that owners should pay. They are made to pay under the condition that they have a voice in the taxation, but here owners are being made to pay by regulations in the composition of which they have no voice whatever, and over which they have no control or say, and no power of retribution. In other words, they cannot vote out of office people who have imposed taxes which are too high. You should exempt from the operation of this power to make regulations all those areas where you have local authorities of that kind. I wonder if the Minister would consider framing a clause like that, for the purpose of exempting people where there is a health committee legally in existence.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister if this clause covers such townships as will not be populated by more than two-thirds natives. Take the location which has grown up at a place like Kliptown. The balance of natives may be such as to give them the voting power in that particular township, and on occasions where they have tried to form a health board the natives have turned it down. They do not want a health board. They do not want any health regulations. The whole place is a hiding place for thieves. It is a very important thing for the people in that district. Does the Minister consider that under this clause he has the power to deal with a place like the Race Course township where it is very necessary to bring about order and decency? Is it possible under any of our laws, to get these natives into the larger locations and abolish this particular location altogether?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>As far as Kliptown is concerned the whole question is whether two-thirds of the inhabitants are natives or not; if less than two-thirds are natives it would not fall within the purview of this section; if more than two-thirds are natives it is the intention of the Government to appoint a board in the interests of public <span class="col_5809-5810" refersTo="page_1565"/>health: but, of course, where one of these areas does not fall within the terms of this section the line must be drawn somewhere.</p>

<p>I have spoken to the hon. gentleman before hand, and I am quite willing to go into this matter during the recess, and see what we can do. That matter can stand over for next session. There is only really one contentious part, and that is the part containing the clauses dealing with vaccination. I think it is a very urgent case, and the Act as it is to-day has not been brought into operation for the last three or four years; gradually a very dangerous position is being created in the country.
