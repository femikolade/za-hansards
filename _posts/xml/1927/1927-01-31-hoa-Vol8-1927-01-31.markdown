<heading>Business of the House.</heading>

<question by="#smuts" to="#prime_minister">

<from>Gen. SMUTS:</from>

<p>I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question of which private notice has been given to him in regard to the business of the House:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether or not it is the intention of the Government to proceed with the Flag: Bill this session;</li>

<li>(2) whether the Government intends to proceed with the native Bills this session, or whether it is intended to hold some form of inquiry into the subject matter of the Bills before they are proceeded with; and</li>

<li>(3) whether he is prepared to make a statement to the House in regard to the agreement come to with the Indian delegation on the Indian question?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#prime_minister" to="#smuts">

<from>The PRIME MINISTER:</from>

<p>I quite admit that the questions are reasonable. The only reason why no mention of these matters was made in the opening speech was because when the House met for the last time during the previous session, it was clear what was to become of them. I will now give the following answers to the questions:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) The Government considers that it is in the interest of the country that the question of a flag for the Union should not remain <span class="col_9-10" refersTo="page_0074"/>a subject of continuing controversy, and proposes to introduce a measure dealing with it at an early date.</li>

<li>(2) It is the intention of the Government to proceed with the native Bills this session.</li>

<li>(3) As stated in the Governor-General&#x2019;s speech, the agreement which has been arrived at between representatives of the Governments of the Union and of India is of a provisional character, and will require the approval of the two Governments concerned before any public announcement can be made. After such approval shall have been obtained, a statement, which will simultaneously be made in India, will be submitted to the House for its information and, if required, for its consideration.</li></ol>

</answer>

<question by="#smuts" to="#prime_minister">

<from>Gen. SMUTS:</from>

<p>When will that be?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#prime_minister" to="#smuts">

<from>The PRIME MINISTER:</from>

<p>We do not know. It depends on the arrival of the delegates in India, and of the approval of the Government there. I expect it will be just after the middle of February.</p>

<p>That is far too early. The other two Bills have been before the House before, but this has never been before the House. It is rather an important matter to try and abolish trial by jury. It should take at least a fortnight in order to get to the country. The Minister should have a little more respect for the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>If there is anything in the Bill that requires an adjournment to Wednesday, I will agree to it at once; hut I want to move the second reading, and I will agree to the adjournment of the second reading debate after I have moved the second reading. I like to do things, not to delay things.</p>

<p>I would like to know whether it is recognized by the Government whether any special advantage will be attached to any applicant if he were to put his application through a Nationalist member. Why I ask that question is: A pensioner wanted to get certain particular benefits, and he was advised by a letter from the secretary of the Acting Prime Minister in reply to his application, that he should get a petition drawn up and sent to Parliament and hand it to a Nationalist member for presentation. I would like to know whether there is any special advantage to these poor, unfortunate people, who make applications, to put their petitions in the hands of Nationalist members; if it is so, well then, let the Government put an advertisement in the paper and advise applicants to that effect.</p>
