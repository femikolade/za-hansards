<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">That this House approves of the report on the status of Great Britain and the dominions adopted by the Imperial Conference on the 19th November, 1926.</block>

<p>The outstanding significance of the report which the motion standing in my name asks to approve of, is clear to each of us. To this country the declaration of dominion freedom, and consequently of Union freedom, national and international, contained in that report, cannot but be a matter of the very deepest interest. It is therefore no more than what is expected of us, the representatives of the people gathered together here, that an opportunity should be offered in this House, such as is contemplated by this motion, for the full and free discussion of that report. I need hardly point out that never before has a similar report been brought out by any Imperial Conference. What on previous occasions&#x2014;such as the Imperial Conference of 1923 and that of the reply of Mr. Lloyd George to the members of the independence delegation from South Africa in 1919&#x2014;had been given utterance to in mere incidental and fragmentary manner, based upon no greater authority than that of the individual British Prime Minister or other Minister making the statement; has in this report formed the subject of specific investigation; has with set purpose been considered, and decided upon by the unanimous judgment of the leading statesmen of Great Britain and the dominions assembled at the conference; has thereafter been specifically considered and confirmed by the Government of his Majesty the King in Great Britain, and finally sanctioned by his Majesty the King himself. The report, therefore, and the declaration of status contained therein, must necessarily carry an authority, both national and international, far surpassing anything of their kind ever published before. I shall now proceed to lay before this hon. House the main contents of the report, with observations. According to the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Equality of status, so far as Great Britain and the dominions are concerned, is &#x2026; the root principle governing our inter-imperial relations;</block>

<p>i.e., equality of status both domestic and external. That status is, according to the report, similar and equal to that of Great Britain; so that, knowing what the independence of Great Britain is and what the measure of that independence is, we also know what and how great that of South Africa is. The principle of equal status, therefore, defines both the nature (domestic and external) and the measure (sovereign) of our national freedom and independence. Great Britain and the Union being equal in status, the one is and can be, says the report, subject to no compulsion whatever from the other. On the contrary, being autonomous communities, equal in status, each State, the report says, is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Master of its own destiny &#x2026; in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs.</block>

<p>All this is, in relation to Great Britain and the dominions in general, tersely expressed by the report in the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">They are autonomous communities within the British empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British commonwealth of nations.</block>

<p>Apart from the mere legal state relationship, as expressed in terms of equality of status with Great Britain, the Union moreover stands related to Great Britain and the other dominions, in associated co-operation, as a member of the British commonwealth of nations. In that co-operative association of free and equal states the Union, like every other member, as the report emphasizes, is now, and must always remain, the sole judge of the nature and extent of its co-operation. In other words, no matter what may be the nature or extent of the Union&#x2019;s co-operation in the commonwealth, the independent status of the Union cannot be affected thereby, because whatever is done, is done by its own free will.</p>

<p>Functioning.&#x2014;Just as equality of status is, in the words of the report, the root principle governing inter-imperial relations, commonwealth co-operation is de facto the governing principle of commonwealth existence. The commonwealth is a league of free nations, freely co-operating with a view to security, peace and <span class="col_1841-1842" refersTo="page_0987"/>progress. While, therefore, the freedom of cooperation of its members necessitates that each member of that league shall be the sole judge of the nature and extent of its co-operation; in its co-operative action, i.e., in its functioning, it requires, according to the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">flexible machinery &#x2026; to deal with questions of diplomacy and questions of defence&#x2014;machinery which can from time to time be adapted to the changing circumstances of the world.</block>

<p>In the &#x201C;Journal of the Royal Institute of International Affairs&#x201D; for January, 1927, there appears an interesting and able address given by the right hon. Mr. Amery on November 30th, 1926, on &#x201C;some aspects of the Imperial Conference.&#x201D; In that address he inter alia says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Full equality of status between the dominions and the Mother Country is to-day explicitly and definitely recognised. Of course, that does not mean equality of stature. No resolutions of the conference can alter the fact that in wealth, in population, in armed power, in accumulated political experience, there are great differences amongst us. Nor does it necessarily mean identity of function. As Lord Balfour&#x2019;s report makes clear, Great Britain is bound for a long time to come to play a major part in the common external policy of the empire, in our common defence and in the control and administration of its dependent territories. What it does mean, is that each partner in the empire is equally entitled to exercise every function of national life, and if any such function is carried on for it by some other part of the empire, that is a matter of consent, of convenience, of mutual agreement, and not evidence of subordination on the part of one partner in the empire to another.</block>

<p>or, to use his words uttered in the House of Commons on 29th June, 1927&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The principle of equality is not in the least infringed, because one Government rather than another deals with questions affecting all. What is meant by equality of status is that as far as the question of rights is concerned, every Government of the empire is, if it so wish, entitled to exercise every function of national and international right.</block>

<p>III. Machinery.&#x2014;This subject, says the report, has also occupied our attention. Here the conference dealt with the subject first from the point of view of the relations between the various parts of the British empire, and, in so doing, examined existing administrative, legislative and judicial forms, which had become antiquated through the present state of constitutional development and had ceased to be in accord with the position at present occupied by the dominions. This examination included various matters, such as: (a) the title of his Majesty the King; (b) position of Governor-General; (c) operation of dominion legislation; (d) merchant shipping legislation; and (e) appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. With respect to these matters, I shall not detain the House long; merely a few short remarks concerning the position of the Governor-General. In conformity with the views expressed by the conference, the character of the position held by his Excellency the Governor-General in relation to the administration of public affairs of the Union, is now one corresponding to that held by his Majesty the King in Great Britain. He, therefore, no longer acts as the representative or agent of his Majesty&#x2019;s Government in Great Britain or of any department of that Government&#x2014;in relation, as I have said, to the administration of public affairs of the Union. The reasons why I so qualify this statement by adding the words &#x201C;of the Union,&#x201D; is because this does not apply when it concerns the office of high commissioner. I feel with the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts), that the Governor-General of the Union should not be excluded from taking charge of the office of high commissioner in South Africa for his Majesty&#x2019;s Government in Great Britain. I do not think that such exclusion would be in our interest. If at any future time it might appear that the holding of that office by the Governor-General is in conflict with the real interests of the state over which he presides, I have no doubt his Majesty&#x2019;s Government in Great Britain, upon request, will at once see that the necessary change be introduced. Except, therefore, in respect to matters concerning the high commissionership, his Excellency the Governor-General to-day represents only his Majesty the King, and the formal official channel of communication between his Majesty&#x2019;s Government in Great Britain and His Majesty&#x2019;s Government in the Union, is to-day between Government and Government direct. A few general remarks I now wish to make as to the three other matters mentioned in the report, viz., operation of dominion legislation; merchant shipping legislation; and appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Certain questions involved under these headings, but not decided upon by the conference, are indicated in the report, as also the reasons why these questions could not immediately be pronounced upon, and require close scrutiny and investigation before they can be brought into harmony with our declared constitutional position. In the meantime, allow me to say once more, it would be wrong to look upon these questions to-day as concerned with cases of inequality indicative of subordination. In so far as they do involve inequality, it is henceforth an inequality depending upon the free consent of the dominion concerned, and which is admittedly within the right of such dominion to have properly adjusted. What the conference has done is to advise that such adjustment should be effected, and to recommend that with a view thereto a committee should be set up to enquire into and advise as to how that adjustment shall be brought about. Until that adjustment has been effected, it is by the will of the dominion concerned that such inequality exists, and not because of any inferiority in <span class="col_1843-1844" refersTo="page_0988"/>existing status. In the words of Mr. Amery, already quoted by me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">. &#x2026; each partner in the empire is equally entitled to exercise every function of national life, and if any such function is carried on for it by some other part of the empire, that is a matter of consent, of convenience, of mutual arrangement, and not evidence of subordination on the part of one partner in the empire to another. &#x2026; Every Government of the empire is, if it so wish, entitled to exercise every function of national and international right.</block>

<p>Equality of status for us with Great Britain is, therefore, not a mere phrase; it is both a national and an international fact.</p>

<p>It may interest hon. members if I quote what a distinguished American constitutional lawyer, Prof. Lawrence Lowell, of Harvard University, has to say on this point. After a full and thorough discussion of the report we are now considering, he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The independence of the dominions, the absence of authority over them by Great Britain are real &#x2026;. So far as the dominions are concerned, the British empire has become, legally and constitutionally, little, if anything, more than a name.</block>

<p>Hon. members will remember when I came back from the Imperial Conference, that is also what I said. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The evolution of self-government has borne its logical fruit. It has brought the dominions to a condition of full constitutional independence.</block>

<p>The conference next dealt with the subject of commonwealth machinery from the point of view of relations with foreign countries. The dominions and Great Britain being equal in status, in no way subordinate in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, it was, of course, necessary that the Imperial Conference, considering Great Britain and the dominions in their combined action, i.e., through active co-operation seeking realization of their objectives: peace, security and progress&#x2014;should seek to recommend the means whereby that cooperation could, according to their view, best be assured and made effective. With a view to that, the conference inter alia took into consideration and advised upon questions of: (a) procedure in relation to treaties; (b) representation at international conferences; (c) general conduct of foreign policy; (d) issue of exequaturs to foreign consuls in the dominions; and (e) channel of communications between dominion governments and foreign governments. The rules or practices recommended in connection with these subject-matters are most often no more than a supplementing of what was adopted in 1923 for the guidance of the Governments of the commonwealth. Nothing can be gained by repeating these recommendations here and I shall therefore refer hon. members, who desire to know what they are, to the report itself. I would, however, like to draw the attention of the House to an observation by the conference which should never be lost sight of. Speaking on the subject of the general conduct of foreign policy, the conference after having observed that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">it was frankly recognized that in this sphere, as in the sphere of defence, the major share of responsibility rests now, and must for some time continue to rest, with his Majesty&#x2019;s Government in Great Britain,</block>

<p>gives expression to the following. &#x201C;We felt,&#x201D; it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">that the governing consideration underlying all discussions of this problem must be that neither Great Britain nor the dominions could be committed to the acceptance of active obligations except with the definite assent of their own Governments.</block>

<p>This governing consideration mentioned by the Imperial Conference is of the utmost importance and significance. Tacitly it re affirms in the sphere of foreign relations the general right of independent action of each separate member of the commonwealth, while it expressly disclaims liability and responsibility without consent in the conduct and conclusion of foreign relations, by no matter which of the members of the commonwealth. This governing consideration is a vital necessity for the international status of every member of the commonwealth, without which there could be no sovereign international independence for any member&#x2014;not even for Great Britain herself. It is this consideration upon which the group unit idea of empire of a few years ago had to suffer shipwreck, and upon which every similar idea involving the existence of a super-state or super-authority, must inevitably come to grief, so long as the members of the commonwealth are possessed of that healthy spirit of individual national pride and endeavour which characterises every one of them to-day. It is, finally, this consideration which has made the commonwealth possible, and which will make the commonwealth, as a league of free nations, persist and flourish when all empires based on the subjection of individual states shall have ceased to be possible. I would like to quote, with wholehearted approval, a passage from an address delivered in the University of Edinburgh on January 26th, 1927, by Lord Balfour, the distinguished chairman of the sub-committee of the Imperial Conference, which brought out the report. After having pointed out what it really was that was of importance in the achievements of the conference of 1926, as distinguished from previous Imperial Conferences, Lord Balfour continued as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">I should like to say something upon what is in some respects far more important&#x2014;the moral, emotional, sentimental, historical, call it what you will, but a side of this problem which looks behind and looks in front, and tries to forecast the future of that great institution to which formal expression was given in December last. You may ask me whether, having roughly explained what I conceive to be the constitution of the self-governing portions of the empire, I think <span class="col_1845-1846" refersTo="page_0989"/>it is the best possible constitution that could be contrived. The question is, in my opinion, an idle question, because the constitution now formally declared is absolutely the only constitution which is possible if the British empire is to exist, and we need not argue whether it would not be better to have a central authority, whether some means of coercion in extreme cases ought not to be contrived. All this constitution-mongering is utterly out of place when you are dealing with the natural growth of the British empire, and when you remember that that empire is scattered in fragments in every part of the habitable globe. It was possible for the framers of the American Constitution to give State rights and to combine with the gift or maintenance, whichever you like to call it, of State rights, a central authoritative Government, but America, large as she is, is on one continent, We are scattered in every continent, and it would be quite impossible for us in any sense to copy or to imitate the great work that was done by the English-speaking inhabitants of North America after the separation of the Mother Country. I myself, however, do not regard the absence of a central authority with the kind of fears that assail those who are brought up upon legal considerations, and who put emotional considerations on one side. I do not, of course, deny the importance of central authorities where you can have them. I will not admit, however, that though we are deprived of that great advantage we must inevitably describe ourselves as having to be content with the second best.</block>

<p>Perhaps hon. member will allow me to quote from the right hon. Mr. Amery in the address already referred to. &#x201C;I have,&#x201D; he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">given some indication of the kind of changes which have been suggested in Lord Balfour&#x2019;s report and accepted in principle by the conference in order to bring out more clearly the equality of status of each Government, the relationship of the dominions to ourselves and to each other. I know there are some people who see in all this the beginning of disruption of the British empire, who feel that the last vestige of any central authority for co-ordinating the policy of this empire, even in relation to the outside world, is gone and that there is therefore nothing to prevent the gradual breaking up of the empire by the development of a series of separate and eventually discordant local policies. Well, I should reply to that in quite general terms, that the empire has not been held together for a long time past by any central authority. It has been held together by its traditions, by its loyalty and by its ideals and interests&#x2014;these have combined to create and sustain the wish to remain united and have created the readiness in a crisis to act in union.</block>

<p>We have already heard the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs declare that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">&#x2026; every Government of the empire is, if it so wish, entitled to exercise every function of national and international life.</block>

<p>This clear statement, assigning to every individual state in the empire complete independence of choice and action nationally and internationally, is no more than what is contained on almost every page of the report.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this full dominion independence has from time to time been challenged, on the alleged ground that no member of the British commonwealth possesses the right to neutrality in the case of Great Britain or a dominion being at war.</p>

<p>As this contention, if true, would mean that no individual member of the commonwealth&#x2014;and again I say not even Great Britain&#x2014;can be accounted an international state unit, i.e., an internationally recognized independent state, I look upon it as imperatively necessary that before advising this hon. House to approve of the report of the Imperial Conference, to discuss the correctness of this contention.</p>

<p>Although this will be the first occasion upon which I lay before this House my reasons for holding the views I do on this subject, it is not unknown to hon. members that I am one of those who maintain that the Union, as every other dominion, has, in case of war between Great Britain and any other state, the right to remain neutral and to have her neutrality respected by the belligerents.</p>

<p>Those who differ from me in this view are prepared to concede that the Union, and likewise any other dominion, has the right to declare that it will not actively participate in any war in which Great Britain is involved; but then they proceed to maintain that from the moment Great Britain is at war with a foreign country, every dominion is ipso facto in a state of war no matter whether it has declared its neutrality or not&#x2014;in other words, that a declaration of neutrality by a dominion has no international force or binding effect in respect to Great Britain&#x2019;s enemy at war with her.</p>

<p>To me this view appeared fallacious long before 1919, and since the coming into existence of the League of Nations and the League membership of the dominions, I feel convinced that it must be rejected as wholly untenable.</p>

<p>Before pointing out the inconsistencies of that view with the status and obligations of the dominions under the League of Nations, let me refer to a few other objections to that view, quite apart from the League and the covenant.</p>

<p>First: The dominions are admitted to-day to be free and independent countries, equal in status to Great Britain and in no way subordinate to her in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, while they must now and always remain the sole judge of the nature and extent of their co-operation with Great Britain.</p>

<p>Such being the state of independent freedom of the dominions, on what grounds then could a dominion which has declared to the world her desire to be neutral in a war in which Great Britain is a belligerent, be denied the right of neutrality?</p>

<p><span class="col_1847-1848" refersTo="page_0990"/>To say that Great Britain&#x2019;s enemy, as I have so often heard, if it suits him will not respect that neutrality, surely is no answer. There is no certainty that it will respect the neutrality of any other nation, if war with that nation were to suit it better. The question is not what such an enemy may be inclined to do to us, but what it has the right to do.</p>

<p>If we were still in the colonial stage of our national existence&#x2014;mere subordinate parts and possessions of Great Britain&#x2014;no doubt England&#x2019;s enemy would have every right to consider us as part and parcel of Great Britain, and treat us, in spite of our declaration of neutrality, as the allies treated the German colonies during the late war.</p>

<p>But on what principle of law or equity could that be done against nations, explicitly declared free and emancipated from any form of subordination, no matter in what aspect of their national or international affairs?</p>

<p>To reject the right of a dominion to neutrality, therefore, to my mind, is to reject the status of the dominions as declared by the Imperial Conference and the report before the House.</p>

<p>If the dominions were to be accepted as being in a state of war the moment Great Britain is at war, then the same must obtain for Great Britain and the other dominions the moment one of these, say, Canada, goes to war; and it must obtain even then when Canada proceeds to war contrary to the declared will of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Can this really be accepted? If such a doctrine be accepted, then in what way can we be said to be autonomous, and what becomes of the declaration of the Imperial Conference, that each individual member of the commonwealth is now and must always remain the sole judge of the nature and extent of its co-operation?</p>

<p>But let us look at the question from a somewhat different point of view.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, it is the same theme. I am afraid hon. members do not like to be convinced. The denial of the right to individual neutrality, be it to Great Britain or to the dominions, not only implies a denial of individual national freedom in its full international scope, but necessarily also assumes the existence of a collective state entity having the character of an international persona, whose will overrides that of each of the constituent members of the British empire&#x2014;be it that of Great Britain or of a dominion. In other words, it assumes the existence of a super or higher central authority. I do not think there can be any doubt with regard to that. Let me, however, here remind hon. members, that the question of a higher or central authority is not one which was overlooked, or merely by implication decided upon by the Imperial Conference. On the contrary, it was specifically raised during the discussion at the conference, and the idea of any central or coercive authority was frankly and advisedly rejected. When Lord Balfour speaks as he does in the words just quoted, saying: &#x201C;. &#x2026; the constitution now formally declared is absolutely the only constitution which is possible if the British empire is to exist. Then I might say this, that he was told that if he were to have a central authority there would certainly be no agreement between the dominions and England as to our status. We need not argue whether it would not be better to have a central authority, whether some means of coercion in extreme cases ought not to be contrived,&#x201D; he does nothing else than confirm what I have just said and declare that the Imperial Conference rejected all idea of an imperial central or coercive authority&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it was not. That is why I discuss it here, i.e., of an overriding super-state, or super-authority, be it in the form of the British empire or in any other form. This appears perhaps still more clearly when, after having declared that he&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">does not regard the absence of a central authority with the kind of fears that assail those who are brought up upon legal considerations,</block>

<p>he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">&#x2026; I do not, of course, deny the importance of central authorities, when you have them. I will not admit, however, that though we are deprived of that great advantage we must inevitably describe ourselves as having to be content with the second best.</block>

<p>No less clear and explicit on the point are the following words of Mr. Amery, already quoted by me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">. &#x2026; I know, he says, there are some people who see in all this the beginning of disruption of the British empire, who feel that the last vestige of any central authority for co-ordinating the policy of this empire, even in relation to the outside world, is gone.</block>

<p>His answer to these people prophesying the disruption of the empire because the &#x201C;last vestige of any central authority &#x2026; is gone,&#x201D; is also important to note. He tells them that &#x201C;the empire has not been held together for a long time past by any central authority.&#x201D; Now, if, as is confirmed by both these distinguished British statesmen, &#x201C;there is no central authority,&#x201D; and no means of &#x201C;coercion&#x201D; that can be applied to any of the self-governing portions of the empire; while the report of the Imperial Conference itself affirms that individually each of these self-governing portions of the empire is &#x201C;master of its own destiny &#x2026; in no way subordinate to any other portion of the empire in any aspect of its domestic or external affairs,&#x201D; and that &#x201C;it is now and must always remain the sole judge of the nature and extent of its co-operation,&#x201D; within that empire, then I submit, for any man to declare that no dominion, and, let me repeat, not even Great Britain, has the right to declare itself neutral in case of a war in which any other portion of <span class="col_1849-1850" refersTo="page_0991"/>the empire is involved, is simply to ignore both law and fact.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to consider this question now in the light of the existence of the League of Nations and our membership of the League of Nations. It must not be forgotten that the dominions, equally with Great Britain, are, since 1919, members of the League of Nations. The primary object of the League being peace and the maintenance of peace amongst the nations, the question of neutrality must necessarily be a matter of deepest concern to the League. For that reason, membership of the League imposes, under certain circumstances, neutrality as a duty. If, therefore, the view be correct that neither Great Britain nor any dominion has the right to individual neutrality the case of any other member of the commonwealth being at war, then, that duty to remain neutral imposed by the covenant of the League on all members, cannot in such a case hold in respect of Great Britain and the dominions, inter se. Is this so? If it is, then it can only be because in some way or another the covenant of the League provides for a special exemption to Great Britain and the dominions from the duty of remaining neutral in the event of a war in which one or other of them is a belligerent. It cannot, I think, be doubted that the covenant of the League does recognize between Great Britain and the dominions, as members of the League, a relationship inter se different to that commonly obtaining between the various members; and that it was intended that that difference in relationship inter se should also carry with it certain rights and privileges inter se, to which other members would not be entitled. But to claim that amongst those rights and privileges, there is the exemption from the neutrality imposed by the League under certain circumstances upon its members, is a contention which I hold to be as erroneous as it will in the last instance prove to be mischievous, if resorted to in practice. As it is a matter of the utmost importance, hon. members will excuse me if I go into this question here somewhat more in detail. First, then, let us look at the covenant of the League and observe the form which was adopted in the annex to the covenant for notifying the membership of Great Britain and the dominions in the League&#x2014;a form nowhere else adopted for any of the other members. Nothing is more clear than that when that form was adopted it was done with the intention that it should serve as a notification to the other members of the League and to the world at large that Great Britain and the dominions, while individually contracting to become separate state members of the League, did so upon condition that they become members of the League, subject to their being, and to the right of continuing to be, members of the British empire. As far as the other members of the League are concerned, this is a condition precedent not only of which they have been thus notified, but to which they must be presumed to have consented. As a matter of fact, we know it was a question actually discussed and decided upon during the peace conference. Now this condition precedent is of the utmost importance in dealing with the question of the right of neutrality by the dominions, for it is clear that having become members of the League upon condition that their membership of the British empire shall not be interfered with, the League can under no circumstances demand from any one of them the performance of a League duty, the execution of which must entail the severance of its imperial relationship. Hence the League can under no circumstances demand from a dominion that it shall take up arms or commit any other act of hostility against Great Britain or against any other dominion. But does this condition precedent to its becoming a member of the League, also exempt a dominion from observing the duty to remain neutral, or not to take up arms, when, by the covenant, that duty is imposed upon the members of the League in general? On what grounds could this be maintained? As far as Great Britain and the other dominions are concerned, even prior to 1919 a dominion admittedly had the right to declare that it would not participate in a war in which Great Britain was engaged&#x2014;in other words, it had the right over against the other members of the empire, before the League came into existence, to be neutral and still to remain a member of the empire. This right, as already pointed out, is equally admitted today. The neutrality, therefore, of a dominion, it is admitted, has no effect upon its imperial relationship; which means that when the covenant demands neutrality, no dominion can excuse itself on the ground that that relationship will be violated. What other ground of excuse in such a case can there be? To my mind, none! The result is, that not only is a dominion in duty bound to be neutral where by the covenant it is called upon to observe a state of neutrality, but every other nation, be it a member of the League or not, is bound to respect that declaration of neutrality as much as it has to respect that of any other state; and as far as the League is concerned, it will be bound in case of a breach of that neutrality by any other power, to extend its protection to the dominion concerned, just as it would have to do under similar circumstances to any other member. For these reasons, I must once more repeat, that to my mind there can be no reasonable doubt as to the right of any member of the British commonwealth of nations in case of war, to declare its neutrality and to have that neutrality inter-nationally respected by all nations. If the question be asked, why its neutrality must be respected also by nations not members of the League, then my answer is because a dominion&#x2014;even as Great Britain&#x2014;is a sovereign independent state, internationally recognised, and, whether its neutrality is violated by a member or by a hon. member of the League, <span class="col_1851-1852" refersTo="page_0992"/>its claim to protection is the same. Before leaving&#x2014;and I think my right hon. friend will perhaps be glad I am about to leave this subject&#x2014;the subject of neutrality, I wish to point out to honourable members that I am here dealing merely with the right to be neutral by a dominion, and its right to have that neutrality respected, without in any way desiring to discuss that neutrality itself. Perhaps there is no other subject of public international law so clamouring for revision as that of neutrality. A thorough treatment of that subject giving due consideration to dominion state relationships and League membership, seems to me very urgently required at this stage of European history. I may here further remind hon. members that, provided the Council of the League functions effectively, as it is expected to do under the covenant, and as we must presume it will do, the question as to the right of a dominion to remain neutral is one which will only arise in the very improbable case of Great Britain or the dominion at war being declared the aggressor by the council. We have a right to presume that this will never occur, so that the question of the right of dominion neutrality is in reality one of an almost exclusively academic nature. When, furthermore, people maintain as they sometimes do, that, assuming the dominions to have the right to be neutral, any dominion availing itself of that right would thereby immediately cause the disruption of the empire. I look upon it as only another proof of the baneful influences exercised by prejudice upon logic and sound judgment. An analysis of what must take place under the aegis of the League of Nations in case of a dominion declaring its neutrality in a war in which Great Britain as a belligerent is declared by the League to be the aggressor, will at once show that, as far as the empire is concerned, the neutrality, instead of being a disruptive, cannot act otherwise than as a cohesive force.</p>

<p>In conclusion, a few words as to the terms &#x201C;British empire and commonwealth,&#x201D; used by the conference in its report and declaration. Doubt as to the sovereign independence of the individual dominions, and, therefore, also as to their international status as sovereign states, has been expressed by writers and public men, founded upon the use of the phrase &#x201C;within the British empire,&#x201D; and of the designation &#x201C;commonwealth,&#x201D; by the Imperial Conference in its declaration of dominion status. According to the view of these men, those terms indicate that, according to the Imperial Conference, there does exist some state entity or persona, constituted by Great Britain and the dominions under the name of &#x201C;British empire&#x201D; or &#x201C;Commonwealth&#x201D; and which possesses an authority superior to that of any individual constituent element of the commonwealth, not even excluding Great Britain. I do not think that after what I have said as to the rejection by the conference of all idea of any central authority, and the manner in which this is confirmed by both Lord Balfour and Mr. Amery, there is any necessity for further refutation. I wish, therefore, to end by repeating what I said upon my return from the conference: The words &#x201C;British empire&#x201D; and &#x201C;commonwealth&#x201D; when used in the report, have no other object to serve than that of indicating collectively certain territorial or state entities standing in certain relation to one another without the least intention of assigning to these terms any persona or functional existence&#x2014;they are mere names, and nothing more! Before sitting down, may I ask the indulgence of hon. members by quoting once more from the contribution referred to by me by Professor Lawrence Lowell. In the concluding part he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Whether the report of the conference is an authoritative statement of the existing international position of the members of the British commonwealth of nations, or marks a further step in the progress that has long been going on, it is a pronouncement to all men of the condition that must henceforth be accepted by other nations. To us it is a notice that the dominions have come of age, have full rights of citizenship among the states of the world, and are to be treated accordingly.</block>

<p>The House has listened with deep interest to the important speech which the Prime Minister has just made. I feel at a considerable disadvantage in following him, for the reason that we are dealing with a subject of the most far-reaching importance. The Prime Minister has had the opportunity of considering the statement carefully, and no doubt he has considered it from every point of view, whereas I have to reply on the spur of the moment, and I ask hon. members therefore to take the few remarks I am going to make in that sense: that I do not want to be bound down to the actual letter of my statement. I hope they will bear with me and consider my position as a difficult one in speaking on a subject which is certainly one of the most far-reaching importance which can be raised in this House. I for one am glad that some delay has occurred in the raising of this debate. The Imperial Conference sat at the end of 1926, and considerably more than a year has elapsed before this matter comes before us for discussion and for action; but I think the delay has served a useful purpose, because it has served to give people time to think and it has given time for feelings and passions to cool, so that we are to-day in a position in the House to discuss the subject with far more absence of feeling and of friction than we were able to do last year. And I welcome the spirit in which the Prime Minister has made his statement. When I compare it with the violent debate we had last year on this same subject on the question which was raised by the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) and the spirit in which the Prime Minister has spoken to-day, it is clear to me we have gained enormously by some delay in raising this matter in this formal way. It is of the greatest importance to us to discuss this subject <span class="col_1853-1854" refersTo="page_0993"/>calmly and dispassionately, far away from party politics and party considerations. One of the misfortunes of our country has been that in our constitutional questions&#x2014;the question of our relations to our empire, of our empire and our international position, the position has been for years one of acute party politics, and has been in the very forefront of the party struggle here, and the result has been that it has been very difficult for our people to form a clear and impartial judgment on matters of the utmost difficulty. Where even the most competent lawyers would differ it is impossible to expect the public, heated up by passion and driven by party feeling, to consider matters calmly and quietly. I hope in future it will be possible for us&#x2014;let me hope it will be possible in future&#x2014;to eliminate this large and important subject of empire relations from party politics. I think it is an essential condition that we should do so. There may have been reasons in years gone by, when we were conducting a great party struggle in this country, to make use of this great question as a party weapon, but the time for that has passed, and I hope in future we shall discuss this matter away from all party and political considerations, and that we shall discuss it as a matter of profound and vital national interest. In that sense the Prime Minister has spoken, and I hope to speak in that sense, too. The matter is most difficult. The position of the British empire, its nature and its relation inter se and among the states of the world is one of the most puzzling questions to-day in the whole range of international law, and you cannot read a single book by experts on the subject without seeing how deeply they are impressed with this: that we are up against something new, something to which the categories of juridical science do not apply. The League of Nations, having given its deepest consideration to our relations over South-West Africa, came to the conclusion that the relationship under the mandate system does not fit in with the pre-existing juridical ideas, and the use of the word &#x201C;sovereignty&#x201D; in that connection might be misleading unless you keep very close to the facts. That instance is to us a warning, because you have a much larger field and the same situation to-day in the British empire. If we continue to talk in the language of the older diplomacy and law of the new and unique situation which has arisen in the British empire, we are likely to go very far astray, and we must be very careful when we use the ordinary language of the law and constitution in regard to this new fact that has arisen, that we do not merely theorise and talk vaguely in a theoretical sense. That is all the more reason for dealing with this subject very quietly and calmly. It is largely a matter of emphasis. You deal with a very large group of complex questions. It is human nature to deal with one point at a time and to forget the rest. Take this statement which the Prime Minister has quoted from, I admit, a very high authority&#x2014;Professor Lowell of Harvard. Professor Lowell says that after this conference and this formal decision which has been come to by the Imperial Conference, the British empire is little more than a name&#x2014;</p>

<p>I raise the point at once to show how intricate a subject we are dealing with. The fundamental statement made by this report of the Imperial Conference is that these dominions are autonomous communities within the British empire. I mention this, not because I hold the view that the British empire is another central authority, a super-State, but to make hon. members pause and realize that we are dealing with very difficult matters. You have one eminent authority in America declaring that the British empire is a mere name, and one member of the conference giving expression to this view in this House. But here you have this report of the conference itself stating that we are autonomous communities within the British empire, and we are bound to give that subject very calm and careful consideration, because the accent and the emphasis here and there may alter the whole result. I agree that the conference was a most important one. I have never said a word to belittle the importance of that conference. That conference and the work it did was necessary. At one of the imperial conferences held in the later stages of the war, it was decided that after the conclusion of hostilities a constitutional conference would be called which would deal with this question of relationship within the empire. It was only the difficulty of our post-war situation which prevented this subject being dealt with before 1926. I went to the 1921 conference fully prepared to deal with the subject, because I felt the question could be raised, and should be raised, at that conference. But I was up against very grave difficulties. It was quite clear that other members of the conference felt that it would be entirely premature to deal with the question, with the result that nothing was done, but at some time or other, the position was bound to be raised. Now, another conference has sat and dealt with the matter. I am the last one to belittle its importance. I have said before, and I repeat, that I do not think anything new has been created. The situation, in fact, had arisen from the peace treaty and the status of the dominions followed out of our participation in the peace and the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Largely by my hon. friend. There was an element of uncertainty and doubt which had to be removed. Statements were made from time to time by the most authoritative persons, by the Prime Minister of England, by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and others of the highest authority in the British Government, and in the strongest terms about equal nationhood and the status of the dominions. These statements were made by <span class="col_1855-1856" refersTo="page_0994"/>Mr. Bonar Law, Mr. Lloyd George, Lord Milner and one authority after the other. Still something more was wanted, and that something more has been supplied by this conference, which has dealt with the matter in the most formal and authoritative manner and has published a statement which can no longer be controverted by any doubting Thomas. I am one of those who held that the conference was an important one. Although it was nothing new, the declaration itself was a landmark and must have important consequences in the future. At the same time, we must be very careful in dealing with the matter, because it is clear that whilst there was an intention on the part of those statesmen at the conference to clear up certain matters, there was an equally deliberate intention to say nothing about other matters. The result is that great task is left to the future. We are in this position to-day, that if we make inferences from what was clearly laid down, we may find that we are going astray, because the silence of the report in certain respects means that the conference did not want to make up its mind on these matters. While I wholeheartedly approve of the report and welcome the declaration made by the Imperial Conference, I also hold that much has been left in obscurity. At the time the report was published, one of the English papers said that the report was a masterpiece of evasion. I do not go that length, but some of the most profoundly important subjects in our imperial and international relationships have been left obscured and unsettled by this report.</p>

<p>And purposely. We must be careful not to stress one point too much and thereby, perhaps, omit another point. The Prime Minister has said this very striking thing in London, that our independence had been purposely omitted from the report because the use of the word might perhaps be misinterpreted. It is quite clear that the report is carefully framed, and we must not rush to conclusions. But we must also bear in mind that it was framed by wise men who left other matters to be settled in the future. The expression used was &#x201C;autonomous communities within the empire&#x201D; without reference to independence. We find the principle of equality is fully and absolutely recognized, because the word &#x201C;independence&#x201D; is avoided because it might have raised fresh trouble and misunderstanding. That is all I meant, and I am sure that that was what was meant by the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>Let me raise one other point. To outsiders looking at this new declaration, the whole position is extremely puzzling. At the peace conference in Paris, continental diplomats were completely puzzled over the nature of this entity. They were thinking in terms which had no reference to the real character of our empire at all. And it is, indeed, most difficult to understand how a body of absolutely free and equal states can at the same time form a group, a sort of entity, to which you give a name, and which can be a coherent force in the world. It is almost impossible to realize such a position, because we have always been trained to think in terms of sovereignty and to feel that for a group to hold together there must be a common binding sovereignty. The question is, how do they hold together? There is a common kingship which, I think, the Prime Minister did not attach sufficient importance to this afternoon. There is a common single kingship which is naturally a very great bond, but of perhaps even greater force and importance is the invisible bond of ideals.</p>

<p>It is difficult for foreigners, and people not accustomed to the psychology of the empire, to understand a situation like this, but to my mind it is a most powerful thing that holds us together, and the greatest fact which has emerged in the new world. The old world was held together by sovereignty and those laws which could be translated into force. Here is an entirely new condition, no central force, but a psychology which is more powerful, the soul of a group of nations. And I am sure this will prove probably a more potent force in the future in holding this great group together than any central authority or force could possibly have done.</p>

<p>Yes. Very grave difficulties arise with such a group, and when you apply these ideas to our foreign affairs and the conduct of foreign relationship, you see at once the great difficulties which emerge. Before the great war the British empire was of a different nature. There was one dominant State which spoke for the others with authority and could impose its will, in one way or another, upon the members of that group. That was followed by the situation which arose after the Peace Conference, when the British empire transformed itself and became a free group and recognized the equality of its members inter se. The difficulty of conducting international relations and having a foreign policy, under those circumstances, became very great, and a great effort was made at that time to have our foreign <span class="col_1857-1858" refersTo="page_0995"/>policies conducted on the basis of joint conferences and trying to carry all the members of the empire together into common agreement with any concrete policy which was adopted. For years at many conferences we were represented&#x2014;all the dominions were represented&#x2014; and took part in the conferences and the resolutions, and the foreign policy which was ultimately formulated and adopted was by the common consent of all the members. That was the method adopted to deal with foreign relations under the new system of equality which had arisen. There was no super-state. The Prime Minister has sometimes accused me of being in favour of a super-state because I favoured the adoption of a common empire policy which might guide us in the foreign relations of the empire, but I never had such an idea. All through I have been one of the greatest opponents of a central authority. That conference system having passed away you are left with a vacuum, so to speak. And the question is how are you going to keep the States together in future when each one conducts its foreign policy in its own manner without regard to the rest. There were those of us who wanted to pursue the policy of joint conferences at which all dominions would be represented in dealing with the great questions of foreign policy that arose. Locarno made a new departure, and there the British Government, for the first time, deliberately abandoned the effort to carry the dominions with her and to have a joint policy hammered out at conferences for the empire as a whole. It was one of the questions which might have been dealt with at the last imperial conference; how, in future, we are going to keep the empire together when we are independent States, each going its own way. The danger was there, and in the Locarno system the attempt at a united point was abandoned, and nothing has taken its place. It is a matter which will require very careful handling in the future, and will involve perfect goodwill and a spirit of comradeship amongst members of the empire if we are to pull through this difficult stage on questions of foreign policy. It is a most difficult problem. It is clear the conference shied off this problem. It did not grapple with it, but left it alone. Looking at the situation as a whole, to-day, I cannot say that we are free of all risk in the matter of our foreign relations, and we can only rely on the utmost goodwill and spirit of co-operation in the empire to see us through this period before we have hammered out some method which will enable us to follow a common policy for the empire as a whole. The question was left unsettled at the Imperial Conference. In years to come, no doubt, it may have to be dealt with. I, for one, foresee grave dangers ahead. If the Government of Great Britain, from her position and special relations to the Continent of Europe, and her preoccupation with European questions, undertakes more and more liability in regard to the state of affairs in Europe, there is grave danger that the occasion may arise when the dominions will say: &#x201C;Here we cannot follow you at all; you are embarking on a course that may lead to trouble which does not concern us,&#x201D; and thus you may have this question arising about neutrality which has been raised by the Prime Minister this afternoon. It is for us to avoid all occasions when the question of neutrality could possibly be raised. I want our relations to be so close and friendly with Great Britain that we should never raise the question. It should be looked upon as an academic question in the future, but the policy at Locarno may make it a practical question of the utmost difficulty for the dominions situated far away, and not interested in the matters in which the British Government have undertaken special obligations. The conference did not solve it. This applies to the neutrality question raised by the Prime Minister this afternoon. The House has listened with great attention to what he said on this question. We are all impressed that it is a difficult, and let me say, a most intricate, question. In view of the fact that the conference said nothing at all upon it, anything we say in the House is merely a matter of inference, and we should be very careful in dealing with the matter by way of inferences. Even on theoretical grounds I find great difficulty. I am not taking a hard-and-fast line. The subject is so difficult and the possibilities for the future are so far-reaching that no man in a position of responsibility would commit himself outright. Theoretically I say the question is most difficult. You have a single kingship in the empire. It is not a mere personal union, it is a union of a different character. We have a single kingship in the empire. The question of participation in wars by one member or some members of the British empire and abstention and neutrality of the rest raises the very difficult question, how that single kingship can be both at war and at peace at the same time. It is most difficult from the point of view of theory, and when you come to apply it in any individual case, and you say, for instance, that South Africa is going to be neutral in a war in which Great Britain is involved, you are faced with a very baffling question indeed, and one that is difficult to answer. I mean the question whether South Africa can remain under that single and common kingship, and at the same time be neutral when Great Britain is at war. I mention these considerations not because I am making a pronouncement on the subject. I am avoiding anything in the nature of a pronouncement. I am only warning hon. members that we are dealing with a subject which, both theoretically and practically, is most difficult, most important, and I do not think we ought to dogmatize. I think the Prime Minister was right when he said that the subject was largely academic, and, that being so, do not let us discuss it here by way of inference and deduction from the principles that were laid down at the conference.</p>

<p>I am only warning the Prime Minister and the House not to let us get off the rails on this point. Keep it in reserve. The conference very wisely kept it in reserve, probably for future consideration. It is one of those points arising out of our unique relationship which has not been settled for the present, and let us look upon it in that light. Let us adopt a position of reserve and be thankful for what has been done, but recognize also that a great deal has been left undone, that great deal remains obscure, and for the present, at any rate, let us not commit ourselves on these matters. I do not see the Minister of Justice here, but I should like to have asked him the question as a matter of law, because there are big principles of law involved, but he is not here, and I will not push the question further. The Prime Minister does not ask us to-day to make a pronouncement on the question of neutrality. If I thought that this resolution which is before the House bound me on a question like that, or on a number of other questions, which I could mention, and which to me are of the deepest importance, I would hesitate to vote for this motion, but the motion before the House is not in that dangerous form. The motion is simply to approve of resolutions which were actually taken, and which deal with our status. To the resolution in that form we can all agree on all sides of the House. Whatever view we may hold on details, whatever view we may hold on some of these highly contentious matters to which the Prime Minister has referred, and others which could be mentioned, we are agreed that the work that was done was good work, it was in the interests of South Africa, it is a work which stabilizes the work of the past, and for that reason I think we should have no hesitation whatever in agreeing to that. I do not want to push the matter further. I think I have said enough at this stage, but the Prime Minister will understand that this matter is a very important one, and the statement which he has made is a considered and very important statement to which hon. members in this House who want to take part in this debate would wish to give due consideration before they pursue the discussion. I think it would be right, under the circumstances, before we go further, that the debate should be adjourned so as to give hon. members a chance of further consideration.

There was an accumulated period of leave which the general manager could not legally claim. I want to make clear that he was not entitled to it. He could only claim the usual period of leave. Quite apart from that, however, we thought the amount we granted as a gratuity to Sir William Hoy should be fairly considerable, so that some indication might be given as to the real value we attached to his eminent services, which <span class="col_1869-1870" refersTo="page_1001"/>were of the greatest value to the country for a very long time.</p>

<p>With regard to the American engines, they were ordered about three years ago, and have been in the service for about two years. The castings of some of these engines cracked. That I am informed by the technical officers, is not a very serious matter, from the constructional point of view. It appears that the castings were not strong enough to stand the pressure and the work, but I may say that the company which supplied these engines replaced those castings at their own expense</p>

<p>I think there were 25&#x2014;I am speaking from memory&#x2014; and a large number are at work with the original castings. We are paying close attention to them to see whether any cracks develop in the castings. We have a number of castings in hand, so that if any castings of the engines crack, they can easily be replaced. Otherwise the engines are giving satisfactory service, and we have no reason to complain. As to the two experimental German engines, we asked for tenders and received a large number from different firms, and we accepted the tender of the firm of Henschel or Maffei at Munich. I am glad to say they are giving extremely good service, and we are using them in the haulage of coal between Johannesburg and Witbank&#x2014;the haulage of 1,800 tons, which is very considerable on a light line such as ours. I do not want to commit the administration and say we should order more of these engines, because we want very strong and well-conditioned lines upon which to run engines of the weight of these two. We are watching these two engines closely, and probably may, later on, decide to order more of this special type. They are purely experimental; and a word of credit is due to the mechanical department for the way in which they were designed.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a curious thing that the engines ordered from America during the war time developed defects&#x2014;I do not say in the same way as the engines to which I just now referred. I was so impressed with this that I considered I would never order American engines again. Something else may occur later on with these other engines. I have no faith in American engines, and I would never sanction any order, after our experience with them during the war time.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) is perfectly right. The engines which were delivered to us by that particular company during the war were certainly not good. The material was bad&#x2014;I am informed it was actually defective. Undoubtedly, however, the company dealt with the Administration fairly handsomely. I do not think it is quite fair to the company to refer to this matter now. In any case, I can say that the engines which have been delivered during the last few years are satisfactory; the workmanship and material are good, and we have no reason to complain except in regard to the castings. As to the point raised by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Sir William Macintosh) there has been an increase of personnel. We have engaged extra men in the workshops in order to deal with the traffic. We went so far as to authorize night shifts. Next year there will be a better spreadover, and I hope it will not be necessary to resort to night work.</p>

<p>I gather from a report which appeared in the &#x201C;Rand Daily Mail&#x201D; that a large order for sleepers and rails was placed with the European Steel Railway Makers&#x2019; Association, which in turn, placed the contract at a lower price with some German manufacturers. If the association can do this, why were the people who really executed the work at a lower figure than that paid by the Administration not given an opportunity of tendering direct? This would have saved the Union the profit which accrued to the Steel Association. I look upon this as a very unbusinesslike method of carrying on the business of the railway.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the combination to which the hon. member refers does exist. Following the practice which obtained during my predecessor&#x2019;s period of office, we never enter the market by asking for public tenders, but we tell the High Commissioner what our requirements are, and ask him to obtain informal tenders. All the foremost British, American and Continental makers are given an opportunity of tendering. After examination by our engineer, the High Commissioner decides what is the best article, and after communication <span class="col_1871-1872" refersTo="page_1002"/>with the Administration here the order is placed.

<p>I am indebted to the Minister for his explanation, but the position seems to be unsatisfactory. Why cannot we ask for tenders throughout the world, and thus obtain the most favourable terms? Under the present arrangements the combination tenders at a certain price, and then sub-let the contract to someone else at a lower figure. I think this is a most unbusinesslike procedure, and it reminds me very much of the sleeper contract which did not come off. I have the greatest possible respect for lawyers and farmers, but not as men of business.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>For reasons I have already given I would have preferred not to go more closely into the matter. The hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Nathan) talks about the business capacity of farmers and lawyers. I am following the practice of my predecessor in office, who is an eminent business man. If you ask for tenders publicly the suppliers, so I am informed, all tender at the same price, but if you ask for informal tenders the members of the combination are allowed to tender freely. I hope the hon. member is satisfied that we are conducting our business on business principles. With regard to the very important question raised by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), this question of bonus earnings in the workshops has occupied the attention of the Administration for some considerable time. We have felt that the conditions in our workshops, satisfactory as they are, are capable of improvement. After going into the matter very closely and getting the full returns, the Administration has come to the conclusion that it is necessary for us, with our large workshops spread over the whole of the Union, to give our chief mechanical engineer greater assistance in regard to the control of our workshops. It will be realized that he has to do all the administrative work, the designing of engines and rolling stock, and with that he has full control over the workshops, and it was felt it was necessary we should give him assistance. Under the scheme I communicated to the House a few weeks ago, we have appointed an assistant chief mechanical engineer in the person of Mr. Watson, who is, at the present time, mechanical engineer at Durban. Naturally he will work under the chief mechanical engineer, but with the special instruction that he should give his attention more particularly to control and organization of the workshops. I am hopeful, as the result of the appointment of what we consider to be one of our best mechanical engineers, that we shall be able to have our workshops reorganized by the introduction of new machinery, better methods and more modern organizing methods generally, with the result of the placing our workshops in a better position for economic production. What the hon. member has intimated has been appreciated by me, and after close scrutiny of the facts we have, not in any sense of criticism of the mechanical engineer, but in the sense of giving him assistance in regard to the workshops, made this new appointment, and I hope we shall be able to show better results in the future.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the Minister. He says nothing, for example, as to why the expenses are going up at so great a rate. I would like to trace, in round figures, some of the enormous increases. The first year in which the Minister was in office the increased earnings were over &#x00A3;2,800,000, and in the same period the increased expenditure was also over &#x00A3;2,800,000. That was only the first year. After making provision for betterment and contributions towards the deficiency in the Pension and Superannuation Funds, and the reduction of interest earning capital, we find the increase of revenue was .15 per cent., and the increase of expenditure was 4.08 per cent. That I thought would have led the Minister to give some explanation. Take the next year. We find, including the additional appropriation, the expenditure was &#x00A3;28,170,000, while the earnings were &#x00A3;28,012,000 odd. The excess expenditure in that year over the earnings was &#x00A3;158,000. In other words, here again the earnings increased by .076 per cent., whereas the expenses increased by no less than 3.77 per cent. Now take the present estimates. The estimated expenditure for the coming year is &#x00A3;29,414,000, an increase of &#x00A3;685,000 on the original estimate, or an increase of &#x00A3;50,000 on the amended estimates. The estimated income for the year is not given, so I do not know what the Minister&#x2019;s policy is. Now if we take open mileage, which the Minister is always referring to when making comparisons, the mileage is now 12,412, so that, in the last year, 145 miles of railways have been added to the Union system. Next year it is anticipated it will be 12,550. When he started in 1924, it was 11,113 miles, and he then had 86,181 persons employed, and the expenses were &#x00A3;22,979,000, and the income was &#x00A3;24,429,000, and the surplus was &#x00A3;1,450,000. In other words, during the last Government, the expense of running the railways was far below the income, and the profit in that year was &#x00A3;1,400,000. Now the Minister claims that his increased expenditure is due to increase in train mileage. The mileage has only increased by 1,400, whereas the increased personnel is over 500.</p>

The expenses increased by &#x00A3;6,435,000, whereas the income during the same period increased only by &#x00A3;5,000,000, or in other words there was a turnover from the time when the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) was Minister from a profit of &#x00A3;1,400,000 to a loss under the present Minister of &#x00A3;1,500,000.</p>

<p>Not during the whole period of your office. The yearly expenditure now has gone up to &#x00A3;29,500,000, and yet the Minister brings in a part appropriation now asking for &#x00A3;9,000,000, and does not say a word about it. Take salaries and wages, they have gone up during the Minister&#x2019;s term of office by no less than &#x00A3;2,800,000. The Administration pays &#x00A3;5,000,000 odd per annum as interest on the railways alone, and &#x00A3;547,000 odd on the harbours, or a total of &#x00A3;5,600,000 odd. In pensions we have &#x00A3;537,000 on railways alone, and &#x00A3;24,000 on harbours. That is besides &#x00A3;287,000 necessary to be paid to restore the fund. Total, &#x00A3;561,900. The total of personnel is 86,636, of whom 82,381 odd are on the railways. In March, 1924, the total was 86,181, of whom 39,024 were Europeans and 47,000 odd others. In the estimates we have no information at present as to the number of Europeans and the number of non-Europeans, but I find that the Auditor-General in his report gives the number at 31st March, 1927, as 54,579 Europeans and 40,177 others, or a total of 94,756. In the previous year there were 97,154, so that there was a reduction apparently of 4,728 non-whites and an increase of 2,130 whites. The position on the 31st March, 1928, is not yet known. The high-water-mark <span class="col_1875-1876" refersTo="page_1004"/>was reached in 1925-&#x2019;26. In other words, in three years from March, 1924, the Europeans increased by 15,500, and the others decreased by 7,000, and, judging from the estimates, now there is to be a very large reduction in non-Europeans, very much larger than during the last three years, and, as far as one can estimate from the figures given now, the Europeans will be 55,000, and non-Europeans 31,000. The salaries for these 86,000 employees amount to &#x00A3;14,863,000, or nearly half the total expense of running the railways. In 1926-&#x2019;27 it was 49.57 per cent., whereas previous to the present Government coming in the ratio of wages and salaries to the total expenditure was 40.27 per cent. Several suggestions have been made from time to time as to how one should be able to judge the working of the railways, whether we are going up too fast in our expenditure, and whether we are getting too little in the way of returns. I find if we take the operating ratio, according to the Auditor-General, our percentage earnings are not in proportion to the percentage expenditure, and he gives some very interesting figures. He shows that since the war a country like Germany which, it will be admitted, suffered very severely, was able to bring down its operating expenditure by 5.5 per cent., Canada brought hers down by 9 per cent., the United States on two railways brought down the operating expenses by 5 per cent. on the South Pacific and by 10 per cent. on the Pennsylvania railway. South Africa, on the other hand, has risen by close on 5 per cent. since the war, and to-day is only 2 per cent. below the high-water-mark of 1922. The ratio of our railways is higher by 10 per cent. than the next highest in Africa, and it is higher by 8 per cent. than in South America, and 2.5 per cent. than in Australia. I want to put it to the Minister that under these circumstances there is very little hope of ever reducing our rates and fares in this country. The Minister formerly always pointed to train and engine mileage and said, &#x201C;Look at the increase there, and how can you complain that our working expenses are going up?&#x201D; That was the Minister&#x2019;s argument, but I would like to remind him of what his own Railway Board have stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Any comparisons based upon train and engine mileage units ignore certain important factors which are of a varying nature, as, for example, loads of trains, and, consequently, any comparisons or deductions drawn are liable to be misleading.</block>

<p>We have often pressed on the Minister that the only true basis is ton mileage. His own board is apparently against him on that, and, strangely enough, on the last debate on the additional appropriation, the Minister&#x2014;I do not know whether he meant to do it&#x2014;certainly changed his argument. The old argument has been dropped, and the Minister now blames the motor competition. But supposing it is the motor competition, and let me remind the Minister of his remark, &#x201C;We will have to take very serious action. See what England is doing.&#x201D; He did not tell us what England is doing, but I looked it up and I see from an article in the &#x201C;Nineteenth Century&#x201D; that England has determined to reduce rates so as to meet the motor competition. If the Minister will read this article I have here, he will find a lot of information which may induce him to change certainly part of his policy. There are one or two points I would like to read to the Minister. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">It is obvious, therefore, that the more traffic sent by rail, the greater the prospects of reduced rates; in fact, this is the sole manner in which the reduction of rates and fares can be ensured. The railways are required to carry out their obligations to the public in the new order of things. The ordinary passenger, the season ticket holder and the excursionist, no less than the trader, will be helping towards lower rates and fares. The greater the volume of traffic, the better for the users of the railway.</block>

<p>The Minister will remember that during the war the rates in England were not increased in any way. After the war, when the railway companies took over the railways again from the Government, they found it was impossible to run them except by a huge increase of rates and fares. The highest increase was 115 per cent., not as high as the majority of items in our tariff. To bring this down again, they had to get the consent of the Government. A commission was appointed, and the commission agreed on terms which enabled the Government to introduce a Bill and make it legal to increase rates and fares and to meet the employees in certain circumstances. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">In numerous instances the present rates will be reduced. For some traffic the scale will have to be increased, but not by more than 10 per cent. The goods traffic will undergo some striking changes &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is here I wish to call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the method they have here. I showed last year that long-distance traffic does not really benefit in this country, and I gave the Minister figures. The system they have there is that for the first 20 miles they charge 3.75d. per ton, for the next 30 miles 2.65d. per ton, for the next 50 miles 2.2d. per ton, and for the remaining distance 1.6d. per ton. That is, the longer the distance of carriage, the less proportionately the rate, and I think it is very necessary, more particularly in a country like this with its long distances, than even in England.</p>

<p>When I quoted to the Minister his own tariff book, he did not correct me. I will give him the figures again if he likes. With regard to the &#x2019;bus competition, when the competition became so very acute, the railway companies went to the Government and said: &#x201C;We cannot do anything unless we are able to reduce rates.&#x201D; The Government, through the commission, agreed to reduce the rates, and they found that was the only way to meet the &#x2019;bus competition.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>&#x2020;Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>My point is, on one occasion the Minister uses one argument of train mileage and in another case he uses &#x2019;bus competition. And yet, since 1925, how much reduction has he given in rates? Bus competition has only commenced since then, so if he has reduced the rates to meet that competition, he has done something which he has not told us of. Then I want to refer to maintenance of rolling stock. If we look at the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, page 169, we find there that maintenance of rolling stock has increased by a sum of &#x00A3;174,000, and running repairs has increased by &#x00A3;41,265, and in connection with this, let us turn to page 164, and we find there something to which the Auditor-General draws special attention, a form of certificate by the chief civil engineer unlike any certificate given by the chief civil engineer before. Instead of giving it to say the permanent way is in good working condition, he qualifies it. He says that on open lines, owing to increased traffic, increased speed, heavier axle loads and a higher standard of maintenance, more expensive renewals will be necessary. If we turn to page 168, we find there that, exclusive of the cost of labour, the expenditure on the permanent way was &#x00A3;1,969,000 as compared with &#x00A3;1,964,000. The Auditor-General draws the conclusion from this that the certificate, not being in unqualified terms as heretofore, is something which requires very careful attention, and I think the Minister should give it particular attention in view of the many railway accidents we are, having. I do not suggest this state of affairs is due to the qualified nature of the certificate, but if there is any reason for qualifying the certificate, it is a serious matter which requires attention.</p>

If the Minister will turn to page 89, we find that while the Minister himself is using the ordinary conveyance to and from his office, members of the Railway Board have used the Administration&#x2019;s motor-cars, and the Auditor-General says&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the Minister is breaking that rule, I am sorry. Departmental heads at Johannesburg, and members of the Railway Board do not observe that rule. The Auditor-General says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">I therefore deem it my duty to draw the attention of Parliament to this lapse.</block>

<p>If we look at the list of motor-cars we find that they are very large. There are eight&#x2014; Railway Board, 2; general manager, 1; chief accountant, 1; assistant general managers, 5. That was at 31st March, 1926. At 31st March, 1927, it was 9, and the total was 53 as against 62 in 1926, so it has come down. Why should members of the Railway Board have this privilege? With regard to the storage of petrol at the docks, I know nothing about the matter personally, but I am told it is dangerous to allow that large amount of petrol in bulk to be stored there. I am told that in London they are stopping the erection of these big tanks, until they have had a full enquiry. It is claimed, rightly or wrongly, that if something went wrong the Government would be held responsible for the effects of any explosion. As these tanks are in the centre of the town, the Minister should tell us whether he has had any enquiry made, or whether he has had any reports from his experts, whether there has been an increase of insurance of Government and private property in the vicinity, and what the contracts are with the oil companies. If the Minister will allow me, I will go back to a matter discussed last year, when the contract with regard to sleepers from the Argentine was referred to. Most hon. members dealt with the matter very fully, and we understood the Minister had dealt very fully with it, hut he left out a very important item, and that is that the Railway Board allowed the contractor to be freed from paying a fairly large sum which he had to pay under the contract.</p>

<p>The Minister need not be so very anxious&#x2014;I am going to read it. The Minister ought to have told us about that amount last year. The Auditor-General&#x2019;s report states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The agreement provided, inter alia, that the contractor (Dr. Visser) was to sell a minimum of one million Quebracho Colorado sleepers to the Administration at 6s. 8&#x00BD;d. f.o.b. Buenos Aires, or 8s. 10d. in South Africa; the ships going to fetch the sleepers to carry cargoes of South African coal to South America. The contractor had to furnish an approved guarantee to the extent of 10 per cent. of the total yearly value of the contract. Lastly, the contractor could cancel the contract without penalty by so notifying the Administration in writing within four months from the signing of the contract. The annual value of the contract was approximately &#x00A3;335,000, and the security approximately &#x00A3;33,500. The contract was signed on the 8th-9th July, 1926. The guarantee or suretyship was not given, nor was any letter received by the Administration within four months to escape penalties under the contract.</block>

<p>There was not a word of protest by Dr. Visser when one man was sent in place of another to the Argentine. Neither of them, however, could have done anything at all, because there were no sleepers to inspect. An individual was sent across and he had to be paid by the Administration, because the contractors said that he was not the individual it was originally intended to send. Is that a defence? This cost the Administration &#x00A3;397 2s. 11d., and not a single sleeper was purchased. We are entitled to have some better explanation for foregoing a claim like that than the explanation the Minister has attempted to give.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAM MACINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say something about a very important document the Minister has laid on the Table regarding the re-organization of the railways and harbours services. It has been referred to in some of the papers as &#x201C;centralization,&#x201D; but I do not look upon it as centralization at all. I approve of re-organization, but centralization often means congestion. The Minister is really appointing at headquarters assistant general managers who shall be so in fact and not merely in name. In the past, the assistant general managers have not been so at all, because from the very fact of their being at different points of the system and concerned only with different sections of the system, they could not really be assistant general managers. I take it that assistant general managers are now to be assistants to the general manager in general management. There are one or two points in connection with the matter to which I desire to draw attention. There are to be at headquarters two assistant general managers; one will look after technical matters and the other commercial matters, controlling trains and rolling stock. The success of this change depends entirely on the use made of these two gentlemen. It had become evident with the growth of the railway system that the concentration of all power in the hands of one man only was not a good system. But the point which rather concerns me is that the Minister referring to the appointment of these two assistant general managers defines their functions, and says they will function for and on behalf of the general manager in their respective spheres. If that is to be <span class="col_1881-1882" refersTo="page_1007"/>taken literally, a great deal of good that we anticipate from the change will not materialize. These gentlemen should be in touch with everything that is going on, not only in their respective spheres, for if they are to be cognizant only of what is happening in their respective spheres they will be assistants to the general manager, but they will not he assistant general managers. That will not be sharing in the general management, and you will get the old difficulty that men are not being trained who will know the working of the department outside the respective spheres of their own departments. It will be, of course, the correct thing that their chief work will be in their respective spheres, but unless there is a constant meeting together between these men and the general manager, we shall not get the full benefit of the change it is proposed to make. To get the full benefit these two assistant general managers should be interchangeable and capable of doing one anothers duties, because it is only in that way either of them would be trained to be capable some day of being general manager when a general manager is required, and I take it that is the object of having men properly trained. I am more than pleased a change of this sort has been made, because I want to give the Minister, from my own experience, and the experience of my constituency, the sort of thing that was able to happen under the system which has now been changed. I want to refer to the question of some reclamation work to be done at Algoa Bay. It was looked upon as very important work. The Minister, speaking in this House on the 9th of June last, said: [Extract read.] The Minister followed that up by taking the vote in the month of June for &#x00A3;25,000 to start this work. As the House will see, the Minister has referred to it as a very serious position at Port Elizabeth. The authority for that work to be commenced was passed out in the month of December, this very serious work which it was very necessary should be done to prevent congestion at Algoa Bay. In the last week of February, one week ago, nothing had been done in connection with this very serious work except to order some timber from the Argentine with which to make a bridge. Naturally the people at Port Elizabeth got restive over this matter, and it got so far that the harbour advisory board, which gives it service free, tendered its resignation because it could not get anything done. It was only then anything was done in the matter. When this pressure was brought to bear the chief engineer went down and it was found the work could be done. I bring this matter forward to show how under the old system it was possible for works authorized by Parliament and for which money had been voted, and authority given, still not to be carried out. Unless there is co-operation in these two different departments the same sort of thing will go on. When complaints were made the Minister answered that he was not responsible for what his executive officers did, he was only responsible for policy.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAM MACINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>I don&#x2019;t mean this to be an attack upon the Minister, but only to show what was possible in the past and what I don&#x2019;t want to think will be possible in the future. When the general manager was referred to he said he had given authority for the work and the money had been provided. What more could he do? You get Parliament authorizing work, money is voted for the work, and if it is not done it shows there is some congestion in the department which should be relieved and, I am hoping that this new way of dealing with the carrying on of the railway work will make it impossible that there will be any such congestion in the future. That is one of the reasons I welcome this change, believing that owing to the concentration in one hand of the work, there has been congestion in more departments than one, and this will help to ease the position and will lead to the better carrying on of the work. I would like to give an illustration of what might happen by keeping these departments watertight, an illustration of something that has happened in Port Elizabeth. With the experience gained at Port Elizabeth in connection with the work going on at a snail&#x2019;s pace in building a sheltering wall a sandbank has accumulated, making it more difficult to do the work unless the sand is removed by dredger. A dredger was sent from Durban after no small interval of time, and when it came instruction had been given from one department that it was only to be used on one set of work and not on any other. Therefore if it cannot work every day except on the one set of work, it could not be used for reclaiming the foreshore. On no account was it to be used by the other department. That is the kind of thing which can go on unless there is co-operation between these departments. There ought to be regular meetings between these two gentlemen and the general manager, and each should be cognisant of <span class="col_1883-1884" refersTo="page_1008"/>what is going on. I hope we shall get what we hope for from this new change.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VISSER</person>:</from>

<p>I was not here at the beginning when the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj G. B. van Zyl) raised the question about the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, and I did not anticipate that it would be raised here at this stage either, because it is a matter which will come before the Select Committee on Railways and I understood that it would be elucidated. I am getting pretty tired of these underhand attacks which are being made on me here by hon. members on the opposite side, very scurrilous attacks to say the least of it. They are unfounded and not according to the facts. I do not want to say much about the matter now. The time has not come for me to do so this afternoon. I have purposely kept quiet because the time when this is due to be said is in the Select Committee on Railways. When I came down here for the opening of this part of the session on January 26th, I saw the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report. The Auditor-General mentioned about my contract and certain notices that I had not given to the Administration, and that a favour was shown me by not asking for any fine because I did not carry out the contract. That contract was always considered a preliminary or tentative contract, and when I came here I went and saw the Administration and asked them whether they got the letter which I wrote to them on board ship on my way from South America. It happened at that time that the Auditor-General came to the office. I asked the Auditor-General about the matter and said &#x201C;How can you make a statement like this in your report about my not having told the Railway Board about the impossibility of carrying out the contract?&#x201D; He said he had never seen any papers. I asked the secretary to find out the facts and give them to Mr. Roos, and the secretary of the board on the 27th January wrote this letter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">With reference to your call at this office this morning, I beg to confirm my statement to you that you addressed a letter to the chairman and members of the Railway Board, dated October 17th, 1926 (1927?) written on board ship, wherein you outlined the position which has arisen in connection with the supply of Quebracho sleepers.</block>

<p>I said to Mr. Roos, &#x201C;What about the position now?&#x201D; He agreed that the whole question should be gone into in select committee. I shall see that it is gone into. I shall take steps to do that and give evidence before the select committee to controvert the mean and insinuating remarks that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) made last year. With regard to Mr. Heberden&#x2019;s expenses, &#x00A3;397, I never contracted to pay Mr. Heberden&#x2019;s expenses. The position was that I arranged with Sir William Hoy, in case the contract could be carried out and to ensure that no sleepers would be refused when they came to South Africa, to have one of the officers of his department who was an expert on sleepers, and I asked that if I succeeded in my contract, this man should be seconded and I would pay his expenses over in South America. The name of that gentleman was Mr. Beacom. He came and saw me and I arranged that in case I succeeded in South America I would pay his expenses. I had nothing to do with Mr. Heberden, who happened to be in South America at the time. I also saw the Administration and the general manager when I got here, and they wrote me this letter, which I think the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) will be surprised to hear&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">With reference to your call at my office on Saturday morning relative to the remarks contained in pages 65 and 66 of the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report in connection with your contract with the Administration, the following is a copy of the letter in the papers, dated April, 1927. Addressed by the general manager to the assistant general manager in Johannesburg: With reference to your letter of the 13th instant, under the circumstances described by you, and particularly in the first paragraph of your letter, I agree that Dr. Visser is not liable for the expenses connected with Mr. Hammerton&#x2019;s visit to Buenos Aires, and the account to Dr. Visser should therefore be withdrawn.</block>

<p>This was signed by the general manager of railways, Mr. J. R. More. This thing is going to be investigated by the Select Committee on Railways, and I am going to make a statement there which will be published to the world. When I entered into this arrangement with the Government. I told the Minister and the railway board, &#x201C;I am a public man, and I do not want to make a sixpence out of my Government and my country.&#x201D; I would not have made a sixpence out of the sleepers. For various reasons, and because of various difficulties, the Railway Board decided to have a contract with me personally, and I could make a contract on the other side. If I had succeeded in getting the contract for the sleepers this Government would have saved &#x00A3;100,000 a year on railway sleepers.</p>

<p>Because I preferred, at that time, to be quite satisfied with the explanation of the Minister of Railways and Harbours, but I do not stand behind the doors and I do not look for anyone else behind doors.

The time is arriving when I shall expose the hollowness and hypocrisy of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell). There are members of this House who cannot realize and appreciate that a South African may want to do some service to his own country, and I wanted to do a service to my country. It is true I would have made a profit out of the coal, but the only conditions I would have made with the Government would have been &#x201C;If you can get the sleepers from South America you must allow the same <span class="col_1885-1886" refersTo="page_1009"/>ships to take the coal from Natal.&#x201D; I wanted to do Natal a service, and you would think I was a pickpocket from the way they attacked me.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BATES</person>:</from>

<p>I am very glad that Sir William Hoy changed his mind as to the position of the hon. member. At certain times a good deal of criticism is levelled at the management of the railways, and whilst no doubt there is a good deal of room for improvement, I think on the whole we have every reason to be satisfied with and proud of our railways. The South African Railways are a very huge undertaking, and we must remember this branch of our public service is collecting, on the average, over two millions sterling every month. I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the appointment of Mr. J. R. More as general manager. Mr. More, I am sure, will prove a very worthy successor to Sir William Hoy. The fact that he is a South African, and that he has been trained in South Africa, makes the appointment all the more pleasing. I hope this is the beginning of a new era, and that, before long, all these senior appointments in the service will be held by South Africans. There is no doubt that Sir William Hoy did wonderful work in bringing our railways to their present state of perfection, but I think the time has arrived for us to review the position very carefully, to take stock and to hasten slowly. In the past it would almost seem that all our energies and ambitions were centred on being thought the best railways of the world, and not what was best for South Africa. We introduced policies before the country had time to realize whether they were in the true interests of South Africa. A good deal of time and money were spent in journalism and advertisements, and at one time it looked as if the railway department dictated the financial policy of the Government. While we are all proud of the elevator system, it has shown a loss of &#x00A3;167,000 for the last three years, and it is very debatable whether we should encourage our farmers to impoverish South Africa for the benefit of other countries.</p>

<p>Take our electrification. It is a very fine scheme, and said to be a credit to South Africa, but is it going to prove an economic success? Would not Natal and the country be better served by a double line under steam? The graving dock at Durban is a very fine piece of work, and we pride ourselves on having one of the largest graving docks in the world, but if that money had been spent in expediting the harbour works at Algoa Bay, it would have served a far more useful and lucrative purpose. Before long we shall have to face very serious competition from the motor lorry, and it is up to the Minister to meet this emergency in no uncertain manner. In this connection I must say that the speech of the Minister at Humansdorp in this direction was not very reassuring. Speaking at Humansdorp on Saturday, the 21st of January, the Minister of Railways, Mr. C. W. Malan, proceeded to utter a warning to the farmers of the district against supporting a private motor lorry service that had been instituted between Port Elizabeth and Humansdorp in competition with the State railways. If they supported the lorry by giving their business to these competitors of the railway, said Mr. Malan, the interests of the public would ultimately suffer. The Administration was not averse to the institution of motor services where they would bring increased traffic to the railways, and had themselves instituted a large number of services all over the country, but where such services came into competition with the railways, it was an entirely different matter. The Railway Administration, said Mr. Malan, had in contemplation the extension of the line from Avontuur to Camfer, and also the broadening of the gauge, but if traffic was lost now it would be impossible to give any favourable consideration to these proposals. To me this seems a very weak-kneed policy, in fact a policy of despair, for in effect the Minister asked the people to put up with high rates and inconveniences of the railways for the sake of benefits to come. This might be the right policy in Humansdorp, seeing it is a constituency represented by the Minister, especially when we take into consideration the forthcoming general election; but is it the policy any business man would adopt to meet competition? Let us rather prove to the farmers by low rates, prompt delivery and efficiency that the railways can and will handle their produce more economically and expeditiously than a private firm.</p>

<p>If the Minister wishes to play into the hands of the motor lorry owners, let him raise the rates. Short-distance traffic is being filched from the railways by motor traffic, and it is entirely the fault of the railways. The latest information is that a road motor service running three times weekly has been established between Port Elizabeth and Graaff-Reinet. It is more speedy than the railway, and it seems that something must be wrong when motor lorries can compete with a train over a distance of 187 miles, and that over some of the worst roads in South Africa. There is no doubt that the Railway Department is largely to blame for this competition, and if the department wishes to retain the confidence of the public it must abandon its present methods and endeavour to meet the wishes of its customers. In the past, owing to the monopoly, the users of the railway have not been fairly treated. It has been customary for the Administration to lecture farmers, merchants and others when they approach it for better facilities, but the present Minister is going one better by telling industrialists what they must do if they wish to carry on their industries successfully. The time has arrived when the Railway Department must do its best to please its customers. Recently I approached the Minister on behalf of one of the oldest industries in South Africa, and asked if something could not be done to assist it by the reduction of railway rates.</p>

<block name="#quote">I am directed by the Minister of Railways and Harbours to inform you that the question of granting a reduction in the rate on wool sent to washeries for scouring has been fully gone into on several previous occasions, and the Administration has always failed to find that the rate charged for the carriage of wool to the washeries is a really important factor; and the difficulties now being experienced by the industry could not correctly be attributed to railway rates on wool. The result of the inquiries made recently at Port Elizabeth support this view</block>

<block name="#quote">The Minister&#x2019;s investigations further disclose that A&#x2019;s washery in Port Elizabeth, which is said to be the most up-to-date washery in the Union, was, according to recent inquiries, only washing on 8 or 9 days in the month. Supplies of grease wool for scouring are obtained by A&#x2019;s washery in Port Elizabeth, and no railage is incurred apart from the ordinary railage charges from the up-country producing centres to Port Elizabeth, where the wool is put on the sales. Despite the fact, however, that the Port Elizabeth wool washery, by reason of being situated in the middle of the town, escapes the incidence of the rates on wool to and from the washery which is incurred by inland washeries, the plant had only sufficient work to keep it going 8 or 9 days during the month, and obviously the reason must be looked for outside railway rates.</block>

<block name="#quote">It is understood that there is little demand on the part of overseas buyers for South African scoured wool, who prefer to buy the wool in the grease, and have the scouring done overseas, where there is a demand for the wool fat recovered in the process of scouring. In South Africa the by-products are mostly run to waste. It is probable that the difficulties now being experienced by South African washeries in obtaining sufficient business to keep the washeries fully employed are due more to the limited demand oversea for scoured South African wool than to the expense incurred in scouring the wool. After careful consideration, the Minister regrets his inability to agree to a special rate on wool consigned to washeries for scouring.</block>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BATES</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended at 6 o&#x2019;clock I had just finished reading a letter which I had received from the Minister in regard to a representation I made to him about a reduction of the railway rates on wool consigned to washeries, for scouring purposes. I duly placed that letter before the industry concerned, and the reply I received is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">We are in receipt of the communication addressed to you by the office of the Minister of Railways and Harbours, and we wish to thank you for your kind efforts on behalf of this industry, and only regret that same have not been successfully received.</block>

<p>I want the Minister to give careful attention to the next paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The statement made by the department concerned appears to us entirely consistent with most of our dealings with the railway. We cannot remember ever having obtained any satisfaction from the railways, although we have been in constant contact with them for a considerable number of years. The attitude generally of the railway administration causes a great deal of inconvenience and annoyance not only to ourselves, but to our clients as well, and we are sure that a certain amount of business is lost to us and the railway on account of this unsatisfactory state of affairs. With regard to the reasons given for not complying with our request, we are afraid the administration have entirely missed the point. &#x2026; The railway administration also state they found the rate charged on wool is not important. This statement is not correct, as the present high rates tend to inflate the cost of production &#x2026; We want to contradict the statement that there is little demand for South African scoured wool, and we might mention that at the moment the demand is rather keen. Hitherto we have always loyally supported the railways, as, in our opinion, they are the legitimate carriers of goods, but now, in view of the reception of our representations we are forced to consider a more economical mode of transport. Recently we were quoted transport by a private concern at 6d. per 100 pounds on goods to Port Elizabeth. By using this a saving of over &#x00A3;600 per annum on our scoured products alone can be effected. Further, only recently one of our biggest clients approached us, relative to the matter of doing their own transport. This represents at least 9,000 bales of grease wool with a return load of 6,000 bales of scoured wool, the total weight of which is 4,484,703 pounds. Our clients pay the railways indirectly just under &#x00A3;2,000 per annum, and we have no doubt they could do their own cartage not only more expeditiously than the railways, but with a saving of at least 40 per cent. of the amount at present paid on railage.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize what this letter says about South African scoured wool. I am sorry the Minister is not paying attention, because this is important.</p>

<speech by="#bates">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BATES</person>:</from>

<p>I am very glad to hear it. I want to read a paragraph which appeared in the &#x201C;Cape Times&#x201D; on January 28th, 1928.</p>

<block name="#quote">The Prince of Wales and the Lord Mayor to-day visited the port of London, where they were much attracted by a sample of South African snow white wool, which compared very favourably with the Australian and Canadian products.</block>

<p>There is no doubt the product the Prince of Wales admired was the product of the firm on whose behalf I am speaking. It is very unbecoming of the Minister to belittle the product of one of South Africa&#x2019;s oldest industries. This firm pays &#x00A3;20,000 a year in wages, and they pay the standard rates of pay. They pay to the railways in railway rates about &#x00A3;10,000 a year, and I think, in view of the circumstances, they deserve some consideration at the hands of the Minister. I want to tell the Minister that we have already a motor lorry service between Uitenhage and Port Elizabeth. I know the authorities at Port Elizabeth are watching it very carefully, but here is a clear case where the Minister can eliminate motor lorry traffic if he would only give this firm some consideration. They recognize that the railways are the legitimate carriers, but I want to ask the Minister, is it fair to this company that they should throw away &#x00A3;2,000 a year simply on account of the high rates and inconveniences of the railway. This Government, and quite rightly too, prides itself on what it has done for industry, but this particular industry has nothing for which to thank the Government. Wool sent from the port to be scoured and returned to the port for export is charged 43d. for 100 pounds for 42 miles when you take into account shrinkage in the scouring process. Surely no Minister can justify that excessive charge. Coal and maize for export are carried at a very low rate, and whilst I do not object to this, we should not make fish of one and fowl of another. I emphasize this because I intend to lay the papers before the Minister to-morrow, and I hope he will deal with the matter sympathetically. I am speaking from the parish pump point of view, but I am speaking on behalf of the railways and of a legitimate industry. With regard to the working of the railway, last session I drew the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the enormous amount of money spent on overtime. It was pointed out at that time that continued overtime was very expensive and not in the interests of the service, and it certainly was detrimental to the health of the staff. The Minister agreed that the amount of overtime was excessive, and said that steps would be taken to obviate it. The cost in 1926-&#x2019;27 amounted to &#x00A3;1,166,125, in 1925-&#x2019;26, &#x00A3;1,254,704, and in 1924-&#x2019;25, &#x00A3;938,194, thus the average cost for the last three years has been considerably over &#x00A3;1,000,000. Surely <span class="col_1891-1892" refersTo="page_1012"/>the fact that it was necessary to spend that large amount is a proof that the railways are understaffed. In reply to the criticism levelled by the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) in regard to excessive overtime, the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">If I do away with overtime it would mean increasing the staff.</block>

<p>I have yet to learn that would be a crime. I think the time has arrived when the Minister should seriously consider increasing the staff. To keep pace with the expansion of the railways the permanent staff must be increased. In this connection it is interesting to see from the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report that compared with March of last year the number of employees on 31st of March, 1927, has decreased by 2,180. I was pleased to hear the statement in regard to the appointment of an assistant to the chief mechanical engineer. I agree that in some cases the repair costs are far too high, but until we get up-to-date machinery and more modern facilities, the costs will be high. In the report of the general manager, page 75, we see the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">There has been sustained pressure on all workshops throughout the year. The lack of adequate accommodation, plant, and up-to-date machinery, to meet the constantly increasing demands, has made it difficult to keep pace with the work offering. Where new machines have been installed they have proved economical and the quality of the work has been improved. Much more, however, is necessary by way of providing greater facilities and additional plant, and the installation of modern machinery, before the workshops will be in a position to meet requirements adequately and economically. At various times over a considerable number of years dating as far back as 1911, I have emphasized the need for effecting alterations and improvements to the workshops both from the point of view of securing economy in operation and of increasing their capacity for executing maintenance and repair work. As stated in my annual report for the period 1924-&#x2019;25, year after year when the estimates were under consideration, funds were asked for to be used for the acquisition of new machinery and the erection of new and additional workshops, which, if granted, would have permitted a reorganization of the workshops and the work, a more expeditious delivery of material to the artizans and the introduction of up-to-date methods, all of which would have made for efficiency as well as economy. But for a variety of reasons, these requests were invariably refused and the amounts asked for substantially reduced, regardless of essential needs, thereby compelling the Administration&#x2019;s officers to do the best they could with the reduced sums allowed. As a consequence, the sums available for workshops&#x2019; development were invariably so inadequate, as to preclude any possibility of entering upon the scheme of improvement which had been contemplated for years.</block>

<p>In the report of the chief mechanical engineer (page 130) it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">It is apparent that the workshops have reached their maximum output unless additional machinery is installed and there is additional staff. &#x2026;</block>

<p>The chief mechanical engineer lays down definitely that we must have an increased staff before we can have an improvement. Last session I compared the amount spent on the workshops during the regime of the present and of the previous Minister of Railways and Harbours, and now that the actual figures are available, it makes the comparison more interesting than ever. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), that demon for economy, while Minister of Railways and Harbours, spent on an average of &#x00A3;257,944 per annum on the workshops, while the present Minister has, for the last three years, spent an average of &#x00A3;116,000, or less than a half of the expenditure of his predecessor. In view of the report of the general manager and that of the chief mechanical engineer, it seems as if the present Minister is starving our workshops. Money is evidently to be found for unpayable branch lines, but money for increasing the number of men employed in our workshops is a different matter. I wish to draw attention to another matter in connection with our workshops, and that is, when does the Minister intend to put into practice that election cry of his to build in South Africa all the railway stock that can be built here? In this I hope I shall have some assistance from my hon. friends on the cross benches. According to the general manager&#x2019;s report in 1926-&#x2019;27 we built 51 wagons and imported 1,260. In the previous year we built 96 and imported 477. In 1925-&#x2019;26 we built one for every five imported, and in 1926-&#x2019;27 for every wagon built in South Africa we imported 20. With regard to coaches, in 1925-&#x2019;26 24 were built and 56 imported, and in 1926-&#x2019;27, 58 were built and 180 imported.</p>

<p>Our workshops are much more capable than the hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce). The figures I have just quoted show that the ratio is again in favour of the imported coach as compared with those of last year. That is all the more remarkable when we see in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">(iv) Coaches, local manufacture, compared with imported cost: 50 third-class main line saloons &#x2014; locally built &#x2014; estimated cost, &#x00A3;185,575 (sanction 23/132 C.). 50 third-class main line saloons&#x2014;imported&#x2014;estimated cost, &#x00A3;175,300 (sanction 23/172 C.). The costs recorded against these sanctions are (to 30th June, 1927)&#x2014;50 coaches, built locally &#x00A3;161,834; 50 coaches, imported, &#x00A3;177,401. Of the 50 coaches built locally, 25 were erected at Salt River; and 25 at Pretoria, the respective costs being: Pretoria (25), &#x00A3;84,081; Salt River (25), &#x00A3;77,753; total, &#x00A3;161,834. As the figures indicated two important <span class="col_1893-1894" refersTo="page_1013"/>features, viz.: (1) that the cost of construction was substantially lower at Salt River than at Pretoria, and (2) that apparently the combined cost of the 50 coaches locally constructed was less than the cost of the 50 imported coaches by some &#x00A3;15,000 (although the estimates indicated that the local coaches would cost &#x00A3;10,275 more than the imported coaches), I addressed the Administration in the matter, but at the date of signing this report had not received a reply.</block>

<p>I hope if there is any explanation, the Minister will let us have it.</p>

<p>If we go back as far as that, we find that the ratio is even more in favour of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). It is a funny thing that while I am trying to do what the hon. members on the cross benches say they are here to do, viz., to build in South Africa everything that can be built here, they always interrupt me.

<p>In conclusion, I want to refer to the staff and I wish to emphasize the injustice of differentiation in the rates of pay. This is a hardship and a slight on the South African. It is against the spirit of the Wage Act, and detrimentally affects the whole service. How can the Government support a Wage Act which lays it down that a private firm employing two men doing the same work must pay the same wages, yet in the railway workshops one man may receive 20s. a day and another man, working side by side with him, receives only 18s., although the latter has been trained in our own workshops and is thoroughly competent in every way. This is an injustice that affects the railway service&#x2014;clerical and mechanical.</p>

<p>My hon. friends blame the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). I also blame him, but were you not returned to power to put right all the injustices done by him? If what the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) did was a crime, the Minister in perpetuating the crime is acting even worse than the hon. member did. There are many other differentiations in the service. For instance, if a salaried official is away from work through illness, he receives full pay, but a daily paid man gets only one-third of his pay. Then a salaried official has a first-class free pass, but the daily paid man only a second-class pass. Again, as a reward for 20 years&#x2019; long and faithful service, a mechanic gets a first-class pass, but a machinist does not receive any reward, no matter how long or meritorious his service. The daily paid man is paid for all overtime, but the salaried man, I am told, in some departments, receives extra pay for Sunday work only. Why not eradicate these anomalies and build up a united and contented service? There is another matter which is causing a great deal of discontent. [Time limit extended.] I wish to thank the House for its indulgence, and will show my appreciation by cutting my remarks short. If we look at the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report on page 78, we shall see a long list of salaried officers drawing extra remuneration for acting in superior posts. There was the case of an official acting as general manager for several months, who received an addition of &#x00A3;122 to his usual salary of &#x00A3;2,060. I would say he was entitled to the amount and was paid accordingly. But if the higher paid officials have the privilege, why deny the lower paid men the same advantage? I know of cases of men who have been working in superior grades for over two years, and cannot get the money or grade to which they are entitled. I hope the Minister will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>The question of promotion is also causing a great deal of heart-burning in the service. Last session I drew attention to extraordinary cases of promotion, and in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, page 76, this year we have the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">X Extraordinary Promotions and Increments&#x2014;Railway Board Staff.&#x2014;In paragraph 43 (xii) of my last report, attention was drawn to certain extraordinary promotions and increments to the Railway Board staff, and the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours, in its fifth report, Resolution No. 18, last session, recommended that I should again draw attention to the subject with a view to reference to the select committee next session. The paragraph referred to was to the effect that the secretary to the Railway Board received increments to the amount of &#x00A3;141 in 20 months. A grade I clerk was promoted from the minimum of grade I on a salary of &#x00A3;410 per annum to principal clerk at &#x00A3;580, passing through three complete grades in just over 12 months, with increments amounting to &#x00A3;170, and four clerks in Grades II to IV received unusual promotions and increments which also did not conform to the general practice in respect of other departments of the Railways and Harbours Service. In giving evidence before the select committee last session, the general manager&#x2019;s representative admitted the facts as set forth in the paragraph, and that they were undoubtedly extraordinary increments and promotions.</block>

<p>If this favouritism is allowed in the Minister&#x2019;s own office, it has a very bad effect on the <span class="col_1895-1896" refersTo="page_1014"/>whole of the service. I can assure the Minister there is a great deal of discontent in the service. Here is a letter from a man who is a first lieutenant in my constituency of the party to which the hon. Minister belongs. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">I am now a shop steward, and am overstocked with grievances.</block>

<p>Some of these I have just brought to the notice of the House. A certain mechanic, who at the last election was encouraged to go to all the meetings of the candidate who represented this side of the House, and was specially selected to question my right hon. friend, the member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt), when he came to assist, was personally thanked by the Minister, he was not Minister then, for his services, and was promised his grievance would be redressed. This has not been done, and recently, through the proper channels, he asked for a personal interview, and this is the reply he received&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The Minister wishes me to state that these matters were finally disposed of by him on a previous occasion, and he cannot see his way to agree to reopen the discussion in connection therewith. That being the case, he feels that nothing will be achieved by granting you a personal interview.</block>

<p>When a member of the staff receives a letter from the Minister, he must acknowledge it and give his remarks thereon, and in this case the remarks were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">As a workman looking for justice, I am sorely disappointed at the Minister&#x2019;s reply.</block>

<p>I assure the Minister there are quite a number of employees in my constituency who are anxious to meet the Minister. It is said they want to remind him of what he is supposed to have said, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">When I am Minister of Railways it will not be necessary for you to take off your hat to me. All you will have to do is to touch me on the shoulder and say, &#x201C;Charlie, remember your promise,&#x201D; and your grievances will be attended to.</block>

<p>As far as the clerical staff is concerned there are many legitimate grievances, and it seems to me responsibility, ability and service are no longer taken into account in the Railway Department. Recently a clerk was wanted for a railway centre outside the Union, and I understand that in a certain railway centre every clerk below a certain grade applied for the position. In many departments the clerical staff feels hopeless, and at the present time this side of the railway is not getting or attracting the standard of ability we should have in a service like our railways. We should be proud of the service, but to maintain the high standard of efficiency we have had in the past, it will be necessary to take stock and rectify the many grievances, remove anomalies, and to make all feel that on the railways ability and service will always be recognized irrespective of the branch to which you belong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#swart">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SWART</person>:</from>

<p>As one listens to the hon. member who has just spoken (Mr. Bates) the desire involuntarily arises to have heard him during the last Government in his outbursts against all the injustice, as he called it, of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). The hon. member was only here a short while before the last Government resigned, but I cannot remember that he then touched upon a single matter. He never dealt with the point which he is raising now. There are many things in the Minister&#x2019;s administration about which we can praise him, but it is not my intention to do so now. Our duty is to raise points which we think ought to be altered. In the first place, I want to say a few words about the Sea Point railway. We know that when steam was used there was an annual loss of &#x00A3;24,000. Since electrification the loss has been calculated at about &#x00A3;50,000 a year. During the few months that electric trains have been running the loss is double that. I think it is in the interests of the country that we should discuss this matter. I am prepared to believe that the object of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) and the administration was to run more cheaply. I assume that they thought so, but the country cannot to-day afford that such a railway should annually lose &#x00A3;50,000. The railway does not pay, and it is quite unnecessary. There are enough transport facilities to Sea Point such as trams and buses, and if the railway think it necessary they can run buses also. The railway spoils the whole coastline. Further, in connection with it, we have that blot on our railway system, the Monument Station. If there ever was an ugly, unpleasant and dreary place, then it is that station. The worst is that it is the first impression tourists get. They pass it, and think it is the Cape Town station. I wish the Minister will give us his motor-car for once and go there when the south-east wind is blowing. A respectable person cannot conveniently get to that station. A lot of filth blows on to you. It is intolerable, and it is no wonder that the line does not pay. The station is a scandal, and if the Minister wants to keep the line alive he must at least put it in order and possibly people will then make more use of it. With reference to branch lines, a great fuss is constantly made about the losses which are sustained in some cases. Hon. members want the figures to be able to show the country that the branch lines are not paying. Is it necessary to have an unnecessary line from Cape Town to Sea Point that causes heavy losses? If losses must be suffered, it is surely much better to have them on the countryside where railways assist the development of districts. I want to say, in connection with the line, that the trains run very regularly, and that it is very comfortable travelling when once you are seated, and notwithstanding that and that the trains run every 12 minutes, and take much less time, those great losses are still suffered, and I hope that other hon. members will point out to the railway management that it is necessary to enquire whether it is not in the interests of the <span class="col_1897-1898" refersTo="page_1015"/>railways of Cape Town and of the country to scrap the line. It will be said that the capital invested in it will be lost, but we can get something out of it&#x2014;use the rolling stock profitably and also use the ground for other purposes. Then I come to a point which I, unfortunately, have to raise every year, but I shall continue to do so until an improvement takes place. I refer to the medical service of the railways. I do not know whether the Minister knows that the Federal Council of the Medical Association of South Africa has made enquiry into the desirability or possibility of introducing the panel system. Does he know that they are practically in favour of it and, from experience in other countries, it appears that the system on the whole gives much more satisfaction? I was very glad of the support that I got last year in connection with the matter from the hon. members for Cape Town (Central) and Beacons-field (Col. Sir David Harris). I should like to know whether the Railway Board has gone into the matter, and whether the Administration is better disposed now. It has been brought to my notice that abuses are taking place in connection with the systems. I do not know if it is true, but my information is from a medical man. Inter alia, I am assured, that in cases of births, railway medical officers are paid &#x00A3;3 3s. each and that it often happens that the doctors are not even personally in attendance, that a midwife is simply sent and the &#x00A3;3 3s. is paid to him. Then I am also assured that there are railway doctors who get medicines from the railway stores and use them for private patients. If that is so, it is a serious matter and my informant assures me that he can prove it. I do not say that it happens in every case. Not in the least. I am also assured, and I know it from private experience, that railway people are often neglected by railway doctors. Possibly they cannot attend to all their patients properly. Possibly also they neglect them because they are paid in any case. One thing is certain that numbers of people in the railway service simply do not use the railway doctors at all because they have no confidence in them or are neglected and that the people prefer to send for a decent doctor if their health or that of their wives or children is at stake, notwithstanding that they pay their contributions to the fund. It is also said that there is abuse in connection with the appointment of doctors. I do not want to make accusations, because I cannot myself prove them, but I have heard from more than one source that there are abuses.</p>

<p>There are local committees for the appointments and they have nothing to do with the Railway Board and the Minister. Another point to which my attention was called was that at many places a man is both district surgeon and railway medical officer. I asked a question last year, and the Minister gave a long list of persons who were district surgeons as well as railway medical officers. They accordingly have nearly all the work and new young doctors have hardly any chance of competing. I think it is unfair for a man to have two appointments. I hope the Minister will investigate this, if necessary. I hope the Administration will go into these matters and give satisfaction. The panel system will work well. Then the doctor who does his duty will get most work. At present there is often only one doctor at the small places, and he knows that he gets paid even if he neglects people. Now, another remark in connection with railway coaches. My experience, and that of many people, is that they are unsatisfactory. When one goes inside some coaches, one finds that they are dirty and the lavatories are in a filthy condition.</p>

<p>Is that on the branch lines?</p>

<speech by="#swart">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SWART</person>:</from>

<p>No, on the main lines as well. It may chance that at a large station on a main line train you find the lavatory so untidy and filthy that you will not make use of it. I do not say this to abuse the railways, but in the interests of the railway service itself and the travelling public. It makes a bad impression on visitors. Then I want to say something with reference to the catering on the trains. I recently travelled by an express train which was very full. We had to wait for the third sitting. When our turn finally arrived we had lost our appetite. The table linen was dirty, the food cold, and the knives and forks not properly cleaned. I do not blame the staff so much, perhaps they could not help it as it was the third sitting, but I wish the Administration would see that less unsavoury meals are served. Our catering service in the past has always had one of the best names in the world, and we must try to maintain it. Then there is another point with reference to catering that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister, viz., the receipts for payment. It has almost become a custom on many trains, I think other hon. members will have had the same experience, for the stewards to give no receipts, and when you ask for one they have to fuss to make them out. If no receipts are issued, what abuses may not be the result? I hope stricter measures will be taken to get them issued. We all know the losses incurred in the catering service, and I think that a large part of the deficit is due to the receipts not always going in the right channels. I am sorry to have to say it, and it is possibly only a small part of the staff who are guilty of it, and I do not want to insult the staff as a body. A further point I want to mention is about the bookstalls at stations. A number of trains, e.g., pass Bloemfontein between 8 and 10 and the bookstall is closed. During the day few trains pass, but at night when the trains arrive one can get no books or periodicals. Those are the points I wanted to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice.</p>

<p>When I went out of office I thought I was about the most unpopular railway Minister that ever existed, but if there is any truth in what the hon. member for <span class="col_1899-1900" refersTo="page_1016"/>Uitenhage (Mr. Bates) says, I think my hon. friend is coming in a good second. Of course I condole with him very sincerely.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>That is very true, and better provided for which makes a great difference as well. My hon. friend over there complained about the doctors. Why did he not point out the reasons for the dissatisfaction? Of course, they are selected by the local committee, but that selection has to be submitted to the Railway Board and the Minister, and they frequently do not confirm the appointment. The blame, for the present, at any rate, has to be placed on the Minister and the Railway Board. I want to get back to another matter, and that is this steady increase in the working expenses of the Railway Department. It is getting quite serious; in fact, the increase of expenses on the railways to-day is greater than the increase in the receipts from traffic, ever since my hon. friend took charge. Let me give him a few figures. We have just voted &#x00A3;750,000 covering the increase in expenditure for the current year, bringing it up to &#x00A3;29,324,000. That compares with &#x00A3;22,979,000 in 1923-&#x2019;24, or an increase of &#x00A3;6,385,000 in working expenses or 27 per cent. altogether. Take the receipts from traffic. They are less than the working expenses since 1923-24. The revenue has increased by &#x00A3;4,935,000 or 20 per cent., whereas the expenses in four years since my hon. friend has been in charge have increased by 27 per cent. The total receipts as taken from the railway books show an increase of only 20 per cent. Let me put it in another way. You take the percentage alluded to by the hon. member for Harbour (Maj. G. B. van Zyl). If you take the percentage of working expenses or operating expenses to the total revenue in 1924 the operating expenses were 74 per cent. and in 1926-&#x2019;27 it was 80.68 per cent. If the operating expenses go beyond 80.20 per cent. it is bound to show a loss, and it does show a loss. In 1924, when we had just brought the railways on to a fair footing, the total operating expenses were 74 per cent., whereas they are now 80.68 per cent. Surely one would expect with an increase in traffic there would be some decrease in the percentage of operating expenses. That is the general experience in most businesses, and I cannot make it out at all why that rule does not operate so far as the railways are concerned. There are certain fixed charges, however big or however small the traffic is. Take general expenses. You have officials to pay. That cannot vary very much in any case. Then there is the permanent way. Take the general charges, why they should have gone on increasing with the increase of the traffic, I cannot understand. The experience of other railways, as of other businesses, is that if you have increased business, trade or traffic, there should be, as a rule, a proportionate fall in operating expenses. To give some indication where this extra money goes, I have here some figures from the general manager&#x2019;s report. In 1923-&#x2019;24 46.13 per cent. of the total expenditure on the railways went in the payment of labour, but in 1926-&#x2019;27 49.57 per cent., or close on 50 per cent. This European labour, or &#x201C;civilized labour&#x201D; as my hon. friend calls it, is one source, and a considerable source, of this additional expenditure. It is difficult to get the amount of this additional cost. My hon. friend has refused to give it as the Auditor-General points out. The latter wrote to the general manager, who gave him some figures, but not the figures which should have been given. Whatever be the policy of the Government in this matter, it is only right and fair that the people who have to pay for it should know the cost. That is all I am asking for. I estimate it costs &#x00A3;700,000 extra to pay for this civilized labour. The proper way is for the Minister to show it so that the taxpayer knows exactly what it costs. On one occasion the Prime Minister gave instructions to all departments to state definitely what was the extra cost.</p>

<p>How would you set off the corresponding benefits?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Leave it to the people to draw the conclusion. He should tell the people what it costs, and can say if he likes, &#x201C;But look at the benefits you get on the other side.&#x201D; The Minister states that white labour is used on the German railways, but the only labour available in Germany is white. One thing that should be borne in mind is the fact that in South Africa skilled labour is the highest paid in the world outside the United States and Canada. We are only able to pay that high wage rate through the fact that our unskilled labour is very cheap, so that one off-sets the other, but the Minister is removing that off-set altogether. Then it must be remembered that our railways are not laid out as they are in the United States, where they have every appliance for the economic handling of traffic. We, on the other hand, have not worried very much about labour-saving appliances, owing to the fact that we have a large supply of cheap labour. It is no wonder that the proportion of operating expenses to receipts is increasing more rapidly than the traffic itself. I wish to call the attention of farmers to the fact that the extra cost of white labour is merely a subsidy. Does the Minister expect the country to pay this subsidy for all time? We cannot afford to do it. You must get down to an economic basis, and it can be done. As long as this present policy is continued, people must not expect any further decrease of rates. In fact, the Minister will be increasing rates very soon, because there has been a steady increase in expenses, and he has got to the end of his tether. So if this policy is maintained, the rates will have to be increased, and they are heavy enough as they <span class="col_1901-1902" refersTo="page_1017"/>are now, as the following comparison, giving the increases over pre-war rates, will show: Groceries, Algoa Bay to Pretoria, 42 per cent.; boots and shoes, Durban to Bloemfontein, 81 per cent.; agricultural machinery, 55 per cent.; wool, Kroonstad to Table Bay, 84 per cent. These are heavy rates, and it is no wonder that the up-country people complain, but so long as this policy is maintained how can the public expect a reduction? I would like to see these people employed, but you must have some consideration for other sections of the population. Let the public know what the employment of white unskilled labour costs the railways, so that people can decide whether to continue the system or not. What astonishes me is what the farmers of this country will stand. Farming is, without doubt, the poorest occupation in the country. The Minister is not a farmer.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Figures have been published showing that the average value of the farming output per person engaged in agriculture per annum, in Australia is &#x00A3;420, in Canada &#x00A3;300, and in South Africa only &#x00A3;80. Is it to be wondered at that people leave the land? But the astonishing thing is that the Minister should increase this burden upon these people. Then the Minister of Finance makes them pay through the Customs 30 per cent. on boots and shoes, 20 per cent. on clothing, 20 per cent. on milk cans, and 5s. a ton on superphosphates. I do not understand why the farmers do not rise in protest. On top of that the railway makes them pay more for transport by the continuance of a certain policy. If the Government had continued the policy which I pursued when in office, the railway rates would be lower than they are to-day. My hon. friend will do me the justice of saying that I got the rates down by &#x00A3;2,000,000.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I dare say it could have been done, and my hon. friend has been four years in office. I would not have allowed the expenses to increase to 80 per cent. of the total receipts, that is very certain. If you bring down rates you increase production, obtain more traffic, and put more people on the land. The whole policy of the late Government was to reduce railway rates. Work steadily for that. Nothing gave the late Government more pleasure than when they could announce a reduction of rates. I doubt myself whether the policy of my hon. friend is a sound or wise policy. I remind him that some time in 1916 a commission was appointed in the Transvaal, the Relief and Grants in Aid Commission, and later, in 1924 or 1925, there was an Economic and Wages Commission appointed, and it is a curious thing, and my hon. friend may not agree with that report, but exactly the same report came from the two commissions. They both agreed that the payment of wages over the economic value of the work is only a way of pauperizing workmen. Some of the men know they are being paid more than they are earning.</p>

<speech by="#pearce">

<p>Do you agree with that?</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I agree with it. I should not say it if I didn&#x2019;t. The native is in possession of the unskilled labour market, and the only way for the white man to get into that field is to show that he can compete with the native on that footing. There is no necessity for the white workmen to ask for the wages that satisfy the black man, but if he only sets a higher standard of efficiency than that set by the black man he will obtain a footing and hold his own. That is borne out in the experience of the Railway Department. You are paying them far more than their productive power warrants, and you will have to cut down eventually and pay what they earn. That is as far as the white labour and working expenses policy is concerned. I want again to deal with the branch lines question. The Minister has adopted a policy of hush-hush, and is afraid of showing what the branch lines cost. What has he got to hide? He is not responsible for all the branch lines. I am responsible for some of these lines. I came to the conclusion when I was in office from the figures published that it does not pay to make branch lines in purely pastoral districts. Those in the districts like Caledon or Klaver paid better, because there was a certain amount of agriculture carried on. I suggest to you, put the men on their mettle, and you will minimize the loss if you publish the returns each month and in that way they would put forward their best endeavours to cut the loss down. I know that. I would also like to say for the benefit of the Minister of Finance that I would not be so liberal with new lines in future. The best thing the Minister has done is the starting of motor services, and I ask him why not be content with that for some time?</p>

<p>Very well. I urge the Minister to continue that policy, and do not spend any money on new lines. Let those now constructed get fully developed. Some of them are not in a paying position, but they may get better. These motor services are appreciated by the public. I would also say to the Minister, don&#x2019;t come to this House and ask for power to throttle the independent man. I refused when I was in office to come to the House and ask for this power. Reduce your rates and give good service, and you will thus be able to compete with these independent services. <span class="col_1903-1904" refersTo="page_1018"/>I hope the House will not agree to giving such power. I know that the Railway Department wants it, and I say it is not fair and just, and it is not in the interests of the country that you should handicap the independent motor services or place them at a disadvantage in competing with the railway. There is just one other point in conclusion I want to ask my hon. friend. What are you going to do with the ships you have got now? At one time they were of some service. That was when they fetched sleepers from Australia, but that has pretty well come to an end. If I might give a hint to my hon. friend, sell those ships as soon as you can. This is the only Government that has been able to make ships pay, and remember you cannot continue carrying sleepers from Australia. Don&#x2019;t take hold of too many things. Confine yourself to the railway, and run that properly. What have you to do with ships? If you continue you will lose money, and I advise my hon. friend to get rid of them.</p>

<p>We know the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) was called to the late Government&#x2019;s assistance in order to put the railways in order and to economize in the department as much as possible.

Pick up any paper, and you see the dispute, &#x201C;Where should this rolling stock be bought, in Germany or England?&#x201D; The road is badly in want of repair, and rails have to be relaid because of the parsimony of my hon. friend in the past. Let me tell the late Minister of Railways what I have repeatedly heard from railwaymen, railwaymen of considerable experience and good sense. At the time when these economies of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) were the policy of the late Government, before 1924, these men uttered the warning that sort of economy would lead to trouble on the railways, accidents and difficulties.

<p>I have made my two points. The opposition can accept what I have said or not, it does not concern me. But before I sit down I want to draw attention to the attack of the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) upon the hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser) when this discussion commenced this afternoon. It seemed to me when I listened to that attack to be playing the Parliamentary game hardly in terms of cricket. The hon. member knows as well as I do&#x2014;he is a member, and an illuminating member of the Opposition on the railway committee&#x2014;that this question is coming before our committee this session, that the whole of the question is going to be threshed out by the committee. Yet he, before the matter is raised in our committee, comes here and passes judgment or asks the country to pass judgment on the actions of the hon. member for Vrededorp in regard to these sleeper contracts. I do not hear any interruption at this stage from members of the Opposition, and I think every hon. member of this House agrees that it was not playing the game according to the rules. I heard the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) interject. Earlier on in this session he played with mud on a similar occasion under similar circumstances. On that occasion the mud seemed in my opinion to stick to his hands.</p>

<p>He performed it in a way that made one think of playing with mud and, in my opinion, it stuck to his hands. The hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) has been playing the same game this afternoon. None of us know all the facts of the case&#x2014; we will have them later on in this session after the matter has been dealt with by the railway committee&#x2014;but I feel sure that when the facts do come out they will show for a second time that the allegations of hon. members on the opposite benches against the hon. member for Vrededorp were entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>I was very edified in listening to the hon. member who has just sat down (Mr. te Water) on the art of playing cricket in dealing with the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report. My memory goes back in this House a little further than that of the hon. member. I cannot help wishing that he had been here on this side of the House to give his party when they were here that lesson in the great game of cricket. I think that time is still in store for him, and then he will be able to give a lesson to his side when they are in opposition on how to use the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report. I got up in view of something that the hon. member said which I want to correct. He said that I had charged the servants of the Railway Administration with giving misleading information before the select committee when I said that I did not believe it would cost &#x00A3;12,000 to give these figures of branch railway results to the public. What I meant was this&#x2014;and I think it ought to be quite clear to anybody who heard the evidence given&#x2014;that the Administration has got these figures. The Administration must have these figures if they run the railways properly, and therefore I did not believe that it would cost &#x00A3;12,000 to put these figures, which they have got, before the public. I have had a great many figures from the Railway Department, and you must look at them with a critical eye, and, looking at them with a critical eye, I do not believe it would cost &#x00A3;12,000 a year extra to give these statistics which they must have to the public. We have constant criticism here in this House and elsewhere about the way in which the railway expenditure is going up, and what I feel most strongly about it is that there is no real way of testing that rise in the expenditure. When we accuse the Minister of allowing the expenditure to mount up every year, he says: &#x201C;Oh, look at the traffic I am handling.&#x201D; When you cite the figures from the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report that the percentage of operating expenses to revenue is steadily increasing, he says: &#x201C;That is no criterion, because I am carrying so much low-rated traffic now, and I have given away so much revenue that these figures mean nothing.&#x201D; That is another test gone by the board. If you turn to the train mileage figures he says you cannot take the train mileage figures; they mean nothing. I say it is time that we had some reliable gauge to enable us to test these matters, not for party purposes, but to enable the Minister to see where he is going, whether the expenditure, which is certainly increasing more than in proportion to the revenue, is really justified by the results, whether we are getting more efficient service from the railways or not. I know the hon. member for Liesbeek (Mr. Pearce) will come and say: &#x201C;We are employing 14,000 more.&#x201D; Sometimes it will be 15,000 and sometimes 20,000 more.

<p>If the hon. member wants to offer me a bottle of champagne, provided it is a good one, I have not the slightest objection any time. I will not allow my party feelings to go as far as that. I am only telling the House the impression the hon. member gives to me when he deals with statistics. They go to his head and they fly all over the House and they increase every time he cites a figure. It is no good applying these tests. What we want to know is, are we getting more efficient service or less efficient service on the railways for the money we are paying for it? The <span class="col_1907-1908" refersTo="page_1020"/>nearest criterion that I know in railway practice is for the Minister to get out ton mileage statistics. Then, of course, he at once says again: &#x201C;Look at the cost.&#x201D; It will cost something, undoubtedly, but it is better, in my opinion, to spend money on that, which gives you a test of what we are doing, whether we are spending more money per unit than before, and, if so, whether we are getting correspondingly increased service for it. I do think it is time the Railway Administration knew that. At present they do not know it, because every test you take they turn round and say: &#x201C;Oh, that means nothing; you cannot apply that.&#x201D; Well, I say let us have a test that does mean something, and that enables us to see what we are spending our money on in railway administration, and whether we are getting value for it. On this question of low-rated traffic, it is quite true that the proportion of low-rated traffic to high-rated traffic has very much changed in South Africa in the last ten years, say, but that is part of our development, and the Minister must realize that is going to be the task of the Railway Administration in South Africa for the future, to carry the produce of the country from the interior to the sea much more than to carry imported goods from the coast to the interior. It is his business and the business of any Minister in charge of railways, no matter what his Government may be, to equip the transport machinery of the country to do the service which the country requires and to see it is in such a state of efficiency that we can carry that low-rated traffic without making a serious loss, as we seem to be in danger of doing now. I do not say we are making a serious loss at present. We are not. But what we are doing is, we are increasing our expenditure rapidly at a greater rate than our revenue seems to be increasing, and if that goes on the time will come when we shall be making a serious loss. I do think the Minister should deliberately set himself to give us such statistics as will show, as near as railway statistics can show, what we are actually doing, and included in that are the new branch lines. We ought to know, the public ought to know, what they are doing, what they are contributing to the general system, whether a loss is being made on them, and, if so, whether the general service they do to the development of the country is justified by that loss. The Administration ought to know that, and if they know it, they should communicate it to the public.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) and the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) have been, to a certain extent, demanding from the Minister statistics dealing with costs. Well, I only hope and trust that the Minister will give them statistics, and he will then show that whereas the members of the Opposition are quoting figures and percentages as regards the cost of running the railways and also percentages as regards labour, they lose sight of the fact that this Government is spending a tremendous amount in the building and equipment of workshops, which naturally does not count, in working out the percentages, to the advantage of the railways.

<p>You would find that this Government is working not only on a lower ratio as regards costs, but also for the benefit of the people of South Africa. It is rather unusual that a gentleman who is an hon. member of this House and who is also carrying on the business of a farmer, believes in up-to-date machinery, but when he is in charge of a department of the State allows machinery and also equipment to be forty or fifty years behind the time. When this Government took over the railways, the machinery and the equipment generally were behind any other workshop of a like character in existence throughout the world, and not only that, but they were of such a character that they would never have been thought of by any reasonable man who was out for the benefit of this grand country we live in. I have seen some of the machinery in railway workshops, and I have also seen some machinery in railway workshops in Great Britain and there is, undoubtedly, a vast difference. Yes, and in Germany also. The South African party has a great deal to say about articles made in Germany, but they took jolly good care to place orders in Germany when they were in power. We must have less talk about Germany now. I would also like to ask the Minister, seeing it has been, and always will be, used by the Opposition and its press, about the failure of the Government to keep its promises to have the requirements of South Africa manufactured in South Africa. I would like to ask the Minister to tell us the amount of money this Government has spent on the building and equipment of new workshops, so that we can manufacture the requirements of South Africa in South Africa. I think if he gave the public the information of what he is doing to keep his promise, it will astonish hon. members opposite&#x2014;what this Government is doing in laying the foundations firmly and solidly.</p>

<p>What about lending money to natives and selling them to the mines as the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) used to do? Seeing that the Government has on the Railway Board a farmer, an ex-railway servant, and an ex-railway workman, surely some scheme could be evolved whereby men with grievances would have not only get a more satisfactory, but also a more speedy, hearing than at present. I would also like statements made in this <span class="col_1909-1910" refersTo="page_1021"/>House, like the one mentioned by the hon. member for Uitenhage (Mr. Bates), should be investigated by the Minister, so that we may know the truth or otherwise of these matters. We had in years gone by numerous letters and statements investigated by the previous Government. I hope that the Minister will do likewise. Hon. members opposite visit the bioscope sometimes, and I think the hon. member for Uitenhage was quoting from the book of Charlie Chaplin when he quoted about Charlie a short time ago. I allude to the statement made that a certain railway servant was engaged to break up meetings. I want to be quite frank&#x2014;I take good care when opposition meetings are broken up, mine are broken up too. It is not only edifying, but cleverly arranged, and you have arranged it in such a clever way that if I contest a few more elections I hope to learn more from the Opposition in this respect. With regard to the two different wages paid to artizans. I would like to know whether a scheme could not be evolved, so that if a workman was employed for a period of five years at 18s. he can receive 20s. It is a matter which would tend to comradeship in the workshops, when two men who are doing the same work get the same rate of pay. Has not the time arrived, I would also like to ask, when local allowances or district grades should be abolished to the artizan staff? I recognize that the artizan staff are employed in the large towns, or in towns with 5,000 or more inhabitants. With regard to the running staff, it is quite a different matter, sometimes members of that staff have to reside in outlandish places where they cannot live as cheaply as in a large town. The cost of living is practically the same in all the large centres. If these workmen are put on the same basis it would tend to remove grievances. Could not something be done when the Railway Department do work for the agricultural or any other department a book entry should be made to indicate the value of services that have been rendered? During the time of drought the Railway Department removes stock from, and carries foodstuffs to, drought-stricken areas In some years there may be little expense in connection with these free services, but in other years it may amount to a large sum. This year it must amount to between &#x00A3;200,000 and &#x00A3;250,000. If this was done it would show that the railways are being efficiently managed, whereas at present people are apt to be led astray by party newspapers, and to think that the railways are working at a loss. In the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report we find that the Agricultural Department, near Pretoria, are subsidizing a private bus, which is competing against the railways. Cannot the Minister arrange that no department of State supports a private concern which is running in competition with the railways? If that were done it would mean greater revenue for the State, and it would keep the money of the State within the State. The Railway Department, at present, are employing 14,000 more workers than the late Government did when they handed over the Government. I want hon. members to realize that the cost of running the railways must naturally be increased if the traffic increases. I have never known any merchant to open up a branch department or extend his business without his wage bill being larger than before. The State does not run altogether for profit, but for the development of the country, and while the railways may not reap the full returns at present, still, by developing the land, we are not only increasing its rateable value, but also its wealth. In conclusion I would ask the Minister not only to do the things which I have mentioned, but, following in the footsteps of his predecessor, play the big drum and point out what the railways are doing and have done for South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member was also optimistic enough to implore the Minister of Railways to give us information on various points. He does not seem to realize that the Minister is a little shy of supplying information. For instance, the House has been pining to obtain information as to the extra cost of the civilized labour policy, but its curiosity has not been satisfied. I am sorry the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. te Water) is not in his seat. It is most regrettable that he should think that he has made points and should endeavour to make political capital out of them. For instance, he made party capital out of the railway accidents which have taken place in the last few years. He stated that these accidents most probably were due to the fact that rolling stock was not replaced during the period of the tenure of office of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). He evidently has forgotten that the present administration has been in power for nearly four years. Has all that time not been enough in which to overtake these alleged laches on the part of the previous Minister of Railways? There have been two lamentable calamities in the last two years, but has any board of inquiry or has any responsible person put down the cause of the accident to the alleged non-replacement of railway material? No, not one single instance of this has been made public, and certainly not in connection with the Fish Hoek and Salt River disasters. In regard to the other accidents, as far as I am aware, not a suggestion has been made by any responsible person that the cause was that which was alleged by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central). I have been looking at the return of accidents for the years 1926-&#x2019;27, and amongst them are a very large number of derailments. On what system is this return compiled? Only one case of derailment at the Cape Town passenger station is included for the months of November and December, <span class="col_1911-1912" refersTo="page_1022"/>1927. I remember during that period two cases of lengthy delays outside the Castle.</p>

<p>I was informed that these derailments were constantly occurring there. One of the delays was to the 4 o&#x2019;clock train on the day of the M.C.C. cricket match, and about a week afterwards the morning train to Caledon was delayed for 30 or 45 minutes. Perhaps these derailments were too small to be included in the return. What is being done in connection with the Dock Road and other level crossings? People are becoming anxious as there have been a number of very serious level crossing accidents involving loss of life. Would it be unfair to ask whether the Administration has adopted any policy on the strength of the report of the level crossing commission? One realizes, of course, that with a greatly increased number of trains as the result of electrification, there is a possibility of a very large number of accidents. I raise the point in no party spirit, and with no desire to reflect on the officials who constitute the boards of inquiry into accidents, but there is a very wide spread desire that the boards should include some independent person unconnected with the administration or the Government. This desire implies no reflection on the bona fides or qualifications of the persons appointed on these boards. I don&#x2019;t for a moment refer to the question of their perfectly good qualifications for the purpose of the inquiry, but there is a strong public feeling that in an inquiry of this sort questions are likely to be put by people not in the Government groove, quite apart from the feeling that people not in the Government service are less likely possibly to be biassed or influenced.</p>

<p>No, nobody questions him, but why not have a magistrate with one of your own railway people who can keep the board in touch with railway details and in addition an expert from outside who is not in any way connected with the Government. I should be perfectly content to have my case tried by the general manager of railways. The principle of an independent member of the board is recognized in Section 68 in the Act of 1916, which deals with the question of railway accidents Provisions are made after accidents have been reported that the Governor-General may appoint one or more persons, one of whom at least shall not be in the employ of the administration, to form a board of inquiry. The essence of that provision is not to cast any reflection on the administration, but so that the public shall have their minds free from the idea that the inquiry is likely to be biassed. I ask the Minister to recognize that principle, and to say that one at least shall be an independent outside expert associated with a railway official. In what way is evidence prepared to an inquiry? Who collects the evidence?</p>

<p>Then the public prosecutor is going to deal with a highly technical subject. How is he to know the technical, scientific and engineering matters which are likely to be brought before a board of inquiry? The effect of having a railwayman on the board of inquiry would ensure that all matters which came before the board would be submitted from a railway point of view and the outside man might be able to suggest things of the greatest importance and see that evidence connected with it was brought before the inquiry. The Minister will appreciate the spirit in which I am mentioning this. It is to re-assure the public. We want the public to have the fullest confidence that an inquiry is held without any fear of bias. I would just like to ask the Minister about the mishap to the railway train at Robertson when the public schoolboys were going through about a month ago. From what I heard of it was a great blessing it stopped where it did. It might easily have been a very serious calamity with serious loss of life. If the Minister has investigated, he might tell us the result. There may not have been any board of inquiry, but there has been a magisterial investigation. I ask the Minister to give the fullest consideration to the widespread desire that there should be an independent man on the board of inquiry.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROOD</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) was not quite fair with regard to the enquiry he spoke about. He said that he would not speak in a party spirit, but at the same time he made an unfair attack on the hon. member for Pretoria (South) (Mr. te Water). The hon. member never said that the policy of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) was the cause of accidents. He merely stated that certain capable people had expressed the opinion that his too great economy was possibly the cause of the railway sleepers being excluded. I know that a little while ago papers like the &#x201C;Sunday Times&#x201D; wanted to make unfair party capital by representing the policy of the present Minister as the cause of the accidents. I believe more money is spent on renewals now than under the former Government. I want to ask the Minister if he is going to publish statistics with regard to branch lines. Of much greater importance, however, is whether the branch lines are not to be neglected. The branch lines actually develop the countryside The main lines run from Cape Town to Pretoria and from Durban to Pretoria, but the branch lines develop new areas. By building branch lines great development is now being effected. I maintain that if the losses on branch lines are properly investigated it will in many cases appear that the traffic which the branch lines bring to the main lines is the cause of the latter making a profit. The branch lines ought to enjoy every attention. Much is said about economy and one hesitates to again ask the Minister for a uniform wool rate. At present it comes under <span class="col_1913-1914" refersTo="page_1023"/>Tariff 4 and 10 per cent. rebate is given for compressed wool. The Sheep Farmers&#x2019; Association of Eastern Transvaal which includes all the sheep farmers there, is again asking for a uniform rate. There is a cheaper rate for cotton and wattle-bark. Then the Sheep Farmers&#x2019; Association also requests that branch lines should not be dearer, than main lines. They ask why the branch line from Belfast to Durban (a main line) is cheaper than from Carolina or Ermelo (a branch line) to Durban, although the latter distance is shorter. Why must the farmers using the branch lines be penalized? I congratulate the Minister on the Shipping Contract and the provision for the export of fruit. I want to ask him if it is too late to provide that fruit and other produce from the Eastern Transvaal should be exported from Delagoa Bay. There are large quantities of exportable produce in the Eastern Transvaal which cannot be made to pay if exported via Cape Town or Durban. Take, e.g., Barberton. A fruit truck to Cape Town takes about 5 days and it takes 15 days before it is back in Barberton again. The truck is out of service for 10 days. It will be a great benefit if the produce of the northern and eastern Transvaal can be sent to the nearest harbour. There are fruit, tobacco and cotton and their export will enormously increase if that is permitted. I even enquired whether the British East India Company boats are much delayed in Delagoa Bay. Both the ships&#x2019; captains and the head office in Calcutta told me that they are never delayed there. Cape Town and Durban need not be afraid that they will be damaged by such procedure. Their hinterland is too great for that to happen. Then I want to ask the Minister to do something in connection with the housing of people in malarial districts. Fortunately the Minister has never yet had malaria and I hope he never will. But one sometimes feels that if some members of the Board of Control had malaria they would pay more attention to the conditions of the staff. A change must be made. The houses which the people live in there are in many cases scandalous. In some cases an improvement has been made, but there are still many railway-men who are not properly housed in unhealthy parts. The hon. member for Lydenburg (Mr. Nieuwenhuize) will be able to say whether the railwaymen between Nelspruit and Sabie are still living in the huts formerly used for natives. I know of people still living in temporary houses which have existed there since the Z.A.S.M. time. If accidents occur when the people are housed in that way, and possibly have malaria, no one can be surprised. Another point in connection with conditions on the Low Veld is that the Minister must no longer make the people serve more than two or three years there. The Minister will be astonished, if he examines the report, at the number of people at Komatipoort who have had sick leave. The people have other great disadvantages with children who have to be sent to school If some of the clerks who have an easy time in offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg were to have a little experience on the countryside it would do much good.</p>

<p>Therefore the people who are not bilingual have the advantage of living in the towns. But let the Minister send those unilingual officials to parts of the countryside where the people are unilingual, e.g., in Natal. It is very necessary that the people at outside stations should be better looked after. This also applies to the education of children. I know that the railway department cannot be held entirely responsible for the position, but the children I speak of sometimes have to walk for hours to get to school and they can only have the teaching for a few hours instead of the full time. I hope the Minister will try to get into touch with the Provincial Administrations so that the children can attend school all the time and not for half a day as at present. I am convinced it is necessary that those people should be assisted. Then I want to urge the Minister that the time that a man who is a white labourer has to wait for promotion should be shortened. The good railway man cannot to-day show that he is working better if he has to wait so long for promotion. If the time is reduced, it will encourage the competent workman. I want to support the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Swart) in his remarks about the dirty condition of our railway carriages. It looks as if the administration only looks after the fast train between Cape Town and Johannesburg. The Minister said last year that an attempt would be made to get separate coaches for coloured people and natives on the Sea Point line. Nothing has, however, been done as yet. Things are terrible there. The hon. member for Ladybrand said that if the Minister would give up his motor car one day and travel in the train, as we do who have no motors, he would see the conditions prevailing there, especially on Saturday and Sunday. It is not so much the coloured people, because they usually conduct themselves respectably, but the natives in Cape Town. If they want to travel first class there can be an entirely similar coach for them with merely a board on it, but as things are to-day they spread themselves over the whole station and when the train arrives they get in everywhere and the Europeans must take their chance of a seat. It is, in fact, the dirtiest native who get in first class everywhere. Let them have just the same kind of coaches as ourselves but separate. The administration is surprised that in such circumstances the people prefer the trouble of taking a tram or bus to the train.</p>

<p>The Minister in introducing this Bill accomplished something in the nature of a record. He spoke, as near as I could make out, for about nine seconds, employed <span class="col_1915-1916" refersTo="page_1024"/>about nine words, and asked for &#x00A3;9,000,000 of money&#x2014;and then sat down. I do not think he will be able to deal quite as quickly with the very numerous and important matters which have been raised in this debate, when he replies. I do not, however, rise for the purpose of offering any criticism of the Minister and his policy on the railways. We shall have another and better opportunity for this when the main Budget comes on, when we shall be able to deal with matters more fully and have more information than we have now. I feel in rather a friendly mood towards the Minister, and I am inclined to-night to offer him my congratulations where congratulations are due. I mean it sincerely. And one thing upon which I would like to congratulate him on is the energetic way in which he is pushing the road motor services, which are serving outside districts, some of which were in a hopeless position until these services were supplied. Notwithstanding this, there are quite a number of districts which do not realize the great privileges which have been given to them, and are still employing a cheaper type of transport, whenever they can get it, not realizing that they are doing the worst thing they can for themselves and their district, for if these road services do not pay and people support competitive transport riders, sooner or later the railways&#x2019; road service will have to be withdrawn. I always urge people to support the road service. In one district in my constituency the road service transported, in addition to the ordinary traffic, 100,000 cases of oranges last season, no mean effort, and this was during the winter when the days were short and is certainly something for the service to be proud of. This year the road service will have to shift 140,000 cases, and next year over 200,000 cases, so the Minister should look ahead, for within two years he will have reached the fullest capacity of the vehicles and the roads. He has reached his limitations. What does he then propose to do? Is he then going to say to the farmers that he cannot carry any more of their produce? If he does then that would be tantamount to pronouncing their death sentence. I am glad that the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. te Water) has returned to the seat, because he has made a speech tonight which reflected no great credit on him either as a member of this House or of the select committee dealing with railway matters, of which he is a member. The hon. member should always bear in mind that there is nothing to be gained by throwing mud at an opponent, there is always the danger of repercussions, and his arguments are not such as he will be proud of on mature reflection. For instances, dealing with the late Minister of Railways, the member for Cape Town (Central), he said &#x201C;I have my own opinion as to the cause of these numerous railway accidents.&#x201D; This is a very grave insinuation. Not satisfied with that personal insinuation, he said he had been in constant communication with railwaymen who assured him that the neglect of the permanent way and the exercise of false economy by Mr. Jagger were bound to lead to serious consequences, and he tries to attach these loose remarks by a porter or a driver to the responsibility for accidents due to the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger).</p>

<block name="#quote">Last session, 1926, was one of the most critical sessions in this country as far as the railway administration was concerned, because it was on its defence in connection with the electrification in Natal. The report came up and the chief judge was Dr. Visser, and at the very time that he was criticizing the department, he was negotiating to become a contractor for a &#x00A3;1,000,000 contract.</block>

<p>That is the charge the hon. member for Bezuidenhout brought. Here was the chairman of the committee sitting in judgment on the railway, and at the same time carrying on negotiations for the obtaining of a tremendous contract, one of the biggest things connected with the railway. The return was to be &#x00A3;360,000 a year for three years and the hon. member charges the hon. member for Harbour with a lack of decency because he again referred to that contract this evening. The hon. member for Harbour was justified in referring to it, because in the defence put up by the Minister of Railways, no reference was made to the fact that &#x00A3;375 officers&#x2019; expenses, which the hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser) <span class="col_1917-1918" refersTo="page_1025"/> had undertaken to pay, and which the general manager of railways fully understood was to be paid, was not paid because of the interpretation the Minister placed on the correspondence.</p>
