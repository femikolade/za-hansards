<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Before the debate is resumed I wish to refer to the point raised by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Coulter) and the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander) as to whether this Rill should not be treated as a hybrid Bill. It is not always easy to determine whether a measure should be treated as a hybrid Bill or not, and our Standing Orders afford very little guidance. In the ruling given on the Government. Attorney Bill in 1924 I pointed this out and stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">an amendment [of the Standing Order] so as to give a clearer indication of what measures should be treated as hybrid Bills might well be considered.</block>

<p>There are hardly any measures introduced as public Bills which do not affect private rights, <span class="col_2791-2792" refersTo="page_0056"/>and I think that generally it may be said that where the nature and objects of a Bill are of a public character and its provisions are applicable generally and not merely to particular individuals, groups of individuals, or localities it must be proceeded with as a public Bill even if it impinges on private rights. In this case I think that it is clear that the Bill must be dealt with as a public measure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister is to be congratulated on this Bill and I think the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) who stated that he was speaking for the South African party showed a broader spirit than many others on his side in congratulating the Minister on the Bill. The Minister has dealt with a most complicated matter in a most lucid and courageous manner. He has shown that he is not concerned with the interests of one section or another section, but with broad principles, and he has shown that he is not guided by the question of popularity. He is to be congratulated upon having dealt with this matter from the point of view of what is right and not from that of popularity. He has consolidated very many Acts which have been on the statute books of the various provinces and he has at last given us a consolidating measure dealing with a matter of the utmost necessity. If a consolidating measure does not as far as possible unify the position in the various provinces there is not much value in it and you cannot have a consolidation without the effect of creating certain difficulties for certain individuals. The Bill also deals with the question of securing the right to the State of its share in these precious stones. In the days of President Kruger and before Kruger it was laid down that precious stones did belong to the State. The province of Natal laid it down in their legislation, and Lord Milner laid down the same principle in the Orange River Colony, and what the Minister is doing is to provide that what rights the State have shall be secured as far as possible. The only question to consider is whether the State is not giving away more than it should to private interests in connection with this matter. The Bill definitely deals with the small man. What the Minister and the Government have in mind is that so far as the diggings are concerned they shall be the preserve of the small man who cannot find employment on the land or in industry or in other directions but who has the chance on these diggings of employment. The Bill shows that is definitely the intention. With the exception of the owner, who is entitled to prospect without a digger&#x2019;s licence anyone else who wants to prospect must have a digger&#x2019;s licence. The digger must work, and if he does not get a digger&#x2019;s licence he does not get the opportunity of working and prospecting. It seems to me reasonable that the principle should be laid down that only the person who is actually doing the work, or going to do the work, should have the right, and not someone who may be sitting in Cape Town, Johannesburg or Timbuctoo. The third very important principle in the Bill is the control of the output of diamonds in South Africa. I know that amongst many people there has been a feeling with regard to this policy that it may have the effect of helping the big man as against the small man, and I must say I share that feeling; but I think everyone in this House will recognize that unless the diamond industry in South Africa is to be maintained in such a position as to secure the fullest value to the State, there must be this right of controlling the output, otherwise, as has been shown by the Government Mining Engineer, by the Minister and by the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer), there is a danger that the value of these diamonds will fall to such an extent that it will involve the diamond industry, the alluvial diggers and the State in tremendous loss. After all, diamonds are not like any other commodity. I disagree with the hon. member for Kimberley when he talks of the intrinsic value of diamonds. I do recognize their intrinsic value when used for industrial purposes, but these form only a small proportion of the diamonds produced in South. Africa. The bulk are large-purchased by people who like to buy them for their womenfolk, and the principal market is in America. That being the case, and people to-day, not unlike savages in that respect, liking to bedeck themselves with all sorts of things, the value of diamonds are not intrinsic but depends on whether there is a scarcity value or not. If we produce more diamonds than the market is able to consume it will mean a drop in the prices and a loss to South Africa. Even though it might benefit the big diamond interests, it is necessary, in the interests of the State, to control the output. Firstly, this is to be done by the Minister deciding whether to call a conference to consider the question of the output&#x2014;and I hope that at such a conference the Minister will protect the interests of the diggers&#x2014;and secondly, it is done by allowing only the alluvial diggers to do the work at the alluvial diggings, and then there is the stopping of the undue subdivision of farms. I agree it is necessary and right that these steps should be taken, and I believe by doing that you will be able to keep up the prices and to secure more than we have been able to do during the last year or two, and to have money coming into South Africa to develop its assets. I do regret it, and I may be mistaken in that but perhaps the provisions laid down in the Diamond Control Act of 1925 have not been carried into effect as fully as they might have been, and it is probable that had they been carried out to the fullest extent, the Minister would not have had to legislate as he has to do to-day to control the output. He could have had a provision that the alluvial diggers should come under the provisions of the Diamond Control Act. The Minister was perfectly justified in what he said about the South African party. That party did not object to the Diamond Control Bill, their chief objection was that the control did not go far enough. They said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We want you to control the alluvial diggers.</block>

<p><span class="col_2793-2794" refersTo="page_0057"/>Now, in the present provisions before the House this is being done. I believe that if the Act of 1925 had been carried into effect to the fullest extent the probabilities are we would have been able to make South Africa the selling place for diamonds, and I think there might thus have been created facilities and the possibility of establishing what I think should be established in South Africa&#x2014;our own diamond-cutting industry. I do not object to the principle of this control of the output; but I put to the Minister that if you look at the figures in connection with the diamond industry, it will be found from the Government Mining Engineer&#x2019;s report for 1925, that as far as the diamond mines are concerned, they employed 2,600 Europeans and 13,676 natives and coloured, or about one European for every 5 natives and others, but as far as the alluvial diggings are concerned, 6,299 Europeans were employed and 22,856 natives and others, or the proportion was one European to 3.6 natives and others. I do make the suggestion that the Minister might make representations, and I hope strong representations, to the industry that in consideration of the protection it is now getting under this Bill, whereby by the limitation of the output they will be enabled to keep up the prices, the industry might do something to provide that, instead of employing one European to five natives and coloured people they should make it one to one&#x2014;alter the ratio to that&#x2014;and thus give an opportunity to thousands of white people to be working in the industry without harm to the industry, because after all, they get the money for the diamonds from America. The Minister is to be congratulated on having dealt, in this Bill, in a very clear manner with these important principles; firstly, consolidation; secondly, the rights of the small man, and thirdly, the control of the output. The Minister is to be congratulated on the fact that in a Bill consisting of 117 clauses the Opposition has found only two or three clauses which it has been able to criticize. The principal speaker on behalf of the Opposition has shown that in the main the Bill should be accepted and he has not strenuously criticized any of the clauses. Let me take the objections that have been raised against this measure. The first objection is to clause 20. which deals with the subdivision of farms. Whether these subdivisions were legal or not, the intention of those responsible for them was to secure a greater share of the diamonds at the expense of the alluvial diggers. They knew for some time that the Government&#x2019;s desire was that diamondiferous farms should not be subdivided. We have had retrospective legislation before&#x2014;even the Bill quoted by the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander) was retrospective in its provisions&#x2014;so that the principle has been accepted by Parliament, and it does not matter whether the retrospective effect of the legislation goes back a few days, weeks or months. You either repudiate the principle of retrospectively entirely or accent the position as laid down in the Bill. In 1919 the S.A.P. Government in its Customs Tariff Act made the duty on spirits retrospective for a number of months and this applied not only to spirits in bond but in open stocks. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) objected very strenuously to that proposal, but the South African party Government passed the Bill. Again, we have the case of the Wine and Spirits Control Act of 1924 which was retrospective. That principle was again accepted by the S.A. party. It is wrong and unreasonable, therefore, for that party to take up the attitude they are doing unless their object is simply to create prejudice against the Government. Then objections have been raised to clause 73 which deals with syndicates, but if you accept the principle that the alluvial diggings are not to be the happy hunting-ground of speculators but that the small man should have an opportunity, it is only right that something should be done to prevent syndicates taking advantage of the position. The Government is perfectly justified in taking up the line it has. Hon. members are knocking at the door which is half open as the Minister has intimated his willingness to consider amendments. The fear has been expressed that the small diggers will be prejudiced because they will not be able to form syndicates. That is not really so, for in section 63 it is shown by implication that the holders of diggers&#x2019; certificates will be able to form partnerships for working their claims, The people excluded are those who may be in a prosperous position or others such as civil servants who are engaged in regular occupations but who desire to invest money in the diamond diggings and make profit on the work of others.</p>

<p>Suppose a digger has no money at all with which to start?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>Very often a man starts a business with nothing at all, but the hon. member advances him goods on trust. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) does not become a partner with them, he just supports them, that is the position. The main objection was to clause 2, that is, farms that had the Free State title, and objections were raised by the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter), for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitzi and the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson). I do not propose to pay attention to the ignorant impertinences of the hon. member for Griqualand. We are accustomed to them, and no decent member in the House would so insult me and the member for Griqualand cannot do so. But there. I look upon him more with pity than with anger because his insults are probably due to the manners which he has acquired from the Griquas in whose midst he has lived for many years, but perhaps it is not fair to say that as to do so may be an insult to the Griquas. I will deal with the criticism of the hon. member for Gardens, whose arguments are always worth replying to. What actually is the position? A certain number of farms have titles which originally were in the Free State, and now are <span class="col_2795-2796" refersTo="page_0058"/>outside the Free State, and which are affected by the provisions of this Bill. If they had remained in the Free State they would not have had the rights at all, because Lord Milner in 1904, by means of the Precious Stones Ordinance, took away those rights. He was not a socialist, but he did exactly what the present Minister is doing. If it was right to do it to other farms in the Free State by Lord Milner, it is right for the present Minister to do the same, so that there shall not be individual farms enjoying rights which the rest of the farming community have not got. Then there is the further fact that if these individual farms contain precious stones, it is imperative in the interests of the limitation of output that the Minister should provide for them as he does in section 2. If they do not contain precious stones they lose nothing and if they do and are left outside the scope of the Diamond Control Act and this Bill, and if by any chance to-morrow, next month or next year, a large find of diamonds was discovered by any one of them, the Minister would have to come again to the House and start legislating for the control of these farms. It is therefore imperative in the interests of the industry, to do what the Minister is doing by Clause 2, and that is why I think that the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) did not stress the point too much. It is imperative that all the farms should be placed on the same level. If these farms are not diamondiferous they are not losing anything, if they are diamondiferous, and belong to De Beers Company, then De Beers have been amply compensated by having had diamonds on their own property which they held up in order to keep up the price of diamonds, and thus remunerated themselves in respect of these farms. The only other objection is that which the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) referred to as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">statutory robbery.</block>

<p>The principle is already laid down by Kruger, Lord Milner and the Natal Government, that precious stones belong to the State, and it is not altogether reasonable to suggest that a principle already enunciated throughout the Union should not be applied to individuals who, by accident, have been excluded. It is not right, either, to come forward and say the Government has been guilty of statutory robbery. The moment you accept the principle of Government you begin to invade the rights of the people, in the first place, by imposing taxation. You do it when you are dealing with scab; you lay down the principle by which Government officials can come along and kill animals suffering from disease; you can destroy property; you have the right to demolish slums in the interests of the community. Governments without the socialistic influence have been forced into the position of passing laws which invade the rights of individuals and property owners. As a result of these invasions there is the peculiar fact that in South Africa in 1913 we had 211,533 convictions, and in 1924, 369,535 convictions not because the people have become more criminal, but because during the 11 years the S.A.P. Government were in power, they had passed Jaws invading the rights of individuals. I want to make one reference to this question of statutory robbery, and to draw the attention of S.A.P. members in this House to a book by John H. Harris, entitled &#x201C;Slavery or Sacred Trust.&#x201D; The S.A.P. have been held up for years as the custodians of native rights.</p>

<p>I am dealing with the objection of the criticism that has been levelled by the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter) against Clause 2 of the Bill, and I am showing the invalidity of that criticism in the light of their own attitude. On page 72 of his book Mr. Harris says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From that summer day in 1486 when Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cape and landed at Algoa Bay, until the rise of the Botha Government, namely, for over four centuries, the native tribes of Africa south of the Limpopo river have never been certain that the lands they occupied would be regarded as their inalienable possession; every reason, every excuse, every species of chicanery and fraud has been practised in order to dispossess these people of the lands they had every right to regard as their own.</block>

<p>These are the people who talk about statutory robbery while they themselves are responsible for a policy of that kind.

<p>Yet hon. members on that side are heard today talking about &#x201C;statutory robbery&#x201D; on the part of the present Government. I need only remind them of certain legislation before this House. We have the case of the Medical and Dental Bill where personal rights are being taken away with the support of the South African party. The South African party have been urging the Government to take away the personal rights, the right to make a living, of dental mechanics and others. They have no objection to invading the rights of others, they have no objection to taking away the means of livelihood of people, so long as you do not interfere with vested interests which secure to their possessors the power of exploitation.

<speech by="#fick">

<from>&#x2020;*The Rev. Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FICK</person>:</from>

<p>In this Bill we have made an honest and earnest attempt to regulate matters in connection with the alluvial diggings. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) has alleged that we have to do here with a piece of hasty legislation, but the hon. member forgets that there has recently come about such a development in the western Transvaal, and such complications have arisen in connection with alluvial diggings, that legislation can no longer be delayed. It went so far that last year the Minister had to warn the people against the unfair division of farms, and had at the same time to tell the people concerned that legislation would be introduced to declare that subdivision illegal. The matter became so serious that the diggers actually took the law into their own hands. At Grasfontein there almost was great trouble. As for the digging population, there has certainly nowhere else in the world been a more orderly body of people than with us. Compared with the history of American or Australian diggings in the past we come off very favourably. Recently at a congress I met a person who has experience of diggings in other parts of the world, America, Australia, etc., and he told me that he had never yet seen such good order as on our diggings. But we must take care. When quiet people become troublesome things are dangerous. We must take care that the diggers do not become unruly. We have had something of that at Grasfontein. We must meet the diggers as much as possible. The great force of the Bill consists in its protecting the alluvial diggings. The alluvial digger is being well protected, and rightly so. If the alluvial diggings had not existed in this country in the past there would have been no Kimberley, no Premier Mine, and no Jagersfontein. Alluvial diggers opened up the rich diamond sources of the country, and it is the ordinary prospector who opened up the rich gold areas in the Transvaal. And what have the voortrekkers had up to the present of the country&#x2019;s riches? How much have they got? It is high time that not only the State, but the ordinary digger should have more of the treasures of the country. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) said that we were by this Bill going to create a political machine on the alluvial diggings. I would rather a political machine under the control of the diggers than a political machine controlled by the big mining magnates. We have had more than enough in this country of that kind of machine. So much so that we need not fear that by this legislation political machinery will be created on the diggings. If the diggings did not exist in the country we should be met with a serious state of unemployment. The late Administrator of the Transvaal said to me one day that it was God&#x2019;s Providence that there were alluvial diggings, because where would we be with regard to unemployment if they did not exist. The poor man must get more. It is an important factor in the solution of our poor white question. The most important factors in the solution of the poor white question are the mining industry and the factories. If we did not have them we could continue with settlements, but we would never succeed on those lines. Agriculture has indeed done a great deal and is still doing much, but does not have the same opportunity in South Africa as other industries. Therefore the time has certainly come that our diggers should get their full rightful share. As the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. P. C. de Villiers) said the diggers on the whole are satisfied with the Bill. It is of course not conclusive, and I take it that the Minister himself thinks that we have not yet done enough. It is, however, the first serious attempt at solving the question and of creating better conditions in the country. We do not get enlightenment from other countries. We have conditions here in the matter of alluvial <span class="col_2799-2800" refersTo="page_0060"/>diggings which no other country has ever had be must find our own way, and it will certainly be necessary to alter and amplify the Bill now before the House in the future. As for the Bill we shall hear much about owners&#x2019; rights. They are not touched at all. I think the Minister is acting wisely in not tackling too much at once, except that we shall still hear a great deal about the number of labourers per digger. I do not know if it is possible to give the Minister discretion to permit the employment of more labourers in cases where it is necessary.</p>

<speech by="#fick">

<from>&#x2020;*The Rev. Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FICK</person>:</from>

<p>We shall hear a great deal about owners&#x2019; rights because we are a long way yet from the end of the diggings. I expect that in the western Transvaal we shall yet discover one of the greatest diamond mines which the country has ever had. The owners want more rights; the Government gets more rights in the Bill and the digger can be given more. The owners will ask for additional rights. As regards the forming of syndicates, I must say that the fact is that the poor man gets a claim but is too poor to work it. He has to borrow money. The digger borrows money on the security of the richness of his claim. How does he know, however, how rich it is? The hon. member for Delarey (Mr. van Hees) said that the Government should only throw open blocks of claims which were actually diamond-bearing, but how can the Government always know what is under the ground? It can only act according to the best of its information, but will never get at the truth unless the X-rays can be so developed that one could see into the bottom of the earth. Before one mines there it is only a guess. In order to get assistance a digger will have to give security, and all he has is to say that he will give a share of the proceeds. Undoubtedly there will be evasions of the law, and the door for evasion must not be left open. Persons will work on shares on a claim and no one will be able to find out that a small syndicate has been formed. I want an opening to be left in the Bill to allow the Minister to use his discretion when a syndicate is formed out of necessity, in order to allow a man to work his claims. The syndicate must be a matter of necessity and must not be permitted to speculate. The mining commissioner can easily find out what the object of the people who want to co-operate is.</p>

He will be able to distinguish what the intention of the syndicate is, and I think it would be worth while to try my suggestion. There are already sufficient limitations on the yield to-day. I cannot approve of Government officials being singled out as people who may not take part in the diggings. If the Minister wants to be consistent he must also prohibit them buying platinum and gold shares. The Minister said that the Government officials get information in the Government offices which they might abuse, but that applies only to officials in the Mines Department.</p>

<p>It applies to the others because the officials of the Mines Department can tell them. But just as well as they can give the information to Government officials the man who gets the information can pass it on to a private individual saying that he will give him good tips if he is prepared to divide the profits equally. The obtaining of information does not apply in the case of officials in the Departments of the Interior and Education, and yet all are included. If Government officials are excluded then I do not see why bank and office clerks who are in the same position as Government officials are not excluded as well. Why are not all people who are earning a living wage excluded? The Bill provides that the diggers committee can reject certain people, and it can be left to the diggers&#x2019; committee to say that Government officials and clerks earning an income will not be admitted. I, however, do not feel happy about the point that Government officials are singled out as people who may not be there. I shall be satisfied if persons with a fixed income including members of Parliament, are also excluded, but I only want to say that we should be more consistent. The diggers will be satisfied if the diamond production is limited on the diggings, because as we have heard the prices of diamonds will drop tremendously if the diamond fields of Namaqualand are exploited to the full I think the diggers understand quite well that if there is no control and no restriction of the output then the diamond market is insecure. I think we have here an honest and earnest attempt to improve things. The hon. member for Delarey dealt with the health conditions on the diggings, but I think that he has done the diggers some injustice in speaking about the great danger of an epidemic. There are many slums in the towns which will suffer heavily.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that Mr. Speaker stopped me when I wanted to speak about hospitals. That is a question we can discuss on a subsequent occasion. Steps have already been taken in connection with the appointment of health inspectors and more is going to be done. I think that considering everything on the diggings we ought to be astonished that the health conditions are as good there as they are. The diggers are, however, just people like ourselves and they are not blind to their own interests. The hon. member also spoke about education on the diggings. That is the great black spot on the diggings. Proper education must be supplied because the neglect of the education of the children is the serious matter with which we have to contend there. The Minister must be prepared for requests for grants on generous lines in future for the education of the children on the diggings. The hon. member for Delarey mentioned what the ordinary digger paid into the Treasury. I do not wish to say that a man should receive according to what he pays in, but it is right that the diggers should have proper educational facilities for their children. They must either be removed from those surroundings or have proper education provided. I wish the Minister all success with his Bill, and I hope that as he has put his hand to the plough he will not draw back but go on. He must, however, accept fair amendments, because there are many points in the Bill which need improvement.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) when he favours this House with speeches cannot resist the temptation of criticizing this side of the House. I think he should be more sure of his facts before he makes definite statements. In dealing with the retrospective clauses in this Bill he quoted as a precedent that the party on this side of the House favoured retrospective legislation. I may remind him that in 1919 this side of the House actually opposed the measure. The hon. member referred to an act of Lord Milner when the present Free State was the Orange River Colony. That was a wrong act of Lord Milner to deprive people of their property. You might just as well say that because A robs B then C is perfectly justified in robbing D.</p>

<p>Exactly. The Minister of Mines and Industries is committing a double wrong in my opinion. The hon. member also made some remark that taxes were imposed to deprive people of their property. It is not so. Ordinary Acts of Parliament, ordinary taxation, deprives people of part of their income, but retrospective legislation and taking away the rights of people on their farms is depriving them of their property and capital, which are two different things. I must remind the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) it is not very courageous to accuse a public man of misdeeds when he has been lying in his grave for several years.</p>

<p>But this is Sir Starr Jameson I am referring to and not Lord Milner. The hon. member for Delarey (Mr. van Hees) who, to his credit, has been advocating the case of the poor man, and has made a very eloquent appeal on their behalf, advised the Government to continue these alluvial diggings so that a large number of men could make a living and some a lot of money in the country. But I would remind the hon. member that the people working for the mining companies are also circulating money in the country. If diamonds are not controlled the people now circulating money in Lichtenburg will have no money to spend, because diamonds will fall so much in value that they will not be able to work at a profit. The figures are not as rosy as the hon. member pointed out. I have here the fifteenth yearly report of the Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa. I will quote part of one clause&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In a letter received from a simple old farmer, in reply to the bank&#x2019;s notice that distressed farmers should return to their farms, he says: &#x201C;Personally, I have never gone to the diggings, but stuck to my plough. &#x2026; I am proud to be able to say my standing crops are looking well, and most of the farmer diggers whom I know are returning with a motor car without money and they have not even paid for the motor car.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This Bill appears to me to be overloaded. I am sure it would have an easy passage if vested rights had not been assailed and no retrospective clauses put in. It is a great pity, but I hope that these matters will be put right so that the Government control will come into force as early as possible and reestablish confidence in the diamond trade. The Minister said that if Griqualand West had been a portion of the Free State the farms would not have retained mineral rights. Excuse me, if I say this is only conjecture. I am certain that if the Free State Raad had remained in existence it would not have deprived any of these farmers of their rights to the land. The Free State Raad never taxed the mines because they felt that to establish mines throughout the country would provide markets for the farms. &#x201C;If&#x201D; is a very small word as the Minister of Mines and Industries pointed out, but it may have a very big application. If my brother had been born at the same time as I, we would have been twins. The Minister said he was so satisfied with the Vaal River D.M. Company&#x2019;s conduct of operations that their title would remain intact, or words to that effect. Now I ask, what is wrong with De Beers? We treat our employees well, as we ought to do, and we have played <span class="col_2803-2804" refersTo="page_0062"/>a great part in the development of this country outside diamonds. We have built railways, and established that big dynamite factory and chemical works at Somerset West, and if hon. members knew Somerset West before that factory was established and compare it with what it is to-day they will see what that alone has done to develop the country. We have large ranches and we are pioneers of the fruit industry in the Western Province. Two millions of our reserve are in Union Stock and Treasury bills. We have never had any strikes in Kimberley, and we grant to working men pensions amounting to £60,000 a year to-day, and not one of those men has paid a sixpence towards a pension fund.</p>

<p>Who gets the best end of the stick out of it all in this House? The hon. member at that end getting £700 a year, or the messenger in the lobby? You can apply that in all quarters. Are the vested rights of persons to be dependent on the opinion or the satisfaction of the Minister regarding the manner in which a concern conducts its operations? If so, De Beers is a long way ahead of any industry in South Africa, and why you should differentiate between the De Beers Consolidated Mines and the Vaal River D.M. Company I do not know. If the Minister could show how they have conducted affairs better than the De Beers Company have, it would be surprising. Under this Bill rights which have cost the company an enormous amount of money are to be taken away. Twenty-seven years ago De Beers bought two farms for £1,600,000. They issued per cent. debentures on the security of the property, but the surface value is not worth more than £10,000. I quote this as an illustration to show how infinitesimal the surface rights of a farm may be as compared with the mineral rights. You are going to deprive people in some instances of the greater value of their property. I am very pleased to see that the Government&#x2019;s interest in the diamond industry is paramount, and the State derives in direct and indirect revenue more than the combined dividends paid by De Beers, the Premier, Jagersfontein and South-West. The Government is the largest shareholder of the whole diamond industry, so in bringing forward this Bill they are not altogether altruistic. The revenue derived by the State is over 20 per cent. of the value of the diamonds produced. I think I am not far wrong in saying that it is probably 40 per cent. of the total profits, and that does not include indirect taxation.</p>

<p>In Mr. Rhodes&#x2019; time in 1893 the diamond output was controlled and the diamonds were sold through one syndicate. Mr. Rhodes said to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The syndicate is the natural outcome of the amalgamation.</block>

<p>Clause 73 makes it illegal for corporate bodies or an association of individuals to be capable of holding a claim licence, and makes it retrospective to 1st July, 1926. This is retrospective legislation. Many syndicates have been formed since this date. Men of limited means have combined to purchase the necessary gear. They obeyed the existing laws, and they did not try to circumvent any Act of Parliament. They could not dream that a practice which had remained in existence for centuries would be made illegal. This clause, if passed, would, to my mind, be a gross act of injustice, and it should not be made applicable before the passing of this Bill. If I am not wearying the House with these figures, I should like to draw its attention to the alluvial production during the past four or five years. In 1922 the total production in the Union of the alluvial diggings was £1,359,730; in 1923, £1,656,270; in 1924, £2,156,340; and in 1925, £1,900,050, or making a total in the four years before the discovery of the Lichtenburg diggings of £7,072,390. The annual average production approximately was 1¾ million pounds. Let us turn to 1926 and see the effect of the Lichtenburg output. For six or seven months only the output for Lichtenburg was £3,047,590; Pretoria, £18,427; Ottoshoop, £2,639; Pietersburg, £2,543; Cape Province, £871,921; and sundry, £40,514, or a total of £3,983,634. Lichtenburg for the six or seven months during the latter part of 1926 produced diamonds to the value of £3,047,000, and for January and February of this year the alluvial diggings turned out stones to the value of £1,140,000, or an average of £570,000 a month. At this rate they would turn out diamonds to the value of £6,840,000 annually. Yet the total output of De Beers, the Premier and Jagersfontein this year will not, in my opinion, amount to more than about £5,000,000. The diamond market is in an uneasy condition. The three mines I have referred to will produce £1,705,000 less this year than the alluvial diggers, while the three mines will produce this year £1,185,000 less than they turned out during the preceding twelve months. This is a very serious state of affairs. Diamond stocks are accumulating in London, the whole trade throughout the world is holding aloof, and waiting to see the results of this Bill. If nothing is achieved this session, the damage will be done, and we will learn by bitter experience the consequence of allowing matters to drift, for it will be too late next session <span class="col_2805-2806" refersTo="page_0063"/>to prevent a crisis in which the State and all the producers will suffer alike, and the small man, as usual, will go to the wall. I take strong exception to the clause which dispossesses landowners of their mineral rights and vests them in the Crown. To my own knowledge, big prices have been paid for farms in which the mineral rights are reserved to the owner. Farms of little value agriculturally have changed hands at prices far in excess of normal rates where mineral rights are reserved to the owner. This Bill proposes to confiscate that right, to deprive a person of a valuable asset acquired by purchase, and to transfer to the Crown without any consideration whatever assets belonging to an innocent owner. Take the case of a man who bought a farm with mineral rights reserved and mortgaged the property. He wakes up one day to find his mineral rights have been filched from him by the Government. Naturally, he would feel that he had been robbed; then the mortgagee would probably call up the loan in consequence of the depreciated value of the security. In most instances the farm would not realize the sum advanced on it, and the innocent farmer would be ruined. I cannot be a party to such legislation. I consider that every member of this House represents the people, and I cannot allow, as far as my limited power permits, a measure to pass which will deprive people of their just rights. Before the Premier Mine was discovered De Beers produced 85 per cent. of the world&#x2019;s production of diamonds. Since then, other fields have been opened up, including South-West Africa, the Belgian Congo, Angola, Becella and other areas in Portuguese West Africa, and now we have the enormous output from Lichtenburg, the result being that De Beers&#x2019; output has been reduced to 23½ per cent. of to-day&#x2019;s total supply. Before the new discoveries were made, De Beers employed 4,000 white men and 20,000 natives. But to-day we are employing only 2,000 whites and 6,000 natives, a bigger proportion of whites to natives than employed by any other South African mining company. For several years, De Beers sold on the average £6,000,000 worth of diamonds annually, but now the sales are only £4,000,000 a year. We have made a great sacrifice to maintain prices and to give confidence to the trade. Kimberley has suffered in a decrease of population, a big fall in the value of property, serious shrinkage in trade, and farmers have lost the large market they formerly had. Kimberley, in fact, has changed from a large, thriving and prosperous city into a dwindling town, and may become an ordinary dorp if diamonds are allowed to be produced and sold ad lib. De Beers own five rich mines within a radius of about four miles. For a very long time we have worked only three of these mines on one shift of eight hours per day. We could produce five times the value of diamonds we are now doing by working all the mines with three shifts per day. De Beers have, up to now, borne the whole burden of limiting the Union&#x2019;s output of diamonds, but we cannot continue this policy and allow every other producer to ride on our backs. I verily believe that we have reached the irreducible minimum. I have a report by Mr. H. T. Barber, a gentleman who, I believe, occupied a very important position in the civil service. He was appointed auditor by the then Government and the producers to make a continuous audit of the accounts of the syndicate in London. He was highly recommended by Mr. Sheridan, the late Secretary for Finance. Mr. Barber represents the four mining companies. He audits the accounts of the syndicate, but he is paid by the De Beers, Premier, Jagersfontein and S.W.A. companies. He has audited the syndicate&#x2019;s accounts continuously for seven years, and during that time has gained an enormous experience of the trade. He is a very honourable and conscientious gentleman and has no interests in the diamond industry. He is not a politician, which is a good deal to be thankful for, and has no axe to grind. His report on the audit of the syndicate&#x2019;s accounts in London for the year ended December 31, 1926, is as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prices realized during the last half year were adversely affected by the enormous increase in the output of the alluvial diggers within the Union. If the production from that source continues in a similarly high rate for any length of time it must result in considerably reduced sales of conference goods at very much lower prices and the tendency will be for the control of the market to pass out of the syndicate&#x2019;s hands into those of a number of comparatively irresponsible merchants or dealers, each one operating solely for his own benefit and adopting a correspondingly narrow view of the requirements of the position as a whole both for the time being and for the future, with disastrous effects on the standard of prices. The benefit to the industry of the restriction of the output to the demand and the disposal of the production through one channel is enormous. This benefit is not restricted to the four conference producers, but is enjoyed by all other diamond producers also, although it would appear that the latter are slow to recognize the benefits conferred on them by the policy of restriction and that they will only appreciate the true position if that policy is weakened or rendered nugatory and a heavy fall in prices and a corresponding shock to confidence thereby takes place. It seems a pity that benefits such as those arising out of the policy referred to are only fully realized when they are lost and the damage is done, and that such lessons can apparently only be learned by hard experience. Moreover, it appears to be a matter of equity that those who share in common in the benefits arising from the restriction of output should also share pro rata to the benefits received, in the limitations necessary to carry the policy of restriction into effect. Until now the whole of the limitations have been borne by the conference producers; the <span class="col_2807-2808" refersTo="page_0064"/>new position developing in consequence of the great increase in the production by alluvial diggers within the Union appears to make it necessary that some more comprehensive arrangement for restriction of output should be considered if the stability of the industry is to be maintained. While non-conference producers may hold the view that the policy of restriction of output to demand is only adopted by the conference producers because it pays them to do so, and that therefore there is no obligation on them to assist in the furtherance of that policy by restricting their own output in a like degree, the new position which may arise may place it beyond the power of the conference producers acting alone to secure for all diamond producers the benefits which they have been able to secure in the past by adhering closely to their policy. Until now the bulk of the total output has been the property of producers who have been wise enough to restrict their production for their own and incidentally for the common good; if a new position develops in which the bulk of a largely increased output belongs to producers who recognize no such obligation, the result, will be that the industry will pass through a very unfortunate experience, new to this generation.</block>

<p>As soon as a farm is proclaimed thousands of all sorts and conditions of people swoop down like bees on the ground and mark out claims with the intention of getting rich quickly, by taking from the soil in the quickest possible time all the diamonds contained in the ground. The richest claims are worked at compound pressure with the intention of making money in the shortest possible time, regardless of the effect on other producing centres. If the majority of these diggers made a few hundreds of pounds only they would not give a thought to, or have a care for, the interests of others or the stability of the whole industry and its future. These people cannot be blamed, but it is the duty of the Government to preserve a great industry, and prevent it from being ruined by those wealth seekers, regardless of the danger to the Union in the loss of a permanent industry and large avenues of revenue. We do not want to crush the digger or to injure him in any way. The policy of the mines has been of the greatest benefit to the digging community, but we don&#x2019;t want them to annihilate us by producing diamonds at an enormous rate and throwing them on the market practically as quickly as they find them. De Beers Company cannot sit down quietly and further reduce their output to enable the diggers to obtain top prices. Self-preservation is the first law of nature. We are willing to come to terms in order to preserve the industry for our mutual benefit. I repeat that. We are willing to come to terms to preserve this industry for our mutual benefit. But if this cannot be done De Beers will not succumb. We have high grade mines, big financial reserves and resources, and great responsibilities to thousands of share-holders, a large number of whom are resident in the Union of South Africa. Speaking for myself, for I have not discussed this question with my colleagues, if we cannot come to terms I would not reduce De Beers&#x2019; output by one carat, but continue the present output and let nature take its course. A further retrenchment would spell ruin to the commercial community and would bring starvation and misery to Kimberley families and inhabitants, a state of affairs which would be painful to my colleagues and myself. There are hundreds of millions of pounds worth of diamonds still in the mine. If these were worked on the same principles as the alluvial diggings&#x2014;that is, get them as quickly as you can&#x2014;diamonds would be worth next to nothing. The collapse of the industry would react disastrously on the finances of the Union, and would dislocate the whole of its financial structure. It would bring about serious unemployment in Kimberley, Jagersfontein, Koffiefontein, the Premier Mine, and all over South-West Africa. Property would decrease in value, and trade would suffer an enormous setback, whilst farmers in those centres would not be able to make ends meet. The collapse of the industry would be a catastrophe of the first magnitude. In my opinion, this can be averted by devising a scheme to limit the output to the world&#x2019;s purchasing power. Until the discovery of Lichtenburg, the four big producers, by arrangement to which the Government was a party, supplied the trade with its requirements on a well-thought-out plan that worked automatically. That has all been upset by the enormous output of alluvial diamonds. The mines have now lost the control through the alluvial fields pumping diamonds onto the market recklessly and with indifference to the consequences, and if this continues any longer, there can only be one ending&#x2014;disaster to the whole industry. To prevent this river diggers must submit to having their output controlled the same as the mines. They do this in Belgian Congo, Angola, British Guiana, West Africa and other fields. It cannot be contended for a moment that the alluvial diggers shall be allowed to produce enormous quantities without let or hindrance and glut the market whilst all other producers control their output. It is to their own interest that we should limit the output of the diggers as much as of the big mining companies. By submitting to this, alluvial diggers will protect their own interests, because, if we allow them to produce and sell diamonds, they will produce to such an extent that enormous numbers of the diggers will have to leave the diggings and their industry would be ruined. [Time limit extended.] I have lived in Kimberley from 1871 through all its trials and vicissitudes when the diamonds and the mines were owned by individuals and small syndicates, and diamonds then realized one-fifth of the present prices. I must say the working costs were lower in those days, because it was mainly surface working, while, to-day, they are produced from 3,600 feet underground The amalgamation and the selling through one channel, the combination of all mining companies and the fixing of the quota of diamonds <span class="col_2809-2810" refersTo="page_0065"/>supplied by each brought about an enormous increase in prices and gave the utmost confidence to the trade all over the world. I say without hesitation, and in the responsible position I hold, that if this House fails to limit the output of alluvial diamonds this session, there will be a panic in the trade. Dealers will not only not hold, but will tumble over each other to get rid of their stocks, the majority of them having been bought on credit by facilities given by Continental banks, whose system is quite different to ours, and the English method of banking. The damage will be done and may not be repaired for a decade or two as in the case of the ostrich feather industry, which, as yet, has shown no signs of recovery. We know Oudtshoorn is on its last legs through overproduction. As an example, I might tell you that when ostrich feathers were being produced to the world&#x2019;s requirements they were realizing £40 per lb. To-day they are not realizing more than £2 per lb. I will put all my cards on the table, despite the effect my remarks might have on the diamond market, and on the share market, and I tell the House emphatically that if the value of diamonds falls, not to one-fifth, but to one-half, of the present value, the Premier Company, the Jagersfontein Company, South-West Africa and Koffiefontein must shut down. The only concern that can keep working on a limited scale is De Beers, with its high-grade mines, but De Beers would receive a nasty knock, but they would survive. There are sufficient diamonds in the Union unearthed to last beyond the present century. I estimate De Beers can produce for another hundred years, and this industry will be a continual source of wealth, and contribute largely to the prosperity of the Union, but if allowed to take its own course, unchecked and uncontrolled, it will run on the rocks and become a complete wreck, a signpost to passers-by of the loss of an enormous asset which, by ordinary foresight, could have been preserved. If we do not control we shall be like the spendthrift who dissipates great wealth in the shortest time. If we do control we shall retain our wealth for many years in the interests in the long run of the workers and diggers, and preserve for the State a great industry and a mighty asset.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOLL</person>:</from>

<p>I am one of the members of the House who represent exclusively persons familiar with this Bill. Sixty per cent. of my electors are diggers, and the others are landowners who are affected by this Bill. I think, therefore, that I can speak with more authority on this Bill than many other members of the House. I made a special point of ascertaining the views both of the landowners and the diggers in my constituency, and the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. P. C. de Villiers) and I went to the trouble of calling the foremost landowners in the Transvaal together during the recess in order to get their views on the Bill. After that, we met the diggers and obtained their views in connection with the Bill. In listening to the speeches of hon. members it seems their first point is the question of the protection of the rights of landowners, and from the speeches one would say that the Minister is engaged in taking away all the rights landowners have possessed in the past. The great point is that the Bill does not allow the cutting up of the ground in the future as it has been done in the past by syndicates. Under the old law 200 owners&#x2019; claims and 50 discoverers&#x2019; claims were granted to landowners, and, in all the history of the Transvaal, I never heard of any farmer and ordinary landowner who complained that those rights were not adequate. The landowners have always been satisfied. For the last ten years I have been representing diggers&#x2019; constituencies, and never has an owner, who had diamonds on his land, complained to me that he was dissatisfied with the rights he had. And, further, not one of them has ever attempted to cut up his land in order to obtain more rights under the existing laws in that way. The diggers have proceeded with their work, and there has never been any question of over-production. Now, suddenly, rich discoveries have been made in Lichtenburg, and that has caused the trouble. Speculators have gathered everywhere and have bought up farms on which they thought there might be diamonds, and for the first time in the history of the Transvaal a gross speculation has taken place in land which should really go to the diggers. I just want to inform the House what really happened on the diggings. It seems to me the main point on which hon. members have attempted to attack the Minister&#x2014;for there has not been any well-founded attack as yet&#x2014;is that the provision with regard to the subdivision of farms has been made of retrospective effect. The other points of criticism are only minor matters. Now I want to go into the necessity for this section in the Bill. I grant that those who have not been to the diggings and seen what is needed there may say that retrospective laws are always dangerous. I grant that it is not healthy, but if hon. members know what has taken place on the diggings it will become clear to them that if the Minister had not inserted this provision the Bill would be meaningless, and it would be a shame for the Government to sit still and regard what is taking place without putting a stop to it, and without making the provision of retrospective effect. I want to mention a few instances. I was at Grasfontein and Welverdiend in person. In the case of Grasfontein the retrospective provision comes too late, because the farm has already been proclaimed. In accordance with the spirit of the existing law the owners of Grasfontein had to peg off 200 owners&#x2019; and 50 discoverers&#x2019; claims at any spot they chose. That then would have given the poor digger and even the farmers in the vicinity, and in the whole of the Transvaal (the public in general) an opportunity of acquiring the remainder of the land. It would not have been so scandalous had the owners divided the land into two or three sections, but they divided it into strips. In this instance the farm has been divided into fifty portions, and the result is that only three strips of diamond-bearing gravel have been pegged off and now one sees that the diggers are working all round the syndicate, and only getting a stray little <span class="col_2811-2812" refersTo="page_0066"/>diamond now and then. Their wives and children die of distress, and yet, in between the claims of the ordinary diggers, the syndicate recovers wealth by the handful and flourishes in luxury. No one&#x2014;apart from political party &#x2014;can see this without wishing that it should be discontinued. Not one member in the House will have the courage to rise in his place and contend that he is against the clause in the Bill which provides that sub-division shall not be allowed in the future. All are agreed that this must happen in the future for the reason that everyone acknowledges that what happens now is not right, and contrary to the spirit of the old law. Hon. members say, concerning the provision for retrospective effect, that in principle they are opposed to such a provision being incorporated in the Bill because it restricts owners&#x2019; rights. If the provision is not made retrospective in effect then the whole Bill would signify nothing. It must be borne in mind that the diamond-bearing farms have already been taken up and subdivided by companies. Those who speak of the landowners in the country districts I may inform that there is not one such landowner who has already cut up his land. They would, therefore, not be affected by the provision, but only the companies. It is nonsense to say that members desire to protect the farmer-landowners because they are in favour of the provision. The sub-division of the farms in the manner it has taken place is not only unjust but scandalous. If we follow the map, we will come to the conclusion that it, amounts practically to robbery, and that our Government may not permit to take place. Those persons who have so wantonly evaded the law are not only prevented from doing so in the future, but are under the present Bill also punished for what they have done. Then much is heard also about the public who have bought shares offered by syndicates, and it is said that the retrospective effect of the law will not affect the syndicates, but the public. I have been all over the diggings where I have made thorough inquiries and, as a result, I am convinced that the public will not be affected by the retrospective provision, but that if the Minister withdrew the provision he would certainly touch the public I will show why. We find instances where a piece of land has been cut up into fifty small portions, and the companies have formed a company for every one of these fifty small portions, and for one of these small portions of land they have issued 500,000 shares of 5s. each, while the whole lot is, perhaps, not worth more than £100,000. What then happens is that the syndicate itself drives up the prices of the shares of the company&#x2014;we know how it is done&#x2014;and as soon as the shares are worth £1 the 500,000 shares are delivered to the public, and in a few weeks&#x2019; time they are worth nothing, because the ground has, in the meantime, been exhausted. The Minister may not allow the few syndicates to rob the diggers of their just due, nor that the public be so shamefully robbed in the manner described. These are in short the main points concerning the actions of the companies on the diggings. I held a meeting on the diggings in company with the member for Klerksdorp (Mr. C. P. de Villiers). There were about 2,000 people.</p>

<p>Yes; immediately after the meeting the syndicate went and spread the report that the meeting was a small one. I have already held many meetings, and I can assure the House that there were about three thousand people, consisting of members of the South African party, English-speaking people, and people of all parties, and no one raised any objection to the Bill, and especially to the clause. A special motion of confidence and of thanks to the Minister was adopted, because he had acted in such a manly way in reference to the provisions of this Bill, and, apart from party, the diggers expressed their satisfaction with the provisions of the Bill and promised full support. We also had meetings with landowners not syndicates, but farmers in the neighbourhood who own farms on which diamonds may any day be discovered, and they have caused the Minister to be informed that they stand behind him as one man. They have always been satisfied with 250 claims, and will in future be satisfied with that, and the retrospective effect of the provisions is not going to affect them, while they will have the opportunity of obtaining a piece of land for digging also. The western Transvaal supports the Minister to a man, the diggers as well as the landowners. I do not wish to abuse my right of speaking in the House, but I just want to say that it is my experience, and the hon. member for Klerksdorp will agree with me, that every possible effort is made by the syndicates to furnish wrong information to members of this House. Does the House know that even the press in the Transvaal does not want to accept an advertisement giving notice of a meeting, if the assurance is not first given that the speakers are going to support the syndicates.</p>

<p>I did not notice him. The officials are another consideration, and I cannot do otherwise, after my experience on the diggings, than congratulate the Minister on his <span class="col_2813-2814" refersTo="page_0067"/>proposals in this regard. Officials of the State ought to be above suspicion, and the public service cannot remain pure if public servants are allowed to have interests in the diggings, but I think that it is unhealthy also if members of Parliament are allowed to hold shares or to be interested in the diggings, because that might influence their attitude in this House. Another&#x2019; point is the limitation of the output. We all felt in agreement with the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) when he said that something should be done to control the output, but I cannot altogether agree with his proposals. This Bill is going to have the desired effect. It is said that in 1926 the alluvial diggings produced £3,000,000, but I can assure the House that the diggers did not produce one-third of that. It was the big syndicates and companies. There are syndicates working on just as large a scale as the Premier Mine and De Beers. They have hundreds of natives in service and large machinery, and they are the cause of the overproduction. The Minister&#x2019;s Bill will protect the individual digger and break up the syndicates. We must either accept or reject the principle proposed by the Minister. Some members say that the alluvial diggings should be left to the individual digger. I am in agreement with that, but if the Minister leaves open the possibility of exporting diamonds then the syndicates will still get too much of an opportunity. There is no such thing as existing rights. The existing rights were obtained by the companies against the meaning and spirit of the laws, and we should accept the principle that the diggings are for the individual person, and that the syndicates or companies cannot come and uproot individual diggers. Other points of minor importance we can deal with in committee. There is, e.g., the provision with regard to the number of natives a digger may use. Most diggers will be satisfied with ten natives, but I feel that we should not always leave the diggers poor whites, and if he is on a rich spot the man must have an opportunity of doing something there in order to be able to get away from the diggings. Ten men are too few to run a machine; the diggers have the utmost confidence in the Minister in this connection. In conclusion, I still want to say that there is certainly not one member in the House, who can claim to represent the people, who will approve of the cutting up of the farms and the work of the speculators, while the poor diggers with their wives and children are starving, and are working next to the syndicates and cannot exist. If the Minister&#x2019;s Bill is passed there will, perhaps, be 5,000 poor whites who will be saved from their position, and will get another opportunity in life. I want to congratulate the Minister again, and I do that also in the name of the diggers and landowners of the Transvaal, that he was manly enough to make the Bill so drastic and to introduce it. If hon. members would only go and have a look at the conditions actually existing on the diggings, and what goes on there, they would all support the Bill without hesitation. Other members have posed as representatives of the diggers and disapproved of the course followed by the Minister. I am prepared to meet any of the hon. members at a meeting of diggers and if the diggers are not on my side, I shall be prepared to surrender my seat in the House.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I was not here during the whole debate, and that I did not personally hear the speech of the Minister of Mines and Industries, but I can give the House the assurance that I have, from the newspapers, carefully gone into the speeches delivered here, and I think that I know practically every word spoken. The Minister has a most difficult subject in his hands, and we cannot treat it lightly. I have listened to the speech of the hon. member for Klerksdorp (Mr. P. C. de Villiers), the great representative of the diggers, as he calls himself, and I do not wish to refer to what may hurt other people, but I think that in the cutting up of farms, things somewhat contrary to the spirit of existing legislation have been done. I say, however, with that, that there is a Supreme Court, and that owners will not be so satisfied if their rights are taken away, rights which they have obtained lawfully. I go so far as to accuse the Minister of Mines that he is the cause of the cutting up of farms, because he did not push the Bill drawn up last year through the House. In that there were provisions having reference to the proportion of owners&#x2019; claims, and if the Bill had been passed we would not have had this difficulty to-day.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>To the members who so warmly congratulated the Minister, I say that the Minister has missed the object of the diamond law if he does not accept the principle of granting claims to the owners on the percentage basis. I do not say how many claims should be given to each owner, but I think that the number given in last year&#x2019;s Bill was too low. However, it is the principle that must be accepted in order to put an end to subdivision. If the percentage basis is introduced, then the owners can cut up their farms as they wish, and still the object of the Bill will have been achieved. This is the first time in my life that I have heard that the rights of landowners have been infringed. If we accept the principle that that can happen, then South Africa would be a dangerous country to live in. Even if the subdivision in the past has been against the spirit of the law, at all events it was quite legal, and the provision ought not, therefore, to be made of retrospective effect. If that were to happen, then I am sorry for the country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Roux), I suppose, is an authority on the Bill because he is a lawyer. <span class="col_2815-2816" refersTo="page_0068"/>I do not believe, however, that the people will get him to plead their cause. However, he will want law and justice to carry the day. I am sorry that the difficulty has arisen, but we must endeavour to put ail end to this for the future. I would very much like an explanation from the Minister why the owners in one province get more owners&#x2019; claims than in other provinces. In the Transvaal it is 200; in the Free State 400; and in the Cape Province 17 or 40. I want to ask the hon. members in the Cape whether they are satisfied that the rights of landowners in the Cape are inferior to those in the other provinces. The Minister will say that they have the same rights according to their transfer deeds, but it must not be forgotten that to the earlier owners of Crown land in the Transvaal and to the surface owners of occupation farms 100 claims were granted. I am glad that that has happened, and would like to see it made 200. In the Cape owners ought to get more claims also because their surface rights have been broken up. For the very reason that the Minister has granted a hundred claims to those in the Transvaal who did not have sub-surface rights, he should also consider the Cape owners.</p>

<p>Not in the same proportion. I cannot see why owners in the Cape should be worse off than owners in the other provinces. We should not only talk of Lichtenburg and of western Transvaal, but we should also look to the future. We do not know where diamonds may still be found. The Minister had to chase off to Namaqualand in order to find out how many diamonds are being extracted there, and has taken the law into his own hands and put a stop to prospecting. Why has that not been done in Lichtenburg, and why were the people not warned that they were acting contrary to the spirit of the law? Why did the Minister not put the Bill on the Table of the House on the first day of the session? Why is that done now when the session is drawing to a close and members are already tired? The Minister said that there was reconsideration on account of new matters arising, and I agree with that, but nothing new has come to light with regard to the subdivision of farms since the commencement of the session. Many of the rights of owners are being taken away, because now an owner may not work with more than five prospectors. If I expect to find diamonds on my farm, I should not want to work with only five men. Where have you heard of a civilized country with a Bill of this sort? Every owner of land will try, nevertheless, to choose the best spots for owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; claims, but now it is said that only a certain number of people may work, and then the Minister has the right to put a stop to prospecting at any time. The hon. members for Klerksdorp (Mr. P. C. de Villiers) and for Christiana (Mr. Moil) want to make out that they went about during the recess consulting the diggers. I was also on the diggings during the recess, and although I did not go so specially to consult the diggers, I met many of them and discussed the Precious Stones Bill with them. They know the Bill particularly well, and, according to the conversations I had, they do not want to take other people&#x2019;s property away from them. They are people who work hard, and I did not find one who wanted the owners to be deprived of their rights. They want the subdivision of farms to be stopped in future. The hon. members say also that they consulted the landowners of Klerksdorp and Christiana, but I should very much like to know how many of them were at that meeting, and where it was held. The hon. member said that the newspapers did not want to take up their advertisements. I was not present at the meeting at Grasfontein, but one of my sons told me that there were about 40 or 50 persons present, but that they did not actually take much notice. The people on the diggings do not concern themselves with politics, because in the evenings they are tired. I do not believe much in the representative nature of the meeting, and would warn the Minister to give careful consideration to the resolutions produced by the hon. members. Let us act squarely, and endeavour to put the Bill through. I am only sorry that it was not introduced earlier, and at the beginning of the session I asked the Minister a question in that regard. The Minister will agree that it is a very difficult matter, and it is a pity that it cannot be referred to a select committee. So many amendments will be proposed, that I do not know when the Minister will get the matter settled by the House. The principle in the Bill of infringing the ownership of people who have invested money in the land will cause difficulty. I do not think that a Bill should be passed by a civilized country which takes away rights by means of a provision of retrospective effect. It will be a bolshevistic measure such as the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) would support, but I do not think the Minister is the sort of man to rob people of their rights. The Minister wants the digger&#x2014;we hear now of another title, &#x201C;natural&#x201D; digger&#x2014;to be limited to ten natives. Now that my children are working on the diggings&#x2014;</p>

My children and I had a little luck there, and are making our money in an honest way, and I am not at all ashamed of it. What does the hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. du Toit) say with regard to the fact that owners in the Cape get fewer claims than those in other provinces? Discoveries are being made here now, too, and we have already heard of <span class="col_2817-2818" refersTo="page_0069"/>Namaqualand. The hon. member for Christiana said that he could give the House the assurance that it is the syndicates and companies who hold the land. Are they then a different kind of people? Did they steal the land? No, they bought it honestly from the original owners, and paid for it. It is a bolshevistic measure which takes away the rights of landowners, and if that is done the property of the owners becomes worthless. After all, they are people who have invested money in the land. The prosperity South Africa has enjoyed is attributable to the mining industry, and the Minister of Finance made it clear in his budget speech what the mining industry and the diggings have done for the country.</p>

We will fight clause after clause in order to get what we want. The people of South Africa do not want the principle of depriving people of their ownership to be accepted. I ask the Minister to say honestly whether he thinks that the cutting up of farms will be prevented by the course he wishes to follow in connection with the granting of ownership claims. And where did you ever hear of a principle of providing that a digger may only use ten kaffirs for his claim? Has the Minister ever stood next to the machines?

<p>Not a bit of it and I can give members the assurance that the Bill does not affect my interests in the least, by its provisions. But that principle that diggers may not assist each other really borders on being childish. Some poor people cannot manage alone. If people like my children disappear from the diggings, 10 to 15 other poor whites who never had a chance but have now been saved from unemployment will go with them. Thousands of people find work there, and business in general is extensive as a result of the diggings. I am not as afraid as the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) that there will be too many diamonds. The places which are rich in diamonds are scarce and small, but I agree with the Minister that if the production could be controlled in order to keep up the prices, it would be a good thing. We are in favour of that, and the hon. member for Kimberley has put our attitude very plainly. We do not wish to kill the diggers, but we want the rights of landowners to be protected. It is a large industry, and may still spread considerably, and the rights of the landowners cannot be <span class="col_2819-2820" refersTo="page_0070"/>taken away so lightly.

<p>As a result of the circumstances and the developments in the last few years on the alluvial diggings and with a view to future development, everyone who has for years taken an interest in this industry expected a comprehensive Bill. Some people have noticed the development of the industry with sorrow, others with joy. Some have noticed signs of prosperity, others of retrogression. More money has come into circulation and the neighbourhood has, to a certain extent, benefited thereby, while in other respects the seeds of destruction have been sown. It is not necessary to go into details in this connection. I think that in any case none of us expected such a fair all-embracing Bill as that now before us. The Bill contains many new principles, or principles at any rate which are new in practice, and so comprehensive a Bill with so many new principles has for a long time not been before the House. Therefore, the. Minister should have expected, and I certainly expected that there would be, considerable difference of opinion in connection with the Bill. The question merely was in what direction the difficulties would lie, and I think those of us who know our friends in the Opposition were not far out as to the direction which their objections would take. The basic principles of the Bill are of importance, not only to the industry, not only from an economic point of view, but also with regard to the moral life and the health of a large portion of our population. One of the great problems in the past always was mineral rights, and I would like to admit that I cannot quite agree with the policy the Minister is laying down. I think he is going too far in establishing a rule about the ownership of minerals in South Africa, because there are different principles in this connection in different parts, and I think that the prescription law with regard to property ought to be borne in mind. But I just want to point out that the Minister deserves the thanks of the country for this comprehensive Bill. A second important point is the provision with regard to the permit to dig, viz., who can be permitted and who cannot. A third important point is the State&#x2019;s share. It was always agreed that the State up to a certain extent was entitled to a share in the minerals of the country or the proceeds thereof. How far those provisions express the views of the members of this House we have yet to see. The State should have the right to the wealth under the soil, but I want to ask the question whether we should not go further and fix what the proceeds from this source should be used for. I know that this does not come in here, but it is an important point. Then the control of the production and marketing is a very important point, as also the regulation of the surface lights of owners, and of discoverers&#x2019; and diggers&#x2019; rights. Finally there is the social position which has also been touched upon. The Bill is most comprehensive and the Minister deserves the thanks of the House for his courageous step, even if we do not all see eye to eye with him on all points. The Bill goes a little far in certain respects. It goes without saying that the Bill goes further than the one of 1923 on account of the new developments in recent years, and therefore I do not wish to draw an unfair comparison between the 1923 Bill and the 1927 one, but in any case this Bill deals in a drastic way with some questions. I want, however, to point out to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) that it was also provided in the 1923 Bill that the Crown should have the right to mine and the disposition over the minerals. There the former Government also appropriated the rights. In this Bill where the same thing is done there is therefore no new principle. We cannot get away from the fact that minerals belong to the State. It is not property which one or a group of citizens ought to possess, but it belongs to the State as a whole, and the only question is in what way the minerals can be mined and be beneficially employed in advancing the welfare of the citizens in general. We must admit that the Bill goes tremendously far in relation to the share of the State. On the other hand I agree to a great extent with the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) that when the State is assuming rights we must be careful about the methods and what is meant to be affected thereby. This can be done in a moderate but also in an immoderate way, and according to the policy which is followed the question must be put whether so far as it does not conflict with the highest interests, the rights of the individual or of society in general are being interfered with? In this debate which embraces so many matters of importance to the people, we expected that there would be less grouping of parties, but we have been much disappointed. Party groups are being formed on the lines of protecting certain interests. This is not a new and unexpected division, but yet we are disappointed seeing we are dealing with a very important problem to the people. The hon. members for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) and Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) talk of the vested rights of landowners. Are landowners, however, the only people who have vested rights? <span class="col_2821-2822" refersTo="page_0071"/>When we talk of the landowners as the only people who have vested rights we are exaggerating and missing the actual point. We heard from the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) that it is a bolshevic measure to attack the vested rights of landowners, and I prophesy that more than one speaker opposite will express the same thought in order to make it appear so repulsive to the people. There are other rights beside those of the landowners which have just as much right to protection, although the people possess less worldly goods and have less money in the bank. The second argument of the Opposition is the retrospective prohibition about the division of farms. Before I saw the Bill I thought that the provision with regard to subdivision should be made retrospective, and therefore I have no objection to it now. I am, however, glad that the Bill provides for a certain amount of discretion being left to the Minister. I admit there may be cases where an absolute cancelling of the subdivision may operate unfairly and unjustly, and therefore I welcome the provision giving the Minister discretion. I assume that the Minister will not be so unwise as to draw a general rule and deal with all the cases according to it, because I have sufficient confidence in the Minister and in his advisers that the provision will be applied practically, economically and justly. The third argument which came mainly from the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) is in connection with the weeding out of companies on the diggings. This, of course, is another argument which we expected from the Opposition, because they are intimately concerned with looking after the interests of their supporters. His representation, however, is not the whole truth, because Clause 63 provides that people can actually work in partnership on the diggings. All that is necessary is that they must have diggers&#x2019; licences. The hon. members for Johannesburg (North) and Beaconsfield (Sir David Harris) can also go and work there if they will pull off their coats.</p>

<p>If, however, they want to sit in the clubs then the position is different. We approve of the policy of the Government. If natural persons want to co-operate, well and good, and Clause 63 is quite clear on the point. The Bill also provides in Clause 73 for a special case. That is precisely a point with which I have great sympathy, viz., the exclusion of public servants from the diggings. As citizens they can maintain their rights, but I do not think it is right that a man who has an adequate income and a fixed appointment and is assured of a pension should compete in the uncertain industry which the diggers are carrying on. The intention, however, is not to cast a stigma on the public servants. It goes without saying that that is undesirable. I know of a case where an official was concerned in a digging and as an official of the Department of Justice he had to take certain decisions. The whole digging population was suspicious, because they knew that he was interested in the diggings and because they did not trust him. Therefore it is right that officials should not have a personal interest in the diggings. I have a further objection to the Bill as drawn. We have in the first place to do with a consolidating Bill. I have gone into it and noticed that no less than ten Acts are repealed to incorporate them under this Bill, but there are a number of shortcomings in the Bill. A Bill should only take account of provincial interests if they are irreconcilable with the country&#x2019;s interests. If they are reconcilable then we must not deal with provincial inequalities in consolidating legislation. Therefore I object to the inclusion of Clause 2 which wants to introduce a certain measure of uniformity and which will be explained to those concerned in the matter as the consolidating clause. Immediately thereafter, in Clause 13 and 14, the provincial legislation is again incorporated in the consolidating measure. I have the privilege of representing a large number of persons who are concerned in Clause 2, but I can say that I would have taken up the same attitude even if that were not the case. There are farmers in my constituency to-day who have free title issued by the old Free State Government in which there is no limitation as to mineral rights. That right has been maintained all these years but now the Minister is taking it away by Clause 2. The argument that it is a consolidating measure is not right, and it is no good saying that the intention is to bring about uniformity. We must in this case acknowledge the vested rights of the citizens. I do not wish to interpret the term &#x201C;vested rights&#x201D; as some hon. members have done, but it has to do here with a right which has been in existence for more than 100 years, and that is a good reason for further acknowledgment. The State must be careful about expropriating a right which has once been granted.</p>

<p>It was admitted that it was wrong, and one mistake does not justify a second. Moreover, we do not know how many farms are affected thereby. The Minister mentioned one figure and the horn member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) another. I am certain that they are both wrong. I have reliable information that 167 farms with the Free State title are affected in the matter, and no one can say how many farms in the northern parts of the Cape Province will be affected. There are many farms, and the argument that it is a trifle cannot be used. Moreover, I have doubts as to the advantages connected therewith. The State can, in any case, levy the export duty on the diamonds that are found and can retain control over the diggings. All the State cannot do is to exercise control over the granting of claims. <span class="col_2823-2824" refersTo="page_0072"/>In Clauses 13 and 19 the provisions are applied which are mentioned in Annexure 4. If there is an argument for uniformity then it is not to commence re-enacting the provincial legislation. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) was not right when he said that we made this difference to-day, because the difference is merely acknowledged in the existing law. I think, however, that it is wrong that we should render it permanent for the future. Annexure 4 allows a private landowner in the Transvaal to have 50 discoverers&#x2019; and 200 owners&#x2019; claims; in the Free State the figure is 600, and in the Cape only 17 plus 9, i.e., 26.</p>

<p>We must have uniformity. Borne principles have been suggested as to the manner in which the matter of owners&#x2019; claims should be regulated. The one is a percentage basis and the other is a provision like that annexure. I think the only sound basis is that the owner should get a number of claims proportionate to the number available on his ground. I think it is not right that a man should get 100 claims if his farm is 9,000 morgen in extent. He should have a number of claims according to the claims available on his farm.</p>

<p>I have no objection to the provision with regard to subdivision being made retrospective because the Minister can use his discretion and because it is in the interests of the citizens of the country. I will honestly admit that I have a telegram here from a tanners&#x2019; association in my constituency asking me to protect the vested interests of landowners. I have done so. I am prepared to stand up for the landowners so long as there is no conflict with the highest interests of the country, and I have so much confidence in the patriotism of my constituents that they also will bear in mind the interests of the State. Another great principle about which there is much difference of opinion is the limitation of the production. I have the honour to represent a large number of diggers, and I do not think there is a single rich digger amongst them. But with a view to the increasing production of diamonds and the limited use, it goes without saying that if the production is excessive, we shall not only lose a steady market&#x2014;not to speak of a rising market but that the market will drop, and there I agree with members opposite that if the market drops the strong man will not be the first to be ruined, but the poor digger. I am speaking for him when I say that I am convinced&#x2014;he may not approve of this&#x2014;that it is in his own interests that the production should be restricted and that a steady market should be retained in our country. The State is compelled to restrict the production. It is inevitable, but as there are to-day so many thousands who are dependent on alluvial diamonds and who can only make a living there, the State must be particularly careful in making the restriction not to go too far. It is a matter of life and death to the digger and his wife and children. We must not act lightly with reference to this restriction. There are a lot of further points about which there is a difference of opinion and others which will mean great improvement. In Clause 57 provision is made for a new composition of appeal boards, and as for my constituency, I do not know of one section in the old Act which caused more difficulties than the composition of appeal boards. I have discussed the matter with my constituents, and I think everyone is satisfied. Some preferred that a magistrate should be on the board, a man who usually can better decide upon the necessary procedure than persons who have less to do with litigation. I think that is a great improvement. As for social life on the diggings, the Minister deserves thanks for the institution of a certificated character. There are many of the diggers who are people of high standing, and who deserve respect just as much as anyone else, and the provisions of the Minister amount to this, that no persons of bad character, or who have lost their good name, can be put into the diggers&#x2019; community. Other difficulties are removed by the provisions of Clause 97. It is there laid down that more stores shall be permitted on the diggings. I remember a case where there was one business for at least 3,000 white diggers, not to speak of the natives. Now the business people get an opportunity of competing and preventing unfair prices being charged to the people. I wanted also to go into a few points which the hon. member for Delarey touched upon, but the hon. member for Potchefstroom (the Rev. Mr. Fick) has already done so. As to education on the diggings, hon. members who have difficulties in the matter should remember that under existing circumstances the provincial councils are responsible in the matter. The State provides funds for the provincial councils and pays a certain sum for every child, whether a digger&#x2019;s child or not. It is true that there were scandalous conditions. On one digging there was a school with five teachers and 300 children, and there was only one big room. The floor and the whole building was very defective and the conditions shameful, but the central Government is not responsible for that. I am glad that the interests of the diggers are so well protected, and that not merely rich people are being considered. Some <span class="col_2825-2826" refersTo="page_0073"/>of the diggers are in a very sad position and who could be assisted, and their interests exceed those of the people who do not need it, and who possibly live hundreds and even thousands of miles away from the diggings. This Bill will contribute to the improvement of the economic conditions of our people.</p>

<speech by="#raubenheimer">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAUBENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>The first impression in dealing with this great matter is the thought that the Government has a very great responsibility in connection with the alluvial diggings. The existence of thousands of people is in the balance, and there is no doubt that there has been a certain amount of neglect with reference to them which must be attributed in a certain measure to our Government, because what the hon. member for Delarey (Mr. van Hees) said about their walking about without any education is true. I am sorry that we have to listen to so many different opinions of hon. members who have visited the Lichtenburg diggings, and that we are not able, from their statements, to find out what is actually required. I have received the impression that it would have been better if they had not gone there. How will the Minister, in solving this question, know which member&#x2019;s word he ought to take as to the state of affairs? I think that the chief purpose of the Bill is to guard against the over-production of diamonds, and this is in the first place of the greatest importance to the digger himself. Professional diggers are people who are dependent solely on digging. Many people think then when a professional digger has once made a lot of money and had a good find he leaves the diggings and makes his living elsewhere. But that is not the case with the professional digger. Only about 10 per cent. of the diggers at Lichtenburg are professional diggers. The others are farmers from the neighbourhood or people from the towns who go there to try their luck. When they have had a good find they go away and do something else, but the professional digger keeps to that job all his life. Legislation was necessary because if conditions continued as they were in the western Transvaal the calling of a digger would become desperate. Moreover, all are agreed as to the principle of the Bill. Everybody wants the alluvial digger to be given another chance of making a living. I have made a special study of the conditions on the diggings, and I do not think that the Bill, as drawn, provides for the needs of the professional digger. In that respect I disagree from the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Moll). I represent diggers, and during the past ten years, there have been diggers in my constituency, and I, therefore, know their interests. The interests of the Lichtenburg diggers are, however, entirely different to the interests of diggers in other places in ordinary circumstances. The Government, moreover, will not at once be able to put right all the short comings in the old law, but this Bill will make an improvement in things. It will not, however, do much for the professional digger. The professional digger, e.g., cannot do much with eight or ten natives. When a digger comes to a claim on which he can make something he should have the opportunity of taking out of it all that is possible. He then requires more labourers. The professional digger has to work out a claim as quickly as possible to see if he can make anything out of it. He has no other livelihood, but has to make his living on the diggings. Even 20 natives will not be enough for the professional digger. It will not enable any digger to run two big machines. I am in favour of the large syndicates and companies being restricted and the individual persons being protected, but it should be possible for individual diggers to make a living. This Bill prevents my lending money to a co-digger to continue his operations, but if many diggers cannot get money they will have to stop working. I can lend money to a digger, but he is not liable to pay it back to me. If he does not wish to do so he need not. If I lend a digger £3,000 for three months then I must have the security of a share in the claim until the £3,000 is repaid. The Bill, however, prevents that.</p>

<p>If a digger cannot be assisted beyond that then he will be ruined and become a poor white and a burden on the shoulders of the State. I feel that we should prevent the diggings throwing more poor whites on to the shoulders of the State. I have had personal experience of prospecting in my constituency. After a prospecting area has been thrown open it is completely prospected without is being proclaimed, and I am glad that the Minister makes provision that a man cannot completely prospect his farm without its being proclaimed. The sub-division of farms in the Transvaal has caused great dissatisfaction among the diggers, because in that way they were deprived of their rights.</p>

<p>At the adjournment I was speaking about the sub-division of farms. There are different opinions about the matter. The hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Moll) represented it as illegal, but the subdivision question was tested and declared legal. If we want to give the provision retrospective force we must be very careful what principle we lay down as to the land of owners. The percentage basis (or commission basis), as explained by the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Boshoff) is desirable, because then it is <span class="col_2827-2828" refersTo="page_0074"/>not necessary to curtail the right of subdivision. Whether a man is the owner of a large or a small farm he will get his just share of the discoveries made on his farm. I am a strong supporter of that basis, and I am sorry that the Minister does not think it advisable to introduce that system. Although the Minister does not wish to do so, I am still going to support him in declaring sub-division illegal, because I think that some of the rights of the diggers are being taken away. I shall stand by the Minister, but I want to say clearly that if I felt that he was not looking after the interests of the diggers I would feel myself obliged to stand by the diggers. I do not think there is an hon. member in the House who cannot say that some of his constituents are on the diggings, and I think the digging population should also have a say in the government of the country. When I look at the schedules to the Bill I am surprised to see that the number of owners&#x2019; claims on private land in the Transvaal is 200, in the Free State 400, in the Cape 45, and in Natal 200. I do not intend making a point of that, but I was very glad yesterday to read in the paper that there was a possibility of Bechuanaland being annexed to the Transvaal. It originally belonged to the Transvaal, and if it once more becomes a part of it then Bechuanaland will find a solution for the injustice which is being done us in the Cape Province. I know that hon. members representing the Cape Province are not very favourably disposed towards the secession of Bechuanaland but I know the Transvaaler will welcome it very much. We were originally a part of the Transvaal, but when the Stellaland boundary was drawn a large part of the Transvaal was incorporated. Our interests, however, are identical with those of the Transvaal, while there is a great distinction between the interests of Bechuanaland and the Cape Province, especially with regard to diggings. I was terribly disappointed this morning when the Prime Minister described the annexation to the Transvaal as impossible. I hope the Government will give its attention to the matter, so that we can obtain the rights of the Transvaal landowners. In the past there are many diggings in my constituency and the owners had the right to 45 claims, but there never yet was a subdivision of farms. The people were satisfied with that, but they never knew that they had the right of subdividing. Now they have ascertained this. I cannot say that they are as satisfied as formerly. Although there may be a difference of opinion about the Bill, I am inclined to support the view of the hon. member for Ventersdorp, because he is not only a digger, but also a landowner. He is a man who has great experience of diggings, and I think we shall act wisely if we take his advice and abolish the sub-division of farms, and apply the commission basis. If I have a farm of 3,000 morgen and you. Mr. Speaker, have a farm next to me of 500 morgen, then the idea prevails that you should get the same number of claims as I. Absolutely wrong. If I have more alluvial ground than you then I ought to share in the additional wealth coming to me. The commission system will give satisfaction. The Minister said that when digging took place in future on Crown land it would be on the commission basis, and I cannot understand why it cannot be applied generally. Then we shall satisfy the landowner and the digger much better than is the case to-day.</p>

<p>The subject is worn rather threadbare now, but I should like to say? few words on it before we come to the of this debate. The Bill has been analysed and dissected and criticized very fully and incisively, especially on this side of the House, and I do not propose to go in any detail, into the particular provisions which have been analysed and criticized by my hon. friends on this side of the House.

<p>If the Minister will accept the criticism of the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) on this Bill, very little of this immense document will remain before the House. No, the Bill seems to have very few friends. The criticism has been from the other side almost as much as from this side. The Bill is the first attempt of the Government to deal with this remarkable, this extraordinary situation which has arisen in the alluvial fields in Lichtenburg, Within recent months there has arisen a place and a population almost as big as any major town in South Africa; the population both white and black entitles it to rank as one of the foremost cities in South Africa to-day. The position in that area has been left very largely alone by the Government. The hon. member for Delarey (Mr. van Hees), who is the chairman of the Nationalist party in the Transvaal, has more than once described in this House the lamentable state of affairs on these diggings. These diggings are from the point of view of Government administration a disgrace to this country. It is the first big test that has been applied to the administrative capacity of this Government, the first real problem they have had to face&#x2014;and what have we seen? The Government have been remiss. They have allowed things to drift. They have done nothing, and the result is that we have a situation in Lichtenburg such as has probably never been seen in South Africa before. I think the Government has come very badly out of this test. When I think of what was done by the old republican Government in the Transvaal in 1886, when they were met with a similar situation, and when I see the supineness of our Government to-day when <span class="col_2829-2830" refersTo="page_0075"/>threatened with a similar problem. I think our present Government comes very badly out of the comparison. If the Government of President Kruger had let things go on in the Witwatersrand just as the Government has let things go on at Lichtenburg, what would have happened at Johannesburg? Instead, there was orderly government and orderly administration, and the ordinary services of government and administration were carried on from the very first, and the situation was one such as we in South Africa were justified to be proud of. This is the first attempt the Government is making to deal with this situation. The Minister brings forward this Bill in the latter part of the session, a Bill which he himself describes as a most difficult, involved and complicated one. He brings it forward in the latter part of the session, when we are already overwhelmed with a great deal of work, and it is very difficult to concentrate on a measure of this kind. He has given the public very little notice of this measure. The Bill was published only just before the recess. The Bill affects very deeply and vitally private interests. These interests are beginning to realize that they are being attacked by this Bill, but we have now, at this stage of the session, reached the point where the Minister says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot allow this to go to a select committee. I must have this Bill through.</block>

<p>The result is that this complicated measure, dealing with a most difficult situation in the country, and vitally affecting large private interests, is going to be dealt with by this House and finally passed without any hearing having been given to the interests affected. These interests are very large. The hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. Mostert) said yesterday that people representing £17,000,000 were lobbying here in front of Parliament. It shows what vast interests are at stake in this Bill, and yet these people will not have a hearing; they will not be heard by Parliament; they will not be heard by a select committee, and we shall have to deal with them and dispose of their lights as best we can. I think this is a lamentable situation. We on this side are not going to press for a select committee, because we feel that certain vital powers in this Bill have to be given to the Government, and if at this stage of the session the Bill has to go through a select committee and a proper hearing has to be given to the interests concerned, it may well be that the Bill will not pass, and as we agree with the Minister that certain powers in this Bill have to be given to the Government we have no option left us but to leave the responsibility with the Government. But I do say this, that it is most unfair to this country and the public of this country that they should be dealt with in this way. The Minister could have brought in this Bill much earlier in the session, and if he had done so people would have had an opportunity to be heard, and the House could have discharged its proper function as the high court of the nation. Now we are debarred from that right, and the responsibility is with the Government. What has happened? The Minister complains of sub-divisions, of the formation of syndicates, and of the situation, as a whole, as it has developed in Lichtenburg. But, of course, it has all happened in accordance with the law; whatever the Minister complains of to-day has happened in accordance with the law. What the Minister proposes now is not to right an illegal situation, a situation which has arisen against and in contravention of the law of the land, but a situation which is within the four corners of the law in every respect. These private rights have been established and the Minister is now ruthlessly going to destroy these rights, but he must admit as a lawyer and a statesman that these rights have all arisen and been established within the four corners of the law of the land. He says these people have been warned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I warned them last year, and they were not entitled to go with subdivisions and with acquiring rights and forming syndicates after the warning.</block>

<p>I have taken the trouble to look at this warning, but let me first say this: What right has the Minister to warn anybody? If a man exercises his rights under the law, what right has the Minister, what dictatorship has been conferred upon him, to warn people not to exercise their rights under the law? But even taking this warning. I find that last November this official statement was issued by the Mines Department&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is said that in view of the threats alleged to have been made by diggers to rush farms in the Lichtenburg district, an official statement was issued by the department explaining what the Government has done, and pointing out the folly of diggers in desiring to go outside the law.</block>

<p>It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The great majority of diggers, however, know the law and are law-abiding. They also know or ought to know that a Bill amending the present law, and in which the Government deals, inter alia, with this very point, was before Parliament last year. It is a consolidating and, therefore, a long Bill, and it will be dealt with next session.</block>

<p>That is the warning; the Government say that they are again going to bring before the House and pass into law the Bill they had before the House last session. We can scan the Bill of last session, and we shall not find the retrospective clauses of the present Bill.</p>

<p>I quite agree with this statement, but it is not a warning such as the Minister claims to have given to these interests. It seems that there was no warning to anybody that in forming companies and syndicates he <span class="col_2831-2832" refersTo="page_0076"/>was contravening the law. The statement goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be obvious that the Government is as bound by the present law as anybody else. Under the new Bill &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here is a very important statement, to which I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; these rights of the owners will be limited &#x2026;</block>

<p>Not by retrospective clauses&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to a proportion of the total area to be proclaimed, so that if a small area is proclaimed the number of owners&#x2019; claims will be small; if large, they will be more&#x2026;.</block>

<p>This is the official statement issued by the Minister last November, but he is coming forward with a Bill which is not in accordance with the statement at all. It is of a different character. There has been no warning, but in accordance with the law and its provisions farms have been sub-divided as they have been subdivided before, but. I take it, on a much larger scale, and people who have had nothing to do with this sub-division have been buying these portions, and they are held to-day by people who have probably nothing to do with the original owners who made the division. The Minister does not come down on the people who originally sub-divided to increase their claims, but he comes down on perfectly innocent people.</p>

<p>I must be very green! Millions of pounds have been invested, and people have put their money into these syndicates&#x2014;people living all over the country, who know nothing of the state of affairs at Lichtenburg, and nothing of the practices to which the Minister has an objection, and now they are suddenly confronted with the cancellation of their rights. The result can only be chaos. You can only bring matters to a standstill. When the Government and Parliament pass laws of this character, they shake the very foundations of security for investment in this country. When people find Parliament interfering with and confiscating and abolishing their rights, you shake confidence, and there is no secured right for capital. This is an agricultural country and a mining country in a very large sense, and if in a matter of major concern like this we shake confidence, how can we expect development? We must expect that land values will suffer naturally, too. When people find that minerals are insecure and don&#x2019;t form a safe investment, they are not going to buy farms and give high prices for them, because they do not know where they may be landed to-morrow under the bizarre legislation of the country. A mining country like ours, can least of all afford such methods and embark on such legislation. Let us keep up security of title, of property and of investment in this country, and if once we depart from these principles we do not know what the after-effects may be. They will affect every farm and every portion of the Union. What is the object of all this? Why does the Minister introduce all this legislation? What is the demand and necessity for it? The Minister said he wants to help the small man. In my opinion, if this Bill goes through in its present form, the small man will suffer in Lichtenburg just as much as the big man. Syndicates will be destroyed which have bought these subdivided portions. The small man will find it impossible to get capital to work his claim, and the result will be that Lichtenburg fields will be brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>The Minister seems to me to have misconceived the whole position of the Lichtenburg diamond fields, and seems to be under the impression that we have still the old river alluvial diggings to which we have been accustomed, where the poor man can go with his wheelbarrow and a couple of natives and start looking for diamonds. This is an entirely different proposition.</p>

<p>That is what this legislation means. These fields are not like the river alluvial diggings, but they are like the Lüderitz fields. The Minister sees that at Lichtenburg an entirely new situation has arisen, and the small man is excluded. Rich syndicates are coming in, and all the other practices of which he complains. It is not some sinister movement that is taking place, but it is the very nature of the field, and capital is needed for its exploitation. You must go down, not a couple of feet, but 15, 20 or 30 feet or more for your diamonds, and it is more like ordinary mining than the alluvial fields to which we have been accustomed in the past. For the Minister to attempt to bring the conditions back to those of the river diggings is to attempt the impossible&#x2014; he is trying to put the clock back. A small man might have a most valuable claim; who is going to buy it? He is restricted to ten native labourers to work it, and altogether, it seems to me that the Minister has completely misunderstood the situation on these fields, or it is his object to shut them up. I think the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) ought to be very grateful to the Minister, and instead of attacking the Bill he ought to welcome it with both hands, because the diamond situation is going to be solved under this Bill by the practical closing of these fields. The Minister has dealt in this rough way with the investor; he proposes ruthlessly to sweep <span class="col_2833-2834" refersTo="page_0077"/>away the rights of the ordinary legitimate investor, and is incidentally going to kill the small man on these fields. How is the owner going to be treated? I ask this because in this country we have not yet reached the stage that the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) would like to see coming by leaps and bounds. We still have to deal with the owner, and he is dealt with very roughly in this Bill. He is debarred from prospecting his farm properly. He is limited to five prospectors. Most of these farms in Lichtenburg are big; and if the Minister knows anything about prospecting, he knows you cannot do it properly with five men. The owner hitherto has had the right of picking his claims, especially as he has had only a few given to him under the law. He has the first pick of the small, exiguous portion of his farm that is given to him as claims. When he has found minerals on his farm, he has no longer the right to sell to syndicates and to rich people; he must now sell to the small man with small capital, to carry out the objects of the Bill. Beyond that, the owner, so far, has had the right to subdivide. The Minister conceded in that notice I have just read that that is a legal right, and owners have so far exercised that right. They have quite legally and properly subdivided their farms and increased the claims to which they are entitled, but the number of claims is not increased, and it remains as it was under the old law. Only the legal right to subdivide the farm is taken away. There is another point, and that is the manner in which Free State titles in the Cape Province have been dealt with. I do not want to enter into that question, because it has been fully dealt with by my hon. friend the member for Gardens. Let me go on to another point which affects the owner. The Minister, under the Bill, need not proclaim a farm on which precious stones have been found. The Minister reserves the right to say that he will not proclaim the farm, but the owner is still bound down to a small number of claims, and his rights are being whittled away.</p>

<p>The Minister does not listen to me. I agree that it is proper that he should have discretion not to proclaim. Then there is the one other very far-reaching provision whereby the Minister proposes to proclaim a field which has been prospected, and where precious stones have been found, as a State digging, and to work it under regulations issued by him. What becomes of owners&#x2019; rights in that case, I do not know. The Minister does not make any limitation as to how the owner&#x2019;s rights are to be affected. If we agree to the request of the Minister for the right to declare State diggings, we shall have to define much more carefully the rights to which owners and others are entitled. No, sir, it seems to me that subdivision has been legal, and there has been the strongest motive for it; the motive is that under the law as it exists such small rights are given to the owner&#x2014;such paltry rights&#x2014;that the owner is driven to exercise every ingenuity in order to increase his claim holding. The only proper solution is to do what the Minister promised in the statement I have read to the House, and that is to award claims to the owner in proportion to the size of the area proclaimed. Then the motive for subdivision will be taken away, because the law will have automatically laid down the scale, say, one or two claims per morgen. It is quite clear that the only solution is to give owners claims in proportion to the area which is proclaimed. I hope the Minister will concede that point, because one of the blots on the Bill is schedule 5. There is no reason for saying that an owner in the Free State should get 400 claims, in the Transvaal 200 claims, and in the Cape 45 claims.</p>

<p>The Minister proposes to take away rights which the Cape has always enjoyed, and no Government has ventured to touch them. If there is to be equality, let us have equality all round, and have a scale which would prevent evasion and manipulation, although technically it may be in order. The only way to do it is to award claims in proportion to the size of the area, and to do this in the same way all over the Union, making no distinction between the various provinces. I do not wish to go further into this clause, but there remains the biggest matter of all, and that is the situation we are faced with now. There is no doubt that a very serious crisis is looming in the near future, and, I suppose, it is to some extent the object of the Bill to deal with that situation, because the Minister has taken very far-reaching powers to control diamond production on the alluvial fields, just as much in the mines. I feel sure that this clause will effect nothing at all in staving off this crisis unless the Minister does more, and unless he gives an assurance to the world that he is going <span class="col_2835-2836" refersTo="page_0078"/>to exercise his rights and to take control in order that we may not lapse into anarchy and a slump which will destroy the diamond industry for many a day. The hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) gave some very alarming figures pointing out that when the Lichtenburg fields were discovered the diggers received nearly £8 per carat for their stones, but last year the price fell to £2 8s. for the same class of diamonds. The fall is still continuing. We can see how the poor digger is the man who is going to suffer most of all under this procedure. If this decay continues, we shall very soon be in the position that the small digger will get practically nothing for his diamonds, and although he may have a rich claim it may not be worth his while to continue working it. Even from the point of view of the small man, there is the strongest motive to take control of the situation, and to see that this enormous production of diamonds does not proceed indiscriminately until there is such an accumulation of diamonds that the price goes altogether. It is not sufficient for the Minister merely to take these large powers; the diamond market and the world want something more. The Minister may under the Bill do the most drastic things, but he does not tell the House that these powers are taken seriously, and that he is going to deal with the situation. Unless he gives the world the impression that he is going seriously to deal with this question of control, I am afraid this Bill will help just nothing at all.</p>

<p>We are face to face with a crisis; the public revenue may suffer tremendously in the near future, and private interests may suffer very largely. We know what happened in this province in 1907 when the diamond slump came and everything came practically to a standstill. This is not a situation which affects Lichtenburg merely&#x2014;it is a situation affecting the world&#x2019;s markets. People everywhere are nervous, and they want some assurance from this Government that the situation will not be allowed to drift. All that has been done so far by the Minister is to ask for powers, but they are all optional. He has not given the least indication of the policy which the Government intends to pursue in the exercise of these powers, and I wish when he replies to the debate to look at it not merely from a dialectical point of view. We are not trying to score off each other. Let the Minister state clearly what he intends doing in the exercise of his powers.</p>

<p>The powers there were purely permissive. All I ask the Minister to do is this, and I do it with no idea of trying to score off the Minister, but the world is looking for a declaration. If the Minister will tell the country that he is going to stabilize the position and control the situation and he is not going to allow the alluvial diamonds to run riot and spoil the market, that will have a very beneficial effect. [Time limit extended.] I want to say this in conclusion. I agree with the Minister that these powers I have just referred to, especially Clause 115. are necessary, and we shall offer no opposition to the granting of these necessary powers. I am sorry, and we deeply regret, that the Minister has overloaded this measure with a number of contentious provisions. He has told the House that he intends to make certain concessions in committee, and I hope he will show a spirit of sweet reasonableness, and do away with these criticized clauses which affect, the rights of owners and vested interests. If he is willing to do away with these clauses, and confine himself to what is really essential, he will find nothing but support and help from this side of the House. As things are now, it is difficult to make up our minds what line to take. If he will confine himself to what is absolutely necessary, we shall give him every support possible.</p>

<p>I think the House is thankful to the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) for what he has said, but I am particularly thankful, because I think that this is the first occasion during the whole day that we have listened to something which is at the same time amusing. Let me, however, add that in certain respects the hon. member&#x2019;s speech was also particularly interesting. The first two remarks of the hon. member were especially interesting. The first was that the Minister was wrong in refusing to send the Bill to a select committee. At the same time he was not prepared to move that the Bill should actually go to a select committee, because he thought there was not sufficient time for that. I think that that is the best reason for not referring the Bill to a select committee. It is very necessary for the Bill to be passed. The hon. member for Standerton actually conmenced by pointing out how utterly negligent this Government was. Yes, how unfit it was to really act effectively on every occasion that something took place calling for intervention. He considers that if there was one extraordinary thing in the history of South Africa there was never a Government hitherto that was so negligent and had sat still so long, and had created such a terribly bad condition of things as that now existing on the alluvial diggings. He wanted to corroborate this by what the old Government of President Kruger had done. I <span class="col_2837-2838" refersTo="page_0079"/>think that, as a disciple of President Kruger, and as one acquainted with what took place in the old days, he ought not to come here to accuse this Government. I consider that the condition on the alluvial diggings is a state of affairs which, to a great extent, we inherited from his Government. The misery which exists to-day is a condition which was caused by the Government of the hon. member for Standerton, which permitted matters to develop as they did in the Transvaal. I remember quite well how, during the 1924 election, I went to Lichtenburg and, during my journey, I casually passed two of the alluvial diggings. There were not merely a few people, because at one I was stopped by about 3,000 or 4,000 men, and there were about 8,000 in the neighbourhood. I may say that the complaints I listened to, and the condition of things I saw there, was as bad as it could be.</p>

<p>When you take over an old, slovenly farming business it takes years and years before you get the homestead in order and the farm running. The Government took over a state of affairs on the alluvial diggings which was as bad as it could be. The Minister of Public Health can enlighten us about the diseases on the diggings immediately after we assumed office. There were epidemics, lack of nurses and doctors, and a very bad state of health. Since we came into power that has been one of the things we have been engaged on, and which we have always tried to put right. Unfortunately, the position was so bad and the extension of the diggings has been so great that two or three years is very little for any Government to make the necessary progress in bringing about a satisfactory state of affairs even with the best intentions in the world. Otherwise I entirely agree with the hon. member that it is right that the position on the diggings should be tackled, and put into proper order. To say that the Government has shown its incapacity in tackling and controlling a new state of affairs which occurs for the first time is going too far. It is not a new state of affairs, but an old, rotten state, of which we became the heirs, and, as is usually the case with bad conditions, it takes a long time before they are put into proper order. Now I wish to make a further slight reference to what the hon. member for Standerton said. He referred to the great necessity of doing something, and of having the assurance that the diamond digging should be under such control that everyone would feel that the diamond industry was safe for the future. I quite agree with him, but that is the very reason&#x2014;and I think the Minister made it very clear&#x2014;why the Bill cannot go to a select committee. The Bill should pass into law as quickly as possible, because the Minister and the Government must take action in the present condition of things. Of course, the hon. member for Standerton wants the Minister to say what he actually intends doing, what steps he is going to take under the powers here asked for. I do not know, perhaps the Minister will be able to give the information, but I do not think a complaint can be made if the Minister does not do so. In fact, I think that the Minister cannot do it, because powers are being asked for the very reason of enabling the Minister to act according to circumstances, and the conditions prevailing at the moment when the Minister has to intervene. The measures for the future will, thus, have to depend on the circumstances existing when the Minister has to take them. Therefore, in this connection, I do not think that the Minister can be blamed if he is unable to give the information. I can well understand that hon. members on all sides of the House would be glad &#x2014;and so should I&#x2014;if the Minister could state precisely what was going to be done, but that is impossible and, for that very reason, it is not stated in the Bill, &#x201C;this shall be done and this is laid down.&#x201D; The hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) spoke here yesterday on the desirability of increasing the percentage of claims which could be granted under this Bill to landowners in the Cape Province. Now I just wish to say here that I have always, and for years, been a firm and strong opponent of giving away State rights to private persons. I have opposed such a policy since the first day of Union, since the day I had the honour to be a member of the Ministry of the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts), and when these matters were in the hands of the late Mr. Fischer. I say that if there is one thing in South Africa then it is that in comparison with all other countries in the world, private owners here have more rights in minerals and precious stones than anywhere else, except Holland, but there are no precious stones and minerals which are worth bothering about. The State accordingly must not give any further rights to private owners. If there is one thing I deplore it is that our farmers are already giving so much time to searching for diamonds, gold and the rest. If they were to give less attention to that they would be better farmers. I may say that I feel this so strongly&#x2014;I also have a farm, but I do not know what is on it&#x2014;that in reply to a number of applications to prospect my farm, I have said that as long as I wanted to farm no one should prospect there.</p>

<p>Not require it? I should be glad if it were so. I do require it, but just because I need it so much I do not want my children to waste their lives looking for precious stones. There are not one, but dozens of farmers who have already been ruined through that. This is digressing a little, but if there is one thing that has taught it to me then it is what I have experienced in the Free State. How many farmers there, who were formerly rich men, are now plunged into poverty? Some become beggars, just because they went round with rods and were always looking for diamonds, gold and similar things. If a man wants to be a farmer he must stick to farming. But let me return to what the hon. <span class="col_2839-2840" refersTo="page_0080"/>member for Standerton said with regard to the Cape. I cannot agree with him, still less can I agree when it concerns a matter where we are in a position to produce too much. If we give away further rights that the Government holds then we are closing one door to open another by this legislation. In the case of diamonds least of all ought we to fall into the temptation of giving away more State rights to private individuals. It is, indeed, true that the objection remains that the percentage is not uniform in the Free State, Transvaal, Natal and the Cape Province, but we must not forget that if I, e.g., had bought a farm in the Cape Province I should have known that I should only have a certain share, and if I had bought a farm in the Transvaal I should have known that such and such a share would be coming to me. Therefore, I see nothing unfair in it and I cannot agree to more rights of the State being surrendered. To come to Lichtenburg, The hon. member for Standerton says that owing to the proposals in this Bill, the Lichtenburg fields will be killed, that the small digger will not be able to exist anymore than the big man. Neither the Minister nor the Government nor the people wish that the small digger should not be able to exist. As a matter of act, I believe that one of the chief purposes of the Bill is that he should make a proper living, but that the diggings should be put under such control that it should be assured that the diamond industry shall actually be a healthy one. If that, however, is not attained by this Bill, we must look into it and improve it so that it is actually the case. Let me, however, say this&#x2014;that, as a boy, I was a digger, and that I know a good deal about diamond digging. I was practically a digger from the time I came to years of discretion until I was 15 years old and I think that at that time one remembers better than at any other part of one&#x2019;s life, and I know that if you consider the area of a claim, a digger with ten men to assist him in this kind of alluvial digging can do a tremendous amount. An hon. member has said that they are not ordinary river diggings I am not certain that the difference is so great. If we look at the Vaal River and see what is done there, then I am convinced that the new diggings cannot demand more strength than is demanded in quite a number of cases. I have not, myself, visited the Lichtenburg fields, and I understand the diamonds lie much deeper there, but not so deep, however, that a man, even with comparatively small capital and little assistance, is not able to dig and to produce on a fairly large scale. It is no longer the case at Lichtenburg of getting up the ground, spreading it out, and taking it to where it is to be crushed, and further treated. The ground is found immediately on the site, and then it is washed in a washing machine or where the water is If that is not enough, the number can possibly be increased, but let us take care that we do not take the opportunity out of the hands of the comparatively small man in order to give it to the syndicate. The small man must be able to make a living. Just one word about the sub-divisions which the Bill was to put an end to. We all feel that the taking away of rights from a person is something which the legislature should not lightly do. We all accept that, but there are circumstances when it is sometimes necessary for the legislator to do so. Whether this should be done or not depends upon the reasons that exist. In the present case we have the fact that an Act was passed of which the intention unquestionably was that an owner of a farm should only get a certain small part of the claims in the event of his farm being proclaimed as a digging. The intention of the Act was that the remainder should remain in the hands of the State to be rendered available for other people, or if necessary, to be retained by the State itself. We now find, however, that while that was the intention of the Act and everybody realized it, and 99 per cent. of the owners considered that that was always the intention of the Act, and was actually the law which was acted upon, certain persons discovered that there was a way of evading it by which they could get out of what the Government and the Act intended, They knew quite well that they were doing something which they could legally do but only because the Act was faulty, and that the loopholes had not all been filled up. The people acted as clearly as possible with no other intention than depriving the State and the rest of the community of rights. They went and cut up farms into small portions&#x2014;into areas of 60 morgen. Instead of their getting what they were entitled to under the Act, viz., 5 morgen on a farm, they were now to get 5 morgen on every block of 60 morgen or thereabouts.</p>

<p>That may be, but the lawgiver of that time did not think so and thought that an owner should only get five claims on a whole farm of 4,000 morgen. Now&#x2019;, through sub-dividing, the owners do not only get five claims&#x2014;if they wish they can get everything, because a farm can be cut up into portions of five morgen. There is nothing to prevent it. No one could find a clearer use of a defect in an Act in order to enrich another person. The hon. member for Standerton asked the Minister of Mines and Industries where he got the right from to issue warnings. The question should not be put in that way. The Minister had the fullest right, just as I or anyone else has to issue a warning. I admit the warning does not have the force of law, but this does not deprive the Minister of the right of giving a warning. The warning at least must have had this effect of putting everyone on their guard that what they were taking from the State and from the community would subsequently be taken back again. I must honestly say that I have no sympathy with those who had their farms divided solely with the object of, instead of getting five morgen to get 10. 100 or 1,000 morgen. They actually had the right, that is, the strict technical right but no one will say that it was a fair right I might almost say that they did not have the moral right on their side, and they cannot <span class="col_2841-2842" refersTo="page_0081"/>complain if the State comes and says that they must give back what they got. I do not wish to enlarge upon this, but I want again to say that particularly in a Bill like this there is nothing that is better and for which the House is better fitted than to have a debate and to point out the shortcomings of a Bill which is intended, not only to be fair towards all, but, at the same time, to be a good thing for the community, and particularly for the diggings on which we all have our eyes in the House when we deal with the Bill this evening. I hope that the further discussion will lead to more light being thrown on the matter. The hon. member for Standerton, e.g., to-night touched on the matter of the basis on which the owners&#x2019; rights should be calculated. I did not follow very well what he said, but I want to say that it is a point that has caused much heartburning to every member of the Government, and to the officials of the Mines Department. The matter has been considered from the point of view of what basis would be most fair towards all, and would not go against the interests of the future owners of the ground. The hon. member for Standerton, e.g., mentioned two claims per morgen.</p>

<speech by="#barlow">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to get on to one clause. The right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) occupies one of the highest positions in the country. Here we have a most serious crisis in the diamond industry, and half of his speech was vote catching. He compares the reef of 1887 with the diggings of today. He curses the Government with book, bell and candle because they did not have a select committee, knowing full well that his party have definitely decided against a select committee. The hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) was far wiser. He said he was speaking for the South African party. Now we have the South African party with two voices. I do not want to get on to the question of party. What I do want to see is this: I want to see the Bill quickly passed into law, and prompt action taken under Section 115. I think the majority of the House and the majority of people in the southern divisions of the Free State realize the danger of unrestricted production to-day. I hope the Minister will take wider powers and prevent recurrences of this thing. I am glad he has done so, but I want him to go further. I want him to change a word in Section 7, Clause 115, from &#x201C;may&#x201D; to &#x201C;shall.&#x201D; Those in the diamond industry do not know what is going to happen. The business is pretty well paralyzed; they are living on the edge of a volcano. If the Minister will tell us that, after the Bill is passed, he is going to call a conference to lay down the quota of the mines and the quota of the alluvial diggings, and give that to the world, he will bring a large measure of peace into the problem. There is a good deal of suffering today of people who are attached to these towns and who live on these mines. I am not one of those who is going to criticize the diamond business, because, speaking from the Free State point of view, we have always got on well with the diamond people, and until Lord&#x2019; Milner came into office the Orange River Colony never put a single tax on diamonds. To talk about Lichtenburg to-day as members have talked is too late&#x2014;the mischief has been done. Lichtenburg is a place of the past. It has been cut up, and those who have cut it up have flown. The question is one of the future, and what we want to know is whether the Minister, when he takes these powers, is going to stop irrational exploitation in the future. There I agree with the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer). We are going to take care to see that only so many diamonds are going to be exported from South Africa. I must thank the hon. member for one phrase&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There must be limitation of output and one channel of sale.</block>

<p>That is the most Leninstic doctrine you could have. When he started the Soviet the first thing to be done was the limitation of output and to have one channel of sale. It was wrong for the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) to sneer at the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s (Mr. Kentridge) nationality&#x2014;a man whose shoelaces&#x2014; as far as his brains are concerned&#x2014;the hon. member is not fit to tie. The diamond concerns when they come into trouble advocated the same thing as we did on these benches&#x2014;to restrict the output and have one channel of sale. Get the trade stabilized once and for all. That is where I agree with the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts). I honestly believe, if the Minister was to make a statement that the Government was prepared to call a conference, both of alluvial and of mining people, and fix the limitation of output, have one channel of sale and fix a quota, it would be a good thing for the people who are producing diamonds. In Lichtenburg men who were doing well, and are winning just as many diamonds, are doing badly to day. Men who were making four or five pounds a week are, to-day, starving, and they are working just as many diamonds. This is because of the fall in the prices. South Africa, if it does not limit its export, will come into direct conflict with other parts of Africa where diamonds are being <span class="col_2843-2844" refersTo="page_0082"/>found to-day. The Belgians, the Portuguese, and other people are not going to limit their quota if we do not do so. Once that happens our diamond trade has gone. There is nobody on any side of this House who would like to see the diamond industry go to-morrow, because it has done a lot for South Africa and for the Free State. We had bluebacks worth 1s. 6d., and when Kimberley started we of the Free State sent all our produce there, and the stock went up to £1. Jagersfontein and Koffiefontein made the southern Free State. We want one of our Ministers who, although not born in the Free State, represents a seat in the Free State, to make a statement, not only for the world&#x2019;s markets, but for the people of the Free State who are living in fear and trembling. Then there is Namaqualand, and if it is true what has been said, Namaqualand diamonds will be as common as oyster shells there. With Port Nolloth coming in, we are going to produce twice as many diamonds as wé can sell. I am assured on very good authority, of people who know&#x2014;not by people in this House&#x2014;that to-day you cannot sell diamonds in any part of the world. The diamond trade is in a very bad position. In England the trade is waiting to see what is going to happen in this House today. I believe the world&#x2019;s confidence in diamonds has been destroyed to a large extent. Tell us what the Government is prepared to do. In regard to the cutting up of farms, they may have acted in accordance with the law, but not justly to the country. I have no sympathy with Wolf Carliss. What I am worrying about is not about the Free State, but what the Government is going to do about control. I hope the Government will act. As far as the other parts of the Bill are concerned, I leave that to other people to discuss. Lots of jeers and sneers have come from both sides of the House. My hon. friend here (Mr. Coulter), who is one of the rising speakers in the House spoilt an excellent speech the other day by throwing sarcastic comments across the floor. Let me, as an old member, advise him never to be sarcastic. There are three men in public life in South Africa who suffer from having a sharp tongue&#x2014;they are the Minister of Mines, Mr. Burton and myself. I don&#x2019;t want to see a rising politician like the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) do the same thing. Let the Minister of Mines make a statement on this subject. The people are waiting to know what is going to happen, and some of the Minister&#x2019;s strongest supporters are in favour of limiting the output, and selling the diamonds through one channel. Lenin has done this in regard to Russian produce, all of which has to go through one channel.</p>

People who doubt this should have a conversation with the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts). However, we don&#x2019;t want a discussion just now on socialism, that will come later on. It has been said that we are trying to take away rights from people, but as soon as you get into trouble you come to the socialistic doctrine of control. You must either do that, or adopt the capitalistic idea which is to throw open all the diamond mines and produce as much as you can or else to go Ac&#x2019; canny.

<p>We limited the output of tobacco. In America if too much tobacco is being grown a farmer must burn what is regarded as being superfluous, and if he does not do that, his fellow-farmers burn him. The members of the Parlimentary Labour party look upon the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) as one of the most honest men in the House. The late Government passed a Bill limiting the sale and production of wine, and one of the biggest capitalists in this town is limiting the catches of fish. We could give dozens of examples on this question. For once we in the Labour party are able to agree with our friends, the enemy, and we are asking the Government to limit the output of diamonds, and thus stabilize the industry. However, we don&#x2019;t want this socialistic principle to be sneered at in the future. When it comes to the point of South Africa producing too many mealies, the principle of limitation will apply to mealies as well. There is not a single commodity that this principle would not apply to if the output were too big. Should South Africa ever produce too many mealies or too much fruit, the State will have to step in. I will tell you what we will do. We agree with the Bill, and we challenge any three men of the South African party to meet any three members of the Labour party and discuss this question on any public platform, in any hall, in any place, at any time they like, in front of a South African party audience, and, like every audience of the South African party, they can come in on a ticket. I want to ask the Minister, for the third time, when he replies to make a statement with regard to the exports of this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hattingh">

<from>&#x2020;*The Rev. Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HATTINGH</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not be long because I do not want to repeat points that have already been touched upon. There are, however, a few points which have not yet been brought to the notice of the Minister and I think expression should be given to feelings which inspire thousands of people in the country. One point is that owing to the extension of the diggings we run a danger in connection with the children that are born on the diggings and grow up there that they will be turned into a digging class. It must surely <span class="col_2845-2846" refersTo="page_0083"/>be plain that the position of the diggers is not going to be a permanent one, and that at one time or other there must be an end to it. There are thousands and tens of thousands of children and people on the diggings. Primary education is in the hands of the provincial administrations and it is right that it should be so. But as the diggings come in the main under the Union Government the Minister should exercise his influence and if necessary grant assistance in providing the necessary educational facilities for the children so that they shall not grow up on the diggings in ignorance and idleness. There is the other class or child of 12, 14 or 16 years who has reached a certain standard. I learn from the best sources that that class of child runs a great danger of joining the criminal class on the diggings, because the care of the children is not what it ought to be. Fortunately, technical and industrial education comes under the Union Government, and I feel that it is very important in connection with the children to prevent them being merely educated as diggers. The Government must take steps to erect technical and industrial schools, especially intended for those children so that they can receive the necessary training in one or other trade. It will not assist us a bit to control the production and sale of diamonds and to look after the material side, while forgetting the other side of the matter, viz., the salvation of the digging population, and especially saving the youth for the future of South Africa. We must under no circumstances permit that part of the population to become in future an endlessly larger burden on the State than what it is to-day with the prevalence of unemployment. Therefore, I cannot strongly enough urge the Minister to take all possible steps to provide education for those children, so that they can be prepared for a better future than a digger&#x2019;s prospects. Another question is that of morality on the diggings. From whatever side we regard the matter the circumstances are of such a kind that there is great danger of moral retrogression on the diggings. This is not only felt by the various churches but by everybody. The churches cannot do enough in bettering the position, and I want to ask whether it will not be possible for the Minister to take power under the Bill to assist the churches who have a certain number on their registers on the diggings to make their influence felt and to provide for the spiritual life of the people. The question of trading rights and of housing of white people and natives are other matters deserving attention. The Bill makes certain provision but it is not clear to me. Before a digging is proclaimed a certain portion which is not considered diamond-bearing must be set aside as a native location where only natives and coloured persons may live, and other portions must be set aside for occupation by whites and for trading rights. The Bill is not quite clear on that point. Clause 27 provides that the Minister can retain control over that kind of matter, but I want a clear provision that ground will be set aside for special purposes before a farm is proclaimed, so that we shall not have the mix up that we have to-day. I especially want to emphasize that when the trading rights are granted the owner must not be able to say where they should be carried on, because it happens that the owner selects rich portions of the farm and grants special rights thereon because they revert to him when the claims are worked out. Besides the owner&#x2019;s claims, he then will also have the portion where the trading area was, and therefore that is why I want the State to have full power in this matter. In the clause in connection with prospecting on Crown lands it is expressly provided according to the existing law. Crown lands which are not specially excluded from prospecting can be prospected by anyone in the world, and then they get the discoverer&#x2019;s rights. I do not think that is right towards the general public. My view is that all Crown land should be prohibited, and if anyone wants to prospect it then special permission should be obtained from the Minister. If the Minister finds that it is necessary to permit prospecting then a portion of the land can be made available and a notice can be put in the Government Gazette or published in another way that that ground is available for prospecting. Then the general public will have the opportunity of also getting some benefit and it will not only inure to the people who have special information. Clause 59 contains provisions in connection with the restriction of licences. In sub section (e) persons are excluded who have been convicted of illicit liquor trading, but I think that if anyone has not been convicted during the previous ten years for illicit liquor selling then he should not be excluded. I do not want anyone to be excluded because he has once in his life committed an offence. In subsection (f) it is provided &#x201C;has been convicted of any criminal offence and sentenced to any term of imprisonment without the option of a fine or to a fine exceeding thirty pounds.&#x201D; Persons could have been sentenced during the strike of 1922 to imprisonment without the option of a fine and they may have been honourable people who want to make a living. I should like the Minister later to accept an amendment to meet those people. In sub-clause (h) there is a provision about persons who are not able to keep the registers required by law. I think that is very severe because there are many people on the diggings who are not able to do so and who have to get others to assist them. An amendment should be made to meet them. Clause 68 provides that if anyone has a claim and does not work it within a certain time his licence monies are doubled and if he does not pay them, then of course, something else may happen. What I should like to see is not only that there should be a doubling of the licence monies, but that the Minister should take power when anyone refuses to work his claim to forfeit it and render it available for other persons. The <span class="col_2847-2848" refersTo="page_0084"/>law is being evaded in more than one way and it may happen that large companies use individual diggers to get areas in claims and then not to work them. The are willing to pay the double licences to prevent the claims being worked. Finally, I want to congratulate the Minister on laying down the principle of State mining. I should much have liked to see the Minister converting all the diggings into State concerns and take the control in the hands of the Government. Then probably thousands and thousands of the difficulties with which we have to contend would disappear. I hope the Minister will consider the points I have raised.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>&#x2020;Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I know that the Minister is in a hurry to reply and therefore I shall not be long. One thing that has not yet been mentioned before is that there are farms in the Free State and elsewhere which have got into the hands of private individuals under settlement schemes. As things are to-day people used formerly to obtain farms under settlement schemes and the rights to the minerals were reserved to the Crown. So it remained till 1916 when the principle was completely altered and people who had obtained farms under settlement schemes could get the same rights as other private owners. The other people are now very strongly urging that they should be treated on the same footing as ordinary owners. They feel they have a claim on those rights. If they had obtained the land cheaply it would be a different matter, but some of the farms have already changed hands three times at ordinary market prices and there is no difference between them and the ordinary owners. The people went on to the farms and possibly never noticed that they were on a settler&#x2019;s farm over which the Government had reserved the rights. And then these people were given the hope that they would be met in the matter. I had the honour two years ago to present a petition on behalf of people in the Free State asking that mineral rights should be granted to them. A promise was actually made. The people were told to be a little patient. Last year these rights were given to people in the Transvaal under the Precious Metals Act and then the expectation was aroused among the group of people in the Free State that they would be met under this Bill. They thought that because the Free State was not so rich in precious metals as the Transvaal they were not met last year, but they cherished the hope that something would be done for them this year. I am also speaking here on behalf of quite a number of people in my constituency, and as some hon. members surely know the diamonds with us are not alluvial but are found in ordinary mining ground and I do not see why the people are not treated as ordinary owners of private farms. I want again to appeal to the Minister to meet them. It is true they were given 50 per cent. of the rights, but they have not yet got the right to prospect like the ordinary owners. They still have to get a prospector&#x2019;s licence and there are all kinds of obstacles in their way. We are dealing with a consolidating measure and aiming at uniformity. In all other respects they are practically ordinary owners and I do not see why the people there should be excluded from the rights in question. I is very difficult to administer matters there in different ways and as the other people were met last year I plead with the Minister to meet these people as well now. I agree with the Prime Minister that the rights of the Crown should be given up as little as possible to private persons, but on the other hand surely people should be treated as fairly as possible and on the same terms. An unfair distinction should not be made. Under the new Land Settlement Acts, which in most cases are much fairer than those under which these people obtained their land the settlers are given the same rights as ordinary owners and I think that in the circumstances the Minister should concede the point. I am dealing with the matter now so that the Minister can consider it before the committee stage. I only want to add that although I admit that the Bill is making an improvement in present conditions I am still rather pessimistic about the matter of alluvial diggings generally. I see that the Minister is given the power&#x2014;I think in Clause 75&#x2014;of deciding in certain circumstances upon the proclamation of certain mines into State mines. If there is anything at all to be said for State mining then it is in relation to the alluvial diggings. The effect of this Bill will certainly be that the small man gets a better chance on the alluvial diggings, but there is no doubt that the diggings nevertheless exercise a demoralizing influence on a great portion of our people. The unhealthy spirit of speculation and gambling, especially among the poor people, will, I fear, become still worse under this Bill. A poor man with a few hundred pounds which he has saved will be able to try his luck on the alluvial diggings to make his fortune quickly, and the gambling spirit is encouraged by this Bill, especially among the poor people. One may approve the claim lottery as an improvement on the existing system in certain respects, but it creates the gambling spirit, the trying to get rich quick without working, or having the certain expectation that the money which is put into anything will produce certain profits. Alluvial * State diggings on which people would be working properly for a good salary and the profit of which the State can employ in further develop ing our agriculture and industries in which the people have a great interest would, in my opinion, be of greater advantage. As regards the remarks of the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) about the disorder on the diggings, I think that it very ill becomes him to make them. I also saw something of the state of affairs under the late Government. They had alluvial diggings on a small scale and could not make a success of them, and it is not fitting for them to criticize alluvial diggings on a tremendously large scale which this Government <span class="col_2849-2850" refersTo="page_0085"/>has to do with. If there is anything about which the Government can be congratulated then it is upon the fact that notwithstanding the astonishing development of the diggings in the last six months order has been so well maintained; there were no riots, no disorder, no bloodshed. I recently read William&#x2019;s book on the diamond mines in South Africa, and he represents that in the old days it was very difficult to control things in connection with diamonds in Kimberley, and he states this as the reason why the theft by Great Britain should be approved. The Free State, he says, would never have been able to exercise control, and the prestige and power of England were necessary and that is why it was stolen from the Free State. This Government has prevented disorder, and is to be congratulated thereon.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I was much amused at the attitude of the Opposition. The hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) said that he spoke on behalf of the South African party, on that side of the House, but after him many members opposite made speeches wherein they expressed such conflicting views and opinions and differing so much from those of the hon. member for Kimberley, that I could almost assume that the hon. member had made a mistake when he said that he was expressing the view of the South African party with regard to the purposes of the Bill. The hon. member for Kimberley admitted at once that the principle of the Bill that the alluvial diggings should be reserved for the poor man was the right one. He found no fault with it, and yet several other members sharply criticized that policy. Therefore, I am not going to take any notice of the other criticism. Either the hon. member for Kimberley was right that he was speaking on behalf of his party, or he was wrong. If he did not have the right, I cannot help it, and if he did have the right to speak on behalf of his party about the Bill&#x2014;which I believe to be the fact &#x2014;then I shall not bother myself about the other criticism. Thus the hon. member for Kimberley practically approves the strong measures which are being taken, and which are intended against the existence of companies and syndicates on the diggings. The hon. member for Kimberley adopted a remarkable attitude with regard to the Diamond Control Act of 1925. He made the statement that if it were not for the 1925 Act, this Bill would have been quite superfluous. I challenge the accuracy and logic of that statement. I want to remind him that an international conference was proposed, and the hon. member was opposed to it. He therefore thought that he would be able to control the whole position in South Africa, but the international conference does not only presuppose the control of mines, but also of alluvial diggings, because no other State would dare to enter into an agreement giving no international control of the yield of the alluvial diggings. They will only enter into an agreement if we in the Union extended it to all produce, both of mines and of alluvial diggings. Then I want to ask whether the 1925 Act had not been passed, what power the hon. member would have had in view of what has taken place in Namaqualand and Lichtenburg over the great production of the alluvial diggings? That Bill was, so far as I can see, the only solution. Neither the hon. member nor a single hon. member has mentioned a reason for the view that if it were not for the 1925 Act this Bill would not have been necessary. The hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) also spoke and said the same thing. I interrupted the hon. member, and then the cat came out of the bag, viz., that they would take care by sharp competition to fight the alluvial diggings. What does that mean? It means that they would have brought about the oppression of the digger, the small man. That is the logical conclusion of the remark which was thoughtlessly made by the hon. member for Kimberley, although he wanted to make out that he was always well disposed towards the alluvial digger, and still is so. I ask him if he will be satisfied if we repealed the 1925 Act and withdraw this Bill? I must admit that in a spirit of bravado he answered affirmatively. Is he actually agreeable that we should introduce a Bill to-morrow to repeal the 1925 Act and allow this Bill to lapse? Of course he is not willing. I challenge him to seriously state and maintain that. I go further. He may say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Oh, no; here is the contract we entered into. It is an international producers&#x2019; contract, and has been approved of by the Government. There is, however, nothing to prevent the producers putting an end to the contract with a syndicate. If it is ended it lapses, and we can then take steps if the Act is repealed, because we would then be in the same free and uncommitted position as before the 1925 Act.</block>

<p>I challenge him to state that he is prepared to run the danger and risk. The fact is that our action of 1925 was completely justified. Of course, the bravado of the hon. member is due to the fact that they want to make out, even with reference to all other. Bills, that the action of the Government is socialistic. That is always the imputation. I only stated the truth at the beginning of my speech in saying that if it suits them, then they are prepared to have socialistic legislation according to their interpretation of the word socialism. In 1904 an Act was passed in the Free State by the Milner regime, and in 1871 one was passed by the Free State Republic which also encroached upon the rights of farms. I now come to the question of free, unencumbered title of the Free State farms. On what principle does the hon. member claim the continuance of the exemption of the Free State farms when the original farms of which these few were a portion were themselves subjected to the curtailment of rights in the Free State by the Act of 1871 and the Milner Act of <span class="col_2851-2852" refersTo="page_0086"/>1904? The hon. member is assisted by the hon. member for South Peninsula, and his criticism of the Bill was that we were taking far too great powers, and that the Bill was full of pin-pricks which clashed with the rights of owners. The amusing position is that the hon. leader of the Opposition wants the assurance that we will not fail to use the great powers, but will exercise them, and that we will act drastically and dictatorially. Because in one and the same breath the hon. member for Standerton described the powers as dictatorial, and strangely enough he insists at the end upon our giving the assurance that the powers would be exercised. The pin-pricks to which the hon. member for South Peninsula referred simply are in the legislation of to-day. The 1918 Act on the leasing of mine property prescribed that the Government could demand that the capital should be adequate and of a certain amount, and there is nothing to which the hon. member pointed which is not already in the law. That is the kind of criticism one gets from them. It is absolutely artificial criticism which is merely done perfunctorily, when they themselves ask for the application of the Bill and for the exercise of dictatorial powers. It was said that under our great powers we should see that we referred matters to the Mining Leases Board. I will say at once that I am prepared to accept that position, but we have constantly to do with the chief objects of the Bill, viz., the preservation of the diggings for the poor man. If the tender system is introduced, it means competition, which means that the small man will be outbid. Therefore, you cannot in this Bill insist on the Government subjecting all the leases to the tender system. The Mining Leases Board is merely an advisory body under the 1918 Act. It is true that under the law tenders must be called for, but the Government is not obliged to accept any tender, but it is competent for it, and it takes the consequent responsibility to lease the ground on any terms practically that it thinks fit, It can decide upon any part of the profits it pleases, even if it is ridiculously low. The Mining Leases Board is a purely advisory body to-day, but I will see how matters can be arranged so that it may be consulted. Hon. members must bear in mind that our chief purpose is that the diggings are to be kept for the small man. Even if you go in for the system of leases and exercise healthy powers, then you will still have to take care that the small man is benefited and gets an opportunity. I do not know how this will work out, and shall undoubtedly, as a matter of administration, consult the Mining Leases Board. That goes without saying. There was a complaint by the hon. member for Barkly (Mr. W. B. de Villiers) that the Diamond Control Board in Kimberley had not had an opportunity of seeing the last draft of the Bill. It was, however, sent to them on the 8th April, and they had the previous draft, and every opportunity to make representations to me. I understand they are now writing me a letter, and if that is so then I will go into it between the second reading and the committee stage. Now I come to the question of retrospectively, with regard to which it is stated that sacred rights are being violated and private rights being encroached upon. I want to refer the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) to the very Act he quoted. I entirely agree with the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) that it was an instance of retrospectivity. I refer to the Act in connection with the obtaining of ground by Asiatics through syndicates and companies. The Act only came into force on the 3rd July, but it was given retrospective force to the 1st March, i.e., four months and three days before the Act was promulgated. We have to do with a case of retrospectivity here, whether one disapproves of it or not, because it makes no difference whether it is a week or a month or three months. The principle is either objectionable or good. I do not say that it is good generally, but here it is justified because we are absolutely compelled to apply the principle retrospectively. Now I go further. The Acts of 1924 and 1926 and the declaration which the hon. member for Standerton quoted to-night all gave the public notice that an end was to be made to the subdivision of farms. When it was stated in the 1924 Bill that in future there would be no 250 owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; claims on every separately registered piece of ground, but one claim in five morgen, enough intimation was given that the intention was to put an end to subdivision. The important fact is that up to the 30th June of last year, the average piece of ground proclaimed was never less than 1,000 morgen. What I say is a fact, viz., that the evil chiefly arose since the 1st June, when the people were aware that the 1924 Bill was drafted in order to combat the evil, and therefore they did not do what they did with closed eyes. I want to point out to hon. members what happened. [The Minister shows the House a diagram of Doornplaats. ] Hon. members can see all the lines on the diagram which indicate subdivisions. I cannot imagine anything more deliberate. Now I come to the Wine and Spirits Act which was quoted by the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street), and I want to refer him to Hansard, part 1, page 113 and other pages. That Act was clearly made retrospective. What about the sacredness of contracts in that case? It was only passed in March, but was made applicable to the vintage which was practically at an end in February.</p>

<p>On page 476 of the English Hansard for 1924, the hon. member for Standerton took up the same attitude, and said that the Act would have to go through and have retrospective force, and on page 479 I find that the hon. member for Hanover Street strongly protested against it. And I go further, and ask whether if Mr. Kramer has not agreed to it, supposing for a moment that Mr. Kramer was the only party interested, whether the Act would not have gone through then? Will the hon. member for Standerton give me that assurance? So much for his view about the sacredness of legislation.</p>

<p>It is what weighs with me, and I will say this in answer to the hon. member when he speaks of the sacredness of principles and about retrospective force. I consider a contract is just as sacred as the title deed of a farm, and I see no difference between the two, but what I am preventing in this Bill is not the subdivision of farms. Everybody who has a transfer deed of a farm has the right of subdividing it as much as be pleases. We are not preventing that, but what we prohibit is that a man who according to the clear intention of the law is entitled to 250 claims, should artificially and evasively go and multiply the claims by 40 and 50. Doornplaats is a farm which has been subdivided into no less than 60 portions, and that comparatively recently. Now I go so far and I ask whether the Act of 1871 was passed in the Free State or the Transvaal Volksraadbesluit of 1858, or every gold law of the Transvaal from 1871 until the last gold law of 1908, for which the hon. member was responsible, or any of the old Natal Acts, and the old Cape Acts which interfered with full owners&#x2019; rights, were not made with retrospective force? Was no encroachment made in the past on vested rights? Anil the Act of 1864 of the Free State took away the full mineral rights of the farms, and what right has the hon. member for Kimberley then to make a plea here for these few farms? My information is, unfortunately the Surveyor-General cannot get the exact figures, that some of the farms in the Cape Province reserve the mineral rights to the Crown up to 95 and 97 per cent.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I am speaking generally. I do not mind whether it is only 80 per cent., but that is my information. The Transvaal, Natal, the Cape Province and the Free State specially curtail the full rights of owners by statutory measures, and laws were clearly made of retrospective force, and a clear encroachment was made on vested rights. Are we, therefore, justified to allow a few farms to continue with the unreserved mineral rights when the owners can simply act as they please with regard to alluvial diamonds? Must we then only exclude farms according to the proposal of the hon. member for Kimberley, where any day diamonds may be found, totally exclude them from this legislation? What, then, becomes of the main purpose of the clause in the Bill that the production of diamonds must be restricted? If to-morrow on a number of these farms large mines are discovered, the law will not apply to the farms that have been excluded, and they will be able to produce just as much as they find and want to produce. That would stultify the whole object of the Bill. Therefore, I think that the Government must maintain the principle and keep it in the Bill. Such cases as Pniel and City on the Vaal are specially treated, because they have unfortunately already been converted into diggings in the past, and we cannot very well interfere, but it is an unsound principle with regard to farms with are still intact and have not yet got any diggings or mines not to put them on the same footing with regard to future rights as other farms.</p>
