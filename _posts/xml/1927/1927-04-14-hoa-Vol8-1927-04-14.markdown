<p>First Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for House to go into Committee of Supply, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate, adjourned yesterday, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members on both sides of the House, no doubt, are glad that we have now reached the stage when our annual battle on the budget is fast drawing its weary course to a close. I understand that there have been disappointments in regard to the budget. The first one apparently was the total absence of thrill. I am sorry that I consider the financial matters, the financial and economic problems of this country, of too much importance for me to resort to all sorts of spectacular financial exploits in order to supply the apparent craving for thrills. As one who, for my sins, has been condemned to listen for five days to the debate we have had, I must sympathize with our friends of the press whose duty it is every morning to supply these glaring headlines designed to revive the drooping spirits of a party sojourning in the wilderness. I say I must sympathize with them that this budget debate has supplied so few thrills, but there has, at least, been one thrill, and that was when the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts), after a period of three years that this Government has been in office&#x2014;in spite of the prophecy we heard at the time that we would only last three months&#x2014;apparently thought the time had come to issue a challenge in connection with the financial and administrative policy of the Government. Well, we had that challenge to mortal combat, but if we take into consideration the times when the ranks were depleted, the steadily depleted ranks of hon. members who no doubt will accompany him to the last ditch when the division bells have rung, I think that it is indicative of the importance which hon. members opposite attach to this challenge. I sympathize with the right hon. member; I think he will find that that is more or less the feeling in the country. I am sure I do not know whether all we heard in the House, and especially from the right hon. member, about financial inefficiency and this country having been brought on the rocks but for extreme luck and the grace of God, will not be received in the country with amused tolerance rather than ridicule. One thing I will prophesy: that after the din of battle has subsided and all the political smoke and dust has cleared away, this budget will stand unscathed. We have had a lengthy debate, and a lot of irrelevant matter was introduced, and some important questions of policy and administration were raised. I do not propose to traverse all the points that have been raised, many of which can perhaps more conveniently be dealt with on the votes of the respective Ministers. I only want to deal with a few of the main principles that were raised here, and mainly the charge of the right hon. member for Standerton of sending up public expenditure in this country to an unwarrantable extent, and the failure of the Government to reduce taxation. He has coupled with that the policy of the Government in regard to extending the provisions of the Conciliation Act into the country, and also the supposed misdeeds of my hon. friend here. In regard to the former, the Minister of Labour has already dealt with that, and has met the criticism in that regard, and my hon. friend here will deal with the other question. Before I proceed to deal with the amendment of the right hon. member for Standerton in so far as it deals with the financial policy of the Government, I wish to deal with a few points raised by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). It is true that he was, of course, the first to raise the hue and cry about inflated expenditure and no reduction in taxation, but it was the right hon. member for Standerton who really led the attack on this point. Of course, the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) had to be true to the faith that is in him, and he had perforce again to deal with this question of the fiscal policy of the Government. I notice that this year he had even less support from hon. members sitting behind him. We have, of course, had again the repetition of the annual vindication of the Government&#x2019;s policy in this regard by his colleague, the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls). I must congratulate the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) on his persistency and on his success in at least gaining over to his side the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. <span class="col_2643-2644" refersTo="page_1393"/>Barlow). That hon. gentleman has now come forward as an outspoken, unabashed and unashamed a free trader, as he described me to be a Tory. He has now placed himself unreservedly by the side of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) in regard to the fiscal question. The hon. gentleman (Mr. Jagger) has not only launched forth his annual tirade against protection&#x2014;which has become in this House an academic question&#x2014;but he has definitely also stated that this policy is resulting in a prevention of a drop in prices, bringing down the cost of living. The hon. gentleman has now shifted his ground. Formerly he prophesied that this tariff policy was going to result in increasing the cost of living. I am glad to have this concession from him now that what it has really done is not to increase the cost of living, but that it has prevented the cost of living from coming down; it has prevented a fall in prices, as has been the case in other countries. But I am afraid the figures which the hon. member quoted in support of that statement did not bear him out. He stated that in the United Kingdom since 1924 prices had fallen by 15½ per cent., 7½ per cent. in Canada, and in South Africa only 1 per cent. I would like to know the source from which he gathered those figures, because I have taken out the figures appearing in the British Board of Trade Journal, and they tell altogether a different tale, and I think another mistake he makes is this, that he is confusing wholesale prices with the cost of living, or rather, he is unfairly comparing wholesale prices with the cost of living. I think it would have been a fairer comparison if he had taken the retail prices. He will admit that wholesale prices are very often subject to alarmist rumours in trade, and to speculation and disturbance in trade channels. For that reason they are not very reliable when you want to make the comparison the hon. gentleman tried to make, and it would be better if we took the retail prices. We have between 1924 and 1926 a fall in the retail prices in the United Kingdom of one point, or less than 1 per cent. on July, 1924. When we come to the wholesale prices, we find it is true that in the United Kingdom during 1924 there was an appreciable fall, especially as the result of the return to the gold standard. The hon. gentleman must remember that here our position is quite different, and we had a heavy fall in prices between 1922 and 1923. We had passed legislation forcing our banks to return to the gold standard by 1923&#x2014;we were the only country in the world to do so&#x2014;and consequently, when 1923 was reached, we had practically reached the bedrock of deflation. It was only subsequently we officially returned to the gold standard, but for a long time our £ was on a parity with the dollar. It was only when the British Government returned to the gold standard that they had an appreciable fall in wholesale prices, and so the hon. member is not quite fair when he compares our prices with the periods I have mentioned in England. But even in Canada, on the otherhand, we had a rise in the retail prices. In South Africa there has been an appreciable fall. The figures of the hon. gentleman that the prices have not come down here, commensurate with the fall in the United Kingdom and Canada, are not in accordance with the facts at all.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>You are taking the retail prices again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>In Canada the retail prices show a rise, and in the United Kingdom a slight drop; in South Africa a fair decrease. In Canada there was a rise of five points in retail prices. South Africa is in a specially favourable position in that, and also in regard to price levels generally as compared with the countries mentioned by the hon. member, and another remarkable fact is, if you take the import figures in January, 1926, the index was 96 less than January, 1925, 1609 as compared with 1705. If the effect of the tariff was as stated by the hon. member, you would not expect to find such an appreciable drop in the wholesale index prices. The consequences the hon. member has drawn from this I think are not warranted at all. But then the hon. member proceeded, and of course trotted out this bogey again, and he was followed by the hon. member for Bloemfontein North (Mr. Barlow), that is, the detrimental effect this fiscal policy has on primary production in this country, especially farmers, and I do not think I could put up a stronger case in refutation of that than was put up by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls). He was rather embarrassed by the cheers that went up from this side, but they were not for the purpose of embarrassing the hon. member at all, because he really hit the nail on the head when he told you that, notwithstanding the cry we nave heard in the country all these years&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Stimulate farming production and let the people get back to the land; do not create openings for them in the railways and other industries,</block>

<p>in spite of that, they are not sticking to the land. That was the experience of hon. members opposite, and that is the experience of the Government. As the hon. member said himself, farming is the worst paid industry in this country. We have for a number of years been doing everything that could stimulate agriculture, spending money on the agricultural department, teaching farmers the best methods, spending much money on land settlement and getting people to come from overseas. That policy has been intensified by the present Government, and, in spite of that, people are dropping off the land. I think we should look the matter in the face.</p>

<p>I admit we do not despair at all, but we must face the realities. In spite of the efforts which the right hon. member made, the people were <span class="col_2645-2646" refersTo="page_1394"/>dropping off the land by the thousand, and you had this position&#x2014;they came to the towns, and there was nothing for them to do. That was what my hon. friend the Minister of Railways and Harbours found on assuming office, and he decided that something had to be done, and the situation was met by a change in our fiscal policy to provide fields of employment for these people; but in the meantime you could not allow them to starve. I do not want to pride ourselves on the fact that we have given this employment. We have done the best under the circumstances. Thousands have been employed in factories; we have been at it only a few years.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) is altogether too impatient. Of course, we all agree with the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) that we ought to do everything to stimulate production, and do everything to get people on the land, but you are not achieving that object. Even farmers&#x2019; sons cannot all remain on the land. They have not the opportunities nor the inclination. We must see, especially in this country, where your two primary industries, mining and agriculture, are in the first instance based on black labour, that avenues of employment are created for the people who have been on the land and who are dropping off.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not agree with the hon. member that the protective policy we have followed so far is making it more difficult for them. The hon. member and his friends who have used this argument have advocated that if a reduction of the customs duties and of taxation is made, you will stimulate employment. If these customs duties were reduced by half to-morrow, I do not think it would make the slightest difference to the consumers and the farmers. The position has been, so far, that when we have made reductions in customs duties, I have been criticized by commercial members, and told that it would not be passed on.</p>

<p>That may be the theoretical argument of the free trader, but it does not work out in practice, and the farming community have not suffered any disadvantages as a result of the moderate raising of the customs duty. On the other hand there have been very considerable reductions, especially in articles used by farmers. The other day the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) went to a neighbouring district, and he is supposed to have stated that as a result of our protection duty the prices of farming implements have gone up. I do not suppose he intended deliberately to be unfair, and am not sure that he was reported correctly.</p>

<p>The price of wheelbarrows was raised by 30 per cent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I don&#x2019;t think there will be many farmers driven off the land as the result of the increased duty on wheelbarrows. The main charge of the right hon. member is that we have sent up the expenditure to an unreasonable extent, and that taxation should have been reduced. It is rather unfortunate for the right hon. member and his party that they have a past which has to be lived down, and with that past behind them I think they will find the public rather sceptical when they read of these vague and general charges about extravagance and failure to reduce taxation. The right hon. gentleman now says: &#x201C;It is all very well for the Government to blame us for the state of the finances, but the Minister of Finance has been wonderfully lucky.&#x201D; I sympathize with him if he wants to make it out that the late Government&#x2019;s footsteps were always dogged by misfortune. For three years the position has not been so bad as that which was experienced by the right hon. gentleman when he ruled over the destinies of this country. Does he want to say that during all those years he had nothing but misfortune? I don&#x2019;t want to make that allegation. The country has had its ups and downs: we have just gone through an unprecedented drought, and the climatic conditions have been against this Government as they were against the previous Government. The last Government had their troubles and I have no doubt that we shall have our troubles. What was the experience of this country during the last five years of the Government of the right hon. gentleman? He apparently blames me for this rise in expenditure, but it was claimed during the debate&#x2014; and the right hon. gentleman made the same claim himself last year&#x2014;that just before this Government took office the Cabinet appointed a committee, a Geddes committee, as the result of our criticism. Last year the right hon. gentleman told us that he reduced the expenditure by £6,000,000. He made a mistake, the actual figure being £1,700,000: We must <span class="col_2647-2648" refersTo="page_1395"/>assume that our predecessors were not extravagant, and that they had put the finances in order by the time we assumed office. It is necessary in order to get at the correct position that we should separate the expenditure at the time prior to our taking office and the expenditure incurred by this Government. When we took office we must assume that the right hon. gentleman and his government when they made economies in administration and reductions in the salaries of civil servants, and brought down the expenditure by £1,700,000, exhausted all the methods of securing reduced expenditure. Then we have to deal with the £3,000,000 additional expenditure which, according to the right hon. gentleman, had been incurred by this Government. I agree it is reasonable to say that we should bear the responsibility for that £3,000,000 we have added to the expenditure. We are quite prepared, when we go into committee, for the right hon. gentleman to point out any of these services on which we have incurred this expenditure, and for him to say where we could reduce or dispense with certain services. We are prepared to join issue with him on that point, and to submit the matter to the country. The right hon. gentleman knows that a great portion of that expenditure is due to the increased subsidies to the provincial councils for education. We know that our predecessors forced the provincial councils to accept the position that they had to go slow, and in many cases were unable to open schools and there was a grave danger that education was going to suffer. We, however, have put the provincial councils on their feet, and they have been able to carry on for the last two years. I challenge hon. members opposite to reverse that decision&#x2014;that policy&#x2014;to make adequate provision for the carrying on of these services by the provincial councils. We get increased expenditure in connection with pensions. Pensions put on a proper footing and meeting our liabilities. Are hon. members prepared to support a measure, if introduced, to alter the basis of the pensions list in the country for the public services? I don&#x2019;t think they will. Increased expenditure on various social services&#x2014;child welfare, mental hospitals and other hospitals, vocational training, technical education. Will hon. members be prepared to dispense with those services? No, they will not. I do not want to exhaust the list. Hon. members will have an opportunity of challenging any one of those services and we shall meet them on that ground.</p>

<p>No, misfortune always dogged their footsteps. I was startled when I got these figures. The need was always felt, if possible, that the country should have relief in the reduction of taxation. I want to take a five years&#x2019; period&#x2014; 1919-1920: increased customs, excise, export tax on diamonds, excess profits duties, transferred from loan account, a total of £1,395,000. That was one year. Then we come to the next year. We find that was a very good year and my predecessor had hoped to come through without any increased taxation, but in the House a motion was moved, I think by the hon. member for Parktown at that time, increasing the income tax abatement and the Government suffered a defeat and my predecessor had to submit. It resulted in a remission of £400,000 for the year.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) says: &#x201C;Look at the examples set you by other countries. Only South Africa has not reduced taxation since the war. Look at Australia and Canada.&#x201D; Let me say that argument does not bear examination. It depends upon your basis. It depends on the basis of taxation in the various countries as to what you can do by way of reduction. The hon. <span class="col_2649-2650" refersTo="page_1396"/>member will agree that is a fair proposition and it is not bringing us any further to say that if Canada&#x2019;s taxation has been higher than ours for a number of years that they have reduced taxation by one million more than you have done yourself. That is no answer at all. What is the position? I do not say that definite conclusions can be based on the figures I have given here, because of the difficulty of making comparisons. You have various differences in the forms of Government and the financial systems of those countries. In Canada the principal railway system is not state-owned. That is one difficulty. Then you have a difficulty in regard to the population. It is complicated here by the natives. It is rather interesting to give the latest figures available to show hon. members what the taxation is which is being levied in the various countries and I think he will see the deduction he made is not fair and takes us no further. In Canada, 1924-&#x2019;25, customs taxation, £22,000,000; Australia, 26.4 millions; South Africa, £8,500,000. Excise: Canada, £8,000,000; Australia, 10.8 millions; South Africa, £2,000,000. In Canada I do not wonder they have been able to reduce taxation. I have not been able to verify the statement, but it is no wonder they were able to do so when you find they have a sales tax in that country producing 17 millions.</p>

<p>No. Sterling £&#x2019;s. The relative income tax figures are: Canada, 11 millions; Australia, 11 millions; the Union, 6.5 millions. In addition to that you have, of course, the provincial taxes, which are very much heavier in those countries than they are in South Africa. The provincial or State taxes in Canada are £13,000,000; Australia, £21.6 millions, and the Union, £3.5 millions. You therefore get total figures of £72,000,000 for Canada, £74.4 millions for Australia, and £24,000,000 for the Union.</p>

<p>What does it work out at per head of European population?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Why does the hon. member want to make a comparison only per head of European population? I think our natives should at least also be considered as an economic factor, and should be taken into account if you are making a calculation of this kind. It is very difficult to ascertain the relative values of these figures by reason of the difficulty of making a comparison according to your population. Taking four natives as more or less equal to one white for this purpose, which is the generally accepted figure, and taking the actual population of these countries, I think you will find that South Africa compares very favourably to the countries I have mentioned, and, therefore, if they have been or are in a position to effect greater reductions in taxation than we have been or are in a position to do, I do not think any definite conclusions can be drawn from that. One thing is clear from these figures, and that is the customs duties in the Union are lower than the Canadian duties, and very much lower than the Australian duties. The Union is not subject to the sales tax as Canada is, the land tax is not levied here as in Australia and the Union income tax is lower than that of Australia and the states there, though it is probably a little higher than that of Canada. I now come to the question of remission of taxation. The right hon. gentleman is disappointed because we have not reduced taxation since we have a surplus. Before I deal with that, let me say that I am rather disappointed at the reception which the announcement of this surplus was accorded from the other side of the House. I do not want to take to myself any particular virtue for bringing out the surplus, but I think we all ought to be very glad and proud of the fact that this, our country, has shown such a wonderful resiliency that in a time of abnormal drought we have been able to come out on the right side to such an extent. I think it shows that, notwithstanding the vagaries of climate and the difficulties that our agricultural community have to contend with, it is fortunate that we have other sources of wealth in this country which can bring us out in such a position during such difficult times. The right hon. gentleman says that we have had a surplus, and that we should have reduced taxation. I do not know whether he wants me to use that surplus for actually remitting taxation for the coming year, whether he wants me to carry forward that surplus, in other words, or whether his argument is that, having had such a big surplus last year, we have been too conservative, we have under-estimated our revenue again, and we should give very much more. I would like to know what the real point of attack is which the hon. member is making. If it is the first, namely, because we have realized this surplus, we should carry it over and so reduce taxation, I must tell the right hon. gentleman that I cannot do that.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that. It must be that because we had that surplus last year we should be in a position to do very much more than we are doing by way of reducing taxation. That would imply that my revenue has been very much underestimated. If that was so, I think it was the duty of the Opposition to criticise the revenue estimates as they have criticised other parts of the budget. I am not wedded to these figures. I have frankly told the House that last year was an abnormal year. We expected to find a drop in the importations into the country, instead of which they have kept up during the year, and they are keeping up now, so that hon. members will agree that it would be very unsafe and very unwise to bank on the continuance of that during the coming year. I think experience shows also that the effects of the good maize crop did not disappear as quickly as we had anticipated. If that is so, I think we are safe in assuming that the result of the bad maize crop will only be felt during this year, instead of last year. Nobody has been able, <span class="col_2651-2652" refersTo="page_1397"/>in this country or any other country, to estimate revenue correctly. We must take these factors into consideration. I have given them all due consideration. I have consulted the commercial community, as we have done in the past, as to the future commercial prospects. As far as I have been able to gather, my estimates with regard to importations are far too sanguine. I have provided for a drop of 5 per cent., but I am told that I shall be lucky if the drop is not 10 per cent. Then there is the diamond position. As I told the House when I introduced the budget, we hope, as a result of the steps we are taking to control the output, that we won&#x2019;t have a collapse of the diamond market, and that we shall be able to continue to reckon on having diamond receipts as we have done in the past. I do not think hon. members would say that I am dealing right by the country if I disregarded the possibilities, if not the probabilities, of the situation which may arise during this financial year. If I have not under-estimated revenue, how is it possible to reduce this taxation if we want to balance our budget, unless, of course, we have very drastically to cut expenditure. That is the only way. With that I have already dealt. The right hon. gentleman is not satisfied with a reasonable reduction of taxation. He wants a spectacular reduction, he told us. That can only mean reducing the administrative expenses, cutting the salaries and allowances of our public servants, and we know what the position is. The other day we debated a motion in this House where our public servants asked the House to consider their position and to grant them higher scales. It is true that hon. members opposite, who now clamour for economy, supported the Government&#x2019;s view on that question, but we must also remember that there was quite a respectable phalanx that crossed over and supported this proposal&#x2014;the stern economists of the other side. Was the right hon. gentleman speaking for the whole party when he deprecated and commented on the growth of expenditure and tabled his amendment, while we had that experience a few weeks ago when a large number of his followers supported that proposal, not for a reduction of the expenditure in connection with our public service, but for an increase? That is the only way you can effect it, or you must be prepared to cut down the other services to which reference has been made. We can discuss that when we come into committee. I shall be glad to have an indication from hon. members opposite as to where we can make reductions. I have invited it, but I have not had a very ready response. The hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) attempted to do something in that direction. He said&#x2014;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>That question has been debated in this House. It was the policy of the country and the Government. Listening to the speech of the right hon. the member for Standerton, one would assume that nothing has been done during the three years this Government has been in office by way of reducing expenditure. But is that so? I do not know whether the hon. member did not go into the figures which I have supplied to this House in connection with this matter. I do not want to suggest that he tried to be unfair intentionally, but I do not think he stated the position correctly or fairly when he dealt with this question of reduction of taxation. I am going to give the figures to the House, and I would like hon. members opposite and the right hon. gentleman to tell me where they think that the conclusions that I have put before the House are incorrect or unreasonable. In 1924-&#x2019;25 we made certain amendments to the customs tariff, and we made a reduction in the tax on roll and pipe tobacco. We got in that year these figures which the right hon. gentleman does not dispute&#x2014;we got in that year a remission of £135,000 for the full year, or £104,000 for the portion of the year. Then we came to the next year, 1925-&#x2019;26. We then had a remission in connection with leaf tobacco of £200,000. There was the return to the penny postage, £100,000 for that year; the return to the farthing newspaper rate, £30,000, increase of income tax abatement for children, £30,000, repeal of turnover tax in all the provinces £215,000, repeal of the companies tax in the Cape £30,000.</p>

<p>I am going to argue that. The hon. gentleman is apparently indisposed to give me credit for a reduction in the provincial taxes. In arriving at his figure he discarded that, and also a few of the others, for instance, the abatement in the case of children, but I think probably he did not know about that. What is the position in regard to the provincial taxes? My action in having taken credit for these remissions in my claims in regard to the reduction of taxation has been questioned. What is the actual position? We had two systems of taxation when we dealt with the matter. We discussed the position with the provinces and an arrangement was arrived at. I told the provinces&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I will give you an increased subsidy to enable you to carry on, but in return for that I insist that certain taxes which are really an annoyance to the taxpayers shall be scrapped.</block>

<p>And these taxes were scrapped by legislation passed by this House, not by the provinces, as the result of that arrangement which we made. Is it not quite fair and reasonable on my part to say: &#x201C;If I give you more money I am going to repeal those taxes&#x201D;?

<p>If you take these figures, then instead of an increase during the year of £270,000, you have a credit of about £5,000.

That is undoubtedly the position.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The licences did not affect the position to that extent; it may have to a smaller extent in some of the provinces. Then we come to the next year. There is no dispute about this figure; I think the right hon. member accepts this figure with the exception of the employers&#x2019; tax in the Transvaal. What happened there was that it was agreed in Durban that that tax had to go. Before legislation was introduced into the House, for political or other reasons I was informed that the province would prefer to keep the tax. I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, but in that case, I shall reduce your subsidy.</block>

<p>Before the Bill was actually passed they changed their mind, and we then provided they would only get the tax for that year, and I reduced the subsidy for that year; but next year the tax was repealed, and I increased their subsidy. So hon. members will see that we are entitled to take credit for that. We come to this year, £215,000, and that figure is not disputed. If hon. members accept this basis, the only point in dispute will be the question of the licences. You get a total figure of £1,095,000. I think I can reasonably claim you should add to that £128,000 which we are now transferring from loan account to revenue. That has been the practice in the past under the previous Government, in the case of expenditure of this nature on buildings which are credited to loan account and which, under this new departure, are transferred from loan account.</p>

<p>It is not a remission.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>No. But for the purpose of my argument it decreases my ability to reduce taxation to that extent. That means we get a figure of £1,223,000, surrenders of revenue which have taken place during the three years. I do not think hon. members are entitled to say we have done nothing. I think we have not done badly at all. If the revenues continue to come in, if we do not have a slump or depression in the country, then it may be possible we shall be able to do more next year, unless, of course, the House decides not to honour its undertaking to face this question of old age pensions. I need not go into that question. Hon. members know that my predecessor dealt with the matter, and he definitely, on behalf of the previous Government, undertook that that question had to be faced. We have taken certain steps, also as the result of motions passed by this House instructing the Government to take action. The matter is being investigated by a commission, and we shall have that report during the recess, and I think we shall have in the near future to face the establishment of a reasonable scheme for our aged and infirm poor. That, of course, is something which I considered even when I framed the estimates for this year; that is a prospective liability upon the central Government which I shall have to shoulder. Accordingly, if we decide to honour our obligations in that respect, then it is doubtful whether <span class="col_2655-2656" refersTo="page_1399"/>even next year we shall be able to have that spectacular reduction in taxation which the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) is clamouring for. I just wish to deal shortly with the position of the reduction which has taken place in our unproductive debt. Here again let me say that I was disappointed to see the attitude which our hon. friends opposite adopted. Here again, certainly as far as I was concerned, I had no intention of trotting this out as a particular financial virtue or a wonderful achievement of the Government. I was very glad that I was able to give to the House and the country this improvement, this wonderful improvement which has taken place in this connection during a short period of three years. I did that with an object. We have from time to time, as a developing country going in for productive loan expenditure, we have to look to other countries for our loan requirements, and we are very glad if we are able to show the world how sound our position really is, and what we have been able to achieve during that period of three years, not as the result of a wonderful financial achievement of this Government, but as the result of the really healthy state of the finances and resources of this country. I did not hide anything. I explained very fully in my budget statement how this reduction was achieved. I did not claim it as a debt paid off by this Government, as the right hon. member wanted to make out. The position is simply this, that, according to this basis&#x2014;hon. members may disagree with the basis, but I think it is a fair basis to arrive at the exact position&#x2014;according to this basis, that is, where the interest which we pay on our debt is recovered from the objects of expenditure or whether the whole or a portion of that has to be raised by taxation, if we adopt that basis, then we arrive at the following position.</p>

<p>Which head do you put loans to the provinces under?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I am taking it that the provinces are paying interest; they are, and we hope they will continue to do so. We find that first there was the deficit on the revenue account at the 31st March, 1924, and forming portion of the existing debt was extinguished by the surplus for 1924-&#x2019;25, and the portion of the custodian surplus. That was £2,000,000. Then we get the debt extinguished out of the revenue surplus of 1925-&#x2019;26 sinking fund and custodian surplus, £2,700,000. Then there were mining leases, land sales, etc., and we get a surplus revenue for this year, and that gives you a total of £11,000,000. Then you get expenditure reaching the interest-bearing stage after being unproductive in the initial stages, for instance, the expenditure in connection with the Electricity Commission. When the previous calculation was made, they had not started to pay interest, and interest did not come into account that year. They are now paying their interest, and consequently this expenditure became productive. Then you get the saving of interest in connection with the conversion of the £9,000,000 loan not long ago. The figures I have given give another £3,000,000, and that makes £14,000,000. A word in regard to this custodian surplus. I regret to find that attempts are repeatedly being made to mix up what I might call a windfall with the general finances of the country, because they really have nothing to do with ordinary revenue. The right hon. member made an attempt, and other members said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, your revenue position is due to the custodian surplus.</block>

<p>Of course, hon. members know that not a penny of that surplus went into general revenue for the purpose of general revenue surpluses. A portion was used for the extinction of the revenue deficit which I found when I took office, and that is my one regret, that it was necessary to appropriate a portion of that amount for what was really not expenditure of a capital nature, which would be a lasting asset to this country, The right hon. gentleman has said I have gone about distributing largesse to my friends in the country. Was he quite fair in that? He knows what was done by the proceeds of these funds. A portion was used for roads, another for land settlement, and the full balance went in the reduction of debt. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) said I had frittered away this nest-egg. I think that that is very unfair, and attempts have been made to twit us with gaily using this money for the service of this country, so that we have taken up a different position from formerly. Hon. members know quite well that we at that time did not join in the general hue and cry that we should pursue a policy of frightfulness in regard to our late enemies, and it is to the lasting credit of this country that the Government at the time, and with the consent of our representatives, adopted a more generous attitude to our late enemies than the rest of the world did. As far as this surplus is concerned, we have restored to late enemy subjects all their property, and the only money we have taken is the profits in excess of a certain amount on investments which they had while the two countries were at war. No exception can be taken to the manner in which we appropriated the money; therefore I have no hesitation in appropriating the balance I find available in the manner I have done, in the interests of South Africa. We must be glad that the position is not as bad as some hon. members have tried to make out with regard to the position of the country. I think the position is very much sounder to-day than it has ever been. I have been criticized in connection with the disposal of the surplus, and criticized from my own side, but I have not carried out a policy which would bring me cheap popularity. My object has been to put and to maintain the finances in a sound position, and thereby to inspire confidence and strengthen the credit position of the country. I claim that during the three years many unsatisfactory features of the public finances were eliminated. We have returned to the practice <span class="col_2657-2658" refersTo="page_1400"/>of balanced budgets, and we retain that. We have made more satisfactory provision for debt redemption, and we are meeting our liabilities with regard to our pension funds. We have definitely abandoned the practice which existed of appropriating moneys destined for loan purposes for revenue purposes. I can only say that nobody subscribes more fully than I do to the sound maxim of living within our means, of living without extravagance, and reducing taxation if possible. But we must take into account the realities of the situation. We have arrived at a stage where a check has been placed on progressive expenditure. The country is developing, and it is becoming more prosperous. We have raised more taxation, but we have not raised the incidence of taxation. We have done away with a number of nuisance taxes&#x2014;taxes which annoy the public, and which do not bring in much money, and we have contracted the field of taxation. It is only as the result of the general prosperity of the country that taxation has yielded more than it did formerly. Taking into account the necessity of development in a young and undeveloped country, I think our people can be considered fortunate that the financial position of the country is so sound to-day If the burden is compared with that of other countries, taxation is not heavy. Every one of us would like to see that burden reduced, but it is not right to say that we are carrying heavier burdens than other countries are doing.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with some of the other and interesting points that have been raised at this stage, and I think it will be better to deal with these matters of policy in regard to the different votes of Ministers. Just a word in regard to the differences in the subsidies payable to certain provinces which has been raised by certain hon. members. Here again I very much regret that this question is being raised in the manner in which it is being done. Hon. members know very well that we adopted this basis as a result of the careful investigation made by two commissions which had been appointed by the previous Government. The whole thing is based on the generally accepted principle of local allowances payable in certain centres&#x2014;that the cost of living is more in certain centres than in others. The commission laid down that there should be a different basis for different provinces, and the whole thing was laid down on these lines. Now, after three years, when an election is on, we have this trotted out again. The right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) does not subscribe to that, and I do not think that the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) does, but it is regrettable that a certain section of the party opposite have brought this forward again. This is one of the greatest pieces of political hypocrisy and humbug that we have had for a long time&#x2014;to make this the object of attack when hon. members know the history of this already. I do not agree with the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) on this point. He did not raise this question three years ago, I think, when it was adopted in the House, but if the hon. member is right, he would have to advocate the sweeping away of the present basis which exists in regard to allowances paid to public servants, because the whole tiling is based on that. I have been criticized by hon. members in various parts of the House, and especially hon. members on the cross benches, as to the disposal of the surplus; but on reflection, hon. members will agree that this is the soundest course we have adopted. Although we have provided in future that revenue surpluses need not necessarily be applied to debt redemption, and may be carried forward, I think it would be a mistake if we should do so and complicate the accounts of subsequent years by surpluses which have been obtained in previous years. I hope that it will be possible for me and my successors in future, in certain cases to continue to apply surpluses in this way, and that was contemplated when we passed the Act last year. Although in the past applying surpluses to debt redemption was much neglected, and we hope to apply surpluses in the future to debt redemption, at least the surpluses should be carried forward to capital, and not revenue, purposes. There may be a heavy importation of goods and heavy customs receipts one year, and they only come into consumption during the next year, and would be legitimate revenue. But as to general revenue, I hope this sound course will be adopted, to strengthen our credit position by the application of revenue surpluses in this manner. I have been asked to raise the income tax abatement by several hon. members&#x2014;the abatement in regard to children. As I pointed out last year, our abatements are very generous. With the £400 abatement and the abatement for children, in the case of a man with three children it gives a total exemption of £600. We eliminated several thousands of income tax payers, and I do not think we can reasonably be asked to go further at present. We have a comparatively small white population, and we can raise the revenues we do only if we distribute that burden. If we adopt the policy of steepening that tax in the upper circles and tax the richer people out of existence, you would not raise the revenue you require unless you spread it over the people. Also here, again, if we intend to shoulder that old age pension scheme, of course it becomes more impossible to consider any suggestion of this nature. I think I shall not keep the House any longer. In a debate like this it is impossible to deal with all the questions that have been raised, and I hope, after my hon. friend (the Minister of Railways and Harbours) has dealt with the railway position, the House will agree to this motion, and not support the amendment which has been moved by the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts).</p>

I agree with my colleague that it is far better that points of local interest only should be dealt with in committee on the estimates. I desire to deal with a few outstanding points of general criticism which have been raised by hon. members opposite. I first wish to say a few words regarding the preparation of branch line statistics. The criticism has been fairly general that by abolishing the publication of these statistics the Government is taking a wrong step and is keeping information from the country. The saving effected through the non-publication is, according to the officers best able to judge, £11,000, which is not an inconsiderable figure. The basis we have adopted is purely an arbitrary one. We credit 10 per cent. of the earnings on the main line to the branch line, both on incoming and outgoing traffic. In Australia and India the credit is 40 per cent. and I am told that in New Zealand the whole of the traffic is credited to the branch lines on which it originates. After all, what would be the actual value to the country of these statistics. I repeat that if any hon. member desires particulars regarding any branch line I am always willing to give it. We have the returns, but we don&#x2019;t employ the necessary clerks to take out the statistics unless they are particularly asked for. There is, however, no desire to keep any figures from the House. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) has advocated the preparation of statistics regarding ton mileage. I have investigated the matter and find that the preparation of these statistics will cost at least £18,000.</p>

<p>I am rather doubtful whether results would justify that expenditure. The right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) has dealt with the question of the export coal rates. I agree that the export of coal is a matter of very great importance, but evidently the right hon. gentleman has not studied the question. Our export coal rate is only 8d. per ton higher than it was pre-war and the whole position with regard to export coal is dominated by the freight question to the eastern market. A reduction of 8d. would not assist the exporters of coal for there would have to be a far greater reduction if there is to be any benefit. The shipping freights are the dominating freights, and they have gone up. I hope that is only temporary, for our coal exporters are experiencing great difficulty in retaining their markets. They have to compete with Australian, Welsh and Japanese coal. Well, I am prepared to take every necessary step to assist the coal exporters but the reduction of 8d. would mean the surrender of revenue we badly want, and would not assist the position. I have indicated to the collieries that if they are prepared to make a reduction in the pit&#x2019;s mouth price of coal I am prepared to consider the matter. The hon. member for Umvoti (Mr. Deane), perhaps in order to support his leader, made certain complaints regarding the working of the grain elevators. The hon. member, although he promised to hand me the papers, has not done so. He told the House that the complaints were made about the middle of March, but so far neither the department nor I have received any particulars. He said the conditions were a disgrace as far as the elevators were concerned. Last year we handled 700,000 bags of maize and received only five complaints from Natal, in regard to maize delivered against No. 2 certificates and of these complaints four were found to be groundless. In one instance a mistake had been made which was immediately rectified. On the other hand I have received two totally unsolicited testimonials to the grain elevator system. On April 8 Messrs. Frenkel and Co. telegraphed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As extensive dealers elevator maize we strongly repudiate Mr. Deane&#x2019;s statement local press. We consider his remarks constitute gross exaggeration and quite unjustifiable. We are perfectly satisfied with grade and condition of maize received ex elevator system. We have taken out for local consumption approximately 8,500 tons from September last, and have not had a single complaint as regards quality and weights.</block>

<p>I have had the following telegram from the managing director of the Vereeniging Milling Company&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My attention has been drawn to statements made by Mr. Deane in the House in connection with the grain elevator system, in which if he is correctly reported he stated that the grain elevator system was a, disgrace, that when grain was received by the merchant from the elevators he found it was not the quality which has been paid for, etc. In the circumstances I think it only fair for me to state that my company has done very considerable business through the grain elevator system, has found the system to be run most efficiently and over a period of years has had no reasonable cause for complaint. So far as quality of mealies is concerned my company has always received what it paid for.</block>

<p>I can only repeat why does not the hon. member bring the complaints to which he refers to the notice of the department. Why cry stinking fish over the elevator system? I do not say that system is perfect and that mistakes do not sometimes happen, but I do say that the system is efficient and is a credit to the officers controlling it. Therefore, a statement of the kind made by the hon. member for Umvoti was unjustified and should never have been made. The hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) has dealt with the question of railway rates, and has quoted certain figures from New South <span class="col_2661-2662" refersTo="page_1402"/>Wales and Victoria. Let me remind him of the record of the South African party with regard to this question of rates. It is not a pleasant record. During the years 1910 to 1913 when the railways were under the guidance of the late Mr. Sauer&#x2014;one of the best, if not the best, Minister of Railways we have ever had&#x2014;the decreases were £465,000, £121,500 and £750,000. On the other hand during 1916-&#x2019;1917&#x2014;</p>

<p>It shows that both companies and Governments have found it necessary to increase their rates, and that is probably what has happened in New South Wales and Victoria. The South African railway tariff provides for the issue of excursion tickets at single fare for the return journey. In New South Wales and Victoria the return fares are double the single fare and excursion fares exceed the single fare. New South Wales&#x2019; fares, quoted by the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour), have been increased to a level above those of South African railway fares, and advantages are enjoyed by the South African public by reason of the cheap excursion tickets both ways. I want to give first the single fares in Victoria compared with South Africa. 50 miles: Victoria, 9s. 9d.; South Africa, 9s. 6d. 100 miles; Victoria, 18s. 11d.; South Africa, 19s. 150 miles: Victoria, £1 8s.; South Africa, £1 8s 200 miles: Victoria, £1 17s. 9d.; South Africa, £1 17s. 250 miles: Victoria, £2 7s. 2d.; South Africa, £2 6s. 300 miles: Victoria, £2 12s. 9d.; South Africa, £2 15s. 350 miles: Victoria, £2 18s. 5d.; South Africa, £3 3s. 3d.</p>

The hon. member has referred to the expected deficit of £146,424, and, in his recklessness, in the desire to score a point, justly or not, he made a statement that I was budgeting for another deficit next year. It is a point of small importance, because time will show, but it does show the recklessness of the hon. member when he makes such statements without investigation. The fact is just the opposite. The hon. member forgets I have carried forward £21,844 from last year, and that reduces the estimated deficit to £124,580.

<block name="quote">A deficit of £146,424 is proof that the railways are badly managed; that there is overstaffing, etc.</block>

<p>That is no proof. The hon. member will have to search further into the records before asking the country to believe that just because in one particular year there is a deficit of £146,424 that the railways are badly run. I want now to deal with the statement of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) that the expenditure has increased during my regime by £1,410,000. When he made that statement he overlooked the fact that that was the increase on the three services, harbours and steamships included. The figure for the railways is £1,350,767, and he forgets that during those years there has been a decrease in rates of £1,250,000. So that is set off. I could very easily have maintained the revenue if I had not reduced the rates. When the hon. member speaks of an increase of £1,350,767 he forgets this decrease in the rates. Of course, he conveniently forgets it. He also gives a further figure which I want this House to consider. Since 1923-&#x2019;24, he states, <span class="col_2665-2666" refersTo="page_1404"/>the increase of revenue has been 17¾ per cent., while the expenditure has increased by 25 per cent. Let us look at the facts. Railway revenue during this period has increased by £4,056,349, but to that must be added, if the hon. member wants to get the true per cent., the reduction in rates of £1,250,000. You then have a figure of £5,306,349. The expenditure has increased by £5,407,116, but the hon. member forgets that the expenditure includes two items, the first being provision for renewals. Surely there are very few members in this House, even on the other side, who would agree to the proposal to take 7 per cent. of the revenue towards renewals</p>

<p>That is going to be done, I think. I am awaiting the report of the departmental committee and I hope we shall be able to do it. The hon. member forgets that included in that figure is the extra provision which we had to make for renewals, £238,375 additional contribution to the renewals fund. My predecessor adopted a basis which was purely arbitrary, namely, 7 per cent. of the revenue in a particular year. For purposes of comparison the fact remains that we made this additional contribution up to £238,375 to the renewals fund and there is another fact that must not be lost sight of and that is that we made a contribution of £163,789 as increased provision towards the deficiency in the railway pension fund. If hon. members take these figures they will see that our expenditure is reduced by £402,165 and you get an expenditure of £5,004,961, which is equal to an increase in expenditure of 23 per cent. while the revenue has increased by 23.2 per cent. I put it to the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), is it fair to say that our revenue has increased by 17¾ per cent. and our expenditure by 25 per cent.? Was it not his duty to inform the country and the House that we have made this provision which he did not make and that changes the whole aspect of the matter? There has been some reference to the cost of running these railways. I have had the figures taken out from the year book available.

<p>And so had the South African party Government with much bigger figures. That proves nothing. The hon. member (Mr. Jagger) wants to draw a red herring across the trail in regard to this particular point. The fact is that a saving such as we have effected <span class="col_2667-2668" refersTo="page_1405"/>redounds to the credit of our officers, and I paytribute to the general manager and the officers and men who have been able to effect this. With all the talk about inefficiency, about which I shall say a word later on, here is the proof positive that our railways at the present time are being run economically. But the right hon. gentleman, in his anxiety to blacken this Government, paid no attention to a very material fact that I disclosed to the House. I said to the House in my budget statement that, as a result of the fact that the tractor force of our locomotives has increased enormously during this period, the train loads have increased, which means that you are running fewer train miles and, consequently, if you had the tractor force which operated under my hon. friend, our saving would be very much more. Surely that is clear to him.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) is just beginning to see light, because, judging by his speech, he was very much in the dark. If the tractive force had remained the same, we would have saved £800,000. I now come to the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) with regard to our running expenses. He made a statement last year, and he repeated it this year, that I have frittered away the position achieved by my predecessor; that there was a surplus in 1923-&#x2019;24 of £1,450,267, and now I am frittering it away. These are his words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After three years that work has been frittered away. It is lost and gone.</block>

<block name="quote">frittering away?</block>

<p>He does not, because he presses for a further reduction. Does he consider that my making contributions to the renewals fund, building up reserves, is &#x201C;frittering away&#x201D;? A contribution of close on £200,000 to the deficiency in the pension fund&#x2014;is that &#x201C;frittering away&#x201D;? In 1919, when the valuation took place, did the previous Government face it?

<p>In 1921 there was a revenue of £27 298,873, and you talk about bad times. It is absurd. Let me go further. We have increased the benefits to the staff under the Pensions Act; it is costing £237,000. Is that frittering away the surplus? We have increased the benefits of the hours of duty Ito the extent of £240,000. Not as done by the previous Government, holus bolus, without any consideration for the interests of the public. Last year there was silence all the time. We never had a word from the Opposition. I put it finally whether making a contribution from revenue of a quarter of a million of non-interest bearing capital, saving it up for the people, is frittering it away.&#x201D; If not, what becomes of the allegations, the reckless statements of the right hon. member? Here you have close on £2,500,000, and no-one has a word to say about any item. Yet he comes and makes loose, irresponsible, reckless statements, and I can only say this to him&#x2014;that the country has found him out, and the railwaymen have found him out.

I say this, and I say it deliberately, that if these statements cannot be substantiated, they are disgraceful.

These officers gave me a preliminary report giving the Lad scheme regarding the admission of youths to the service. I felt that unless we could carry the members of the staff with us we should be in for trouble, and I then referred these preliminary proposals to the Conciliation Board, which I asked to deal with the matter. They did so, but unfortunately they came to the conclusion that these proposals were so unacceptable that they were not even prepared to accept any part of them. When that happened, the organization and development committee went into the matter further, subsequently sending in a further report. I also asked the department to give assistance in evolving an acceptable scheme. When the official report of the organization and development committee was received, I again referred it to the Conciliation Board, for I felt that we must have the staff with us.

<p>I agree that the final result and the scheme should be published, and it will be done. Whatever the defects of the old system may have been&#x2014;and I am the first to admit that the old scheme had its defects&#x2014; we are taking thousands of men into the service. Hon. members opposite have criticized the Government very severely for doing this, but I stand unabashed. Here we had thousands of men unemployed, and the Government said it was far better to take these men into the service as native wastage occurred, and then have a close, careful and scientific investigation, so as to place the whole matter on a sound basis. Now we have the agreement and the cordial co-operation of all grades of the staff and the whole matter thrashed out, we are on an absolutely sound basis. Hon. members have asked why the Government does not continue to publish the figures showing the extra cost of this system. We can bring in a far larger number of natives at a much lower wage into all grades of the service. In Portuguese East Africa natives occupy important positions of trust. It is quite conceivable that a Government might be so foolish as to bring in a large number of natives and allow them to proceed to various positions. Do hon. members not see we should then have to continue the system of accounting as to what the difference is between the employment of a white man as an engine driver or a native at a low wage? That is the principle. I admit that while the scheme was not on a sound basis, and we were still experimenting and investigating, it was right that Parliament should know what the scheme was costing. Now the scheme is on a sound basis, and we are getting full value for our money.

The thanks of the country are due to the three senior officers and those who co-operated with them in bringing in this valuable report. Our thanks are due to the Conciliation Board in finding the scheme which is operating at the present time and which will place the whole matter on a sound basis. Consider now how we have made provision for the youths of the country who were in many cases running the streets without employment. We admit them as probationers. If they are not satisfactory in the first period of 12 months, they are not taken into the service. If they show they are capable and give indications that they will make good railwaymen, we admit them to the learner grade, learner checkers,. learner cleaners, learner shunters, and, if they prove they are suitable, they are put on the graded staff, and in future we shall be training our young men to run the railway service. Apprentices are being taken, 50 per cent. by competitive examination and 50 per cent. from the workshops. Instead of a word of credit to the men who have given their time to evolving a scheme which the hon. member will admit has placed the matter on a sound basis, instead <span class="col_2675-2676" refersTo="page_1409"/>of a word of praise, not for the Government, but for the men who have co-operated with us, instead of that, what have we had?

<p>I am glad of this interlude, not only because it has given me a little rest, but it now gives me an opportunity as well of correcting a misstatement. I did not charge the people of Natal with an organized agitation, but I charged the Natal press, and I mentioned the names of the papers. I never mentioned the people of Natal. I am glad to say that there are many citizens in Natal, many voters in Natal, both English and Dutch-speaking, who do not countenance any organized agitation of that sort. Let us test out what&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the sane and moderate policy</block>

<p>of civilized labour is of the S.A. party. I refer to the years 1922-&#x2019;23. I am now going to give the official figures disclosing the policy of the S.A. party while in power. I find that at the end of December, 1922, there were 4,756 European labourers in the service, and at the end of December, 1923, there were 4,390, <span class="col_2677-2678" refersTo="page_1410"/>a decrease in one year in European labourers of all classes&#x2014;permanent, temporary, casual, piece-workers&#x2014;of 366. Taking the position in regard to non-Europeans, I find that on December 31, 1922, there were 38,970 non-Europeans in the service. The corresponding figures for natives were 29,331. At the end of December, 1923, the corresponding figures are 44,699 non-Europeans, 33,082 natives, an increase, therefore, in the non-European staff of 5,729. Of course, that is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the sane and moderate policy</block>

<p>of civilized labour, and the support given to it by the S.A. party. Well, it did not stop there, for my predecessor took further steps. He removed the European labourers from branch lines, and in order to make it most difficult for the man to follow his employment he broke down the dwelling houses. That was the sane and moderate execution of a civilized labour policy.</p>

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. member think he is going to dictate to me what I say in this House? No, when hon. members opposite carried out this policy, what they lost sight of was that they treated this as relief work. That is the cardinal mistake they made, and it is only now that it has been placed on a sound, scientific basis that they fail to appreciate the change that has come, and they are crying out against a policy which is in the interests of the public. These men are doing an honest day&#x2019;s work. These men&#x2014;I honour them. I do not say this for any ulterior reason. Many of these men were owners of farms all over the Union. Drought and distress and other difficulties upset them, and they were driven off the farms, and I honour the South African who is not too proud to work, even if it is with a pick and shovel. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Sir William Macintosh) may say this is melodrama; he probably will say so, and hon. members will say so, but I say that when South Africans, whether Dutch or English, are still prepared by the sweat of their brow to earn an honest day&#x2019;s wage then we have reason to be proud of our people. It hurts me that a fellow South African should refer to these men as civilized loafers. I can quite understand that the right hon. member for Standerton is saying, as he said last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Oh for a Jagger to carry on the railways.</block>

<p>I can quite understand his saying that, but the people of South Africa will not, I feel sure, endorse the policy that was carried out by the previous Government, but will give their approval to the policy which is being carried out by the present Government. There is no reason whatsoever why the policy of civilized labour, carried out on sound economic lines, should not form a part of our railway system in the future, and no reason why we should not get full value from a large number, probably larger even than to-day, of civilized men working for a low wage I admit, but honestly working and receiving a salary and, at the same time, receiving training which will assist them to make their homes in South Africa, and in that way help to build up South Africa.</p>
