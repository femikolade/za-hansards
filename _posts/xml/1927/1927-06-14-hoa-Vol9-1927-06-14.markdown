<heading>Sheep Scab: at Dundee.</heading>

<question by="#anderson" to="#minister_of_agriculture">

<num>I.</num>

<from>Mr. ANDERSON</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Agriculture:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether it is true that a flock of sheep belonging to a Mr. Gregory recently arrived in the Dundee district, Natal, from the Orange Free State badly infected with scab;</li>

<li>(2) if so, (a) for what period of time is it estimated this flock had been so infected, and (b) how many miles of clean country did this flock traverse before the disease was detected;</li>

<li>(3) what action does the Minister propose to take (a) to cause a thorough investigation of the scab position in the district in the Orange Free State in which the flock in question had been running, and (b) to deal with the apparent carelessness and inefficiency of the inspectors responsible for allowing this infected flock to be moved; and</li>

<li>(4) how does the Minister reconcile the existence of scab in this flock with his claim that the Orange Free State is free from scab?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_agriculture" to="#anderson">

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes, two flocks.</li>

<li>(2) (a) In each case estimated at about three months; (b) 40 and 50 miles respectively.</li>

<li>(3) (a) A thorough investigation is being made; (b) will be decided in the light thereof.</li>

<li>(4) I am not prepared to discuss this aspect of the matter until all the circumstances of the case have been disclosed by the investigation now proceeding. As is well known scab is a disease which as a result of conveyance of infection may break out at any time.</li>

<from>Mr. ANDERSON</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Railways and Harbours:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether Mr. W. Heckroodt, second grade clerk from the station master&#x2019;s office, Kroonstad, has been appointed as acting district inspector, Bloemfontein, vice first grade district inspector Joy, who is absent on sick leave;</li>

<li>(2) upon what date did Mr. Heckroodt (a) join the service of the Administration and (b) receive his appointment as second grade clerk;</li>

<li>(3) over how many first &#x201C;B&#x201D; and second grade station masters has Mr. Heckroodt been preferred for the appointment of acting district inspector, Bloemfontein; and</li>

<li>(4) what are his special qualifications for the appointment referred to?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours" to="#anderson">

<from>The MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes; but to the extent only that he has been seconded temporarily for duty as district inspector.</li>

<li>(2) (a) 13th July, 1908; (b) 12th July, 1920.</li>

<li>(3) The appointment of Mr. Heckroodt to act in the position of district inspector, Bloemfontein, was made by the assistant general manager, Bloemfontein, who was apparently satisfied that Mr. Heckroodt, on account of his excellent qualifications, should have an opportunity to act in the position. It is the general practice when making appointments of the nature under review to confine the selection to the division or system concerned. There is no question of promotion involved or that 1.B. and second grade station masters competent to carry out the duties have suffered any disability.</li>

<li>(4) Mr. Heckroodt is regarded as an excellent all-round railway official and is a qualified station master, in addition to which he is fully bilingual, which is a desirable qualification in the position in which he is acting. He is also a qualified shorthand writer in both English and Afrikaans.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_agriculture" to="#swart">

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) 4,969 English, 3,639 Afrikaans as at 31st March, 1927.</li>

<li>(2) 1,500 English, 650 Afrikaans. This is due to an enormous reduction on the former free list.</li>

<li>(3) On first year completed 31st March, 1927, the loss was £1,879, but it is hoped that this loss will be extinguished as circulation increases. On the former journal of the department the annual loss averaged £4,289. It will be seen that a considerable reduction of the loss has been made since the issue of the new publication which took the place in the journal of the department. The financial loss on the publication can be regarded as being but small in view of the excellent purpose which is being served by the publication which on all sides is admitted as of the greatest use in keeping the farming population in touch with the development of agriculture.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_agriculture" to="#brown">

<from>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) It is known that drought persists in the Sunday&#x2019;s River Valley, but it cannot be accepted that Hall&#x2019;s theory of cloud precipitation has been successful in America, as the American Government has been carefully watching the efforts to produce lain and so far has not had sufficient confidence in them to undertake such experiments on behalf of the State where the climatic conditions are similar to those of this country.</li>

<li>(2) Every effort will be made to secure an aeroplane and pilot but all costs of the service must be borne by the interested parties. It must also be mentioned that it may be a dangerous undertaking and consequently if any loss of life should happen, they must be held responsible for compensation as well.

<heading>NATAL PROVINCIAL COUNCIL.</heading>

<speech by="#nicholls">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your indulgence and that of the House, may I invite your attention to the fact that on Tuesday last a member of the Natal Provincial Council moved the adjournment of that Chamber for the purpose of calling attention to the rejection by you of certain resolutions passed by the provincial council on the question of (1) South African Nationality and flag Bill; (2) the Indian agreement. The resolutions were forwarded to you for communication to this House, and were returned with an intimation that you found yourself unable to present them to this House as the representations sought to be submitted to Parliament did not fall within the scope of the provisions of Section 87 of the South Africa Act. With submission, sir, may I ask whether you would be prepared to make a statement for public information as to your reasons for rejecting these resolutions, especially in view of the fact that a resolution from the Natal Provincial Council on the Indian question was communicated by you to this House on the 28th July, 1924. And may I ask, sir, whether you would be prepared to accept these resolutions if they were so altered in their phraseology as to come within the section of the South Africa Act quoted, by definitely recommending legislation of a certain character since the exclusion of these resolutions from this House may conceivably be taken to deny the provincial council the privilege of representing to Parliament its considered opinion on the questions referred to?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) was good enough to inform me that he intended to ask these questions and I will deal with them at once. I may say that on receipt of the resolutions I discussed the matter with the President of the Senate and we came to the conclusion that they did not fall within the scope of section 87 of the South Africa Act and therefore could not be formally communicated to Parliament. In my opinion section 87 of the South Africa Act does not entitle a provincial council to have formally communicated to this House any and all resolutions it may wish to pass with regard to intended legislation before Parliament. I think that a reference to sections 85, 86 and 87 of the South Africa Act will at once show that section 87 is intended to meet the case where a provincial council finds that it has no power to pass legislation which it considers necessary for the Province. In such cases the provincial council may recommend to Parliament the passing of the law or laws which it deems necessary. That is what was done in the resolution which was communicated to this House on 28th July, 1924, and to which the hon. member for Zululand has referred. In effect that resolution was a recommendation to Parliament to pass legislation which the council considered to be necessary for Natal and which it was not competent to pass itself.</p>

<p>Section 87 of the South Africa Act provides an exception to the salutary rule that no resolutions of outside bodies should be formally communicated to this House and if that section were to be construed more widely than I have indicated above it would mean that whenever legislation of a general nature is under consideration of Parliament every provincial council will have the right to pass resolutions with regard thereto and to have such resolutions formally communicated to this House. In my opinion that was never contemplated by the South Africa Act. For these reasons the resolutions of the Provincial Council of Natal to which the hon. member has referred were not communicated to the House but were returned to His Honour the Administrator. The resolutions in the one case urge Parliament to reject the Nationality and Flag Bill and stated reasons for such a case, and in the other case they protested against the ratification of the Indian Agreement by Parliament and expressed certain opinions thereon. In my opinion the resolutions in neither case were such as could be formally communicated to Parliament as being within the meaning of section 87.</p>

<p>The ordinary way in which the views and wishes of persons or bodies outside Parliament are made known to this House is through hon. members, and it would be contrary to all parliamentary practice to allow resolutions of any outside body to be officially and formally communicated to the House except in the case provided for by section 87 of the South Africa Act, namely, when a provincial council recommends to Parliament the passing of legislation affecting the province which that council is not competent to pass itself.</p>

<p>I may say that in 1919 the Provincial Council of the Orange Free State passed a resolution protesting against the Enemies Repatriation and Denaturalization Bill and it was sought to communicate the same to Parliament, but Mr. Speaker ruled that the resolution did not fall within the scope of section 87 of the South Africa Act_ and it was returned on 7th April, 1919. On 30th May of the same year a resolution of the Provincial Council of the Transvaal expressing apprehension at certain intended legislation and urging upon Parliament not to pass any measure having the effect of validating the illegal registration of companies formed for the purpose of holding land on behalf of Asiatic shareholders and further protesting against the legalization of certain licences granted to Asiatics, was returned on the same ground.</p>

<p>It will be seen therefore that the point has on previous occasions been considered and decided, <span class="col_5009-5010" refersTo="page_1165"/>but this is the first time that a statement by Mr. Speaker has been asked for.</p>

<p>With regard to the second question put by the hon. member I may point out that it is of a hypothetical nature and I am not prepared to say whether I would accept the resolutions if their phraseology were altered. I may, however, state that in my opinion the only resolutions of a provincial council which can be formally communicated to Parliament are those in which the Council in terms of section 87 of the South Africa Act &#x201C;recommends to Parliament the passing of any law relating to any matter in respect of which such Council is not competent to make Ordinances.&#x201D; If a provincial council decides to discuss legislation which is under consideration of Parliament and to express its disapproval thereof or of the actions of the Government it can send its resolutions to the Government or have its wishes made known to this House through hon. members of this House like any other body but it must not expect such resolutions to be formally communicated to this House under cover of section 87 of the South Africa. Act.</p>

<heading>SPEAKER&#x2019;S RULING (COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY).</heading>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to give my ruling in regard to the points raised in Committee of Supply on the 12th instant.</p>

<p>To entitle the mover of an amendment in Committee of Supply to the benefit of a forty-minutes&#x2019; speech under Standing Order No. 104 (3) there appear to be two essentials. First, the amendment must be bona fide intended to challenge the Minister&#x2019;s policy and not merely to enable the mover to evade the ten-minutes&#x2019; rule; and secondly, the matter to be discussed must be a single specific question of policy.</p>

<p>I do not think that it was the intention to grant to the mover of such an amendment a roving commission to launch a general attack on the Minister&#x2019;s policy on all matters for which he may be responsible. For instance, an honourable member who wishes, in Committee of Supply, to discuss all the policies of the Minister of Agriculture in the various departments under his control, could not, in my opinion, avail himself of the rule. The same applies to the various policies of the Minister of Railways and Harbours. If the rule is to be construed in such a way that more than one question of policy may be discussed then in principle there is no reason why all questions of policy should not be discussed and it would have been much easier to have laid down that two members could avail themselves of forty-minutes&#x2019; speeches on moving a reduction of the Minister&#x2019;s salary.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that a general discussion of policy takes place on the Budget debate, and, in my opinion, an honourable member under this rule, is confined in committee to the specific question of policy raised by him if he wishes to have the benefit of a forty-minutes&#x2019; speech. It seems to me also that if any other interpretation were placed upon the rule it would be very difficult indeed for the Chairman to know when to draw the line. Moreover, if members were to be allowed to make use of the rule merely to get in all they want to say on various matters, it would not be fair to those who really wish to challenge the Minister&#x2019;s policy on a definite question.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that the view expressed by the Chairman is the correct one.</p>

<p>I should now like to fulfil the promise which I made yesterday to the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) about the work of the House before the end of the session. I think the only matter of importance which does not appear on the Order Paper is the Nationality and Flag Bill. Besides this Bill, orders I to IX including the motion standing in my name will be disposed of as well as orders XIII and XIV, and the Bill on Railway construction, which is the order of the day for next Friday.

<p>We find under this head a decrease of £128,000 which on the face of it seems satisfactory, but to appreciate the position it is necessary to know what expenditure there has been from renewals fund.

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEUWENHUIZE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to put a question to the Minister in connection with what appears under this Vote for salaries and wages. I take it that it includes the wages that are paid to white railwaymen for maintenance of the permanent way. According to my information the wages for unmarried persons at present are from 3s. 6d. to 5s. 8d. a day up to their 21st year, and for married railwaymen 6s. 3d. a day. Unskilled labourers, however, under Government contracts are paid, according to certain stipulations of the Public Works Department, at the rate of 1s. an hour or 8s. a day. It goes without saying that this influences the view of the railwaymen because their work is also Government work. They naturally think that when others get 8s. a day they are also entitled to it. My question now is simply whether the Administration intends to increase the wages up to 8s. a day.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>In answer to the question of the hon. member I can only repeat what I said last night in answer to a question, viz., that it must not be forgotten that the young people who get the low wage are being trained for their life work, and if that is remembered the wage is not so low. We have the same principle in the trade union apprentices who are indentured for five years and earn a low wage. They are learning during that period. With regard to the old people who earn 6s. 3d. a day, I want to point out that besides free housing they have many other privileges such as the pension fund, free transport once a year for the worker&#x2019;s wife, etc. It is difficult to calculate the cash value of that.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Harbour (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) asked for information with regard to the allocations. He will find the particulars of expenditure from the renewals fund in the brown book. The allocation which is made on a particular work is done by the chief accountant.</p>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) I may say that, as intimated to the House, the company responsible for the delivery of these engines has agreed to supply us with the castings which failed in the first instance, and I understand that the engines are now giving satisfactory service.</p>

<p>&#x2020;*With regard to the question of the hon. member for Bethlehem (Dr. D. G. Conradie), I just want to say that there was some doubt at the commencement whether the policy of having tenders sent in in South Africa would be successful. I am glad to be able to say that the policy of the Government has been absolutely justified by the facts because, as the Government expected, nearly all the oversea firms who do business here sent agents to South Africa and opened offices here to carry on business, and in these offices people from South Africa are, of course, employed. A further benefit is that we find that the delivery of supplies is much expedited by the agents being in direct touch with us, and they look after the interests of the firm and see that speedy delivery is made. Another advantage&#x2014;it is strange that it is so&#x2014;is that the field of competition has been extended. Where formerly the High Commissioner&#x2019;s office had a certain number of firms on the list, we find now that the advertising is done in South Africa and tenders are opened here, that a large number of firms tender who formerly did not do so, and the result is that it is all to the good of the Administration. Finally I want to say that during the past year, 1926, more goods were purchased in South Africa, viz., to an amount of £1,420,000 than in 1925. That is a further justification of this good policy.</p>

<p>I would like to call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the items under &#x201C;coaching stock,&#x201D; where I see there is a decrease of £4,509. There are quite a number of complaints with regard to the condition of the rolling stock. I am not referring to the Union mail&#x2014;that is quite up-to-date&#x2014;but passengers complain that the coaching stock on other trains is very dirty and in a deplorable condition, and I think it is time that the Minister probably increased this vote so that the coaches may be put in proper repair and renovated. I desire to support the plea of the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) that tenders should be opened in public. I understand that the railway department endeavoured to try to meet the wishes of the public, and opened tenders in public in Johannesburg one day, but nobody put in an appearance, and the department turned the thing down. In the public works department a day is set apart when tenders are to be opened, and the public turn up. Probably on this occasion the railway department did not notify tenderers that tenders would be opened on that day. I think if the Minister were to adopt that method of fixing a day on which tenders would be opened, he would find that the public would attend.</p>

<p>I do not want to raise the general question of the control of the fund at the present moment, because I understand that representations are going to be made to the Minister next year with a view to revising the whole system. I want to deal more particularly with the appointment of R.M.O.&#x2019;s. Under the old regulations the District Sick Fund Board would recommend the appointment of a certain medical officer. That recommendation <span class="col_5015-5016" refersTo="page_1168"/>would then be referred to the Central Sick Fund Board, and if the board confirmed it, then that officer was appointed forthwith. A new regulation was promulgated in June, 1926, under which the appointments of railway medical officers, etc., are placed under the jurisdiction of the Central Board, but subject, however, to the approval of the Administration. I can assure the Minister that the members of the Central Sick Fund Board and of the District Sick Fund Boards and the railway servants are rather perturbed about the actual working of this regulation. Up to now there has been an elaborate series of sick fund regulations laying down definitely rules in regard to the appointment of certain officers, and suddenly a regulation is brought in which nullifies the work that the Central Sick Fund Board is responsible for, and I say that to do this is an interference with what I consider the rights and privileges of the staff. There may be some very cogent reason for altering the regulations in this way, but I can assure the Minister that the members of the Central Sick Fund Board consider that their rights should not have been taken away in this manner? I would be glad if the Minister would make a statement on this subject.</p>

There can be no question whatever that, to the utmost extreme, our coaching and other rolling stock should be built in this country. As far as Pretoria is particularly concerned, certain classes of repairs have been removed to Germiston, and that change has necessitated the removal of sixty or seventy workmen. We can have no objection whatever, of course, if it is in the interests of the country; and the department is bound to get work done in the best way; but it is essential that we should keep our undertaking in regard to utilizing the workshops for coach-building in Pretoria, so that men who are taken away from there may be replaced by others for this work.</p>

On the way back, the electric light gave out in my coach and we were four hours in the dark. When I was coming back here again the locks of the doors had not been attended to, and I had to get out three times in the night to close the door. This is my own personal experience of the way the rolling stock is maintained, on the line between here and Port Elizabeth, and I hope with this extra sum on the estimates, there will be an improvement.</p>

<p>I think the Minister has made a grave mistake in taking the appointment of medical officers away from the men themselves. Up to now the entire control of the sick fund has been in the hands of the staff. It is one of the things they appear to value highly, and to have taken away these privileges is, I think, entirely uncalled for. I would certainly urge my hon. friend to reconsider the whole matter. There is a full account on page 4 of the report of the Railways and Harbours Board, and they say they are going to leave in the hands of the sick fund board the whole of the other matters in connection with the fund, but the appointment of medical officers must be subject to the approval of the Railway Board. I think that my hon. friend has made a great mistake there.</p>

Unquestionably we have rolling stock in use which should have been on the scrap heap a long time ago.

<p>My hon. friend now says we have gone too far. I can only say that we have to make the best use of the rolling stock at the present time. If there are cases where carriages and coaches are not clean, that is a matter which should be dealt with. There is no reason why, even if a coach is old, it should not be perfectly clean. If hon. members will bring those cases to the notice of the officers concerned, they will look into it and see that the staff responsible is suitably dealt with. My hon. friend has also complained about delays on the Cape Central. Unfortunately, that is so, but I indicated when we took over the line that the condition of the permanent way was such that we could not run our heavy engines over the line. We must use a lighter engine, and many of them are of an old type. <span class="col_5017-5018" refersTo="page_1169"/>I am making provision for relaying, etc., a further section of the line, and I am hoping the whole of the line will soon be completed, and then the whole service will be re-organized. With regard to the point raised by the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Snow) with regard to the appointment of railway medical officers, let me make it clear that there is no intention on the part of the administration to interfere with the work of the sick fund board. They are still carrying on the business of the sick fund as they did before, and making all appointments with this exception, that when it comes to the question of railway medical officers, the appointments are made subject to the approval or disapproval of the Railway Board.</p>

<p>It is then referred back to them to make another appointment. We have not taken the power to appoint. The reason for this change is that it has been felt that as the administration, and as such, the users of the railways, the taxpayers, contribute 75 per cent. against 100 per cent. contributed by the staff of the revenue of the sick fund board, that it is only right that as medical men are taxpayers, that the administration should be responsible ultimately and finally for their appointment.</p>

<p>But we are all taxpayers. Are the members of the sick fund board not taxpayers?

By what ingenuity of reasoning does the Minister say this change is justified, because medical men are taxpayers? If my hon. friend had told me it was another example of that desire to increase the bureaucratic tendencies of my hon. friend and the Government in general, I could well understand it, and if he had told me it was in pursuance of a desire to keep their finger on every possible appointment so that they could carefully scrutinize the qualifications, not only from the professional point of view, but other qualifications as well of every person put in a Government post, then I think the committee could understand better what the reasons of the Minister were. I agree with the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) that the sick fund board have the confidence of the employees of the department. True, the men only pay a quarter of the contributions, and the State pays the other 75 per cent., but whether the State pays a larger portion or not, the sick fund board are the representatives of the men administering this fund, and the sick fund board, as such, are the people who should make these appointments without the assistance of the Minister.</p>

Because after all if the men who are members of the sick fund to which they contribute are dissatisfied with their medical attendant, that is their business, and it is not the business of the Government to tell them they must be satisfied with anybody the Government desires to put there. Does my hon. friend consider this is a very democratic means of administering a sick fund? Perhaps my hon. friend is thinking of some medical men who would like to become taxpayers, and whom he could assist by putting them into these positions.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. BROWN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the Minister&#x2019;s reply in regard to this sick fund question is very satisfactory. A fundamental change has been brought about in the sick fund board control without adequate justification. The only reason given by the Railway Board is that the appointments were open to a little criticism. Ever since the establishment of the fund up to the 22nd June, last year, the Railway Board has never interfered with the appointment of a medical officer and the recommendations of the sick fund board have been accepted. Yet during the present year strong recommendations by the sick fund board Have been set aside and appointments have been made by the Minister. That destroys the confidence which should exist as between the Railway Board, the sick fund board and the administration. To make a success of the fund, and to give confidence, there should exist between the two boards complete confidence and <span class="col_5019-5020" refersTo="page_1170"/>trust. The change that has been brought about has destroyed that position and is going to lead to a tremendous amount of friction with regard to this fund. If the Minister had given a good reason for the change we would have accepted it, but he has not done so; he has said that he and the Railway Board are the boss. That is how it appears to me. The sooner the Minister and the board get back to the old position the better for the fund and for the Administration. Members of the district sick fund board know better than the Railway Board sitting in Cape Town and Pretoria the men who should be appointed. In my own district four-fifths of the men sent a petition stating that they were satisfied with the medical man&#x2019;s services and asking him to be retained, but he has been passed over, and another appointment is to be made.</p>

I suggest to the Minister, for the sake of his own peace of mind, that he should go back to the old system.

The men&#x2019;s representatives, to put it bluntly, never had a perfectly square deal, and I am glad the change has been made by the Minister of Railways and Harbours.

<p>I have as much reason for speaking on this subject as anybody here. After seventeen years&#x2019; experience I may inform the committee that this system has given dissatisfaction to both medical men and employees, for a number of years it has been a cause of friction between them. Medical men have found the position untenable to a large extent, and employees could not get the men they wanted. Some criticism has been advanced to the effect that the Minister overrides; that cause cannot be advanced to prove the system has not been a success in the past. I am not going to prophesy that it is going in the end to reduce dissatisfaction, but it will prove to the public and the committee whether the new system will give more satisfaction than the one in the past. I agree with the closing remarks of the hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser)&#x2014;not the preliminary remarks&#x2014;that we must come to the position when we have to nominate or elect panels of men, so that employees may go to the men in whom they have most confidence.

<p>I also wish to protest against the suggestion made by the hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser). It is news to me that the ordinary man in the street or worker is concerned with the nationality of the doctor. I think the medical profession is looked upon as a universal profession, and the medical man people want is the best they can get, irrespective of whether he is Dutch or English&#x2014;especially when they are sick&#x2014;and the <span class="col_5021-5022" refersTo="page_1171"/>only thing they are worrying about is to get that relief and attention they feel they are entitled to. But I do say the Minister is wrong in taking up the position of criticising appointments or recommendations of the district boards, because if there is one thing these boards are in a better position to do it is in a matter of this description, because they are in closer contact with members of the sick fund and know the local conditions better. Generally they know who is most acceptable to the men. It does seem a curious thing that within twelve months four or five recommendations in Germiston and Pretoria have been turned down. The Minister would be wise to keep clear of this. The hon. member for Vrededorp mentioned the Crown Mines sick fund, where they had many difficulties, and where they are satisfied with the panel system as far as I can see, but before they got that working smoothly they had all sorts of difficulties and they had chaotic conditions for some time. As the hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) rightly put it, the relation between a man and his doctor goes much further than a business relationship. Leave it to the local people, who, after all, know what they want.</p>

Last year, however, the Minister said that he intended to make another experiment, probably at Bloemfontein. It came out clearly before the select committee last year that it was always the old bogey that in Durban the experiment had proved too expensive and that, therefore, the system could not be adopted. I should like the Minister to keep his promise of last year and make another experiment. When I am at Bloemfontein numbers of cases come to my notice of people who are dissatisfied with their treatment. Last year the general manager (Sir William Hoy) himself admitted to the select committee that there were numbers of railwaymen who, although they contributed to the sick fund, did not call in the doctor of the fund. They often have no confidence in the doctor, or otherwise he is unilingual, and it is awkward to have such a doctor in a family, but chiefly it is a question of confidence. There are other doctors who are willing to do the work for the same payment, and I cannot see how the panel system can work out so much more expensive. Then the people will be able to choose which of the panel doctors they want. What objection is there to it if the doctors are prepared to do the work for the same tariff. I can assure the Minister that this is a great grievance. I mentioned special cases on a former occasion. I hope the department will still see its way to arrange that the people who contribute to the sick fund will not be deprived of the benefits thereof, but will be satisfied, and be able to choose the doctor they want. It is an important matter, and we can well understand that when one is once accustomed to a doctor, and has confidence in him, you do not like in a case of serious illness to call in another doctor that you do not know and have no confidence in. I beg of the Minister to keep his promise and to make another experiment in one or other centre.</p>

<p>I spoke about this matter last year and suggested that the two chairmen of the medical councils, the chief medical officer of the Crown mines, and the chief railway medical officer should be appointed a small committee to go into the matter. It will not cost 3d., because they have offered to make an investigation to see whether the same system that is in force on the Crown mines cannot be introduced among the railwaymen. It will give great satisfaction. In connection with the remarks about the appointment of Dutch-speaking railway doctors, I may say that it is actually a fact that they had no chance in the past. The Dutch-speaking men tried repeatedly to have a Dutch-speaking railway doctor appointed in Johannesburg, but they always failed to secure it.</p>

<p>I should not like the debate to degenerate into a racial one. The question was raised by me because a matter of principle is involved. Although the men contribute to the sick fund more than the Administration does, the latter controls the Central Sick Fund Board because it nominates the chairman, who has the casting vote. It is not democratic that the Administration should have the power of veto on doctors selected by the board. It is a dangerous principle to interfere with the board&#x2019;s recommendations, and I would rather take the risk of an occasional unsatisfactory appointment being made, than to open the door to the worse possible kind of influence being brought to bear in making these appointments. The Central Sick Fund Board should have complete power to decide what is best in the interests of the contributors, as the members are either nominated by the Administration, or elected by the railway servants, and by interfering with the selection of doctors there is the danger of the contributors losing confidence in their own representatives, and such action I contend constitutes a slur on the personnel of the board, and also on its impartiality.</p>

Serious objections are being made this afternoon by certain hon. members to the curtailment of the powers of the Sick Fund Board. If the hon. member had been in the House he would have heard that I said that the Sick Fund Board was an entirely independent body, and that the only power of the Railway Board was to approve or disapprove of appointments. For the rest it is an independent body. I asked the Sick Fund Board to go fully into the panel <span class="col_5023-5024" refersTo="page_1172"/>system. It is now late in the session, but I am prepared to lay the report of the Sick Fund Board on the Table next year.

<p>I know that there are such cases, but the facts have all been brought to the notice of the Sick Fund Board. Notwithstanding that, it was not prepared to make further experiments.</p>

<p>&#x2020;As to the appointment of doctors, not only the chairman, but half the members of the Central Sick Fund Board&#x2019; are nominated by the Administration. No Minister, however, would ever think of interfering with the right of the nominated members to exercise their free judgment. I certainly have never attempted to do it, and no Minister should, in my opinion, attempt to do it. When you appoint responsible officers under such circumstances no Minister should dictate to them. They exercise their free judgment so that there is no question of control by the Administration of the actions of nominated members of the board. Hon. members do not seem to appreciate the position of medical men outside the number of those who have been appointed in the past. Medical men have the right to look to this House for protection in connection with appointments where public money is concerned.</p>

<p>We would then have to deal with the position in another way. The question of political jobbery or the appointment of a particular friend of a Minister or members of the board does not arise, because the final appointment is made by the Sick Fund Board. It is not as if the Administration had taken the powers of appointment out of the hands of the Sick Fund Board. I must differ radically from the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. Christie), who said: &#x201C;Never mind whether the doctor is bilingual or not.&#x201D; Can he maintain that position with justice when about 75, per cent. of the lower-paid men are Afrikaansspeaking and many of them and members of their families are unable to understand English? My hon. friend says I must not carry it too far. If there are two doctors, A and B, and one is bilingual, and one is only partially bilingual, then you would undoubtedly appoint A. I do not want to go into each case, but if hon. members desire it, I am prepared to enter into each case mentioned and give the House particulars.

<p>I have come much into touch with poor people in Pretoria, and I can assure the House that there is much dissatisfaction about the railway doctors. I think that the system of appointments now being tried will be a solution of the difficulty. It is not a question whether the Sick Fund Board is dissatisfied or not, but whether the railway officials and workers are dissatisfied. Hitherto the railway people have been dissatisfied with the railway doctors they have had. The poor people in Pretoria are dissatisfied with the railway doctors because they say the latter are not sympathetic. The railway doctors come in for a moment, hardly examine the sick person, write out a prescription, and leave. The result is that some of the people go to other doctors. When a married woman is dissatisfied with a railway doctor she goes to another doctor and her husband has to pay for it. The Railway Board will now have the final decision about the appointments, and I want the new system to be given a chance to see whether the people will be satisfied with the doctors they will now have. If that is not the case, then the panel system will have to be resorted to. At present the people are dissatisfied, and the sooner there is contentment the better. It will be in the interests of discipline and the railway service. I trust that the Railway Board will now act more satisfactorily than was the case in the past. The object should be to satisfy the railway officials because a part of their salaries is deducted.</p>

If the Railway Board had come forward and said that they found the Control Board had used their power in an improper manner, then the House would have said quite right, the Railway Board had the right to take the power out of the hands of the Control Board.

<p>Then I want to suggest, don&#x2019;t carry the question of bilingualism too far in the appointment of a doctor. The science of medicine being universal should be the first consideration. If a doctor can exercise <span class="col_5027-5028" refersTo="page_1174"/>his professional functions with satisfaction to himself, and to the patient, by having enough knowledge of the two languages, that should be sufficient. A large number of workmen are Dutchmen, and they are not so discriminating in that respect. They want the best, whether Englishman, Dutchman or Jew. Do not apply this discrimination of bilingualism too much against the doctors. The proof of the pudding is in the selection the men make themselves with regard to a doctor. I submit that the Minister ought to be very careful in regard to this matter. One cannot sufficiently emphasize this fact that the local boards and the Central Board, in direct touch with the men themselves, having made this recommendation, having decided that this man is a suitable man, certainly know much better than the Minister or the Railways Board ever know. After all, they are the people who have to put up with these men once they are appointed. Therefore, I think you ought to leave it to them, and you will save yourself a great deal of trouble, and you will certainly satisfy the 75 per cent.</p>

Men in responsible positions, I understand, are placed on the roster to work 12 and 13 hours a shift. There is altogether too much overtime being worked in connection with this department.The aspect which appeals to me rather in this connection is that we have been recently discussing the question of unemployment, and I want to point out to the Minister that by reducing the enormous amount of overtime being worked, he can do a great deal towards applying a remedy for the unemployment problem. There is also the social side. Men who are working long hours are deprived of the ordinary amenities of home life, and these long hours have a bad effect on them physically and mentally. There are hundreds of civilized labourers working on the railways who would be only too glad to be trained to fill some of the positions that might be created if this systematic overtime were reduced, and we should certainly be brought a step nearer to the accomplishment of what I wish to see, i.e., the <span class="col_5029-5030" refersTo="page_1175"/>re-introduction of the eight-hour day, as recommended by the Hours of Duty Committee.</p>

<p>In regard to the question raised by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) I may say that if it were not for the fact that we are taking power from the Colenso power station, our coal and wood bill would have been very much more. Traffic is increasing all the time, and that is the reason for the increase in this vote. In regard to the point raised by the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Snow) I agree with him that in normal circumstances one does not want to see overtime worked to any great extent, and I am glad to say that there is a tendency for overtime to drop. Of course, he will appreciate the point which I made earlier this session that, with seasonal traffic in South Africa as it is we must either have a very large staff capable of dealing with the traffic at its peak, or we must have a smaller staff dealing with the traffic at peak periods with overtime. During February and March there has been a tendency for overtime to drop. I am afraid now it will go up again owing to the maize season. There will be this seasonal traffic which will have to be dealt with. If you take a man into the service, he naturally wants to get on to the permanent staff. That means an increase in the pension contributions, sick fund contributions, etc. We, therefore, do not want to overstaff, but at the same time I agree with the principle that we should not work overtime regularly.</p>

<p>I see from this head that the total increase is £241,536, of which £206,557 represents increased salaries and wages. I would like to take the Minister over the running and traffic expenses for the last four years. In the first year, 1924-&#x2019;25, the train miles increased by 5,000,000, while the running expenses increased by £170,000 and the traffic expenses decreased by £20,000. In the following year we find the increase in train mileage is practically the same, and the increased traffic and running expenses were proportionate. In the third year we find the increased train mileage is down by two million, while there is an increase in running expenses three times greater than previously. The running and traffic expenses were also three times greater. We come to the fourth year and we find an increase in running and traffic expenses proportionate to the previous year. That seems to me a very strange position that in these four years we find for two years the increases are proportionate and in the other two years the increases are out of all proportion. We find the running and the traffic expenses three times as much as previously and I think we are entitled to some explanation. I want to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice, in regard to the Tender Board, the matter of these ropes. Three firms tendered. Two firms quoted f.o.r. and the other one was railage. It was quite lately. The first tender was for 267,000 lbs. of rope and the price quoted was 68s. 3d. per 100 lbs. f.o.r. Johannesburg. The next was 69s. 3d. f.o.r. Natal. These two tenders were accepted. The third tender was for 59s. 6d. delivery anywhere the railway wanted. By accepting the first two tenders the railway lost in railage £263 9s. 3d., and they had to pay more for the goods £1,500; in other words, they paid £1,763 9s. 3d. more on the tenders they accepted than they would otherwise have done. There was a large amount of railage lost. It seems to me that here we require a very clear explanation. They were the same goods according to the specification and yet there is a difference of over £1,700. I want to know from the Minister why in a case like this the Tender Board should accept a tender for goods which makes a difference of over £1,700 to the railway administration.</p>

<p>I would like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a matter under the heading of station expenses, and that is the position of the staff at the goods station at Pretoria. I understand these men go on somewhere about the middle of the day and they have to work until the job is completed very often up to 9 o&#x2019;clock at night. They work right through Saturday afternoon. They find the position is getting unbearable and I hope the Minister will give his attention to this. Then there is the position of these goods labourers. I take it these are the white labourers the Minister is employing in place of natives. There have been considerable complaints from the Chamber of Commerce at the way these men handle the breakable goods, glass and crockery. There has been a considerable increase in damage since these men were taken on. I hope the Minister will take it up with the goods agent at Pretoria.</p>

<p>I may say that the pressure, not only from the Transvaal Provincial Council, but some other Councils, has been very strong indeed, but I have not acceded to the request. It seems to me that so long as the construction of roads and the control of roads are in the hands of the provincial councils there is no justification for the Railway Administration contributing. I think the House will agree that if we were to make a contribution to the maintenance of roads we would be benefiting not only our services, but also general services.

<p>Am I in order in raising a matter of administration on this vote? It is in regard to road motors, and it is the question of allowing some of these lighthouse-keepers in outlying districts to get their supplies by these road motors under the same privileges as you give to your railway servants. It is very hard for them to get supplies; they have to pay very dearly for them, and I have in mind a particular case at Port St. Johns, where you have a road motor service running from Kokstad down there. I would ask the Minister if he could not extend this concession to these men. These men have no better pay than on the lighthouses such as Dassen Island, where all supplies are delivered free of duty; no local allowance or anything of that kind.

<p>This is a gradual reversal of what the object was when we drew up Clause 127 of the South Africa Act. Under the Cape Administration, there is no doubt Kimberley, which was a big consumer in those days, was looked upon as a milch cow. We used to charge 4d. per ton per mile for ordinary goods. The representatives at the convention, particularly of the Transvaal and of the Free State, knew that perfectly well, and made up their minds to take every possible precaution to guard against that as far as the Rand and the Transvaal were concerned. Hence Clause 127 of the Act of Union. The intention was that the lowest possible rate should be charged for the traffic going to the north. So strong was the feeling that the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) called these clauses the Magna Charta of the North. Keep the rates to the north from being used in any shape or form for taxation purposes, or for any fads or experiments of the railway department. The Minister is carrying out an experiment with white labour.</p>

<p>This is being done at the expense of the railway users, and naturally more at the expense of the northern consumers than the people down here. I rather disagree about the sinking fund. In the National Convention we fought for days about the sinking fund.

<p>I thoroughly agree it is a healthy development, but the hon. member must not say that the north suffers. The Railway Administration is certainly assisting the producer in the north in the terms of the Act of Union. I do not think the inland portions of the Union have any real grievance against the department in that regard. We have dealt very handsomely with the inland producer in the matter of export rates.

<p>This reminds me of the old controversy in regard to the sum of about £400,000 which is paid by the railways to the Treasury in respect of interest on capital. The only satisfactory explanation of this I have ever heard was, &#x201C;Well, we discussed it in the Convention and we came to the conclusion that as it was definitely understood there would be no sinking fund, and as the railway users would not have to contribute by railway rates to a sinking fund, we will say nothing about this £400,000.&#x201D; If the Minister raises the question of a sinking fund, he will have to face this little point. The Minister&#x2019;s argument about the north has no point in it, for we are taking money out of the users of the railway whether we send their goods north or south. The inland people have to pay these heavy railway rates out of all proportion to that paid by the people of the coast.

<p>It is not far-fetched. If the railways are run economically the man up-country will get the cheapest possible rates for his exports. The additional railway charges on exports come out of the producers&#x2019; pockets the maize grower, the cotton grower, and every other producer&#x2014;because the price of his produce does not vary one half-penny whether the railway rates are high or low. But all this extravagance that is going on the railways to-day&#x2014;the white labour policy and the payment to men of more money than they are earning&#x2014;is coming out of the producer, who, generally speaking, lives upcountry, and will have to pay through the nose for the pleasure of having the Minister in that position.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister to leave the question of pilots&#x2019; salaries open. I want the Minister to go into it because I want to go into the question of the Minister&#x2019;s reply to the last deputation of the pilots. They appreciated the courtesy with which the Minister listened to the deputation. In reply to them, the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With regard to the emoluments of pilots at the administration&#x2019;s harbours, an opportunity has been taken of comparing the earnings of the pilots in the United Kingdom with those obtaining locally, and it is found that in almost every pilotage district, the earnings in the United Kingdom are less than the emoluments paid to the pilots in the administration&#x2019;s employ.</block>

<p>I will give an official extract from the Board of Trade&#x2019;s return in the United Kingdom-&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There were 322 pilots in the London district and 27,250 British and 18.342 foreign ships were taken in and out, and the amount received was £314,993. A table given in the return deals with the average earnings of the Port of London pilots, and shows the average earnings per man of the channel pilots was £1,229 gross and £934 net for pilotage only, including pilotage earned in deep sea waters outside the district, and £28 and £22 net for extra services.</block>

<p>The pilots placed a table before the Minister showing the majority of the harbours paid their pilots a higher rate than is paid by the administration. It is significant the staff has not been increased since the time of Union, although the increase of traffic has been very material indeed. That is why I ask the Minister <span class="col_5037-5038" refersTo="page_1179"/>to leave the matter still open so that he can go into the matter when overseas. The Minister refers to the question of actual pilotage itself. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister and the members of the Railway Board feel that it is perhaps difficult to make a fair comparison between the duties of pilots in the Union and those in the United Kingdom. &#x2026; So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, pilotage is performed for long distances in rivers or channels, whereas, in the case of the Union, pilotage consists of handling ships between the outer and inner harbours, and in the latter the service is of comparatively short duration.</block>

<p>As a matter of fact, there is very little to be drawn from the comparison, and if there is anything, it is in favour of the pilots out here. When I was in Europe I saw a member of the Board of Trade and discussed with him the respective merits and duties of the two services, especially in so far as the Thames pilotage was concerned. They admitted the distances of pilotage in the Union was small, but it required very careful handling, more careful handling than in the long distance channels. Taken all round, it is a question which should be gone into, and as far as possible there should be an increase of staff. There is no night work, I know. It is not a question of bringing the vessels into the harbour, but of shiftings inside the harbour. Here it is done by the same service. The pilots have to take great risks, which should be considered.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) has asked what the good is of these ships. He has asked what are we doing with them. We are taking coal to the East and doing excellent work in that regard. We are assisting the exporters of coal in the Transvaal and Natal. We are bringing sleepers back from Australia. I think my hon. friend, in advising me to get rid of these ships, is giving me very bad advice. The position is that we have sold one of the ships which was presented to us by the British Government. It was old and there was not much further use in that ship. Two new ships have been purchased, not out of capital, but out of the reserve fund which we built up during past years. These two ships are giving us excellent service. We have five ships at the present moment and they are all fully employed. In regard to a shipping line, the hon. member may rest assured that we shall give very full consideration to that aspect before we ask the country to embark upon it.</p>

<p>I am sorry the Minister of the Interior is not here because I want to speak in regard to the promise made by him to the Kirstenbosch Gardens. The Minister said last year on the 4th of May that he had a good deal of sympathy with Kirstenbosch and he had done a great deal for that institution. He referred to the agreement between the Government and the institution to make a contribution on the pound for pound principle so that they would get another £1,050 from the Government. This £1,050 is not down in these estimates.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>If the Minister will look at the letter from the Minister of the Interior he will find that this is another matter altogether. This is a special grant towards the cost of buildings and the new dam. It is not the promise in regard to the bequest. Here is the letter from the Department of the Interior dated the 2nd of June which says that the sum of £1,050 will be provided. On the 2nd of June this had not been put down on the estimates. If the Minister will look at the letter of the 5th of May from the department he will find they absolutely refuse to put it on the estimates at all. So it cannot be the same amount. It was first refused, but then the Minister wrote to say he would put it on the estimates, but they are withdrawing all their promises in regard to future contributions to the gardens. This is a national institution. We are committed to certain expenditure and we are getting the public to assist us on <span class="col_5041-5042" refersTo="page_1181"/>the condition that the Government give the pound for pound contribution. We are losing all that and with the commitments we have we are going to find the position very difficult to meet. When the Minister definitely promised to give that money we should not have to come back afterwards and have it placed on the estimates. We feel we are forced into a very awkward position. We feel we are receiving adequate assistance from the Government to carry on the work as it should be carried on. I think more particularly that when a promise is made and we commit ourselves on that promise, it should be carried out.</p>

<p>That is what they wanted the money for. I am prepared to give the £1,050 which the Minister of the Interior said last year the Government would give. It was afterwards when we found out the trustees were relying on the statement made by the Minister in the House that they would get the contribution, that we decided to do this. But the Treasury never intended in terms of the regulations to contribute in respect of bequests left to the society. I had a deputation from the trustees and as they relied on the statement of the Minister, I said that under the circumstances although this contribution would not strictly fall under the regulation, I was prepared to provide the additional amount to give them the £1,050 which the Minister of the Interior mentioned.</p>

We have selected out of the list of the various departments all these smaller buildings, and there is no hard and fast rule. I daresay if we come to a building of £2,000 it might be constructed out of loan.

We have just, as a matter of fact, had published the report of the present mining engineer which does not prove very much different from the report of Sir Robert Kotzé.

<p>I hope my hon. friend is not very serious about this. I expect, of course, in a large item of this kind that my hon. friend and other hon. members would naturally criticize it, but it seems to me that the Minister made a good case for it when we dealt with the matter on the loan estimates. I have looked at the plans, and I must say there was nothing about them that I could see that was of a luxury character. The accommodation required is very large, and we are not merely providing for the ordinary accommodation of a railway station, but also for a large amount of office space for the different departments of the Railway Administration. Look at what railways in other countries spend on railway stations. Take the American railways.</p>

<p>Well, take the English railways. It is not long ago that £1,000,000 was spent in re-arranging Waterloo station. That, of course, is a big concern compared with Johannesburg, but Johannesburg is the chief city of the Union, and it is the city from which other parts of the Union derive their livelihood directly or indirectly. The provision of a suitable station for Johannesburg is very long overdue, the present station being entirely inadequate for a place one-quarter the size of Johannesburg. Taking into account the accommodation that has to be provided not only for passenger traffic and the administration&#x2019;s officers, but the amount that is spent in re-arranging the tracks, I do not think this can reasonably be objected to. It is a favourite argument of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) to ask how much additional traffic these new buildings will bring. I think this will bring additional traffic.</p>

<p>That is an argument I had not thought of. Seriously, the amount is not out of reasonable proportion to what is required. The argument has been brought forward that we are not justified by the prospects of the Rand in building such a station, but that argument is without foundation. If hon. members will go to Johannesburg and see how private companies are providing for themselves in the matter of new buildings, they would see no lack of confidence. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) <span class="col_5045-5046" refersTo="page_1183"/>has also shown his confidence in this way in the future of Johannesburg, but he is not one of the more recent ones.

<p>Everyone that wants to sell his produce and sheep sends it to the Johannesburg market. What would South Africa be without Johannesburg? The hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. J. P. Louw) went so far the other night as to say that the station would one day be standing alone, and that Johannesburg would merely be a dust heap. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) is afraid of there being too many factories there because he wants to keep everything for Cape Town. He also is the cause why Johannesburg did not have a station, which was so necessary, before. He had the power in his hands and overlooked the needs of Johannesburg, and now I am sorry that another Minister has had to give the station which it really needed to Johannesburg. Hon. members opposite must surely vote with their Government. The public buildings in Johannesburg are in a deplorable state, and I think that the Minister of Justice has to give further buildings which the town requires. Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa. Let the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) and other hon. members remember how much the taxpayers of Johannesburg pay into the Treasury every year. Think of what the gold mines mean to the country. Do not let us any longer be petty. I think the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) and the other opponents of this expenditure are petty in going against Johannesburg. I know that the Minister and hon. members opposite will use their common-sense. I hardly have words sufficient to express my feelings towards the hon. member for Cape Town (Central). He is a business man and ought to know better. The people of Johannesburg will be dissatisfied if such a shabby amendment towards Johannesburg is passed, and one proposed by an hon. member on this side of the House. The Minister of Railways and Harbours completely floored the critics the other night when he pointed out that it was not only a station building but the head office for all the administrative work of the railways. Do hon. members, then; not want the head office to be a decent building? Should the officials in the head office have the kind of offices which the officials at Cape Town have to work in? Here the officials have to work in cubicles which are a scandal to Cape Town. Large buildings have only been erected in Cape Town since the commencement of the Union. Take, e.g., the alterations to the Cape Town station and the buildings which are now being erected at Groote Schuur. What is Cane Town not getting by the electrification of the suburban line.

<p>I know that hon. members opposite will have to vote with me, even the hon. member for George (Mr. Brink). The last named knows that the produce goes from his constituency to the Johannesburg markets. Johannesburg has to consume the articles which are produced in the country. The industrial development of Johannesburg is only in the initial stages, and as the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) said, large companies are to-day investing money in buildings. Close to the station large and beautiful buildings are being erected to improve the town, and it will be an honour to South Africa, The Railway Administration is taking pains to attract tourisms here from other countries, but if South Africa is to be advertised by a station such as Johannesburg has to-day, then it would sooner frighten away than attract. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) does not know what the officials have to endure. They have to work in cubicles in the existing building. When the hon. member comes to Johannesburg he goes to his own large building, and he does not see what the officials have to put up with. The Minister should also make provision so that natives and Europeans should not meet on the station, because, unlike the people in <span class="col_5047-5048" refersTo="page_1184"/>Cape Town, we are not accustomed to rub shoulders with each other every day.

<p>It is amusing to see how this battle royal developed between the protagonists of Johannesburg and the other people. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) has made one mistake. He has criticized the attitude of hon. members as if we were against a new station at Johannesburg. Not one hon. member has put his criticism on that basis, nor is it on account of jealousy. We are a little unaccustomed in this House to seeing votes of £650,000 for a railway station, and naturally we wanted to know why such a large amount was put down for a new station. We also wanted to point out to the Minister that he reminded us last year that it was gross extravagance to be spending money at the present time. There are claims in other parts but we are not pressing them because of the need for economy. After hearing this talk of the need for economy it is surprising to see such a large sum put down for Johannesburg. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) and the papers at Johannesburg need not be so touchy about the criticism of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) and of other members because after all the sum is a very large sum indeed to be put down for the purpose of one single station, and we have not yet had any explanation why such a magnificent station at such a cost should be put up at Johannesburg or anywhere else at the present time.</p>

<p>I notice that there is an amount of about £1,700 on the Estimates for the station at Potgietersrust. Now, I want to ask the Minister to enquire into the station building before the amount is spent, because the feeling amongst the public is that the station is situated at a wrong place and that it ought to be moved. If that is so then I want to warn the Minister to first make enquiries. I admit that I am not acquainted with the matter, but it is the prevalent opinion. There was a public meeting held yesterday and railway officials were to have been present. An enquiry ought to be made whether the money ought to be spent at the present spot or whether the station building will not eventually have to be built over again.</p>

<p>The station at Johannesburg is an eyesore, and I have noticed that it is not even sufficiently large to accommodate passengers and traffic on many occasions when I have been there. I have seen passengers lose the train because of so much baggage and luggage on the platform. Johannesburg and the Transvaal have contributed in a great measure to the prosperity of South Africa. In Johannesburg there are some of the most beautiful buildings which will compare very favourably with any buildings in Cape Town, and I think the station should be in keeping with the other buildings, and it should be worthy of South Africa. Although we may not increase traffic, I do believe a lot of people are prevented from travelling via Johannesburg, because of the inconvenience and danger in the station during the crush of passengers at excursion times. As a Cape member, I am in favour of building a new station at Johannesburg in keeping with the status of the goldfields and to the credit of South Africa.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I have been a friend and follower of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) for many years, but I must say I cannot go with him in this latest outbreak of his on the question of the new station at Johannesburg. Let me clear up a misapprehension that exists in the minds of some hon. members. They say that to spend £640,000 on a new station for Johannesburg is extravagance gone mad. But of that £640,000, £275,000 is for the lay-out, that is the purchase of the necessary ground, the track, equipment and bridges, and so forth, and it has nothing to do with the station itself. Of the balance, a very substantial portion is for the administrative offices of the railways, and has no real connection with the needs of Johannesburg itself at all. As hon. members know, Johannesburg is the administrative centre of the railways, and there are already large administrative offices there going round three sides of a quadrangle, and I understand it is contemplated to devote a large portion of this money to completing that quadrangle. It should not be necessary to remind my hon. friends of the Cape of some very elementary facts. They seem to forget that Johannesburg and the Witwatersrand generally is the centre of the largest European population in Africa. It is the most wealthy mining community probably in the world, and certainly it is, and has been for the whole of this generation and longer, the main source of this country&#x2019;s wealth. If Johannesburg had not existed my hon. friend (Mr. Jagger) would not be sitting in front of me to-night, and my hon. friend, the member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) would not be sitting on my left here, and we would not have been sitting in this House. I want to remind my hon. friends that the gold product alone of the Rand has been over £900,000,000, of which an amount of over £700,000,000 has been spent in this country. My hon. friend (Mr. Jagger), referring to this report of Dr. Pirow, the Government mining engineer, said he had read it, and he did not think there was much in it. I have just read that report, and it leads one to hope that for this generation and the generation that will follow this the mines of the Rand will continue to be the chief source of this country&#x2019;s wealth, and yet we are told by our Cape friends that they cannot see any necessity for this expenditure. My hon. friend, who has led the opposition to this, draws a very large portion, if not the main portion, of his wealth and his income from this town of Johannesburg. His business there is one of the largest and most prosperous in that city, <span class="col_5049-5050" refersTo="page_1185"/>and he ranks as one of the leading merchants of Johannesburg. That station, when built, will convey his goods to his wholesale emporium, and will take them away from that emporium to his customers, and his customers will be attracted by the amenities afforded by that station.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I agree. I do not question his impartiality for one moment. He would make an equally vigorous onslaught if the proposal were to build a palatial station in Cape Town, but I do say one can sometimes be short-sighted and over-zealous in this cry of economy. We have waited forty years for a decent station in Johannesburg, and at last we see the prospect of getting one. I would not stand up in this House and defend any proposal in regard to Johannesburg or anywhere else that savoured simply of unnecessary spending of money, but when one knows the needs of that city, the volume of traffic that that station will have to cope with, and the wealth that is distributed all over South Africa from that station, I submit that this cry is one that will cause grave feeling on the Rand and elsewhere, and that it is entirely unjustified. What the Government is doing for Johannesburg is exactly what Johannesburg has been doing for itself in regard to building. I have asked my hon. friend, the Minister of Labour, to get for me the figures of building which has gone on in Johannesburg and on the Rand for the last few years. In 1921-&#x2019;22 the total expenditure in the whole of the Union on building was just over £5,000,000, and of that amount a sum of over £2,000,000 was spent in Johannesburg itself, and nearly £500,000 on the rest of the Rand. In 1922-&#x2019;23 45 per cent. of the whole of the expenditure of the Union on building was spent on the Rand. In 1923-&#x2019;24 it was 44 per cent. During the last three years from 44 per cent. to 50 per cent. of the total expenditure in South Africa on buildings has been spent in Johannesburg and on the reef. Yet, when you come to look at the other side of the picture and ask yourself what the Government has spent there, what it has done for public buildings and public amenities in Johannesburg, another story is told. We used to complain in the days when my right hon. friend (Gen. Smuts) was the head of the Government, that their treatment of Johannesburg was somewhat step-motherly. I can only say that this is the first earnest that we have had from the present Government of anything but step-motherly treatment of Johannesburg, and when they do come forward with a proposal of this sort, I say it is misguided and it savours of narrow provincialism for my hon. friends in the Cape to get up and question that expenditure. I want to give what has been spent by the Government on public works in the various towns of the Union in the year which has just ended. I am quoting the figures for the final six months of the last financial year, 1926-&#x2019;27: Cape Town. £70,000; Durban, £149,000; Bloemfontein and the Free State, £212,000; Johannesburg and Witwatersrand, £81,000. At Pretoria, £54,000, so that of the total spent in the Union by the Government on public works during the last six months of the financial year, 13 per cent. was spent in the Witwatersrand, while 11 per cent. was spent in Cape Town and 32 per cent. was spent in Bloemfontein and the Free State.

<p>I am deeply grieved, in fact, pained, at the hostile attitude of some of my hon. friends. I can quite understand that hon. members think the figure is big, but you cannot criticize a figure unless you have all the facts and circumstances. The Minister of Posts and Telegraphs said that certain provision would be made in the new station to deal with postal matters.</p>

<speech by="#papenfus">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAPENFUS</person>:</from>

<p>I am very much relieved to hear that. I feel this matter has been very carefully handled and has been gone into by the best architects you could have. The whole of the present station it must be remembered will have to be scrapped. I do not know whether hon. members realize that the present building is a wood and iron building, and that this building has been serving us for all these years. I do not think it takes us any further to make comparisons which are sometimes invidious, but if one looks at these very estimates we see items on page 23 of £59,000 for Cape Town. Then, if you turn over and go a couple of pages further, you will find an expenditure of £212,000. and on page 53 a further item of £225,877, making in all a railway expenditure for Cape Town for this year of £487,600. It is probably required and necessary. I would not venture to express the opinion that it is wrong. These things are required and, naturally, should be provided, but I hope hon. members will cease to talk about this large expenditure, because they do not know the facts of the matter. The amount is large, but the amount is necessary, and we are at last to have a public building which, I hope and trust, will be an ornament to the city. If there is one objection and criticism, I would make, it is this&#x2014;I notice the entrance to the station on either side is guarded by elephants. Well, I would prefer lions as being more characteristic of the country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to add a word or two to what I was saying. Hon. members should not forget this, that for years Johannesburg has been pressing for one of the most necessary improvements that could be made, namely, the lowering of the line. Hon. members know that by reason of the fact that the railway line cuts Johannesburg in two, an almost intolerable position has been created there. The department has always said: &#x201C;You must wait until we finish our new station.&#x201D; Yet we get this criticism from my hon. friends in the Cape. It is very keenly resented on the Rand. One of the critics was the hon. member for Weenen (Maj. Richards), who represents a Natal constituency. That province, within the <span class="col_5051-5052" refersTo="page_1186"/>last few years, had four and a half millions spent on electrification, a million on a graving dock and three-quarters of a million on a grain elevator, and yet when this first piece of capital expenditure that has been spent near Johannesburg for years is mentioned the hon. gentleman throws up his hands in horror at the suggestion.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>It will probably be a far more reproductive piece of expenditure than the new building costing close on £100,000 which we have put up next to this building. I do want to appeal to the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) and the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) not to pursue this matter. I tell them frankly that if they do they will stir up a good deal of interprovincial feeling the repercussions of which may be felt in the Cape. There are a good many members in this House who, for many years past, have been convinced of the unwisdom of the dual capital, but we have refrained up to now from taking any concrete action in this House, because we did not want to stir any form of inter-provincial feeling, but I will tell them this&#x2014;that if they pursue this discussion in the narrow provincial spirit they have shown up to now, and they take this matter any further, then some of us will consider before Parliament meets again whether we should not bring up in this House a proposal to abolish what we believe to be an anomaly which costs every year far more than two Johannesburg stations put together.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not see why this should not be discussed in a calm manner. There is no reason for any feeling that I can see. We ought to discuss it calmly as a responsible body responsible to the taxpayers for expenditure. If I may venture to be personal for a minute I daresay I am more interested in Johannesburg than anyone in this House. I went there several times by coach from Kimberley in the early days. I quite agree and always have agreed that a new station is wanted at Johannesburg and when I was in office I made a definite promise that we would build a new station. I was not in office sufficiently long, that is the sole reason, otherwise a sum would have been put on the estimates to make a start. I do not go back on it now but the only thing is that my idea was to spend £250,000 to £300,000 on the station. What I do grumble at is the amount of £640,000 and I do not think that will be the last of it. You have to consider two or three things. You have above all to consider the future of Johannesburg. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) has spoken of what it has done in the past. No one disputes that. It has done more probably to send forward the prosperity of South Africa than any other industry or city in South Africa. But, unfortunately, it is not a permanent industry. If it were a permanent industry and could continue to produce this gold every year it would be a different story, but we have these warnings, and on this industry the prosperity of Johannesburg when all is said and done is dependent. It is claimed that it is going to be a big manufacturing centre. It cannot be. The working expenses are too heavy, far heavier than at the coast. It is alright talking but I am in business and I know. How can you make on a big scale boots and shoes or clothing when you pay far higher wages than down at the coast? It cannot be done. The industry which it has is not permanent. I have a few extracts from what has been said by men who know the position. This is one by a very well known gentleman in South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have the Government officially publishing a warning that things will not be as rosy in the future as they have been in the past and we must look forward to lean years at no distant date.</block>

<p>Here is another one by a correspondent&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am perfectly sure that very few understand how limited is the life of the industry or how easy it is by unwise measures to hasten its decline. Even the plain warning by an unbiassed critic like Sir Robert Kotzé has left no very marked impression on the public mind. People say they have heard &#x201C;wolf&#x201D; cried too often before, and they light-heartedly assume that it will go on for ever.</block>

<p>That is exactly the truth. He goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this diagnosis of public opinion there is unfortunately a great amount of truth even in Johannesburg itself. Outside mining circles a happy-go-lucky spirit of optimism is by no means uncommon. There has been in late years a boom in the building of luxurious flats and most of the commercial community seem to be free from doubts or misgivings. Johannesburg, broadly speaking, is serenely confident, like Mr. Macawber, that if anything goes wrong in one direction something will turn up in another to make amends.</block>

<p>That is precisely the case. He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Very different are the views of certain leading men and independent thinkers although they are not in the mining industry. They remind us gravely that the industry is passing its zenith.</block>

<p>Sir Robert Kotzé reports that of the 49 mines two have already ceased operations and four have not yet had their lives determined for purposes of taxation. Of the other mines the lives range from one to 30 years. For less than five years there are 19 mines. It is admitted that these figures are conservative, and I should add three years, making it eight years. From 8 to 13 years there are 11 mines, from 13 to 18, seven mines, from 18 to 23 years four mines, and from 23 to 33 years two mines. In 35 years from now there is no doubt there will be a very different state of things in Johannesburg, and I say it with regret. Dr. Pirow&#x2019;s report is not so definite as Sir Robert <span class="col_5053-5054" refersTo="page_1187"/>Kotzé&#x2019;s. But then certain factors have come into play which will prolong the life of the mines, but I cannot conceive a man not taking the future into consideration in this regard. There is nothing that Dr. Pirow brings out so strongly as that if we want to prolong the life of the mines it is entirely a matter of working expenses. We can prolong them for five or six years, and one way of reducing expenses is to reduce railway rates. The Minister ought to aim for that; if he can reduce the cost of carrying coal from Witbank to the mines you can prolong by years the lives of some of these mines. The whole thing, to my mind, almost hangs on the Government and the people generally doing their level best to reduce the working expenses. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I do not propose to say anything about inter-provincial relations or dual capitals in this discussion, but it is somewhat ungracious on the part of certain hon. members from the Cape to have spoken as they did. If any two towns in the Union should be considered for better railway consideration, they are Johannesburg and Kimberley, and neither has been looked favourably upon in the past by any administration. I also have seen the rise and growth of Johannesburg since 1888, and the establishment of the railway; it has never been properly served as far as accommodation at the main station, either Park or Braamfontein, is concerned. In 1914, when the fire took place, it was hoped that something would be done, but the war intervened, which prevented anything being done. I see that something like £500,000 is being expended, within a comparatively short distance of Cape Town on these estimates. I would like to ask how much would be warranted to be spent in Cape Town were it not for the existence of Johannesburg. Not only, as the Minister has pointed out, is this £640,000 meant for the railway station, but there are several other matters such as the purchase of the Wanderers&#x2019; Ground, and certain large buildings in connection with the head office of the railway which are also included in this amount. That being so, I think this opposition should cease, and this vote should pass.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>The fly in the ointment from the other side appears in the &#x201C;Rand Daily Mail.&#x201D; I do not know whether the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) is the leader of this agitation or whether it comes from the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Nathan). The hon. member for Von Brandis says the whole of the agitation comes from that side, and not only from the hon. member for Cape Town (Central). Interviewed in regard to this question on his arrival in Johannesburg, the hon. member for Von Brandis said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To a very large extent the present agitation is due to the possibility of the Flag Bill being passed. Since my return from Cape Town I have hardly been able to walk through the streets because of people stop ping me and asking me if the Bill will be passed.</block>

<p>I put it to the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) that is the real thing at the back of it. If the hon. member were Minister of Railways and Harbours to-day, would he put that consideration before him or not? I do not seem to get an answer, and I do not know why. I think this apology coming from the other side is rather unfortunate. The &#x201C;Rand Daily Mail&#x201D; said that the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) had no objection to coming to this House for expenditure to protect canaries. The hon. member for Umvoti (Mr. Deane) followed the same line, and no word came from him with regard to millions being spent on grain elevators. I think this late apology coming from the other side is simply to detain the House. Criticism of Dr. Pirow&#x2019;s report is inopportune. I do not think the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) has assimilated that report from the mining point of view. Dr. Pirow stated that on the Witwatersrand under the new conditions of mining they had been able to extract narrower reefs of higher values, which had brought into possibility a longer extension than had been considered to be the case of Sir Robert Kotzé. What the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) loses sight of, not being a technical man, is the continuation of the deep levels, when a mine closes down. To-day you are dealing with mines of 2,400 claims, and at the E.R.P.M. and Cinderella, 4,000 claims, or practically 10 mines rolled into one, compared with previous conditions. When they reach the boundary it overflows. Government ground is being added to it every day. I think Dr. Pirow has rendered a great service by framing this report at this juncture, because the argument was often used in this House that the life of the Witwatersrand had been determined, and we had the end of it in sight. That induced the Government to get Dr. Pirow to report on what the actual position was. There is no limit to be put on, and say that in a certain year or at a certain time, the mining industry will cease. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) will be able to put up a good many double-storeyed buildings before the industry ceases.</p>

The bridge is a railway one only. As to the extension of that line we cannot spend money in territory which is not part of the Union. At the request of the Swaziland Administration the Board visited the area, but there can be no question of extending our railway into Swaziland proper. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Maj.

<p>No, the territory does not, but it feeds our railway lines. We have consulted the law advisers and they advise that we can do so. With regard to the question of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Sir William Macintosh) concerning the Limpopo Bridge the amount must be voted even though the cost is contributed by an outside party. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) asks about the high cost of the line. That is undoubtedly so. There was a serious underestimate of the cost of construction. The Railway Board presented a report to Parliament, and attached the report of the chief civil engineer, who is responsible to the Board and to the House. The difficulty arose because this was totally unknown country, and when the engineers made the survey there were no Europeans living there and they had to depend on the information gathered from the natives. Afterwards floods occurred and it was found the information given to the engineer when he made the survey was incorrect. There is something to be said for the view that the engineers under such circumstances should again report to Parliament. Then about the line from Matubatuba to Somkele. The amount of £55,600 is the original amount which has to be drawn from the capital account,</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) asked me about the Limpopo line. It will, of course, be built after Parliament has granted the necessary authority.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) the new offices for Pretoria are an extension of the post office annexe and the object is to house one whole department from the Union Buildings. The Union Building has insufficient room for the whole department. In the public offices at Durban we are concentrating in one spot all the public activities of the town. In Cape Town the projected offices are in Lelie Street. With regard to pulling down these old buildings, I think the time is not far distant when we must pull down these buildings and put up a comprehensive suite of offices. It is conditional of course upon whether Parliament decides that Parliament must remain here. In view of the threat of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) it seems very doubtful. I think we shall have to consider asking the city council to agree to close Parliament Street from the old Supreme Court up. It is a dangerous spot and is productive of the utmost noise so that business cannot be carried on here in the day, and in the Select Committees the constant roaring of traffic makes it difficult to carry on. I have made representations to the Cape Town Council without effect. With the exception of putting a notice up asking vehicles to go slow, no effective steps have been taken. With regard to the bridge over the Kat River, that is an internal thing connected with the mental hospital at Fort Beaufort. It is to make it easy of access. I might take this opportunity of telling the Committee that the Manor House at Groot Constantia is now complete, and the Government would like any members who take an interest in that old monument to go out and have a look at the place?</p>

The hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton) wants to know about this question of 1s. an hour in connection with the Telle River bridge.

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister of Public Works whether the building he is putting up in Lelie Street forms part of the building scheme, and whether it will fit in with his suggested alterations to Parliament Street. As regards the noise the Minister suffers from in Parliament Street, I would suggest to him that in rebuilding they put back the frontage some feet. It would make an enormous difference to the noise. I live in probably the busiest corner of Cape Town, and I suffer from practically no noise. If he put back the frontage, with by all means a courtyard there which would not be open to the public, he would not suffer from noise in the rooms, and a very beautiful block of buildings could be put up there which would be a credit to the legislative capital of South Africa. I would suggest to the Minister that he should officially write to the Town Council, pointing out the inconvenience to the parliamentary people of the traffic there, and then something might be done about it. If one of us unofficially simply speaks about it, it does not go very far, but if the Minister writes officially, and suggests some improvement there, I think very considerable notice would be taken of it. I should also like to ask the Minister whether he will not make a point this year of forcing on the erection of that art gallery. That art gallery has been promised by the Government to Cape Town for, I suppose, 25 or 30 years. I think it is about 30 years ago that the then Government took the site of the art gallery and promised to give them the funds to put up another one. That money has been used by the State for all these years, and it is surely time to give back to <span class="col_5063-5064" refersTo="page_1192"/>Cape Town what you borrowed from them 30 years ago. I do urge that a little bit of energy should be put into that art gallery. It was in exactly the same position last year. This time last year the Minister said: &#x201C;We are going to get on with it. You can depend on that.&#x201D; The only &#x201C;getting on&#x201D; is a certain quantity of stuff put on paper. There is not a weed taken out of the foundations. I do ask the Minister this year to, at any rate, take the weeds out of the foundations. There is one other point, and that is Barrack Square. The Minister was rather priding himself on Barrack Square. I will say this&#x2014;that the Union Government had one of the chances of its life to make of Barrack Square a beautiful site for public offices, but they have simply built up streets of good offices, very well designed, but so crowded together that you cannot see them. Instead of laying the square out with a little artistic taste, you have simply made it look as if you were building semi-detached villas. I do urge, first of all, that we should go on with the public buildings in Parliament Street, as suggested by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Struben), and that the Lelie Street part should form an integral portion of the scheme. The other point is, I want the Minister to say to himself every night: &#x201C;We must get on with the Cape Town art gallery.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In regard to the suggestion by the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) that we should set back the building, I am afraid that would not help us very much. The noise would be just as great. My idea is, we should get the City Council to close the road altogether, and that we should take out the railings here and throw the whole thing into the gardens. I think we should seize every opportunity of opening the place out, and surrounding it with a certain amount of floral decoration. I have written to the Town Council, I wrote last year officially, but I got no satisfaction. All they did was to stop horse traffic and mule traffic. They closed the side street and asked motorists not to use their horns. Fancy asking a motorist not to use his horn! It becomes instinctive with quite a number of them. With regard to motorbicycles the noise is terrific. I am going to force on the erection of the art gallery. My hon. friend will see that we are determined to pull the weeds out of the foundation, because we are going to spend £14,000 this year upon it. With regard to the Government having promised it for 25 years, I would ask him to hurl his reproaches at the hon. members surrounding him. They promised, and, as usual, we perform. The hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. J. P. Louw) is ungrateful. Look at what we are spending on his gaol. Tire hon. member grumbles because we are spending only £2,400 on a post office for a place so delightfully situated and expansive as Somerset West. We are building only for the requirements of the locality. If Bethlehem is getting more, it is because its requirements warrant that expenditure. The same thing applies to the gaol, and when we have spent the money prisoners will no longer be able to escape&#x2014;and my hon. friend had better be careful. With regard to the annexe of this House, my hon. friend is hypercritical. I want anybody who knows anything about building to go and look at it, and if he does not like it, he must be hard to satisfy. As to the tin roof, I did not know it was being put on until I saw it. Although we are over-carrying less than last year, our capital expenditure is growing at an enormous rate, and we cannot waste money on unshipping the roof and putting another on. Let us wait some years&#x2014;we might move.</p>

Some of the plots were destroyed, and we have to make advances to the settlers to put the plots in order again. The question raised by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) is one which may be considered from different points of view. The triangulation of the country is useful for posterity, as well as for us, and it is not right that only the present generation should pay for it.

<p>Because future generations will derive as much benefit from it as we do. It is the same thing as public buildings. It is a question of policy. My colleagues considered it should be done that way, and the previous Government also did the same. I think the previous Government was right in that particular instance. As to Hartebeestpoort, I started this probationary settlement, and I cannot do it in one year. I put a certain amount on the estimates every year, and prepared 60 plots for allotment. This is the last lot. That will bring up the settlers to about 220. According to the Act as soon as the probationers have been passed out by the Land Board as settlers, they have to be started and we have to make them advances for the purchase of stock and implements; his money they have to repay. That is also the case in regard to the Olifants River settlement. A few years ago I bought a piece of land from the natives south of Durban near Umbogintwini. This is one of the finest sites for Durbanites as a suburb. I have had a town planning expert laying the ground out, and I am perfectly confident I will get twice the amount! I paid for it. We also gave the natives land higher up away from the coast. They are quite satisfied, for in addition to the land we gave them we also paid them £30,00&#x2019;0. We shall sell the land in plots, but not all at once so as not to flood the market. The purchase money for the plots will probably be repaid over a certain number of years with interest at 5 per cent. or 6 per cent.

<p>I can assure my hon. friend we have not very much land. As soon as a holding is abandoned, it is re-advertised and taken up again in a few months. This £500,000 is spent almost exclusively under Section 11, under which a settler selects the land himself and buys it from a private owner. The sum voted last year for this purpose was exhausted within less than three months. I am simply overwhelmed with applications from people who have a small amount of capital to buy land for them. They make an initial payment of one-tenth of the cost. This has proved the best means of land settlement and one on which we have lost least. I now confine myself exclusively to this kind of settlement. I act as banker, provided that the Land Board is satisfied that the price is not too high and the settlers are suitable. Land is being bought in all the provinces. Natal has made a bigger percentage inroad on this amount than any of the other provinces.

There are quite enough private water borers and quite a number have failed to make a living in recent years because of the terms upon which the Government bore for farmers. It is not the business of the Water Boring Department to bore for municipalities or for the railways. The Public Accounts Committee took that view and passed a resolution on that point.

<p>I would like to ask the Minister to explain to the House on what basis loans to the Provincial Administration are granted. On inspecting the loan grants I find the Cape gets £275,000 and the Free State gets the same. We know the Cape is four or five times the size of the Free State. We have four or five times as many schools and school children, and for years now the Provincial Council of the Cape have not been able to allocate a single bridge to the Transkei where we need them. The position regarding hospitals is also serious: The Administrator used to state that the blame rests upon the Central Government which refuses to give the Provincial Council sufficient funds for these purposes. It does seem unfair that the Cape should only get the same amount as the Free State, and I ask the Minister on what he bases the sums which are allocated. Are the allocations based upon the amounts requisitioned for by the various provinces or is it pure guess-work. Natal, too, which is also a very small province, gets practically the same amount. It is wrong, and I think that the Cape, having regard to its size, should get a very much larger amount than this. I know that the Cape Province is handicapped very seriously in educational development, and in regard to bridges, hospitals, etc.</p>

An amount of £20,400 has already been spent, and £22,050 is put down for this year. The position is that the contract has been signed with the consent of the Minister of Education for this amount. The Technical College people inform me that they have asked for £42,000 this year, leaving a balance of £5,000. They have consulted their architects again and they have been told that at least another £10,000 is necessary to carry on the building during the year; otherwise they say that the building will come to a standstill. Of course, the building cannot come to a standstill. The bill will have to be footed in some way. The other £10,000 has to be provided, and the suggestion is that an additional £10,000 be granted, otherwise the Technical College people want to know what they are to do in the matter.

<speech by="#hay">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>I ask for some further information in regard to the housing loans fund. We have been led to believe that what is to be spent this year is already ear-marked, really only making up to various municipalities what they have had promised in the past, and practically no new amount is provided for this purpose. It is monstrous to suppose that a country like this, expanding as it is, is going to be content with this small amount of loan provided for housing purposes. It does not begin to meet the wants of Cape Town alone. It is all very well for our friends to be constantly talking, as they do, about doing away with slums and going in for city improvements, model townships and town planning, and wonderful things of that kind, and then we find that the total amount apparently that the Government can borrow for such purposes is somewhere in the vicinity of £300,000, and that sum all appropriated. Having regard to the total amount of under £3,000,000, which the Government have so far provided for housing, when one comes to think of what the municipalities are themselves doing, it does not say much for the parent Government that they cannot do more in regard to assisting these important schemes. We are talking loudly about it every year, and newspapers indulge in long articles about what we should do and could do and ought to do, but what can public bodies do if our chief Minister simply knee halters the country? As regards the loans to provincial administrations, I listened with the greatest attention to what the Minister has said in regard to the limitation of expenditure. There again, of course, we have the same old time-worn explanation. We go to the Administrators and they say what amounts they have been able to obtain, in correspondence from the Government. They are told to keep expenditure down, &#x201C;we cannot provide the money.&#x201D; We have enormous areas like the Transvaal cut down and told not to spend more than £200,000. Why, we could spend there fully half of what is provided here, for bridges alone. There are municipalities spending every year in capital expenditure far more than is provided for the provinces. It is all part of the policy to try and sicken the people of their provincial councils so as to do away with them, and again I warn the Government that if they try to break up that system they will ultimately be very sorry indeed. It is part of the Union bargain and the people will hold to it. This provision of loan funds is absurdly insufficient, and I think the Minister should make up his mind to carry out the intention of the South Africa Act and say to the provinces, &#x201C;borrow on your own credit.&#x201D; I think the Minister has got to face this eventually. It is little use coming to the House and saying that the amount provided is all the provinces have asked for. We know in the past they have been told not to budget for more than a certain amount. I have been pressing this for years. Municipalities are allowed to borrow on their own credit, on the authority of the provincial administrations, and I do not know of a single one that has not met its obligations. It is very pleasing to see the Orange Free State provided with £275,000 and the Transvaal with only the same amount. The Free State does not contribute to the revenue anything like as much as the Transvaal, and it is not a fair allocation. I do hope, so far as the housing loan fund is concerned, the Minister will see it is totally inadequate and I trust he will venture to largely exceed the vote, even if he has later to come to the House for condonation.</p>

<p>I want to support what the hon. member has just said in regard to the housing loans, and I want to know from the Minister whether the Government really are serious in the policy which would appear from the estimates here of closing down the housing loan when this sum of £366,000 has been spent. This is the final vote. There is nothing remaining out of the original allocation after this sum, which, as the hon. member has said, is already all allocated and there are a large number of municipalities and local authorities applying for housing loans which will not be able to get them. What does this mean? It means that the whole machinery that has been working since 1920 has got to come to an end. We have had the Central Housing Board, which has done very valuable work. They have got local authorities in various parts of the country interested in the thing, and now apparently it is to come to an end, and we are to be <span class="col_5071-5072" refersTo="page_1196"/>thrown back on the initiative of individual municipalities and local authorities. The Minister says in large towns like Cape Town and Johannesburg they can borrow the money almost as cheaply as the Government can, and why should they not do so. There are several answers to this, and one is that the State has a definite responsibility in this matter in stimulating municipalities and local authorities to do their duty and help them with the advice of the Central Housing Board. It would be a misfortune if the State should lose all interest in this effort and leave it to municipalities and local authorities. With regard to the needs of the country as to housing, I do not think they have ever been adequately understood by Parliament or the municipalities concerned. When we get some huge national calamity like the influenza epidemic people wake up and a great fuss is made, but within a few years the whole thing dies down again. It seems that nothing but a recurrence of this will shake us out of our comfortable apathy.</p>

When the commission sat in 1920 from which this housing loan took its origin, it reported that the minimum amount then required for housing to put us in a proper position was seven millions. We have spent about £2,600,000, and the need has been growing all the time. The need for that kind of house which is required has not been met, and will never be met, by private enterprise. I hope this will not be the last word of the Government, and that it will not allow all this machinery that has been built up, all this knowledge as to the best type of house, and all this possibility of advice from the Central Housing Board, to be dropped, and leave the matter as it was before 1920.</p>

<p>The question as to the continuance of the responsibility of the Central Government for providing money annually for housing will be considered during the recess to see whether we should go in for another scheme, but that question does not arise now. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) is unfair. In the last four years we had provided respectively £400,000, £337,000, £245,000, and last year £321,000, of which £116,000 has not been expended. This year we are providing £366,000. It is no use putting globular sums on the estimates for housing advances when the money will not be spent. The hon. member attacks me for not putting sufficient money on the estimates for hospitals for the Transvaal. Well, I provide the amounts asked for by each province. What is the good of providing £100,000 if people can only spend £50,000? These people have committed themselves in regard to the expenditure on hospitals costing in the neighbourhood of £250,000. I have undertaken to provide the money, but it is not required all at once. I have provided the Transvaal with the amount it has asked for. Surely the hon. member knows that interest has to be paid on money borrowed, and the provinces do not want to go in for all sorts of expensive schemes, as they have to provide the interest. The whole question of the future of the housing schemes will be considered by the Government, but the matter does not arise this year for we are providing an adequate amount, and even if we put more money on the estimates it will not be expended. We need not vote money specially for the smaller municipalities, as they can be assisted under the Local Loans Act. As to the Port Elizabeth technical college, the allocation has been made bý the Education Department. I told them they have loans to the amount of £430,000. I daresay that rather than stop work the treasury will provide the extra amount needed.</p>

After making use of him, they are the first to criticize him afterwards. But I entirely agree with him from the date of Union the policy directed towards the provincial councils has been directed towards killing the provincial councils. I think the present Government is prepared to give the provincial councils a better chance than in the past. There is not any real sincerity on the part of hon. members in this House towards the provincial councils. In connection with housing I want to emphasize one or two points. The Minister of Finance, in reply to strictures made upon him, pointed out that he devoted a certain sum of money which has not been taken up. I cannot understand the position.

<p>It takes time for these schemes to come along and mature. They will get the money now, but they did not spend it during the year.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>The need for housing is there. Might I point out, the more money we spend on eliminating slums and providing houses for the poorer classes of the community, the better value we shall receive as a community. I know the Minister is interested in the matter, but I do not know if he is sufficiently interested to stress the position of spending as much money as is possible out of what he provides in connection with this matter. I should like to read from the Economic Commission&#x2019;s report, and I shall quote from the majority report, so that it might receive the attention of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). It is imperative that the Minister should not merely provide this amount and not merely see that it is spent, but that he should really consider the whole question of housing from a much more definite and elaborate standpoint to see if the slum conditions that exist in South Africa cannot be eradicated.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I would suggest to the Minister that the practical difficulty arises in the way he has allocated this sum for housing. As a matter of fact, according to the Minister&#x2019;s statement, this £366,000 has already been earmarked for certain schemes. They have re-voted the whole of this amount. Owing to the development of the schemes the whole of the money is not likely to be spent. I would suggest that after he has looked into the matter in the recess, and decided that further sums are to be allowed for housing, he should authorize the Housing Board to accept new schemes and new propositions so that then this money will be used in the year in which it is granted. If the Minister would do that then the new schemes can go on. The position today is that if you go to the Central Housing Board you will not be able to get anymore money because they will say that they have already undertaken liabilities to the extent of £366,000. They will say that they agree that these liabilities may not become liabilities during this year, but they cannot grant any further facilities for housing unless they get a bigger amount, and a grant in addition to their total liabilities. That is where, if I may say so, the stoppage has taken place. They cannot spend the money in the year, and they cannot take on new work during the year, because they do not know next year whether they will have money to continue the process. That is where I would like to see the Minister authorize the Housing Board to take on new schemes.</p>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Then I ask the Minister to do something better than the £366,000. The housing has to go on. There is no doubt from the point of view of this country that the Housing Act of 1920 has to be kept in force. This amount of £366,000 is the balance of what the Housing Board had put at their disposal.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The whole position will be considered further.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that the Minister does not see that not a single new proposition will be accepted this year if only this £366,000 is voted. Though only half that amount might be spent this year, yet, during the year the Housing Board will constantly refuse to allow any further advances on account of housing. The balance of the money will be re-voted next year, and we shall be in exactly the same position as we are to-day. I would suggest if he would only put on another £50,000 the Housing Board would go on allocating further sums of money which they cannot do today. The Minister said that the smaller municipalities can use the Local Loans Act. I have said half a dozen times that that Act is going to be no good for housing. In the first place, none of the money is allocated under 6 per cent.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Surely that is cheap enough.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>It is not cheap enough for housing. The Government only pay about 5.2 per cent. for their money, and, therefore, the Government can easily lend money for housing at 5¼ per cent. 5.2 per cent. covers all their expenses, and they can lend that at 5¼ per cent., because they have the security of the Provincial Council, of the local authority and of the House itself and the individual who has built it. The Housing Board have not lost a single farthing in the last seven years, and the Government is doing a good work without taking any risk. And I say that unless the Minister is prepared to allow the Housing Board to allocate some of this £366,000 for new schemes, it is going to tie up housing altogether, and it is practically going to stop the Housing Act of 1920 from-to-day.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to hear the Minister say that this matter is going to be looked into during the recess. Owing to <span class="col_5075-5076" refersTo="page_1198"/>the cumbersome machinery of our Housing Act&#x2014;Government, provincial council, municipality and then individual&#x2014;and the delay that takes place, there is a weakness I am sorry to say that none of us realized. Now when the Government has a big building scheme on they only ask Parliament to vote a portion of the amount during the year. The Government put down £366,000 on the basis they will spend that amount, but if they find out that only £100,000 is going to be spent surely the Government could say in the same way to these people, &#x201C;You are only going to spend £100,000, so you&#x2019;ll only get £100,000.&#x201D; I think the Minister, if he could do it, and I do not see any reason why he should not under the Act, should allocate the money to the Provincial Council on the understanding that the money would be actually spent during the year. That would release a great deal of this money for other schemes on the basis that they should also be confined to the money that could be spent during the year. That would spread the money over a large number of applicants, and we would do something to get rid of this terrible sore&#x2014;the lack of housing. The Minister will save a lot of money in the long run if he is generous in the matter of housing. There is no loss; the money is reproductive, and there will be a tremendous saving on other votes, such as public health, hospitals, mental institutes, police, and the administration of justice. Those who work in slum areas prove that a good deal of human misery results from bad housing and slum conditions. It is really a most serious social problem&#x2014;one of the most serious we have to face. I hope the Government will not hesitate to put a very large sum of money on the estimates. In future I should like to see a very much larger sum on the estimates for housing. In Cape Town alone, as the Medical Officer of Health points out in his last report, we are thousands of houses short. During the last ten years the shortage has become more and more acute, and what is taking place in Cape Town is also taking place in the Union. At the present rate it will take at least ten or fifteen years to overcome the shortage in houses. The Minister will have the whole of the House behind him in putting a larger amount on the estimates for housing.</p>

<speech by="#hay">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>Possibly the Minister of Finance does not know what has transpired in the past in connection with money wanted for housing. Johannesburg wanted £150,000, and the reply was they were too late By two or three days. When they put in an application later, they were told they were rich enough to get the money themselves. Johannesburg has been compelled under the Urban Areas Act to spend £350,000 for native housing, and faced it, but not a penny piece for houses so greatly required by Europeans. It is a case of subsidizing cheap labour and enabling it to undercut white workers. The Minister might well consider a different system for raising loans for the provinces. If the Union Government itself did not want to go in for premium bonds the provinces could be allowed to do so, and get the amounts they require, thus assisting in the development of the country. Provincial councils have repeatedly passed resolutions in favour of lotteries, and if they were allowed the profits might be devoted to housing. I hope, during the recess, the Minister will go into these suggestions and see if he can allow the provinces to adopt them.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GIOVANETTI</person>:</from>

<p>Loans to the municipalities through the provincial councils for housing purposes are generally made for people who can repay them, but the people referred to by the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander) and the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) must be helped by some other system, and the municipalities concerned will have to take the responsibility for the repayment. In Pretoria we have no difficulty in lending money to people who can afford to pay back, but when we deal with the persons mentioned by the previous speakers, the difficulty has been to obtain payment. Some system must be devised by which houses for the poorer classes may be provided, but on this vote by discussing this matter we are simply beating the air and extending sympathy to people who cannot afford to make use of the moneys advanced under the present scheme.</p>

<p>I granted a loan this morning for one of the native territories. The provision we made last year under the Local Loans Act was altogether adequate. We do not encourage the larger municipalities to come to us for local loans, but I have no doubt we shall be able to assist the small municipalities. We have adequate provision for meeting the cases contemplated under the Act.</p>
