<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person></from>

<p>laid upon the Table&#x2014;</p>

<ol><li>(1) Preliminary considerations, by Ernest Bury, on the Gütehoffnungshütte report on the proposal to establish an iron and steel industry.</li>

<li>(3) Report by Percy A. Wagner, on the Newcastle Iron Works.</li>

</ol>

<p>I do not know whether I am entitled to make a remark in laying these papers on the Table. I propose to lay certain reports on the Table drawn up by officials, but I wish to observe that it is not desirable in general to hand in reports or memoranda of officials. The reason is that the general rule in the public service is not to publish such reports in order not to influence the officials in any way. An official is expected to make his report impartially and if it is known beforehand that his report will be made public, it may influence the report.</p>

<heading>SPEAKER&#x2019;S RULING (QUESTIONS).</heading>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Before the first Order is read, Mr. Speaker, I should like to raise a point of order in order that I may obtain a ruling from you. Hon. members will remember that on Tuesday last I put the following question to the Minister of Justice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) For what offence was the police sergeant at Kuruman recently transferred; (2) what opportunity was given to the sergeant to explain or excuse any alleged neglect, inattention or disrespect to the acting Prime Minister said to have been shown by him?</block>

<p>The reply was as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) The police sergeant was not transferred for any offence; he was transferred to a post in a larger and more convenient centre on the railway line; (2) if he had committed an offence he would have been charged and tried but he was stationed for a length of time at Kuruman greatly in excess of what I lay down.</block>

<p>Arising out of that question I put the following supplementary question to the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Do I understand the Minister to say that the transfer of the sergeant of police had nothing whatever to do with the fact that he failed, aparently, to report himself to the Minister on the occasion of the Minister&#x2019;s visit to Kuruman?</block>

<p>To which the Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have given my answer.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member for Yon Brandis (Mr. Nathan) attempted to put a question to the Minister, to which he replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am not going to answer a single further question on this point.</block>

<p>Thereupon yesterday I handed in the following question to the Clerk of the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Blackwell to ask the Minister of Justice on March 1st (1) whether it is a fact that he visited Kuruman on November the 17th last and in the course of a public speech said the following&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">There is one thing I would like to stress and that is at every place where I have arrived the head of police has come to meet me, but at Kuruman this is not so. The sergeant has not come but I know that the head of the police is away. As soon as I reach Pretoria I will look into the matter?</block>

<ol><li>(2) When did the Minister return to Pretoria, and when did he look into the matter?</li>

<li>(3) Is it not a fact that in less than a fortnight after his visit the sergeant received notice that he was to be transferred?</li>

<li>(4) Was not this action the direct outcome of the Minister&#x2019;s visit and the threat contained in his speech?</li></ol>

<p>That question was handed by me to the Clerk of the House and does not appear on the Order Paper. I understand unofficially that the reason was that it was considered that the first question I put was fully answered. I do not know whether I would be in order in submitting to you at this stage that it was not answered fully or otherwise, but I am raising this point that members may know exactly what they may do in regard to questions. In my submission the answer of the Minister is remarkable for what <span class="col_695-696" refersTo="page_0417"/>it does not contain, and it does not meet the question I put. Of course the supplementary question which I put makes the issue quite plain as to whether the sergeant was transferred because of any dereliction of duty or disrespect to the Minister. The Minister practically refuses to answer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) has correctly stated the facts.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that I had beforehand privately intimated to the hon. member through the Clerk that the question, notice of which he intended to give on the 23rd was not admissible, he pressed for its inclusion on the Order Paper by following the course prescribed by S.O. No. 47 (1). I thereupon directed the Clerk not to admit the question.</p>

<p>There has been a growing tendency this session to place questions on the Order Paper and more especially to ask supplementary questions, not for the purpose of eliciting information but rather of scoring what might be called debating points against the Ministers concerned. Hon. members should remember that questions put in this House are not in the nature of cross examination of, or interrogatories put to, witnesses in a court case.</p>

<p>The underlying principles governing the latitude allowed in respect of questions that may be put to Ministers in the House are very old-established and sound. A question may be allowed which is designed to elicit information for the purpose of a future debate, but it must not usurp debate; it must not in itself be in the nature of or designed to elicit a reply in the nature of debate, one natural element of which is controversy. May, at page 249 (11th Edition), indicates that a question should not contain &#x201C;arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, or controversial or ironical expressions,&#x201D; and that a question may not refer to answers to questions previously asked during the current session.</p>

<p>The grounds upon which the question has been disallowed are, firstly, that the original question was adequately replied to by the Minister, who expressly stated that he was not prepared to answer any further questions on the point, and secondly, that par. (4) of the proposed question not only attributed an unworthy action to the Minister but imputed that the Minister had given an untruthful or, at the least, an equivocal reply to the question of 22nd February, an imputation which certainly would not be allowed in debate.</p>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>Before we go on with that, do I understand that if the Minister announces he refused to answer a question on any particular point, that is out of order?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>An hon. member may question a Minister, but the only means of compelling the Minister to answer is by way of motion. The position is simply this, that if a Minister says he is not prepared to answer any further questions it is futile to put such further questions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marwick">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>Is it in order for a Minister to give an arbitrary refusal without claim as a ground of privilege the interests of the public service? I have always understood, and it is clearly laid down in May, that a Minister may refuse to answer further questions provided he does so on the ground that it is not in the interests of the public service? But in the present case the Minister said arbitrarily &#x201C;I refuse to answer a single further question on this point.&#x201D; Are we debarred from asking a Minister any question, or series of questions, on a very large number of other points?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I have already intimated that there are no means of compelling a Minister to answer any question, except by way of motion, and if any hon. member is dissatisfied with the attitude taken by the Minister in that regard, it is open for him to put a motion on the Paper in order to compel him; and that is the reason why, if a Minister once says that he is not prepared to answer any further question, it would be futile to let any further question be put. Of course, the position is different on the matter of any public interest, and if the Minister says that in the public interest he refuses to answer the question, that settles the matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, it may be desirable and is desirable in the public interest that it should be known publicly that a Minister refuses to answer a question, and that cannot be known if the Minister simply answers that he refuses to answer a certain question.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I would point out to the hon. member that the refusal of the Minister to answer was in connection with questions arising out of answers given to questions appearing on the Order Paper on 22nd inst. and put by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. As far as the question now sought to be put on the Paper by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is concerned, the Minister knows nothing about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#krige">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>I quite agree with you, Mr. Speaker, if your ruling is solely founded upon the fact that the Minister has declined to answer any further question on this point, but I understood your ruling to be further based upon the consideration that in your view the question had been sufficiently answered by the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will permit me. I stated that para. 4 imputes to the Minister an attitude or conduct which would not be allowed even in debate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#krige">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>I therefore submit to you, in regard to all administrative acts of Ministers of the Crown, hon. members have the right to put questions in a supplementary form; and if your ruling is to this effect&#x2014;that Mr. Speaker has to take the responsibility of deciding whether a question was fully answered or not, I would, with due submission, ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether, to a very considerable extent, <span class="col_697-698" refersTo="page_0418"/>you might not be curtailing the rights of private members in asking questions. That I think, Sir, is a point which, I submit to you, is worthy of grave consideration. I would ask you whether you would not give more consideration to that point, because we have established the right of putting supplementary questions and have adopted in this regard fully the practice of the House of Commons.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think it could be inferred that I have to decide whether a question is fully replied or not&#x2014;I certainly would not take that on myself. I think the question has been fully dealt with on the ruling I have given. Ministers are entitled to say they are not prepared to answer a question in the public interest. If they say so, that ends the matter, and nothing further can be done. If there are other matters on which the Minister is asked a question, and the Minister will not reply and says so, the only way of bringing these questions up is by way of motion. I cannot compel him to answer, and only the House can do so.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for the courtesy with which you allowed me to put that point. Do I understand that if para. 4 were eliminated, and something else put in its place that did not transgress the rules, the rest of the question would be allowed to go in subject to the Minister replying or not, as he chose?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>May I put the point to you, Mr. Speaker, with all respect&#x2014; members of this honourable House are not aware of what the tenour of the question was, as it did not appear on the Paper. But I understood that the Minister gave a reply to the question the other day, which the hon. member who asked the question did not consider satisfactory, and he put a supplementary question, which the Minister refuses to answer. Is it not within the privilege of any member of this honourable House to put a question on the Order Paper which has not been put on the Order Paper before? It will then be open for the Minister to refuse to answer, if he desires to do so, but it gives the hon. member an opportunity of putting a concrete question on the Order Paper. If the Minister refuses to answer, the Chair would rule that the question can never be put again. In regard to this question, I understand it was never put on the Order Paper, and the House can have no opportunity of knowing whether the Minister, in his calmer moments, would have reconsidered his answer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>It is open for any hon. member to put any question on the Order Paper, if it is according to the rules of the House. As hon. members know, it is the duty of the clerks to deal with questions as handed in, and if such questions do not conform to the rules, they generally speak to hon. members who have handed in these questions on the point. If the members are not satisfied with the views taken by the clerks, then it is perfectly open for them to see me about the matter. In this instance, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) thought it right to obtain my ruling in the House.</p>

<p>Is there any machinery that would ensure such a motion being reached, or would it necessarily share the fate of private members&#x2019; notices and never be reached if the matter arose late in the session? Unless there is some such machinery, the matter would never come up again, and the effect of Minister refusing to answer would practically end the matter as far as the House is concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I think that the ordinary procedure which is followed in regard to all questions of confidence&#x2014;for I take it that any such motion would be regarded as one of no confidence in the Minister&#x2014;would be adopted, and therefore would have precedence.</p>

</speech>

<p>I am sorry to have to intrude again, but I want to know what penalties could be imposed by the House against a Minister, and how they could be enforced?</p>

<p>In regard to the particular refusal on which Mr. Speaker&#x2019;s ruling is founded, the Minister of Justice said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I refuse to answer any further questions.</block>

<p>Some of us understand that the Minister could exercise his undoubted privilege to refuse to answer supplementary questions, but would this mean that if the Minister meant that for the future he would answer no more questions on this particular subject, that no questions could be put on the Paper bearing on that particular matter? Think what that might lead to. At the beginning of a session, a Minister might say that he would refuse to answer any questions on this or that subject. Hon. members would then be deprived of one of their most valuable privileges&#x2014;that of <span class="col_699-700" refersTo="page_0419"/>obtaining information. The procedure is very largely in conflict with that of the House of Commons, where extensive use is made of this privilege.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I think it would be rather dangerous if I were to generalize. I think each individual case should be treated on its merits. As far as this case is concerned, I think the question should not have been put. As far as the House of Commons is concerned, there are cases in which Mr. Speaker has said, after a Minister has indicated that he is not prepared to answer any further questions, it would be futile to put them. As far as the point raised by the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) is concerned, I shall deal with matters as they arise; each matter will have to be dealt with on its merits. The Clerk will read the first Order.</p>

<heading>ADDITIONAL ESTIMATES.</heading>

<p>First Order read: House to resume in Committee on Estimates of Additional Expenditure from Revenue and Loan Funds.</p>

<p>House in Committee:</p>

<p>[Progress reported yesterday, on Vote 25. ]</p>

<speech by="#boshoff">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOSHOFF</person>:</from>

<p>I am very glad to see that the Minister of Finance has decided to put £6,000 on the Additional Estimates for sanitary services on the diamond fields. I must say that the sanitary services on the diggings leave much to be desired. As one fairly well acquainted with the diggings, I can assure the House that great inconvenience is suffered on the diggings in connection therewith. I am therefore glad about this item, and I hope that proper provision is being made. It is a difficult problem, especially because the diggings are of such a nature that the diggers are here to-day and there to-morrow. I think, however, that the problem can be solved by proper movable buildings or w.c.&#x2019;s which can be removed, just as the diggers remove their houses from one digging to another. Something must be done for the health of the diggers. Then I should like to direct the attention to education on the diggings.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support what the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Boshof) has said. I honestly think that the Minister and the responsible department are not doing their duty to the diggings. When one thinks how many people there are, and that only £5,000 more is asked for sanitary services on the diggings, it is very sad. Unfortunately, the Minister of Mines and Industries is not now in the House, because I should like to put a few questions to him. I will, however, put them to the Minister of Finance, and perhaps he will do me the favour of answering them. I particularly want information about the Lichtenburg diggings, and want to ask whether the Minister of Mines and Industries still intends introducing a new diamond Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member cannot now ask the question, because it does not come under the matter under discussion.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Namaqualand ought not to try and joke about it when one is discussing a serious matter. I am speaking here in the general interests. The diggings are an industry which has arisen in the country and is a blessing. There are thousands of people who are trying to make their living there, and to whom Providence has there given an opportunity. In my opinion, the Government is proceeding very slowly there.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>I think the amount of £6,000 appearing on these Estimates for sanitary services on the diamond diggings is very insignificant because I hear that there is a very large number of diggers on the Lichtenburg diggings, so many that the Government is urged to go so far as to erect hospitals. I should like to ask, however, how it is that in one part of the country the diggers are assisted with Union capital while in other parts the sanitary work is done by divisional councils who use local capital of the division where the digging is situated. Those divisional councils have no benefit whatever from the diggings. All they get out of it is that the roads are worn out by the transport wagons and other vehicles, and that they have to repair them. Hon. members must not think that I am opposed to the vote for sanitary services. On the contrary I think it is a first-class thing the Government is doing, but I think that this work ought to be done by the Government throughout the Union, and that it should not be done in one district by the Government and in another by a divisional council.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mostert">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>I also am glad that there is an additional sum of £5,000 for sanitary <span class="col_701-702" refersTo="page_0420"/>services on the Estimates, but we must not forget that the Government can only know the conditions when they are brought under its notice. That was duly done by the hon. member who represents that part, but now the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) comes to carry off the credit and honour for what the hon. member has done. He induced the Government to see that the sanitary needs on the diggings were looked after, but because the hon. member for Johannesburg ( North) has claims or shares there he wants to rob the representative of that constituency of the honour. This is going a little too far, because we want the man who did the work to also have the honour. We must not forget that in the case of the hon. member for Johannesburg ( North) it is a matter of self interest.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#geldenhuys">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Namaqualand ( Mr. Mostert) takes up the matter in an entirely wrong way in saying that I want to rob the hon. member representing the constituency of the credit. That is not so at all. The hon. member for Namaqualand said that I spoke from self interest, but he is certainly convinced of it that he sometimes speaks from self interest in the House. I am not speaking from self interest, but in the interest of the country and the people on the diggings. The hon. member said that I come from Johannesburg, but I can tell him that there many Johannesburg people go to the diggings, even from my constituency. It is in the interests of the country that an end should be made to the sub-division of farms.</p>

<speech by="#fick">

<from>&#x2020;*The Rev. Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FICK</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think that there is any question here of depriving any member of credit. I do not take it amiss in the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) speaking about this question. He also is interested in the diamond diggings, and let me say that the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) did very well on the diggings. The hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. Mostert) has the same right, but just let me remind him that the credit here does not belong to one or other member, but that a large congress was held in Pretoria in October last to which persons concerned came from all parts of the Union and from the diggings, and where matters were discussed with a view to the maintenance of the interests of the diggings, and one of the matters discussed was sanitation. At the conference then held in Pretoria recommendations were made as regards sanitary arrangements which the Minister is now giving effect to. What is more, health inspectors were appointed to make better provision for the health of the people. It is noticeable on the diggings that where there is a large congregation of people the health conditions are still what they are to-day. This is remarkable, but it is because the people work in the open air, and that class of people is not so delicate as we are in the towns who require provision for everything. It is a hardened class of people who understand battling with nature. Hon. members may believe me that many of us would require more than health inspectors on the diggings. Proper food and drink would, in the first place, be necessary, and, as regards housing, great improvements would also be necessary. All these things were discussed at the Pretoria conference, of which I had the honour of being a member. Those people on the diggings are bravely facing the difficulty with which they have to fight, and they are satisfied that sanitary arrangements are being made. All that is necessary further is to provide hospital accommodation. Movable hospitals would do very well.</p>

<p>In connection with this matter it is difficult to understand that only an additional sum of £5,000 is asked for sanitary services on the diggings. I was there myself four months, and travelled through the diggings time and again. One can, to some extent, imagine the conditions by supposing the Cape Peninsula had, to-morrow, to do without any sanitary arrangements. What would be the position then? Just imagine that the town council of Cape Town had to try to make proper arrangements for all the people in its area with an amount of £6,000. The population on those diggings to-day is 80,000. The sum is quite inadequate. I will not now fully describe the position there, because I shall have an opportunity later. The officials there are doing their best, but if we at all understand the position with a number of white men and their wives and children, the native labourers and native girls who are there, then we will understand that conditions are indescribable. I want to tell the Government that the position there must be improved, and that it cannot be done with an additional sum of £5,000. I cannot propose an increase, for that is not permissible for a private member, but I want to ask the Minister of Mines and Industries to take into proper consideration, after consulting his department, the placing of a large sum on the Estimates for this purpose. Hon. members must remember that there is no water on the diggings, and that <span class="col_703-704" refersTo="page_0421"/>every drop has to be brought by motors for miles. It is, therefore, easy to see what will happen if a drought or epidemic should come. I want very earnestly to warn the Government to spend more money on sanitary services. The people pay for them. The diggers pay a 10 per cent. export tax, and at the moment diamonds to a value of £600,000 per month are produced there. That production will still be increased. The diggings provide a large income for many people, and that is the reason why the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) and his children, as well as hundreds of other people, have interests there. The population consists of persons of all occupations, inter alia, attorneys, advocates, and syndicates in Johannesburg and Cape Town are interested there. Large incomes are obtained on the diggings and on the incomes alone 5 per cent. tax is paid. Then there are the transport riders who pay motor licences.</p>

My hon. friend is apparently under a wrong impression. £11,000 will be spent in this financial year, but we are providing £18,000 for next year. What is more, we have obtained one of the best men, viz., Mr. Bid well who has been very kindly lent us by the Johannesburg Town Council to take charge of the sanitary service on the diggings and to take effective action, and Mr. Bidwell has rendered excellent services.</p>

<p>If he had done a hundred times as much it would possibly not have been enough according to the view of some people and sections. But Mr. Bidwell reported that from a health point of view the position was saved, and the Government attaches great importance to his report, and it was on account of his special experience and competency that he was sent there. As regards the future of the sanitary service, we hope that the legislation we are introducing will improve the position still further, and I ask hon. members not to anticipate matters on the general question in discussing this vote. During the debate on the consolidating Bill which is before the House, there will be an opportunity to discuss the whole matter, and if hon. members will look at Order for the Day No. 3 they will see that a Bill on public health will be proposed by the Minister of Public Health for second reading, and in that way a further attempt is being made to solve difficulties. In conclusion, I just wish to add on what the hon. member said about big financiers, companies and syndicates, and that they also should come under stricter control from a sanitary point of view, and that, as regards the Bill there will be a future for the small man, and that the object is to, as far as possible, exclude the large companies, syndicates and financiers from those diggings.</p>

<p>I am sorry I was not here last night when a reply was made by the Minister to a question by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) in connection with the item payment of iron and steel bounty, £15,000. I would like the Minister to tell the House whether any bounty has been paid, and, if not, why not? I would be obliged to the Minister if he would tell me exactly what the position is in regard to the payment of this bounty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I should like, first of all, to answer that question. No bonus on iron or steel has yet been paid under the law. The estimate here is based on a possible 20,000 tons in respect of which a bonus may be paid at 15s. per ton. That makes £15,000, but according to the 1922 Act, the Minister has to be satisfied that the factory, that the industry is capable of producing at least 50,000 per annum. Now the Minister has not yet been satisfied about that, and the reasons for his opinion why he has not yet been satisfied are given in a letter to the company directly concerned, i.e., the Union Steel Corporation, Limited. I must, therefore, ask my hon. friend to get it from them unless he wishes me to read out the correspondence here, and I take it he does not wish that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am not a bit afraid of the correspondence. So far the Minister has refused to give any information; why I do not know. I do not know whether it is a personal matter against myself, but I have been met with great discourtesy throughout. I ask him to place that certificate on the Table which has been granted by Mr. Reece, who is regarded as one of the foremost blast furnace engineers in the world. He granted a certificate that the Newcastle iron and steel blast furnaces were capable of producing 50,000 to 60,000 tons of pig iron a year. A quibble has been raised under this law with the object of trying to evade the payment of this bounty. The law distinctly lays down that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that such bounty shall only be paid if the Minister is satisfied on data supplied to him by the producer, that the plant is capable of producing at least 50,000 tons per annum of such pig iron or steel as the case may be.</block>

<p>I put it to the Minister what does that section mean? The Minister says, as I understand him, that it is only intended under that section that payment of a bounty should be made to a concern capable of producing 50,000 to 60,000 tons a year. He said it is intended that any industry established should be capable of producing at least 100,000 tons. The thing is as plain as a pikestaff. The law is perfectly <span class="col_705-706" refersTo="page_0422"/>clear. Last year when he set the dates back, what was his intention? Did he not have in mind the payment of this bounty to the Newcastle iron and steel works? I submit the attitude of the Minister is not one in the spirit of the Bounty Act of 1922. The Bounty Act of 1922 makes it perfectly clear that if the producer can satisfy the Minister that the works are capable of producing 50,000 to 60,000 tons every year that the bounty should be paid. What has happened? The blast furnace at the Newcastle iron and steel works, which was only started last July, has, within the first six months, produced 22,467 tons of pig iron. The Minister must bear in mind that the first few months of a furnace are spent in overcoming mechanical difficulties which arise. It is quite true that this furnace did not produce up to its full capacity, but you have the certificate of Mr. Reece stating that the blast furnace at Newcastle is capable of producing 50,000 to 60,000 tons a year. Why does the Minister quibble? Why does he not pay to these people what they are entitled to? Is it in anticipation of this new Bill that they are to be throttled? The Newcastle iron and steel works have had very great difficulties to contend against, and at this stage to raise a quibble I do not think is fair. It is not in the terms of the Act.</p>

Had he some other company in view? I hope the Minister will treat this matter fairly and not try and raise a legal quibble, which I say is not tenable.

He says that it is possible to deliver that quantity and that a certificate from an expert or an engineer confirms that statement. That makes me think of an engineer who said that a certain sluit could carry 100 cusecs of water, but after that was said it could not carry 80. I can still remember how the iron factory at Vereeniging a few years ago was only using scrap iron and the person who wanted to float the concern could not get the capital for it when he came to Cape Town. He subsequently died of a broken heart and one can allege that he was murdered. It seems to me that all our difficulties come from Natal.</p>

<p>I would like to know what the answer of the Minister is to these points which have been raised. The Minister says he is not going to give any information because he has been insulted by the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel). Well, I listened to the speech of my hon. friend behind me, and I construed no insult from the words he used. The argument of the hon. member was this&#x2014; he assumed that the Act of last year extended the bounty system, that it was passed in good faith, and that it was intended to assist that particular industry. At that time there was no other in the country and no other intended, and there must have been some specific object in passing that Bill. The hon. member says &#x201C;Why therefore not help us?&#x201D; There is no insult in that. I am sure that if there had been any insult or imputation of bad faith on the part of any Minister, you, Mr. Chairman, would not have allowed it&#x2014;it would have been a gross breach of the rules. It is a question in which not only the hon. member is interested but the rest of us are interested. We want to know to what extent the existing industry at Newcastle can look for bounties under that Act. It concerns not only the hon. member but the Committee and the country, and I sincerely trust the Minister will reply, and not think that because he has been insulted no information is to be given to the Committee. I think it is a substantial and important point that has been raised. There has been a public debate on it, and it has been dealt with in the press. The people dealt with are under a grievance, and they think they have been dealt with unjustly by the Government.</p>

<p>Of course, if any other hon. member gets up and raises the same point, as the right hon. member (Gen. Smuts) has done, it is only right that the Minister should reply, and I am quite prepared now to reply. The hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) stated that a Mr. Rees had given a certificate, and that he is an expert of standing. It is obvious there is an equal duty on the part of the Government also to get the advice of its technical advisers, and although the Act speaks of the Minister being satisfied, it is clear that the Minister should give his technical advisers an opportunity of reporting on the situation and be guided by their report. With regard to the Act of last year, obviously to meet Newcastle and Vereeniging still further we altered the schedule and shifted the years forward. The Committee must not be under a misapprehension. The amount of £15,000 mentioned refers only to the period to 31st March, 1927&#x2014;the current year&#x2014;it does not affect their right or opportunity of applying for a bounty in respect of next year. The Act says (Section 1 of Act 41)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">.... Provided that such bounties shall only be paid if the Minister is satisfied on the data supplied to him by the producer that the plant is capable of producing at least 50,000 tons per annum of such pig iron and steel.</block>

<p><span class="col_709-710" refersTo="page_0424"/>The Act aimed, both in letter and in spirit, at this, that there should be a capability of producing at least 50,000 tons per annum. The whole idea was to stimulate the industry so as to produce a considerable quantity above 50,000 tons per annum, although that was the minimum. This matter was referred, amongst others, to the Board of Trade and Industries, which went carefully into it and reported on it, and as a result of the consideration by the Minister of that report, and also after consulting the Government Mining Engineer, this letter dated the 21st February, 1927, has been written to the Chairman of the Union Steel Corporation There has been previous correspondence and it was left an open question. The letter reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir,&#x2014;Re bounty for pig iron under Act No. 4I of 1922. With further reference to your letter of the 20th January, 1927, I have been instructed by the Honourable the Minister of Mines and Industries to inform you that, as previously conveyed to your company by letter dated 21st December, 1926, in reply to their letter of the 10th November, 1926, the hon. the Minister is of opinion that as regards the current financial year, in any case, your company has not proved that your plant at Newcastle is capable of producing at least 50,000 tons per annum of pig-iron in the meaning of Section 1 of the above-mentioned Act. The hon. the Minister feels&#x2019; that a 50,000 ton capacity was stipulated in the Act, as an absolute minimum of production which it was surely intended should be on a larger scale. The quotum of 50,000 tons per annum was certainly not fixed as a limit to be striven for, possibly under undue pushing of the furnace, in order to be able to claim the bounty. The mere statement that it is technically impossible for the furnace to produce 50,000 tons per annum of pig-iron does not, in view of the figures of production submitted by your company in a letter dated 15th January, 1927, from Mr. L. Marks, convince the Minister that under conditions of normal annual work without undue hard driving your furnace will ensure a safe annual production of a minimum of 50,000 tons per annum of pig-iron. Act No. 41 of 1922 was placed on the statute book with a view to securing for the Union a really large scale iron and steel works which would give the Union cheap iron and steel. Producing at a maximum capacity of 50,000 to 60,000 tons per annum of pig-iron without the requisite steel mills for making such pig-iron available to the country at cheap rates is really not what the Act intended. From information in the possession of the hon. the Minister it appears that you had only a month ago an accumulated stock of about 11,000 tons of pig-iron on hand representing locked-up capital of approximately £55,000. As the Union&#x2019;s average annual demand for articles like steel rails, galvanized sheets, rods, angles and bars and fencing wire alone amounts to almost 200,000 tons per annum, it is palpably clear that there is not nearly at present, nor will there be in the near future, anything like the large scale works contemplated in the Act of 1922 (and the former Board of Trade&#x2019;s report on which the Act was based) when you have about 11,000 tons of pig-iron on hand out of a half-yearly output of 21,675 tons. Even though the Government is willing to pay out the bounties provided for under the Act when you can prove to the hon. the Minister that you can actually produce a minimum of 50,000 tons of pig iron over a period of 12 months you will admit that under the existing circumstances the country might still have to wait a long time for that large-scale and really economical production of iron and steel contemplated under the Act.</block>

<p>The reasons set forth in this letter are reasons which have been weighed and discussed, and that is the conclusion to which the Minister has come. I hope, therefore, that the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) will appreciate that this is the conclusion come to after much consideration and discussion and interchange of views between the Union Steel Corporation and the department. If the hon. member is under the impression that the department has any grudge against him personally, or against the Union Steel Corporation or against Newcastle he is entirely mistaken. I think the hon. member is the first member of this House who has accused me since I have been a Minister of discourtesy or of personal feeling in any matter of public concern. This is the simple explanation of the whole position.</p>

<p>I wish to call attention to the grants to certified institutions and maintenance of children under the Children&#x2019;s Protection Acts, 1913 and 1921. These grants were originally estimated at £110,000, but an additional £5,000 is now being asked for. I expect the minister will want more money on the main Estimates. How many children has the Minister under his charge?</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Fortunately when the Children&#x2019;s Protection Acts were passed I was not a member of Parliament but the hon. member was, and he voted for them. These Acts having been passed the department cannot help itself. The children are committed by the magistrates and the department is bound under the law to take care of them. Although these Acts came into operation a number of years ago some time elapsed before their benefits became known to the public generally. I think, however, that the people concerned in the class of children affected are now making the fullest use of the Acts, and we can reasonably expect that the increase of expenditure will more or less come to a standstill. The increase is certainly slowing down. In 1921-&#x2019;22 the increased expenditure under the Acts was 82 per cent. above the previous year; in 1922-&#x2019;23 the increase was 19 per cent. in 1923-&#x2019;24, 15 per cent.; 1924-&#x2019;25, 8 per cent.; and 1925-&#x2019;26, 6½ per cent.</p>

<p>Last year Parliament voted £30,000 for the assistance of tenant farmers. That money was handed to the Land Bank to supply draught animals, and this amount of £2,500 is to pay for the different commissions appointed in the districts and also for inspectors to supervise the expenditure. The amount of £2,500 seems a little bit high, but commissions have had to be appointed in the districts where the schemes are being carried out, and the Land Bank has to see that the purchasers are not overcharged.</p>

<p>Hon. members will remember that when the scheme was approved by Parliament last year, and £30,000 voted, I made it clear that the Land Bank would be responsible for the administration. This is not, however, the ordinary work of the Land Bank, and it merely acts as agent of the Agricultural Department.

Districts with East Coast fever were excluded because the fighting of that disease may cause damage to people. This is not a tenant farmers&#x2019; scheme, but is practically the same scheme as that introduced by the Botha Government in the Transvaal to give a team of oxen to certain people who could not help themselves, where they were able to live on the farm of a landowner.</p>

If the Minister is, however, convinced that the landowners on whose arm the bywoners are, are progressive farmers, then he will see that there is not much danger of the cattle dying. The bywoners who would be assisted are actually with progressive farmers who regularly dip their cattle, and who see that their bywoners and natives do it regularly. The Minister can, therefore, quite safely include-East Coast fever districts in the scheme.</p>

<p>I should like to know whether £30,000 is all we can vote for this scheme. I must say that the poor people-on the countryside appreciate it greatly. Prominent farmers are selected and the magistrate also decides whether the farmers are the right ones to have bywoners under this scheme on their farms. The scheme has worked very well, and I do not think that undeserving persons have been assisted. A large percentage of the people have, however, not yet been assisted. Under the Botha Government in the Transvaal the previous scheme worked fairly well, although there was not so much supervision and inspection. To-day the Land Bank is strict in seeing that the cattle remain in good condition. I do not think the amount should be limited to £30,000, because much more is spent under the tenant farmers&#x2019; scheme of the Labour Department. We should try to assist the poor people on the countryside.</p>

I think, however, that if we had voted twice as much the cost of administration would have remained the same. On a former occasion in connection with the Drought Emergency Loan Bill, I discussed the question of supervision with the general manager of the Land Bank and also the appointment of inspectors. I said that it was impossible to spend £20,000 and pay £5,000 for proper supervision. The general manager assured me that if strict supervision was not kept the Government would lose money. I was at first not inclined to agree with him, but I thought that Mr. Herold had more experience about the matter than I and, therefore, approved of his action. My experience now is that Mr. Herold was right, and if such supervision had not existed, the State would have suffered much more damage. The Land Bank is very careful, and I can assure the hon. member that no more money is spent than is necessary to protect the money of the taxpayer.</p>

I expected that would cause a reduction in the grant to the Stellenbosch University, but I find that this has gone up. I see from Vote 26 the grant to Stellenbosch University has been increased. I expected, under this new scheme, when the whole faculty of agriculture was taken away from Stellenbosch, the general grant would have been diminished.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>For the present the vote is being increased. The cost of Elsenburg amalgamation with the Faculty of Stellenbosch will cost a considerable sum more than it used to cost, but we expect in the years to come it will be cheaper. The faculties of universities were entitled to 10 per cent. increase every year, so in ten years&#x2019; time we doubled the amount. This will not be the case with Elsenburg and Stellenbosch now. The only increase will be if it is necessary to appoint a new professor or lecturer in one or the other place. The members of the faculty are also taking a part of the extension work, so that we can have more extension over other parts of the Union. The professors were getting a smaller salary on account of their working only nine months. The Civil Service Commission was approached because they now work for twelve months and had to be paid three months extra. New appointments had to be made to make the faculty a good one, and that is why the increase has come about. £7.500 of the" £12,500 is the 10 per cent. which they had to get, and so the vote is really only £5,000. also the income from their experimental farms comes to the State, so that the increase is not so big.</p>

On the vote last year we gave £98,000 increase and now you come forward for another £15,000 on this item. I consider that was a highly improper address to give to his employees; there was no consideration for the taxpayers in it. I notice also there was a difference between the employees and the Minister on the question of the appointment of a welfare officer. What is a welfare officer at the Post Office for? Is he a new attache to the Treasury crib? Another question on which I want information. What has happened with regard to broadcasting in Johannesburg which has broken down? I see a leading gentleman in Johannesburg is proposing to take it over providing he can bring in Durban and Cape Town. He will not get Cape Town. Of that I am sure. We are satisfied. Then the Minister proposed to bring in an amendment to the law to assist the broadcasting station at Johannesburg. I would like to know about it. I don&#x2019;t understand this thing myself.

The Minister was asked then and there to state what the duties were of this gentleman, to which he replied that he was not going to write out a detailed schedule of duties. Mr. Foley would work harmoniously with the associations If desired, and would give them all the information if given the opportunity. The Minister then said to Mr. Whittaker&#x2014;</p>

<p>No doubt, but I would like to know what additional qualifications he had. I want to know, when making an appointment of this exceptional nature, whether the Minister made inquiry as to whether there were suitable applicants in the ranks of the service, what the results of the inquiry were, and were they such as to lead him to the conclusion that the only person in South Africa to whom the appointment could be offered was Mr. Foley. If he had to go outside the service, why was an opportunity not given to persons who had done welfare work to apply? Was Mr. Foley the secretary of the local Y.M.C.A. or the leader of the Boys&#x2019; Brigade, or had he shown any signs of being acutely interested in the welfare of his fellow beings apart from the welfare of the Labour party? Beyond that, what particular indication had he given to lead the Minister to the irresistible conclusion that alone in South Africa this Mr. Attorney Foley was the right person for this appointment? Personally, I am much gratified at the compliment to the legal profession. But seriously, the Minister must realize that this appointment made outside the service to a post&#x2014;I take it a lucrative post .........</p>

<p>. . . is keenly resented by the whole body of postal servants throughout South Africa. In so far as they are voters they have expressed their resentment. It is hard for the ordinary rank and file of post office employees to be told, when a special appointment of this nature is made, that they are not considered in regard to it and that the Minister goes outside the service. If he had the assurance from his departmental chiefs that there was not a man who could suitably fill the position there would be some justification for going outside. Is Mr. Foley a member of the public service? Is his post such as now to make him a member of the public service of this country? If so, what action was taken by the Public Service Commission in regard to it? Were they consulted? Did they make any recommendation or did they put the usual rubber stamp on that we were hearing about last night?</p>

<p>May I at the outset refer to a matter which is so important that I feel that I should draw attention to it in the House. It is an article that appeared in the &#x201C;Cape Times&#x201D; a few days ago, the 21st to be precise, headed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Post office savings bank depreciated investments,</block>

<p>where they go on by a process of analysis to make deductions from certain statements issued by the Debt Commissioners rather inimical to the position of the savings bank account in the post office. This is one of those cases where I am able to allay any anxiety that has resulted. I do so emphatically. This is one of the cases where the adage is proved to be correct that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Those who have analysed this have gone on a wrong basis altogether. One of the statements made in this article goes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a somewhat lamentable admission that withdrawals are exceeding deposits. £183,000 was received for investment while £237,000 was withdrawn.</block>

<p>That is not all the tale. It does not apply to deposits in the savings bank at all. It applies to the deposit that is made by the Postmaster-General himself from deposits made in the savings bank with the Public Debt Commissioners and the withdrawal referred to is a lump sum withdrawal made periodically by the Postmaster-General which he immediately places in his own account and these withdrawals are based on the estimated requirements for repayments of withdrawals by depositors and have only an indirect relation with the actual deposits and withdrawals by depositors and with-drawers in the savings bank. As a matter of fact the statement is so far wrong that I am able to say, and I do so with the utmost pleasure, that since Union, during the whole of the savings bank operations, there has only been one occasion when the withdrawals exceeded the deposits. In 1919-&#x2019;20 the amount deposited was £4,374,458 and the amount withdrawn was very nearly five millions. That is the only occasion in the whole of our Union experience where withdrawals have exceeded deposits, and so far from its being true to-day we have a balance, and each year before that and since that we have had a balance in favour. The amount deposited in 1925-&#x2019;26 was £3,564,888 and the amount withdrawn was £3,368.425, and that I hope will dispose in the minds of the country of any fear that the position was such as was indicated. Further it goes on to say that investments of post office savings bank money have depreciated. That is perfectly true.</p>

<p>My hon. friend is a past master in the art of osculation! Coming to the question of broadcasting, it is true that broadcasting in Johannesburg went by the board. Even those men who composed the original company will admit, I think, that they were not business men, and if my hon. friend would see the accounts he would agree that they were not. They were public-spirited gentlemen, and they felt that this was a sort of thing that ought to be introduced. I want to pay a tribute to these men for putting their money into it. It was little more than a society of their own, and I am afraid that unfortunately they will lose every penny of their money. In spite of efforts to bolster it up it went to the ground. Different people came to see me to restart the scheme, including the Mayor of Johannesburg. I could not see my way clear to agree to the suggestions that were made. A suggestion was made that the Johannesburg municipality should take it over and run it like the Durban municipality. That appealed to me. It was suggested to me that Mr. Schlesinger should take it over, but I did not like that idea, and I refused. I had an interview with various people interested&#x2014;the Mayor, the Publicity Association, and members of scientific and technical societies, and, later on, with Mr. Schlesinger himself, who made an amended proposal, with which I am inclined to agree. He suggested that a public company might be formed and that the Government might have one representative on it. I stipulated for two members, and the hon. member will agree that it is wiser.</p>

<p>A public company is to be formed and the Government will have a censorship over the programme to see that nothing is wrong.

Originally his suggestion was, and he made it a sine qua non, that he should have a monopoly over the whole Union, and I said straight out that I would not be a party to that and to taking away the Cape Town and Durban licences from their municipalities, but I did make a promise that, if the House agrees, piracy should not occur any more with the company than with the others. I do not think we shall require legislation as the Act is sufficiently comprehensive. If other stations relayed programmes sent out by Mr. Schlesinger that would be piracy.

Will the public be allowed to subscribe at par for shares, and for how long will the contract be?

That is, they will have a monopoly of that licence, unless some untoward circumstance arises which militates against the interests of the public, for example, in times of national emergency. We do not control the board of directors, but we do control the licence. For five years it is secured to them. For the second five years it is also secured, except that we can take it away for State purposes, and Mr. Schlesinger agrees that if the State wants it for its own purposes, it should be allowed to take it. The whole thing is on a quite sound basis. The company&#x2019;s share of profit is limited to 10 per cent. and any overplus must be equally divided between the company, the State, and the listeners-in.</p>

When Mr. Whittaker asked this question, he was apparently not aware that a similar office was in existence in other parts of the world. Surely Mr. Whittaker should have made known to him the duties of an officer of this nature. We have not been told either whether there was or was not an officer in the service who could have filled the position. We do know now that Mr. Foley was a friend of the Minister, that he knew him from top to bottom. I am totally opposed to importing people from outside. The Minister has been the greatest sinner in this respect. He takes a gentleman whom I don&#x2019;t know, excepting that I knew there was a gentleman named Foley, a partner in a firm in Benoni. I am glad to know that Mr. Foley is a returned soldier, but surely the firm of which he was a member would have been loyal enough to keep him in the firm when he came back from active service. I am not concerned with Foley as an individual, or with what he earned before, but I am concerned with the fact that the gentleman was imported from outside, and that no other member of the service was given an opportunity to get this appointment.</p>

<p>This is a lesson to them. When they came to me, they said they have got 53 families there, and they put three proposals before me. One was to sell the place to the highest bidder, another was that we should pay them another £12,000 and take the place over, and the third was that we should give them £5,000 and let them carry on. Under the Act which we passed last year, they are entitled to a subsidy of £12 per family. At my request, the board made an inspection, and in their report they strongly recommended that we should give these people £5,000 so that they could start in a proper way and provide themselves with trek cattle, implements, etc. I thought this was the best way out of the difficulty. I agreed to give this sum on condition that they would not be entitled to the grant of £12, and on the further condition that they had to appoint a superintendent who is an agricultural expert, and of whom I shall have to approve, so that I know that the place will be properly run. The Cabinet decided that would be the best way out of the difficulty, and so £4,000 has been placed on the estimates. In reply to the hon. member for Klip River (Mr. Anderson), I may mention that the Act which we passed last year, the National Parks Act, contains a clause which empowers me, as Minister of Lands, to declare any other park or game reserve as a national park, and then it would fall under the administration of the board appointed. But, of course, there is a great deal of expense connected with the matter. The provincial authorities in the Transvaal spent £7,000 a year on the Kruger National Park. I approached the provincial authorities in the Transvaal and said, seeing that I had taken this place out of their hands, would they be prepared to pay £3,000 a year, and I would pay £4,000? They agreed to that. There is certain revenue which they can obtain from this place, but they will only get that when they have constructed roads and so on, and I can quite understand that under the circumstances they have not started operations. The board have not yet made a recommendation to me with regard to the inclusion of other parks. That matter is entirely in their hands. There is, of course, a national park in Natal administered by the provincial authorities and with the assistance of an advisory committee, and in the same locality is the game reserve at Giant&#x2019;s Castle. The whole question is of course, one for the board to consider. There are these parks in Natal, and it is for the National Parks Board to come afterwards and tell me how many, if any, and which particular ones should be made national parks, as soon as the revenue justifies, and then I will bring the matter before Parliament.</p>

<p>In regard to the Goedemoed labour colony, this has been in existence for twenty years. They owe about £28,000 of Government money, and they have paid no interest on it, nor have they paid sixpence off as far as the records show. They have gradually got down and down, and have to come for Government assistance. With great respect I want to say that it is a grave reflection on the capacity of the Dutch Reformed Church not to be able to manage the thing better.

<p>The fact is as stated by the hon. gentleman, that one shilling an hour on all public works contracts has to be paid for unskilled labour. The majority of the builders, particularly in the Transvaal, were in favour; they agreed that the time has arrived when we should uplift the general standard of those who are regarded as unskilled labourers in this country. But strong representations were made to me to confine its application to whites; in other words, that we should have a clause in our contracts laying it down that the shilling an hour should be paid for unskilled labour, but it must be white labour.</p>

<p>It is unjust, and I point blank refused. In point of fact one firm down here in the Cape, which had tendered on those conditions, immediately afterwards wanted to go back to native labour at 7½d. I appealed to them to help us in this new policy of a general uplift. They agreed, and tried it only for two days. They discharged all their civilized labour and took on natives again and made the same request. My hon. friend the hon. member for Worcester (Mr. Heatlie) says they pass it on. I can give you one specific case&#x2014;that of the Kimberley post office&#x2014;the estimate for which was £38,000, based on 7½d. per hour unskilled labour, and the tender was, for 1s. an hour unskilled labour, £34,000, by Messrs Church &amp; McLachlan. The fact remains that in the majority of instances, except where the labour was unobtainable, the tenders were lower than the estimates. The Kimberley post office is a fair example, and is a big work. Mr. Church told me when I was in Kimberley that the work would have cost him three times as much if he had had the use of raw unskilled native labour.</p>

We ought to ask the Minister of Finance to give an explanation as to how it is these apparently conflicting and irreconcilable conditions of pay exist in the different departments of the Government. It is important, and he is the one with his hand on the switchboard. In one department we have the Minister applying his extremist views in extreme ways.

They are taken on for a contract, and they finish when the job finishes.</p>

<p>When it comes to a question of building from the Native Development Fund, money put up by natives themselves, do you lay down restrictions in those contracts to enforce the use of white labour? There seems no doubt that in these contracts certain clauses have been inserted which tend to restrict, if not to prohibit, the use of native labour, and I feel sure that the Minister must agree with me that such restriction is very unfair, especially when these works are being built with money raised by direct taxation from the natives themselves. I ask the Minister to give me his assurance that he will look into the matter so that any contracts in the future do not include any such clauses.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>Before the adjournment I was mentioning to the Minister the matter of certain buildings erected from funds provided through the Native Development Fund, and a provision in the contracts that was designed rather to encourage the employment of white labour on those buildings and the exclusion of native labour. The Minister has assured me that as far as he knows that is not the fact. I hope he will look into the question because I think he will find that there are cases where that has happened and I believe he will agree with me that where money has been raised by taxation placed upon themselves, the natives should at least have the opportunity of providing the unskilled labour required on those buildings. I would ask the Minister to give the matter a thorough investigation. There is another matter somewhat in the same connection in regard to the construction of telephone lines. We were assured very definitely that in the native territories preference would be given to native labour for rough work and that unskilled white labour was not going to be used in the territories for the construction of telephone lines.</p>

That will throw a great burden on the farming population. There are many persons working for farmers who as a result of this arrangement will leave their service and come to the towns. The result will be that there will be no progress in farming matters. They will now be compelled to pay 1s. per hour for unskilled labour. As a business man I can see that if the labourers can earn as much as 1s. an hour on public works then they will not want to work on farms. I am sorry that I was not in the House this afternoon, but I should like to know the attitude of the Minister because our farmers have become frightened of the provision that unskilled labourers on public works are to receive 1s. an hour.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>No, but for the Minister to argue that the farmer could not be affected by this declaration of his in all Government contracts for Government buildings is entirely erroneous. He must bear in mind that farmers do not always continue to farm out in the district. They often come into the towns to build their residences. In my own constituency a new part of the Caledon township is being laid out and large numbers of farmers are putting up their residences there. In another part of the township the Minister is constructing a building where he is paying unskilled labour, irrespective of colour, 8s. a day. In that very same township a farmer or any other citizen is building a building for his own private use. Does the Minister think in a comparatively small township that the fact of his paying 8s. a day on a Government structure is not going to affect the wages the private builder is going to pay? The Minister must have a very peculiar idea of human psychology if he thinks that. What I object to is this, that we, as taxpayers in this country are being saddled in the case of all Government buildings with extra expenditure. Every contractor when he tenders for Government contracts will have to take into account 8s. a day for unskilled labour. In the country districts there is no demand for this exorbitant wage. I can only now, in the name of my constituents, protest against this innovation which has been brought about by the Minister in all Government contracts in regard to public buildings. We are now calling for tenders in connection with the Caledon hospital, for nurses&#x2019; quarters. The provincial authorities have agreed to give us a certain fixed amount towards that. We have to provide the balance necessary. We have got that by private subscription; we have about £1,500 in hand, which is the estimated cost. Now the Minister comes along and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now I am going to encumber that building to be erected; unskilled labour has to be employed there at 8s. a day.</block>

<p>The result is we should have to go back to the public for additional donations in order to cover the Minister&#x2019;s wage regulation. I can assure the Minister that this is a most unpopular regulation and he will hear a great deal more of this new departure in taking away the right of the contractor, the right of the principal who is responsible to the contractor, the right of people to pay according to circumstances in different parts of the country. I protest against this new regulation.</p>

<speech by="#brown">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. BROWN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) that he is behind the times and out of line with modern thought. His speech is based on the assumption that paying a civilized wage is going to add to the cost of the building. It is going to do nothing of the kind. I suggest to him that he reads a book, &#x201C;The Life of Lord Brassey,&#x201D; written by his son. He was the largest constructor of railway works in the world and he says that in India they employed very cheap labour on the contract; then they had to do work in Canada, where they had to take men from the British isles and pay them a very high wage and at the end of the contract their labour costs were no greater in Canada on the high wage than they were in India on the low wage. The idea of the hon. member was exploded long ago. By paying a civilized wage you encourage a man to put the best that is in him into the job, and by paying a low wage you perpetuate the system of the employer paying the lowest wage he can pay and the workman doing the least work he can. I approve of the line the Minister has taken on economic grounds, because in the long run it is going to be much cheaper and better for South Africa to base its labour on a civilized standard.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Lt.-Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. PRETORIUS</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Germiston ( Mr. G. Brown) that we ought to pay a man a wage on which he can live. But here we find that the Minister compels the contractors to adopt a provision in the contract that they will pay unskilled labourers 1s. an hour. If a provision is to-day put in the contract that unskilled white labourers are to receive 1s. an hour, then I should have nothing to say against it. We know, however, what the position in the Transvaal is, viz., there are white and native labourers. The provision in the contract does not stipulate that only the white labourer is to receive 1s. The present provisions encourages the natives to demand the same wages everywhere as what are paid for unskilled white labourers. I think the Minister&#x2019;s principle is dangerous in the Transvaal. If the contract provides that white labourers are to receive 1s. an hour and native labourers a little less, e.g., the half, then the contractor can be compelled to use a better class of labourer. If, however, the natives are paid at the same rate as the whites, then I consider it a hopeless principle. The effect of it will be felt in the future. The natives will go to the villages where large buildings are being put up. The contractor will say that he prefers to use native labourers, because he will be able to push them, and we know that a white man will not willingly permit that. This policy in the Transvaal will result in something we do not anticipate to-day.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>The speech of the hon. member for Germiston (Mr. G. Brown) is typical of the Labour party. Directly anyone puts forward the agricultural point of view you get these gentlemen of the Labour party saying they don&#x2019;t know what they&#x2019;re talking about, and they are fools to talk like that. I grant that we are fools to allow the Labour party to get their grip round our neck in the way they do. They <span class="col_739-740" refersTo="page_0439"/>repeat these platitudes, and they do not know what they are talking about. It is just like putting a gramophone on the floor of the House and letting it reel out the same old tune. You might just as well put a parrot on that table and let it voice the principles of the party. It would give you just as much common sense as the Labour party would themselves. We have the platitude that when you pay a man a higher wage you get better work. That is not the point at issue at all. The point is whether it is a good and sound principle to pay a white man 1s. an hour&#x2014;which is, after all, a low rate of wage&#x2014;and to pay a native 6d. to 9d. an hour, which is a high rate for unskilled labour. If that is a sound principle applied to building, then it must be soundly applied right through labour in this country. The hon. member is sitting beside two farmers of the old school. Are they prepared to pay 1s. an hour for unskilled labour on their farms? Of course they&#x2019;re not! These rates of wages are gradually being fastened on to us; the shackles are gradually being rivetted on to us, and the time will come when we shall not be able to shake them off. These labour doctrines and ideals are surely going to spread to the country. Then we are going to say, S.A.P. or Nationalists&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What fools we were to enter into this Pact.</block>

<p>We belong to the conservatives, we farmers on both sides of the House. The hon. the Minister of Lands is smiling; he is one of the old conservatives himself, he dare not get up and support the Minister for Labour. I welcome it for this reason, that it is going to drive the conservatives of this country into one camp. Then we shall treat the Opposition then as they should be treated. The Opposition will consist of men who have not the real interests of the country at heart, but whose only aim is to squeeze the uttermost penny from the taxpayer and the wage-earner of this country. When they have squeezed them dry they will pack up their tools and go to another country. The hon. member for Witbank (Mr. A. I. E. de Villiers) has a broad smile on his face. He is going to be in the same boat as we; in common parlance, we shall be left to &#x201C;nurse the baby.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I can understand the speech of the hon. member for Germiston (Mr. G. Brown). It is all right to pay 8s. a day when it is earned, but does he tell me the native labourer will earn 8s. a day on this job. Let it be paid when the wage is earned; no fair-minded man would object to that, but to go and pay it to unskilled labour when it is not earned is another story altogether. This move of the Minister&#x2019;s is going to have two effects. First of all the farmers will be affected because they employ unskilled labour on their farms, and everyone knows perfectly well the farmer cannot afford to pay 8s. a day or anything like it. There is another point my hon. friend seems to have overlooked entirely. The skilled man in this country gets the highest wages in the world outside the United States, simply because the wages of unskilled labour are the lowest in the world probably.</p>

<p>The Minister has adopted a very dangerous principle in this clause. In Natal the unskilled man gets 4s. a day, if you adopt this principle he will ask to be paid 8s. a day, and it is going to affect native labour throughout the whole country. At the docks at Durban Zulu labourers are paid 4s. a day. I want to warn the Minister. If it is paid to natives under civilized conditions, I have nothing to say. If this is applied, however, to the native who works on a building in Natal, you will find your costs very largely increased, the I.C.U. being very busy in Durban rendering the hitherto good relations generally existing between master and servant.</p>

<p>What is the position in the United States? The farming and commercial community there recognize to-day that higher wages mean prosperity to the commercial community and the farmer. When my hon. friend suggested that bankruptcies occur in the United-States amongst farmers, the reason is that many of them are mortgaged. It was rather amusing to hear the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) attempt hereniging in this House, and say that his hon. friends of the Nationalist-party were wrong in associating with members of the Labour party, and he was trying to get at the Minister of Public Works because he is a good Labour man and a good socialist. The hon. member waxed so eloquent that his eloquence ran away with his discretion, or any reason we might have expected from him. That they get so wroth with the Minister of Public Works is the best indication that he is doing his job well, and carrying out his principles. I am quite sure that when the Minister has been in office for many years, as we hope, the fruit and results of his work will be shown. It has been proved and emphasized that if you crush down the lowest paid workers, you create a depression throughout the whole of your system, with the exception of a few highly-placed people who control and manipulate finance and industry, but apart from these, the policy of the Minister will stand the test of time. The small shopkeepers in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg, or in towns of any size that are dealing with industrial workers or wage-earners, need not fear the policy of the Minister. The only people who will suffer to a certain extent are the large employers.</p>

They are anxious to make the thing a success and to uplift the bottom dog, but we don&#x2019;t want to do it all at once. That is why I have agreed to variations.

The result is calculated to be quite the reverse to what the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) seems to anticipate.

I would like him to go back to the Native Territories and tell the people there the attitude he has taken up here. No case has been made out against the imposition of the shilling-an-hour rate.

My judgment is perhaps not perfect. I know my hon. friend is very sorry to hear it, but I am prepared to concede something to other people&#x2019;s judgment, and that being so I came to the conclusion that it would meet the needs of all concerned if I made the scheme at the start apply only to the big towns, but in the countryside to make variations.

<block name="quote">Draw the natives to the towns by telling them that they can earn a shilling an hour.</block>

<p>Can the hon. Minister reconcile these two views? We in the country have to live with this so-called uncivilized labour&#x2014;our existence depends on these natives and the existence of the native depends on his living and developing in the country, for he is often led astray by coming into the town. The best natives are invariably those who live in the country. The greatest enemy that the native has are those gentlemen who tell him that when he comes to the towns he can earn a shilling an hour, put on a white collar, and call himself a white man, and forget his own home and people. I appeal to any Nationalist member from the country who understands the natives to get up and support the doctrines we have heard to-night, if he honestly can.</p>

Is that the test?&#x2014;for that is the civilized labour policy the Minister has preached to-day. What is happening here in Cape Town? The Administrator has been told that he can undertake the excavation of the site for a new hospital at Groot Schuur provided he uses &#x201C;civilized labour,&#x201D; but it must not be black. That is the distinction as far as I can find out from the Minister; as long as a man&#x2019;s skin is black, he cannot be civilized. Is that the doctrine the Minister preaches when he makes the proviso in his contract that no man, whatever his civilized standard may be or his educational attainments, so long as his skin is black, he cannot be employed? Is that the doctrine of the Labour party?</p>

I come from the Transkeian territories, where we have one million natives chiefly depending on the labour of their own hands. I find contractors coming from Johannesburg to build a hospital for the natives themselves out of funds that we vote here, and the condition is that it must be constructed with civilized labour costing 1s. per hour, which means that natives are practically debarred.</p>

<p>I want the natives to have a fair chance of earning their living in decent conditions, and of rising in that scale of civilization of which the hon. Minister has preached to-day. What is happening in Johannesburg? There they are erecting a native location under the Native Urban Areas Act, but the natives have to pay a rental for the buildings, and the conditions are that those buildings shall be erected by civilized labour, which means white labour. Every native knows they could be erected at half the price by black labour, and they also know they have ultimately to pay the cost. Is that right? Cannot I appeal to any former on that side? No. Then I issue a challenge to any member of the farming fraternity on the Nationalist benches to rise and support the doctrine which the hon. Minister has just preached. If this challenge is accepted, it will be one of the greatest surprises of my life. I ask the hon. Minister not to get up straightaway, out to give any of those gentlemen an opportunity of rising before he gets up himself.</p>

<p>Members on the Opposition side must have reason to congratulate themselves on the advancement of their cause by the attitude of the last speaker. Clements Kadalie will find a lot of assistance from the contents of that speech. In this House we advocate the dominance of the white people, and we say the native is a ward of ours, and we are his wardens. Yet you hear a representative <span class="col_745-746" refersTo="page_0442"/>of the natives in this House stand up and say we depend upon the native for our existence. Whether he means economic or social existence I do not know, but it is the most degrading declaration I have ever heard from a European. We, of the Labour party, have never confessed that we depended upon the native or any inferior race. We look upon a people who are unable to maintain themselves by their own exertions as inferior. Many of those who deem themselves our superiors, we look upon as inferiors. I would like to refer the hon. gentleman to the biggest industry in the country, owned and controlled by his political friends on this side. I do not remember him coining back and raising an outcry when he went through the compounds and saw natives working in the time offices and hospitals, and wearing collars, and paid a wage which enabled them to live up to a standard of decency. Nor, on the other hand, did he cry out in protest against human beings being herded together by the thousand like animals, scientifically well fed for their tasks, separated from their women kind in the prime of manhood, with immorality rife all round, and unspeakable practices rampant amongst them. We did not hear that outcry, but we do hear an outcry when a Labour Minister tries to pay for labour what it is worth. Have you proved the labour is not worth the price he pays? Have you attacked him on that economic point? Such a speech is calculated to raise the anger of those who the hon. member and his friends say we must look upon as our economic and social inferiors. You do not attack the Minister on the grounds that we have wasted public money by paying a bigger price for labour than it is worth. In conclusion, when our friend wants to convince this House and the public that he is sincere, let him put his finger on the political, social and economic sores which exist, and let him point out to the House, as well as to utilize the press of the country to broadcast, the fact that those sores do exist. The credit of this House rests upon its sincerity. If the credit of this House rests upon its sincerity, and if the public becomes convinced that this House is simply an arena to cast backwards and forwards insinuations for the purpose of scoring political advantage, then the House is going to fall into discredit. The native question is much too serious in this country to be used for that purpose. By taking the line he has taken, he has injured his reputation, and it does not redound to the credit of the hon. member when he seizes the occasion of proper remuneration to the native to speak this way, and does not recognize that all labour, European or native, is worth its hire.</p>

<p>It has this to do with it. That is policy which is controlling labour conditions in regard to the farmers in Natal and all parts of South Africa. Every native in every line of agriculture is paid by results. In my district they earn half-a-crown a day and their keep. I hope farmers on the other side will see the point of the pernicious policy of the hon. Minister. The hon. Minister advocates a minimum wage of a shilling a day in the towns. Does he know there is a movement on foot among the natives to amalgamate and join together, and it will not be long before they demand these conditions on the farms? What will happen to the farmers then? The backbone of this country are the farmers. We have made this country with the aid of native cheap labour, and we are expected to compete in the markets of the world, which we are able to do owing to cheap labour. We realize that native labour is our best asset, and we have built up the wealth of the country with it. Some of these hon. gentlemen, the flotsam and jetsam of other countries, would not have been here to-day but for the native. The South African farmer appreciates that asset, and is anxious to treat the native fairly. One hon. gentleman from the cross benches shouted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What about Australia?</block>

<p>The minimum wage on farms for unskilled labour in Australia is two shillings an hour, and what about the condition of the population in Australia?

It is because of the socialistic Governments they have there. Every piece of land in the six States of Australia has got to bear five taxes. The small farmer, with that taxation and the high rate of pay for unskilled labour, cannot make a living, and he is driven into the towns, and there employment is created for him by socialistic Governments, who are entrenching themselves by finding jobs for these people. I would appeal to my friends on the opposite <span class="col_747-748" refersTo="page_0443"/>benches who have the same calling as I have to regard this as the writing on the wall.

Before long an inspector from the Public Works Department came along and asked the masons what they were getting. They said 10s. He told them they were not allowed to do that and that they must get at least 2s. 9d. per hour and must not work for more than 8 hours a day. What was the result? The contractor said that if he had to pay that rate of wages he would lose on the contract. He had to sack all his men.

<p>At Britstown. It was impossible for this contractor to pay 2s. 9d. per hour and the men had to go without work. This policy is going to have a serious effect upon agricultural employment in this country and especially the regulation that unskilled work must be paid at least 1s. an hour. We know that the greater portion of the farmer&#x2019;s income depends upon world conditions while the cost of his produce is determined by domestic conditions. A contractor can in the next instance put in a higher tender so that he is able to pay these higher wages, but what is the farmer going to do? He cannot raise the price of his produce because that is fixed by world conditions. With reference to the remarks of the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. Christie) the hon. gentleman held up the United States where high wages were paid not only in the towns but also in the rural districts. I have here a dispatch from Washington based on the report of the department of agriculture in the United States which shows that in 1925 there was a net loss to the farm population of 900,000 persons on account of the increasing drift to the towns. In 1924 the net movement away from the farms was 697.000 persons. An appeal was made by the hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) to farmers&#x2019; representatives on the opposite side. I did not rise then, because I thought I would give them an opportunity of speaking, but they have preserved an absolute silence. Their faces, however, told the story when the appeal was made. They know as well as we on this side know that this policy is going to seriously affect the agricultural industry in this country.</p>

<p>There would appear to be a good deal of widespread misconception as to the object with which this clause was inserted by the Minister in his labour conditions. I confess that in my simplicity I thought the object was to exclude native labour; but the Minister has indicated to the House that his object was directly the contrary. He intended to convey the idea that the proviso was put in for the purpose of increasing native wages. I think that is pure cant. The hon. member did not mean that. That is not the object of putting in this 1s. per hour; the object clearly is to squeeze the native out of this sphere of labour and possibly a good many coloured people also. Here, again, is another colour bar. There is no question about it. The effect of this provision, apart from other aspects, is to exclude the native and a good many coloured people also from getting employment. I submit that, after all, the native has some claim to our consideration. I heard hon. members on that side talk with tears in their voices about the white man being the guardian of the native. There is no evidence of that now. The Minister is being supported in what is another colour bar. I want to indicate further what the effect of this will be. I happen to be interested in a native township near Johannesburg. It is a purely native and coloured township.</p>

<p>That is not correct either. I can only say that the Native Affairs Commission and others familiar with the matter favour that solution of the native problem. The health committee of that township want to put up an office. They have sufficient funds to do so, if it can be erected by people resident in the township. There are natives sufficiently skilled to do the work, but this is an area to which the wage board provisions apply, and they cannot do it unless they pay the very high wages laid down. So you see the operation of this. There is no doubt that you cannot lay down prices of labour in regard to one industry and not another. So many of us lose sight of the fact that this country has been built up largely by native labour, cheap labour. If you eliminate that and go up to high prices, you have to pay the penalty. The time will come when these increased prices of labour will be forced upon the country people. Farmers have a hard enough time already with droughts and other drawbacks. Now they have this spectre in the background of their native labour being tampered with by pernicious contract clauses being initiated.</p>

They are trying to tell us the old, old story of a low wage being the best asset the country could have. It has been proved time and time again that that is a fallacy. I say this, that low wages in this country are one of the curses of the country, and anything we can do to increase the standard of wages and the consumption that follows will be one of the best things we can do for South Africa.

If the great mass of the working people of this country could get a higher standard, the interests of the country would benefit to a great extent. But they do not want that on the other side. All they want is cheap labour and exploitation. The hon. member for Umvoti talked about a declining agriculture in Australia. Is the wheat-growing any less? Are the agricultural products of Australia becoming less and less year by year? The hon. member knows it is not so. Improved agricultural conditions and improved wages in Australia are enabling them to compete most successfully in the world&#x2019;s market, just as improved conditions and wages in this country would do. With sugar produced by white labour, they can compete against Natal where coolies are paid at scandalous rates.</p>

He accused us of being the natives&#x2019; enemy. It is admitted by hon. members on the cross benches that if the shilling an hour rate were adhered to the natives would get no work at all and that this is the object of the regulation, and then they have the hardihood to say that we are trying to do the natives out of their job. If the hon. members on the cross benches had their way there would be a clause providing that the shilling an hour should be paid only to white people. The hon. member has no more idea of how to run a farm than how To run the Roberts Victor diamond mine. We farmers, however, understand labour conditions and do not believe in the policy of making white and black compete in the labour market. The white man&#x2019;s task is to perform skilled labour. A flat rate of a shilling an hour is going to do good neither to white nor to black.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>The Administrator is not working his farm with white labour. Let us realize that there are plenty of jobs for white men on farms. I have proved personally that it pays to cut up a farm and instead of attempting to run a farm, say, of 6,000 acres by oneself it is better to cut it up into six different sections and to put a white man in charge of each section to direct the labourers employed on it. In this way we could absorb a lot of white labour. The rising generation should be taught that it is their task to direct native labour. Unskilled labour has been, and always will be, supplied by the native. The white man belongs to the dominant race and should realize his responsibility to direct unskilled labour. The sooner we get away from the policy of bringing them into competition and thus dragging down the white man, the better it will be for the country. An instance of the evil of attracting white men to the towns is to be found at Durban, where white men working on the railways for £7 or £8 a month are living in the most appalling conditions. Whole families are existing in one room in the most awful conditions of insanitation. I am entirely opposed to that policy, and the sooner we get the white man back on to the land and make a producer of him, the better. That is the line we should follow, and not attempt to create a minimum wage standard, which is dragging the one race down and doing the other no good at all.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister of Public Works two or three questions. The Minister claims that in departing from the original condition regarding the payment of one shilling an hour, his desire was to uplift the native. What I should like to know is what is the practical working of the present arrangement? Does the Minister adopt the same definition of civilized labour that the Minister of Labour uses? That is Question No. 1. Whether in the working of his department he limits the people who are to work to those of the civilized standard, and whether he places the same definition as the Minister of Railways and Harbours has stated in this House, that no matter what the standard of education of the native they cannot get work under the civilized conditions. I next want to ask him whether the work that is done at Groote Schuur is not done by the provincial public works under the general direction of the Minister of Public; Works and his <span class="col_753-754" refersTo="page_0446"/>department who will direct this labour policy. The next question I would like to ask is whether in fact the Minister of Labour has given direction that the work of this hospital is to be performed, according to notification in the papers yesterday, by civilized labour and not native labour, and that the Government is going to pay a special subsidy for the increased cost. I want to ask next under what circumstances does the Minister or the Department of Labour interfere with the policy and control of another department such as that of the Public Works Department itself. These are three or four simple questions to which I shall be glad to get a direct answer. I ask these questions as testing questions as to the merit claimed by the Minister of Public Works that he is doing what he can to uplift the native by the policy of striking from the contract, as a matter of form, the exclusion of natives, and whether the native is not as effectively excluded by the department controlled by the Minister of Public Works itself.</p>

<p>I do not differentiate in the application of the 1s. an hour. A concrete example will prove it. If the hon. member goes to his own town of Valkenburg, where there are extensive alterations taking place, he will see the employer is employing natives. The choice of unskilled labour does not rest with me at all. It rests entirely with the employer. All I stipulate is that he should pay 1s an hour in the town. With regard to the Groote Schuur hospital, it is a provincial service, and the conditions are set by the province, and it has nothing to do with me. I have nothing to do with the labour. So far as interference is concerned my hon. friend does not interfere, but the Minister of Labour lays down the general conditions for labour throughout the country and, in that way, impinges on every other department.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHRISTIE</person>:</from>

<p>I would like again to appeal to the Minister in regard to the final part of this clause, wherein he definitely takes away a right, a vested interest, which certain people have enjoyed for many years. I refer to the concluding portion which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that such work is carried out on the instructions and to the order of a dentist, but it shall not be lawful for any such person to perform any other function specially pertaining to the practice of dentistry.</block>

<p>I want to make it clear that the dental mechanics in the Transvaal in future will only be able to do work to the orders of a dentist. As many of these people have been doing this work all their lifetime, and doing it for the public, and have been competing against the dentist, it is quite obvious that the dentists will not give them any work to do, and that they will be victimized for all time. I called the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a specific case the other evening of a man who has been practising as a dental mechanic, and who is now too old to adopt any other vocation. He will be compelled practically to go on to relief work. I suggested to the Minister that if he would be prepared to give some opening to those people in the succeeding clause, I thought that would meet the case. I would suggest to the Minister that we should let these people come in under sub-section (3) of Clause 36, and take a modified examination, and thereby be put on the same basis as those 20 dental mechanics of the Operative Dental Mechanics&#x2019; Society of the Transvaal. I would like the Minister to seriously consider that. I want to emphasize the fact that he said nothing in this Bill would take away the rights legally enjoyed by people connected with any part of the Bill, but as the Minister will see, in the saving clause there is no protection for dental mechanics. The Minister used the expression the other night that dental mechanics were evading the law in so far as they got the patient to make an impression of his mouth and then send it to the mechanic. There can be no question of evasion, because he is either breaking the law or he is carrying it out. So one can accept the position that the law allowed him to carry on his work in that way for years, and dental mechanics, many of them advanced in life, are now faced with the position of being deprived of their very <span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0447"/>existence. I do not wish to go against the clause as it is, because it is right in the interests of the public that we should close the doors for all time, but we must do something to allow these people to carry on the work they have been doing. They will gradually disappear and die out, but in the meantime, under the clause as it stands, we are doing an injury to them.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Before I reply on the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander), and which is now partially supported by the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. Christie), I want first to deal with the objection raised by an hon. member in connection with certain rights granted to doctors under the old Cape Act. Under that Act ordinary medical practitioners may practise as dentists, and there is a small number of them who exercise the right. The question was whether they would be protected under the Bill. I have consulted the Government legal adviser, and he has no doubt that those people are fully protected by Clause 95. Clause 95 was actually specially drawn to protect them. As regards the clauses about dental mechanics, they were drafted by the select committee that dealt with the 1923 Bill. That select committee was very liberal with regard to certain people who were previously entitled to registration and the select committee recommended these clauses. Only one member of the committee, the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street), who is now moving the amendment, opposed the clauses. Therefore, the House must not be under the impression that there was a difference of opinion at all or in a great measure on the part of the select committee in this matter. The select committee examined many witnesses, both from the point of view of the dental mechanics as from qualified dentists, and, after hearing all the witnesses, they came to Parliament with the draft Bill as it now is with regard to dentists. I think the House must very seriously consider the matter before it tampers with the clauses. Let me again say that if there is one thing lacking in South Africa then it is qualified dentists. The number must be increased, and that can only happen if we make the calling attractive to our young people. We know more and more about teeth and hear every day how people&#x2019;s health depends on the health of the teeth, and how disease is attributable to bad teeth. The position to-day is regrettable, and that appears clearly from the reports of the medical inspector. If we, however, do not see that dentists get a proper livelihood, we shall not find the young people selecting that occupation; in other words, we must see that the work forming the livelihood of the dentist is actually done by him, and that the dental mechanic works under his supervision. If we do not do that, the unqualified man will do the work which the qualified man should do, and there will be no encouragement for young people to train as dentists. Let me further lay down this proposition, that under the existing laws it never was the intention that dental mechanics should do the particular work which the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) now wants to allow them to do. In the existing Acts of all four provinces, it is laid down that dental mechanics may not take an impression of the mouth, and that after the false teeth are made he may not even put them into the mouth. From this it clearly appears that the meaning of the law in the four provinces was that this sort of work should be done by qualified dentists, and not by mechanics. But what happens now? The dental mechanics have so contravened the Act that he has encroached upon the domain of the qualified dentist without the law being able to touch him. He has made sets of teeth on his own account, and then simply goes to the patient, who fits the set himself, and he also makes the patient himself take the impression of the mouth which he requires. This is undoubtedly an evasion of the whole intention of the law. The Bill to-day intends only to keep the dental mechanics in the place they were intended to take under the old Acts. Now it is said that they can be permitted to merely repair false teeth for their own account. If a dentist has made a set of teeth which require repairing, it is asked why a dental mechanic cannot do the work, or it is asked why should not a dental mechanic make false teeth on his own? If we, however, permit that, then the law can again be evaded as it is to-day. It is the easiest matter in the world. The patient can then simply again take the impression and fit in the teeth, and we feel that that is the very evil to be got rid of. Therefore, it is impossible to accept the proposals of the hon. members for Cape Town (Hanover Street) and Langlaagte. It is represented that all the dentists support the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. When I read some time ago a telegram from the Transvaal dental mechanics, it was said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, those are the people whose rights are being protected by the Bill, and it goes without saying that they want the Bill as drawn.</block>

<p>I have a telegram here from dental mechanics who do not belong to that class. They are dental mechanics who to-day work, and have always worked, under the instruction of qualified dentists. They remained inside their own circle and complied with the intention of the law as it is to-day. The telegram reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have dental mechanics here who have worked under supervision. They had the right to evade the law, just as others did, but they did not do so. Now they say that if the people who evaded the law are given the right to practise as dentists then they will get the right in preference to those who kept to the intention of the law and remained within their own circle.</block>

<p>I think that their attitude is quite right, and that the House should not go so far as to say that we will give any person the right to make false teeth and sell them to the public. If hon. members read the succeeding clause, <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0448"/>then they will see that the Bill goes very far in protecting vested interests in the way they should be. It is unnecessary now to go into that, but hon. members will see that there are a good many people who have done work in connection with dentistry without being properly qualified, and to whom an opening is being given to become properly qualified. There are other people again who have been working for a considerable number of years in connection with dentistry without being properly qualified, but have made a living thereby, and they also are to a great extent protected by the succeeding clause. It has been freely said here that we must follow the example of England, and that some years ago quite a lot of people who were not properly qualified were protected there simply because they had vested rights. Those hon. members want us to commence with a clean slate. The matter is not represented correctly. There is not a single dental mechanic in England who was a dental mechanic and nothing else who has been permitted to practise in the future as a dentist without his having first passed a proper examination. I want hon. members, before they vote on the matter, to be fully aware of the facilities granted in England and the protection which is there given to vested rights. We have gone as far here as has been gone in England, in the case of men who are not properly qualified but who have done the work.</p>

<p>I should like to have the point cleared up where the Minister says that provision is made in Clause 36 for someone who has practised as a dentist although he had no diploma and who had no other means of livelihood. The Minister said that he could be given a chance to come in under the Bill. Now I should like to know whether I understood him rightly, because on page 135 of the Votes and Proceedings I have an amendment which will be unnecessary if it is covered by Clause 36. I should therefore like to know whether a man who has for 12 years practised as a dentist without any other means of livelihood and who has never been before the court will have the right under Clause 36 to make application for registration if it appears that he is competent.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRACHAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the following be a new clause to follow Clause 35.</block>

<block name="quote">36. The council shall enregister as a dentist any person who makes an application in that behalf within three months after the commencement of this Act and who satisfies the council that&#x2014;</block>

<ol><li>(a) he is of good moral character; and</li>

<li>(b) was for any five of the seven years preceding the commencement of this Act engaged as his principal means of livelihood in the occupation of a dentist or dental mechanician in any province of the Union: Provided that any person registered under this section shall be permitted to practise only in the province where he was practising before the commencement of this Act.</li></ol>

<p>Perhaps members may think this is asking a great deal, but I simply wish to put the clause forward in order principally to do bare justice to members of a society of dental mechanics in Natal. It is called the Society of Unregistered Persons in Dental Business on their own account in Natal. The membership is not very large. In fact, there are only seven of them. They are not registered, but they are fully qualified. The Minister has received a communication from one of the members. I have a copy of the letter, which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a dental assistant, I respectfully beg to place before you the facts of my case. I came to South Africa in 1905 under engagement to&#x2014;</block>

<p>(and here is the name of a, dental surgeon who was at one time well known in Pietermaritzburg)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">as a dental assistant with a knowledge of dental surgery. During the sixteen years I was with my employer I not only did all his mechanical work, but a great portion of his dental surgery work, such as filling, extracting teeth, taking impressions and fitting plates; in fact, for many years, I have been executing the work of a qualified man.</block>

<p>The time came when the dental surgeon had made sufficient money to retire, and he left South Africa to settle down in England. The dental mechanic could not obtain another position. He goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When my employer disposed of his Pietermaritzburg practice in 1922 I found I was unable to get work with any of the other dentists in Natal, they all having their own assistants. I would like to point out that if this Act passes in its present form, it will take from me my only means of gaining a livelihood in a profession in which I have spent over 25 years working with fully qualified dentists. Probably you will remember when the Dental Act was passed in England in 1921, any person who had been working as a dental assistant for four years was put on the dental register. We are only a small number in Natal, and most of us have spent many years working as dentists.</block>

<p>I can vouch for the accuracy of this statement, and it is typical of the position of the other seven members of the society. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I am very sorry to say that I am not able to accept the amendment of the hon. member, because if he thinks of it, he will see that it goes very much further than even the amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) which has just been rejected by the committee, and the provisions with regard to the protection of vested interests under the English Act. What the hon. gentleman asks is that a dental mechanic, for instance, can be registered as a qualified dentist if only he makes application, he is of good moral character, and for five out of seven years preceding the commencement of the Act dental work has been his principal means of livelihood. He does not even require an examination. Under the English Act not a single dental mechanic has been registered as a dentist otherwise than by passing an examination. If the hon. gentleman asks that the House is to make provision for the registration of dental mechanics without their passing any examination, I do not think we could go so far as that.</p>

<speech by="#strachan">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRACHAN</person>:</from>

<p>Under the Natal Dental Act of 1896 several dental assistants who were in practice as dentists were put on the register without submitting to any examination. I could give the committee the names of unregistered dental mechanics who were practising in Natal and who were put on the register without passing aim examination. The seven mechanics for whom I am appealing have set out their case in a long memorandum, and they state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We request your earnest consideration in support of our claim for registration in some form which shall not deprive us of the means to earn our livelihood.</block>

<p>Several dental mechanics who could not find employment were obliged to set up business on their own account. Their memorandum proceeds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Having invested all our capital in our business, it will spell utter ruination if our status is not protected by some form of registration. The dental law in Natal does not define the functions of a dentist, and the ruling of the Natal courts have been in favour of the unregistered person, provided he does not use the title of dentist or imply that he is registered as a dentist or dental surgeon.</block>

<p>A case was recently decided in which a dental mechanic, doing all the work appertaining to dental surgery, had prominently displayed in his room a notice that he was not registered under the Dental Act. The magistrate refused to convict and the Supreme Court, on appeal, upheld the magistrate&#x2019;s decision. The law in Natal is that if you do not hold yourself out to be a registered dentist, you can do all the work of a dental surgeon. Owing to the entire absence of provision in Natal for a South African youth to qualify in his own country as a dental surgeon members of the society would have had to proceed to England to obtain the necessary qualification. Under such circumstances, men who have spent their lifetime in the dental profession, although unregistered, but fully qualified, should not be deprived of their only means of livelihood by any Government.</p>

<p>I am supporting the last speaker in an appeal for simple justice. Wherever there has been an alteration in the law affecting any particular class, there has always been exemption of those already practising. I am a trade unionist, but I do ask that men who have to make their living by the use of their training should be recognized. Their number is small, and in time would disappear. The amendment provides that the applicant must satisfy the Council, and that body is not likely to be satisfied unless it is sure that there exists legitimate ground granting an application. What will be the result if the Minister makes no exception? At present a number of men who are not registered carry on dentistry. These men would like to practise their profession honestly, but must protect themselves behind qualified dentists. They have to get some miserable broken-down dentist to give them cover. In the country districts some have practised for a long time and have become proficient. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment or else give us some assurance that he will meet the legitimate claims of men driven out largely by the action of dentists who have taken apprentices, accepted the premiums and sometimes let them go out unqualified, and these men are now a danger with regard to the prices charged. We must recognize there are such men, and they have claims for consideration as the creation of circumstances too strong for them. Until recently they could qualify in this country, in which some of them were born.</p>
