<speech by="#marwick">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the frequent resolutions that have been passed by the Agricultural Union Congress from time to time in regard to the necessity for the revision of the pass laws that are applicable throughout the Union. A recent congress in Maritzburg has again drawn attention to this matter and there has been a commission reporting very fully on this question and it was anticipated some time ago that legislation would follow upon the recommendations of that commission. The Masters and Servants Law, it is also pointed out, is, in a very chaotic state, and various farmers&#x2019; conferences have drawn attention to the necessity for a revision of that law.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>In connection with the administration of the Native Urban Areas Act I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to a case that has occurred in Johannesburg which seems to me to demand disciplinary treatment on his part. It is the case of one of the leading officials employed by the municipality there, under licence of the Minister, in charge of the natives there. Not very long ago he appeared in court in Johannesburg under conditions described in an extract from a native paper which I wish to read. The name of the official is mentioned but I do not propose to give the name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He was recently charged in D Court with driving a car while under the influence of liquor. A constable gave evidence to the effect that when he crossed over to the car, which had crashed into the baggage carrier of another car, he asked him for his name and address but he was so drunk that he was unable to speak. He was fined £5 with the alternative of 14 days&#x2019; hard labour.</block>

<p>There have been other charges from time to time brought by the natives against this gentleman which have formed the subject of inquiry, and I know that the Prime Minister has a very strict regard for the conduct and integrity of persons in charge of native affairs, and in other instances he has shown his disapproval of the employment of anyone of intemperate habits. I should be glad to know whether this case has been brought to his notice and whether he has withdrawn the licence which I presume his department had granted for the employment of this official under the Urban Areas Act by the municipality. It seems to me that the interests of the natives are not in safe hands combining all the circumstances surrounding this case, when men of this type are employed as the head official in charge of native affairs in so important a district as Johannesburg. There is the question of the demoralization that is taking place in the Witwatersrand among the natives owing to the sale of yeast. I refer to that because the urgency of the matter is not sufficiently appreciated in other quarters or by other Ministers under whose department the administration of the liquor law comes. I would like to quote a statement that has been published with regard to this yeast evil and its effect upon the natives. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing was done last session, and this session is nearly gone and the Government have not moved yet in the matter. A short Bill dealing with the yeast evil alone would be passed with the whole-hearted support of the House. A handful of unscrupulous individuals are amassing fortunes by flooding the Reef with thousands of pounds of yeast. If the Government wishes to retain confidence it must act before Parliament closes.</block>

<p>The same sort of evil exists under absolutely uncontrolled conditions in the alluvial diggings at Lichtenburg. I do appeal to the Prime Minister to consider whether it is not possible to deal in a salutary manner with this evil before the session closes.</p>

<speech by="#deane">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEANE</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to call the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the non-provision for any betterment works in connection with the locations in Natal in regard to irrigation works. The Minister knows that the present works, which have been established for some years, have proved an unqualified success. The natives are entitled to have an extension of this work. There is ample land there for irrigation and there is no question about the quality of the land. The money expended on it is justified by the crops that these natives grow. On the same page we have an item, Relief of Distress. It only goes to show that the productiveness of these districts has not been fully developed. It is not fair to the natives that this irrigation should not be extended. I hope the Prime Minister will tell us it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to extend this. I want to refer to a question I <span class="col_3437-3438" refersTo="page_0379"/>raised the session before last in regard to the Lillani hot springs. I believe the Prime Minister has come to some arrangement to making a road to these inaccessible Lillani sulphur springs, which are greatly sought after by natives, and Europeans also use them to a large extent. Then a burning question with the natives is their cattle. These locations are overstocked, and there is no outlet for their cattle. The Government have provided dipping tanks, and stamped out disease of every kind, and the cattle are increasing at a great rate. There is no restriction on the number they can run. What relief is the Minister going to give the natives in converting practically their only assets into cash? East Coast fever is practically unknown there now, as the administration is so good.</p>

<speech by="#cilliers">

<p>I should like information from the Prime Minister about sub-heads D. and F. respectively, advancement of natives (Natal) £4,400 and grants for industrial purposes for the benefit of natives £200. The subheads also appear in the financial year 1926-&#x2019;27, and I should like to have information about it.</p>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. Minister what his policy is in regard to granting permits for prospecting on native locations. I find from the return the Prime Minister laid on the Table the other day that these permits have been granted during the last two or three years in very large numbers. I do not know what happened before that, and I do not say that there was a divergence of policy from what went before. During 1925, from the return the Minister laid on the Table, no fewer than 77 permits were given to various persons to prospect on native reserves. The gold law gives the Minister the right to grant permits to prospect on native locations and reserves, and I submit that is a power that ought to be used very sparingly, especially on the part of a Government which came in on a policy of segregation. Anything less calculated to lead to this, when the natives are already segregated, it is difficult to imagine. It is practically driving the natives out to find land elsewhere. I know that where it takes place with Crown land, the Government have to find other land by way of compensation. If we are serious in encouraging the native to remain and to assist him to remain on his own reserves, and not seek employment in towns and elsewhere, the Government should be sparing in the granting of permits to Europeans to prospect on these lands for their own profit.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I must say that I am surprized at the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan). For 14 years he has either been sitting with the Government, in the Government or in opposition to the Government. For 14 years the same practice has always been carried on, and to-day he comes and takes strong exception to this policy of giving permits for prospecting on native reservations.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>It is so much in clash with the Government&#x2019;s policy of segregation that it must bear a totally different character! What was good the other day must be bad now! It is neither worse nor better than it was before. It is totally consistent with segregation, and if we were to have the fullest segregation possible my hon. friend would not stand up in this House and advocate any measure to prevent prospecting in native locations taking place. Why would he? He wants to go to this extent&#x2014;that while your European has ground he has the right to make money out of the minerals on his farm, but the native should be debarred from that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>To the natives. Of course, they have as much right as the European. My hon. friend has been led too soon by the Opposition policy with regard to segregation. Either the ground belongs to the natives or to the Government in these locations. As far as your native is concerned, he has the right&#x2014;only yesterday I pointed it out in answer to a question put to me. The Government has no right to prevent giving prospecting rights to natives, as little as it has the right to prevent any other private man being given prospecting rights, or giving prospecting rights to anybody. But the Government sees that no native gives a prospecting right orally. It must be put in writing, so that the native is not fleeced eventually. The Government sees that the rights given to the European are under the most favourable conditions that can be, obtained for the natives. When that is the case all the Government does is to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Very well, that man may have it if you want to give it;</block>

<p>and the contract is entered into by the Government with the man. Then they have to go to the Department of Mines, where they get the necessary licence. The Government does no more than only to see that the native gets a fair deal. Then part of these locations are Crown lands. Here again, all that the Native Affairs Department does is to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Very well, we are not going to allow any location more than so many, according to its size;</block>

<p>because we do not want a location over-run by so-called prospectors; so that the department keeps a watching eye there on behalf of the native, and when someone comes along and says he wants the right there, the Minister of <span class="col_3439-3440" refersTo="page_0380"/>Mines and Industries waits for the man to bring him the assurance that my department has no objection to his going prospecting there. This is no new practice, but has been followed all these years and will always be followed. Some of the richest platinum fields are in native locations. Platinum and chrome have been responsible for most of the applications for permission to prospect within native areas. As far as diamonds are concerned I am not giving licences in native areas as I don&#x2019;t want anymore prospecting for diamonds as at present we are having quite enough of that.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Harrismith (Mr. Cilliers) asked for information in regard to subheads D and F. That is trust money which has been handed over to us since the establishment of Union. The money comes from an old British source and is first handed over to Natal, and we hold it now as guardian. We are annually responsible for its payment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umvoti (Mr. Deane) has put a question about irrigation in Natal for natives. But that is a matter largely for the native trust in Natal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deane">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEANE</person>:</from>

<p>You control the trust.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but the native trust some years ago established works and according to the funds it has it assists the natives. Nothing has been brought to my notice of late in respect of any particular irrigation undertaking in Natal. Two years ago there was talk of extending irrigation works there. And even to-day it would be a good thing if they were established on a larger scale, but you have always to bear in mind the income of these trusts. As far as the hot springs are concerned, this is the first I have heard of them officially, but I will make further inquiries. With regard to the native cattle, I do not see how Government is going to do anything in the matter of overstocking. It would not be wise of any Government to interfere with native stock except with their full consent. If any means could be pointed out of alleviating the position the department and I would be willing to assist, because we feel that the natives are overstocked especially in the matter of cattle. The hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) asked me whether I intended doing anything as far as the pass laws and the Masters and Servants Act are concerned. With regard to the pass laws the hon. member knows very well what a fine hornet&#x2019;s nest he is going to stir up the moment this subject is touched. If my hon. friend will give me the assurance that he and his party will support me I may, perhaps, venture to put my finger into that nest, but so far I must say I do not think any government&#x2014;even the previous government &#x2014;has much reason to be satisfied with the assistance it really obtained when dealing with this matter.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>As far as I am concerned I am quite satisfied to remain where I am. As to the Masters&#x2019; and Servants&#x2019; Law that is a question for the Department of Justice as it affects both Europeans and natives. I do not think we are likely to introduce a Bill which will be applicable today to the native as far as this matter is concerned. The hon. member spoke about an official who in a drunken state drove a motor car, and was brought before a Johannesburg magistrate. This is a municipal matter and as such I have nothing to do with it. There is reason to think that the municipal authority is dealing with the man. If he were my officer he would certainly not remain there one day, and if he holds the licence with the approval of the Government that licence will not remain where it is. With regard to the sale of yeast, if there is any question which has given a tremendous amount of worry to the police in the Transvaal, it is this very subject. The hon. member knows to what extent this is being imported clandestinely, and every now and again we see that the police have come across large quantities smuggled stealthily into the country. The Minister of Justice is dealing with that in the liquor law. In the meantime representations have been made to the Treasury to deal with this subject from the Treasury point of view by the imposition of restrictive duties, prohibitive duties. But it is still under consideration as to which is the most effective way of dealing with this matter. I think the best way is that suggested by the Minister of Justice in the Liquor Bill before the House.</p>

<p>What policy does the Government propose to follow with regard to fences erected between native and European areas? There has been a lot of misunderstanding and confusion in his department. For upwards of 25 years we have had fences along the boundaries of New England and Herschel.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>On a point of order, is the hon. member in order in discussing this subject?</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member may discuss this on the Minister&#x2019;s portfolio.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sephton">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SEPHTON</person>:</from>

<p>From time to time these fences have been renovated, repaired and improved, and in each case the Government has borne half the cost. With the approval of the magistrate of Herschel, farmers who constructed their fences were paid half the cost by the Government, and at one time the magistrate of Herschel employed a man to look after the fences and maintain them, of which the farmers paid half the cost. The last farmer to erect a vermin-proof fence was not so fortunate. He was promised that his case would be dealt with in the same manner as those which preceded him, but when he presented his account the magistrate demurred about it and delay was occasioned, during which period the last Ministry went out of office and the present Government came in, subsequently this party again put in his claim, which has been turned down. I then interviewed the Herschel magistrate. <span class="col_3441-3442" refersTo="page_0381"/>I suggested that if they were not prepared to go to the extent of contributing towards vermin-proof fencing they might do so on the basis of a stock-proof fence, but the argument was advanced that the farmers by converting their fences to vermin-proof, thereby forfeited their right to any claim. This is a very unreasonable attitude to take up. Let it be ascertained what the difference is between the cost of an ordinary and a vermin-proof fence and adjust the payment on the basis of the former. Afterwards I went to Pretoria and saw the Secretary of Native Affairs, and he was in agreement with me that some obligation rested on the department and suggested that such farmers should be paid out on the basis of stock fences. He wrote to the magistrate in regard to this, but so far, nothing has been done. Ever since the existence of these joint boundary fences, up to three years ago, they have been mutually and jointly maintained. Since then the Government has refused payment. I also saw the Minister of Agriculture and urged the desirability of getting the Basutoland Government to contribute towards vermin-proof fences in respect of their section. But now we have another Government. In the past the Government recognized the claim and promised to pay out, but now the Government turns the matter down and it is not receiving attention, in spite of the fact that three parts of the entire line is being fenced. The Government has put a stop to it. The Minister of Agriculture got a report from the Secretary for Native Affairs with regard to the same fencing, but it is a most erroneous and misleading report, and they have the record so mixed up that they don&#x2019;t know where they are. They put forward a suggestion which has never been made and they have no knowledge of certain payments. A payment to myself, for instance, when I put my vermin-proof fence along there, they have no record, as far as we know, of that. I do hope that the Minister will go into the matter, because we all know that the natives on the other side are liable in respect of a stock-proof fence. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#stals">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STALS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to bring a few things to the notice of the Minister of Native Affairs in connection with the collection of native poll tax. It appears that in 1925 there was a doubt about the interpretation with the result that a number of coloured people were also made to pay the tax. The tax is in many cases paid by the employers, and now the coloured people who are not liable for it are demanding a refund from the farmers. The difficulty is that the farmers acted in good faith but bad feeling is now arising between the employers and employees. I brought the matter to the notice of the department and the difficulty is appreciated, but I do not think the matter has as yet been disposed of because a few weeks ago Í was again approached about it. A second point in connection with the collection of taxes is that I have received information from my constituency that the police have done amazing work in this connection, but that the police for some reason or another have received orders from the Native Affairs Department that they are not to collect the tax. This is objected to by the farmers because they fear that their native servants in consequence of the new orders will have to go the villages to pay the tax. They think that the police are the proper people to collect the tax and I want the duty to be again placed on the police. There was no objections in my constituency but I understand that a native casually went to complain. As for the spending of the poll tax the impression exists among the natives that they are entitled to a part of the amount collected for educational purposes. At the Brakfontein diggings there are a few thousand natives and they rightly put up their own private school to keep their children out of mischief. Even the police officials there stated that the institution was a splendid thing for keeping the little ones off the road. Applications have been made to the local school board, the Provincial Administration and the Native Affairs Department to get an allowance for the teachers who are doing good work there. The local school board and the Provincial Administration said that they had no funds for the purpose, and the Department of Native Affairs said that it was not responsible for it. In the end they had to pay the tax and at Brakfontein £1,000 was voluntarily paid.</p>

<p>I should like a little more information from the Minister with reference to the permits that are issued for prospecting in native areas. I see from a return that more than 100 have been issued for native locations, but fortunately the majority of them have lapsed.

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GELDENHUYS</person>:</from>

<p>I state that the natives in the locations were not entitled to the £20,000 if it was Crown land. It is possibly a very good thing that a large number of the platinum licences have lapsed. I am not opposed to a man trying to make something out of it, but I do not want the natives in the Transvaal to have advantages from what should come to the Union. Take the case that half of 100 prospecting contracts turn out successfully. How much loss might the State not have suffered if it had been given to the prospectors, and the natives had got a large share of it. I think the natives are only entitled to live on the ground.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pretorius">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. S. F. PRETORIUS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to invite the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the position regarding natives in Johannesburg. About four years ago an Act was passed which compelled the town councils to house the natives in locations. The Act has been in force four years and municipalities have already spent hundreds of pounds for housing natives, but the position has not improved at all. If a house is built for a native two more come in from outside. The result is that the natives are all over the place to the annoyance of the white population. There is, e.g., the location at Vrededorp. Is used to be railway ground, and some years ago natives were permitted to go and establish themselves there. Subsequently the municipality and the Railway Administration agreed to have a drainage system because the location was such a pestilential place and to put it in better order. Nevertheless some of it was subsequently vacated, and the natives went away. A large part of that area belongs to an Indian, and some time ago there was a case in court which the municipality lost for the reason that there were more natives than could be housed. Around those places where the natives live there are Europeans living and the natives are a great nuisance to the Europeans and complaints are made from time to time. There is, e.g. Ferreirasdorp which is a pest of a place and where the natives live right in amongst the whites. The position is such that when people go to bed at night they do not know whether they will be robbed the following morning or not. I think that better control of the natives is necessary and that the public should be reassured in regard to this matter.</p>

<speech by="#moffat">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOFFAT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to call the attention of the Minister to sub-head C, No. 7, repatriation and removal expenses of natives. It will be interesting to hear, not only for what particular purpose this amount is intended, but the reason of the increase by 50 per cent. Then sub-head F, grants for industrial purposes for the benefit of natives. Here again it would be of interest to know in what direction this amount is being spent for industrial purposes for the natives. Then sub-head G, relief of distress; hon. members are well aware that distress during the last two years has been very severe right through the Union. The distress among the European population in the rural areas is a matter of grave concern at the present time. Then distress as the result of drought is also prevalent among the native people. I would be glad to know why only £250 is voted for the relief of distress among the natives of the Union. Surely the conditions of natives on their locations and reserves and elsewhere deserve greater attention from the Minister in regard to relieving distress and poverty I would refer the Minister also to Clause C again, agricultural supervisors. We know that the yield of crops, wheat and so forth, in the Union is very poor compared with other countries. While it is so among Europeans, it is still worse among the native population. The improvement of the productive capacity of the agricultural and arable land of the native will make all the difference in his material prosperity. I see there are only three agricultural supervisors, and from the amount of salary I suppose they are Europeans. Surely we require a very much larger number of men working under them to give the necessary direction to the natives.</p>

<p>With regard to this last point I would say at once that these are more or less general supervisors, and there are under them, and supervised by them, a number of agricultural demonstrators of whom there are a fair number.

<p>By the Bunga. The hon. member also asked why only £250 was provided for relief of distress among natives. When the Estimates were framed we did not know exactly that matters would become so serious as they have become since. Although I must say that they are not so serious as they have been on some past occasions, still they are more serious than to require merely £250. Probably a good deal more will be required, for instance, in Natal on the border of Portuguese territory. The position there, I was informed, was such that I had to consent to something like £2,000 being spent there for the acquisition and importation of maize for these natives. The great thing is to have an amount of this kind on the Estimates and then it is so much easier practically to get from the Treasury whatever is required, because this is one of those cases where the Treasury never refuses to come to our assistance. Then the hon. member asked as to C 7. why this increase? This is because of the Urban Areas Act, if I mistake not. Yes, it is repatriation and removal expenses of natives due to the operation of the Native Urban Areas Act. For instance, a number of natives from <span class="col_3445-3446" refersTo="page_0383"/>Portuguese territory are landed in Johannesburg; they find they cannot be used there, and they do not get employment and they must be sent back, and the Government must pay for that. Then he asked also with regard to subhead F, why only £200? That is exactly for such things, as, for instance, assisting in the development of natives in native territories or of getting somebody in connection with native agriculture and so on, in these places.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Fordsburg (Mr. J. S. F. Pretorius) asked me a question about the state of the natives in Johannesburg. We know how much it is desired that the position should be much improved, and I can assure the hon. member that the department is constantly engaged in getting the Johannesburg authorities to make haste with the necessary provision for natives, so that they can be put into locations. I think that the Johannesburg Town Council on the whole has not done badly. The town council is incurring a tremendously large expenditure because thousands of places have to be built. It is to the credit of the council that hundreds have already been built and that so much progress has been made. I can assure the hon. member that the department is taking action, and I can say to the credit of the Johannesburg Town Council that it has done its best to meet the demands. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) wants to know whether the £15,000 obtained for prospecting options should not actually come to the State. I can assure him that neither the Department of Finance nor the Department of Justice would allow me to give it to the natives if it was not due to them. No, it is only because the ground where platinum is found belongs to the natives that the money has been paid to them. The ground indeed is registered in the name of the Government but the Government are merely trustees for the natives. The ground belongs to the natives but as usually happens when a native tribe buys ground the transfer deed is registered in the name of the Government. The ground belongs to the natives and we are therefore obliged to deposit the money to their credit in the bank. Then the hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) spoke about the collection of the poll tax by the police. There my department cannot assist him because it is a matter for the Department of Police. I have no doubt that if the Minister of Justice is approached he will meet the people if it is at all possible. With regard to the rights of the natives to a contribution for the upkeep of schools, I must point out to the hon. member that it is a matter which comes under the Provincial Administration and not under my department. My department is concerned in giving a certain contribution to the Provincial Administration but with the spending of the money the department has nothing further to do.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton) has raised a question with which this department has nothing to do. The hon. member has seen me, and let me honestly say that if the law had allowed me. I would have come to his assistance most readily. But I could not come to his assistance except on the basis of an ordinary fence. If any change is to be brought about in the fencing law, it is not for this department, I cannot shirk the law as it stands, and it is a matter which pertains to the Department of Agriculture. The hon. member knows as well as I do that there is no question here of any legal claim. It is only, I take it, that he raised the matter for the purpose of seeing whether the Government would not be induced to introduce a policy through legislation or otherwise which would meet the wishes of people in his position and others along the border. I think I shall follow the advice of the right hon. the member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) and say that this department. I at any rate, have already sufficient hornets&#x2019; nests to deal with.</p>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to take the opportunity given me by this vote of voicing certain criticisms in regard to the administration of the Native Urban Areas Act, especially on the Rand. Hon. members will remember that we passed that Act in 1923, and we called it an Act &#x201C;to provide for improved conditions of residence for natives in or near urban areas, and for the better administration of native affairs in such areas.&#x201D; I think hon. members will agree with me, when they have heard my story of what has happened up there, that at any rate, so far as Johannesburg has been concerned, this Act has not brought about the better administration of native affairs in the area of Johannesburg. The Act is intended to provide for a segregation policy in urban areas throughout South Africa. It provides in the first few clauses that municipalities should be compelled by the Government to erect proper accommodation for natives in such urban areas. It provides also that if the municipalities fail in their obligations to provide such accommodation that the Government of the Union can step in and at the cost of the municipalities can erect such accommodation then it goes on in section 5 to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever the Governor-General deems it expedient he may by proclamation in the &#x201C;Gazette&#x201D; declare that from and after a day to be specified therein all natives within the limits of any urban area or any specified portion thereof&#x2014;</block>

<p>I dwell on those words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">other than those exempted shall reside in a location, native village, or native hostel, or in other words, the Governor General may in relation to any given municipality</block>

<p>provide that after a certain day all the natives living within that area must live in a location, and by proclamation apply it to the whole or part of the municipality; and if he should apply such proclamation it is a criminal offence for any native living in that urban area to reside there except in a location or native hostel. I should imagine that any hon. member would draw the conclusion, having regard to the power of the Governor-General to specify the <span class="col_3447-3448" refersTo="page_0384"/> whole or the portion of such an area, that if the municipality has been able to provide accommodation for the whole of the natives within its area, the proclamation would apply to the whole of the municipality; but if the accommodation is only sufficient for a portion of the natives in the municipality, the proclamation would apply to such portion of the municipality as contains the requisite number of natives. In Krugersdorp the existing accommodation provided by the municipality was sufficient to provide for only a portion of the natives and a proclamation was issued that the natives of such and such a portion of Krugersdorp should after the date of the proclamation go and live in the location. On the same date and in the same &#x201C;Gazette&#x201D; there was issued a proclamation relating to Johannesburg, which said that every native living within the municipal radius of Johannesburg, unless he was exempted under the Act, should after the date in the proclamation, go and live in the location. After a chequered existence of 12 months it was declared ultra vires by the court, because of a technical informality of its issue. Then they issued another proclamation in the same terms having cured that technical defect, and it said that every native living within the municipal area of Johannesburg should&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From to-day go and live in the native location.</block>

<p>According to the chief superintendent of native locations who gave evidence in the test case, there were 60,000 unexempted natives living within the urban limits of Johannesburg, and the accommodation available at that date amounted to something like one-tenth of that number. There was accommodation for 2 117 married natives, 2,900 single natives, and&#x2019; no accommodation at all for native women, and nearly the whole of this was already occupied. The Government said natives must live in the location and said to the natives&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you don&#x2019;t, we will arrest and fine you and arrest and fine those who harbour you.</block>

<p>A test case was fought, and the magistrate had under the law to convict. The matter went to the Supreme Court which said&#x2014;in effect&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is perfectly ridiculous to issue a proclamation which in its terms says to the natives: &#x201C;You have to live in a location,&#x201D; when there are no locations for them to live in; and to do so constitutes an improper exercise of the powers delegated to the Governor-General.</block>

<p>The simple answer that would occur, not only to lawyers in the House, but to the ordinary hon. members, is that no amount of benevolent intention in its administration will cure a radical defect in the proclamation itself. For the second time the proclamation was set aside, and on that being brought to the notice of the Minister of Native Affairs by myself by a question in this House, he said an impossible position had been created and he would have to come to the House for an amendment of the Act. Apparently he has reconsidered the matter, and has done what he said was impossible.

<from>&#x2020;Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RICHARDS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat) has raised the question of agricultural advisors in the native territories We are all interested in this subject in Natal, particularly in respect to the lands which the natives occupy. It is always necessary to inform the Committee what Natal is doing for its native population in connection with the lands set aside for them. We set aside no less than per cent. of our total acreage; while the Cape with its 9 per cent., the Transvaal 15 per cent. come next, and the Orange Free State only 1.5 per cent. Although we set aside this tremendous area, it is now proposed to take another 1,000,000 acres, and release them for native purposes Now we take the view that before any further land is taken the Government should use every means to develop the land already allotted&#x2019; to and occupied by the natives that is to bring it up to its highest cultivatable capacity. To a large extent this land is wasted. It is overstocked as regards its <span class="col_3449-3450" refersTo="page_0385"/>cattle-bearing capacity, but as regards its agricultural development the land is being ruined. The native crops the land until it is worked out and then works other land in the same way to its total ruination! In discussing this matter with certain native chiefs and bearing in mind what is done in the Transkei, they have often asked that the same attention should be given by the Government to assist and instruct their people to get the best out of the land under circumstances as they exist to-day. They believe that under similar circumstances and if given the same assistance and instruction and encouragement, they will get a greater return from the land in Zululand and Natal. We think that is the right and proper thing to ask. It can be done, partly by the development of irrigation works such as the Mooi River Works, where excellent land is brought under irrigation and excellent crops are grown. But this requires careful supervision as the tendency of all natives under the circumstances is to over-irrigate their lands. Natal has, however, no more land to give away for as regards its whites it has a denser population per mile than any other province of the Union. As regards the desire of the hon. member for Umbilo for information this is not a matter which should be discussed publicly at the present moment, but we know the Prime Minister has his eye on the situation. There are, however, certain irritating matters which might easily be rectified. Reference has been made to the tax on native blankets. Every native, no matter his station in life, has his cotton blanket, which they have always been able to buy for 2s. 6d. or 3s., but the increased customs duty has raised the price to 7s., the idea being to encourage the manufacture of these articles in South Africa. That naturally indicated the growing of cotton here, but instead of utilizing South African grown cotton these factories are kept going with rags and yarn and other imported material, with the result that the article is very inferior. A little consideration here on these lines would go a long way. Then the matter of the issue of native passes to leave the province is far too lightly undertaken in Natal. Parents object to passes being given too freely to children, without either the consent of the parents or the owner of the land on which they live. Children who obtain passes in this way go to large towns and to gold fields, and return home demoralized. Some of them never return at all. There has been an increase of crime amongst the natives to the number of 28,000 cases, and there must be some reason for that. Rural crime is a more serious indication of the deterioration of the native as a law-abiding person than is urban crime, and this calls for the serious attention of the Government.</p>

<p>I am sorry the Prime Minister replied to my speech before I had an opportunity of finishing my argument. I anticipated the reply he gave, that his department was not responsible for the erection of wire fences. The Minister of Agriculture has likewise repudiated responsibility and referred me to the Minister of Native Affairs. Who, then, is responsible for fences along native boundaries? Last year I proposed a motion asking the Government to make it obligatory on natives living in such areas to contribute half the cost of vermin-proof fences, or for the Government to take other steps to meet the farmers in regard to these fences. The Minister of Agriculture, in his reply, said, whether the motion was adopted or not, it would make no difference, as the Government had the right to grant money for the purpose. The Government having paid half the cost of the erection of a fence, surely it should be responsible for a part share of its maintenance. It is a tremendous hardship that people who are on the border, and who are our first line of defence, should have to construct a fence at great cost without any financial assistance. The late Government recognized that these people were entitled to consideration. Some farmers have put up fences towards which Government has contributed half the cost, while an adjoining farmer has been refused. The Agricultural Union has endorsed what I am trying to get the Government to recognize. Without any reason, as far as I can see, the practice of Government contributing towards the cost of these fences has suddenly been repudiated.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>It has been said that the quality of speaking in this House has very much deteriorated. If that is true, nothing is more responsible for it than the rule limiting speeches in committee to ten minutes, because it is impossible to put a difficult or complicated case in that short time. To make matters worse, when one&#x2019;s time limit is up the Minister is apt to assume that one has finished, and replies before the whole case has been submitted. To resume my story, apparently the Minister has reconsidered his attitude in regard to the matter at Johannesburg to which I previously referred, for a fresh proclamation has been issued dealing with Johannesburg on a partial basis, and this is about to be tested by the Supreme Court. The first two proclamations were found to be invalid, and, consequently, a third one has been issued. In dealing with a heterogeneous body of natives in Johannesburg, it is exceedingly unfortunate that the department should issue proclamations which are very soon found to be invalid. The department should have taken legal advice to ascertain whether its proclamations were legal. According to the answer he took no such advice. He issued the proclamation and trusted to chance <span class="col_3451-3452" refersTo="page_0386"/>whether the proclamation would be valid or not. The proclamation applied to native women, and there was no accommodation for native women at all. Accommodation certainly existed for 2,000 families, but all of it was full up, and accommodation was provided for single natives in two hostels. Under what conditions were they expected to live? They lived in dormitories which contained from ten to twenty natives each, and they had to go into whichever dormitory they were placed by the superintendent. There were no health regulations, and a healthy boy might have to live in a dormitory with diseased natives. The Minister says natives accommodated in the Wemmer hostel are provided with beds, but does he know that these &#x201C;beds&#x201D; are concrete slabs arranged in tier fashion round the walls as in the mining compounds. We tell highly civilized men that they would be put in these dormitories with ten or twenty other natives, and would have to live under conditions of barrack life, and if they did not do it, they would be fined. That is the unfortunate way he has administered the Native Areas Act in Johannesburg. If a native is civilized this Act will not allow him to live in a private room in Johannesburg. Until proper room accommodation is provided, such natives would be willing to pay for their own rooms, and I submit that it is not right in these circumstances to enforce the penalty on those who will not live in the compounds.&#x2019; The Government has been guilty of undue haste in applying the Act to Johannesburg. I admit all the evils, but no good purpose is served by getting the backs of the natives up by attempting to force the pace as they are attempting to do in Johannesburg. Some sort of informal board has been in existence, but it has had no legal powers, and the natives are not represented on it and the Government have failed to appoint inspectors as they had the power to do under Section 11 of the Native Urban Areas Act. There have been 132 convictions, and £230 has been collected in fines under a proclamation which has been declared to be ultra vires. Not a penny has been returned.</p>

<speech by="#marwick">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to revert to the question of mining in native locations, and invite the attention of the Prime Minister to Section 147 of the South Africa Act. As indicated by my question yesterday, I suggest that no diversion of the existing native locations from the purpose for which they were granted can be made without sanction of an Act of Parliament. The concluding portion of Section 147 of the Act of Union is in these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No lands set aside for the occupation of natives which cannot at the establishment of Union be alienated except by Act of the colonial legislature shall be alienated or in any way diverted from the purposes for which they are set apart, except under the authority of Act of Parliament.</block>

<p>I understand the contention of the Minister&#x2019;s department is that the Transvaal mining law of 1908 empowered the Government to allow mining in native locations, and that, therefore, no further legal sanction is necessary. The wording of this Act makes it quite clear that the express authority of the Union Parliament is necessary, by way of Act of Parliament, before any diversion of this land from the way they were dedicated can be made. That is borne out by the Transvaal constitution of 1907, which is in line with that section of the Act of Union. It says that no land which may be set aside for the occupation of natives may be alienated or in any way diverted from the purpose for which they were originally set aside. The grant of these lands was not within the disposal of the Crown as Crown lands. They were originally granted in accordance with the Pretoria convention at the end of the Anglo-Boer war, and special provision was made for the appointment of a native location commission, and it went on to say that such native location commission would reserve such locations as they may be fairly and equitably entitled to do, regard being had to the actual habitation of these tribes. In respect of the two locations of which I am speaking in Waterberg and Zoutpansberg districts, the further clause is of importance. It says that no fresh grants of land will be made in the districts of Waterberg, Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, until the locations have been defined. In other words, the beaconing off of the locations was the first thing to be attended to. There were no previous grants. They were the first grants made by the Government, and as they were transferred, in trust for the natives, they were no longer in the category of Crown lands. The London Convention laid down that all transfers which took place during the British occupation would remain in force, an officer of the Transvaal Republic taking the place of the Secretary for Native Affairs. These locations were originally the ancestral homes of the natives, and they were set apart for the natives by agreement between the Transvaal Republic and His Majesty&#x2019;s Government. They were then taken out of the hands of the Re-publican Government and were registered in the hands of the Commissioner of Native-Affairs for the use of the natives, and under the gold law the natives would have ample protection as if they were on Crown lands. Under the gold laws it is laid down that if the location belonged to chiefs or tribes a different procedure was laid down, but I am not quite clear whether these locations have been treated as Crown lands. If so, they were wrongly treated and my contention is that no mining can be permitted in these locations unless the diversion of these locations to mining purposes is approved by Act of Parliament, and I submit on the reading of the concluding portion of Section 147 of the South Africa Act, that contention is amply borne out. There is the question of the desirability or otherwise of allowing locations to be opened up for mineral rights. If the Prime Minister&#x2019;s contention is correct that these locations may be opened up and the natives may be dispossessed, and that all that is necessary is for other land to be provided, then I say the whole of the principles of segregation are challenged, and the whole principle <span class="col_3453-3454" refersTo="page_0387"/>on which these locations were set apart for the natives is in danger. In the Act of 1913 these particular locations are mentioned in the schedule of the Act as locations set apart under the segregation scheme for the use and occupation of natives. If the Prime Minister has the right himself to approve or grant these permits with regard to locations, everybody would welcome a declaration of his policy for the future in regard to prospecting for minerals on these lands. If these locations are to be prospected upon and opened up for mining and be treated as Crown lands, then every protection which we imagined we were giving to the natives by the Act of 1913 will fall away. By the process of mining the natives will be dispossessed of their lands and, although it may be sought to re-establish them in possession of other lands, as we all know, it is becoming a more difficult matter as time goes on, and we shall arrive at this stage very shortly, when it will be impossible to place them on anything like the value of the ground they now possess.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) has raised a very important matter, and I think all those interested in native welfare are indebted to him for bringing the facts to the notice of the House, especially those hon. members who do not live in the Johannesburg area and who may not know the facts. It certainly raises a very serious question in regard to the Native Urban Areas Act, because I always understood when that Act was brought forward that it was quite clear&#x2014;and I think the interpretation put upon it by the court proves that also&#x2014;that, while you are making every provision for natives living in a location, you would not compel them to do the impossible, and to ask them to remove to a location which does not exist is something that one does not really understand at all. It does seem to me that the department in this respect made a very bad blunder. The omission which was made, it seems to me, was that the first thing the Government should have done was to submit the proclamation to the Government legal advisers to see whether it was intra vires. I personally cannot see anything more demoralizing to the natives, of whom, we are told that they are children and that the Prime Minister is the father, than to find that their father does not know how to frame laws to provide for his children. I cannot conceive of anything having a more unsettling effect than fining people under a law which has been held to be ultra vires, and then not refunding the fine.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know that it would actually require legislation. It would require a grant from Parliament, and I would suggest that when the supplementary estimates are brought in, provision should be made for it on the native affairs vote. I should imagine that it must have a very bad effect on the natives to know that the money has been taken from them under a proclamation which the Government had no right to issue, and they must be very much surprised that the Government insist upon keeping the money. I hope, now that the new proclamation has been issued, that the Prime Minister who, we know, does not want to do anything unjust or unfair to the natives, will see that that proclamation is administered with scrupulous care. I know the difficulty. I know that in other parts of the country, besides Johannesburg, owing to the overcrowding of natives in the urban areas, some of them have been living in a most unfortunate condition, and some of the buildings they are living in urban areas are so terribly overcrowded as in some cases to become a menace to public health, and to amount to a public scandal. All the more reason, therefore, for the local authorities to proceed as expeditiously as possible with their work of making proper provision for natives in their areas. Everyone is anxious to see that natives who are living under slum conditions and in an insanitary way should be placed in properly equipped locations, but, at the same time, one must realize that to compel them to go there until proper provision is made is something that is not only unjust and unfair, but which is likely to recoil upon those who are in favour of this particular kind of class legislation. I think that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) has certainly brought forward a matter of some seriousness. Although the answer given on the 8th February by the Minister dealt * fairly adequately with the matter, there are still points that I hope he will deal with. One is the refunding of the fines, and the other is as to whether proper advice was taken in regard to this proclamation.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister will remember that a piece of land situated to the south of the Kruger National Park, and between White River and the park, was about 12 months ago constituted an area for natives to go and live in. I have not been through that area myself, although I have seen it, and I do not profess to speak with first-hand knowledge, but I have it on the authority of farmers living in the neighbourhood that that land is wholly unsuited to occupation by human beings, whether black or white. There is no arable land, there is no water&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is known as Block F. It is a piece of land situated between Plastron and the reserve, near White River. It formerly constituted a part of the reserve. It is a barren, arid piece of ground, and when I was there last there was a drought prevailing, and the natives were on the border of starvation. I am not speaking very authoritatively in regard to the matter, but if this land is unsuited to native occupation, as I am told it is, I would suggest to the Prime Minister, seeing that there are rare Bushman paintings in the area, whether he would not accede to the request made by the South African National Society to set this area aside and place it under the society. I am not pleading now for an extension of the game reserve, or anything of that sort, but if the ground is unsuited to native occupation, then I think it might very well be added to the reserve, or placed under the society mentioned. I would like to ask the Prime Minister how it is that last session the Prevention of Disorders Bill was withdrawn. This Bill passed the second reading and was sent to a select committee. It came back from the select committee, and never came before the House again. We all know the Bill is very urgently required.</p>

<p>All those in Natal who have the welfare of natives at heart will appreciate the action of the Prime Minister in regard to appropriating the Amanzimtoti location I believe the Natal Native Trust received £30,000 to purchase more suitable land. This policy is a very wise one, because this land is not suitable for growing cereals. It is sugar land, and the natives have never attempted to grow sugar.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ANDERSON</person>:</from>

<p>For my own part, speaking for my own constituency, to which I believe the displaced natives have been sent, or are to be sent, instead of appreciating what has been done we resent it very much. It is all very well for the hon. member for Umvoti whose constituency has not been inflicted with this horde of natives, to express his appreciation for what has been done, but I would like him to speak for his own constituency rather than give the impression that Natal as a whole is satisfied, which is not the case. I want to allude to a matter which is of more serious import, namely, the position regarding land held by societies carrying on educational and missionary work in the Union. The restrictions imposed on Europeans and others as to transactions between Europeans and natives being subject to the approval of the Governor-General are not applicable to these societies. The section of the law reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed as applying to land held at the commencement of this Act by any society carrying on, with the approval of the Governor-General, education or missionary work amongst natives.</block>

<p>It is quite clear that it was not contemplated when that 1913 Act was passed that these missionary societies would treat their holdings as speculative counters to be turned into money by selling to persons regardless of the race or colour of such persons. Earlier in the session the hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt) raised the matter in the form of the following question to the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir Thomas Watt asked the Minister of Native Affairs whether the Government has advised the Governor-General to approve of the lease or sale by the Trappist community to natives of a farm in the Biggarsberg district, Natal, which is surrounded by farms owned and occupied by Europeans, in small sub-divisions with the object of establishing a native village.</block>

<p>The Minister, replying, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No. The approval of the Governor-General would not be required having regard to the provisions of Section 8 (1) (h) of the Native Lands Act No. 27 of 1913, the property in question being land which at the commencement of that Act was held by a society carrying on, with the approval of the Governor-General, education or missionary work amongst the natives.</block>

<p>That particular district of Biggarsberg it is true is in the constituency of the hon. member for Dundee, but it affects a considerable number of farmers in my constituency. This Trappist mission is adjacent to the boundaries of the two constituencies. Since this question was raised by the hon. member for Dundee I received this letter from a gentleman in my constituency, Mr. James Macauley&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Mr. Anderson,&#x2014;I have had a call to-day from one or two of the people in the Besters Bluebank direction who are very much perturbed at a rumour which is going round to the effect that the St. Joseph&#x2019;s Mission people are having their property surveyed and are going to sell it to natives. It is in fact more than a rumour because Mr. Kirkness stated that one of the fathers personally made the statement. The other day <span class="col_3457-3458" refersTo="page_0389"/>Henderson of Balbrogie also stated that the mission people up his way are going to cut up their farm and sell it to natives. The farm in question is probably on the Dundee division, but I think Mr. Henderson is in your district. In both instances the farmers feel that a sale to natives will materially affect their interests and if they are to be planked alongside a native location they might as well get out of it for all the good they can do farming.</block>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the report of the intended sale of the Biggarsberg land I received this letter advising me of the contemplated sale to natives of St. Joseph&#x2019;s Mission in my constituency. I happen to know both these mission stations.</p>

Since then the position has become much worse, owing to the protracted drought. I am sorry we failed to make much impression on the Minister and to get his sympathy. All he said was that he would instruct some official of his department, somewhere within a hundred mile radius, to provide rations. They need more land, and better and more sympathetic treatment.

But the Native Affairs Department are not stringent enough with the Town Council of Johannesburg, with which I have a grievance. I would like to see the Government be more drastic with the town councils. It is true they have built a large township westwards, but for every native who is removed from Vrededorp two natives take their place. I have asked the town council officials whether it is not possible to open a sub-office to keep proper control and supervision in that area. If the Minister would insist on the town council taking more active steps to have more efficient supervision to prevent natives coming in, we would soon get all the natives removed from there It is not only shop natives, but mine natives working on the surface of the mines who are congregating in the Vrededorp location, and the position has been intolerable for years.</p>

In the meantime, I agree that a good many more demonstrators would do useful work, but the misfortune is that it is not so easy to get qualified persons. If we could get them at the moment we would be only too glad. They have to be trained, and are being trained. With regard to the native agricultural schools in the Ciskei, a farm has been got the purpose. The necessary plans for the building and so forth are out, and it is hoped that <span class="col_3459-3460" refersTo="page_0390"/>within a short time the buildings will be commenced.

The hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) has joined in&#x2014;what shall I describe it?&#x2014;the criticism of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell). Surely they are not serious in thinking that the Native Affairs Department every time it issues a proclamation should run to the law advisers and ask if it complies with the law in all respects. Both hon. members are lawyers and know very well that when an Act is passed here we all think there is no flaw in it. How many lawyers are there who could point out that on this or that little point the court would upset a proclamation? Thousands of proclamations are issued every year and if they were all submitted to the law advisers administration would be impossible. Our officers have to exercise their judgment, and unless it is an exceptionally important or difficult matter I do not think that anybody could expect that a proclamation should be submitted to the law advisers. What is the whole question about. Has any wrong been done to the natives in Johannesburg?</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind. Except technically no wrong is done to the native and even then only to certain natives.

<p>But you didn&#x2019;t state all, and I don&#x2019;t see the necessity of raising the question again after that answer. I cannot put the case more cleanly than I did in February last. Everybody who heard the reply will admit that nothing really wrong was done, and that every precaution was taken to prevent any injustice being done to any native. And no injustice was done to any native, although a technical wrong was committed. Although that proclamation was issued so as to cover the whole of Johannesburg, every necessary step was taken to prevent it being applied to any but those natives for whom the necessary accommodation had been prepared.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite incorrect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>It is correct according to my information from the officers of my department and the municipality. If the hon. member knows better, why didn&#x2019;t he come to my department, and then I could have instituted an inquiry immediately? I say again, no injustice was done to nay native. I must say I do find serious fault with these hon. members. What they say in this House carries far beyond these walls, and they ought, therefore, to be the last to bring forward a matter of this kind, especially in a manner calculated to give an impression to the natives that a wrong or an injustice has willingly been perpetrated by the department or by the Government. As far as Johannesburg is concerned, you have either to follow the course we adopted in that proclamation, or wait until Johannesburg has spent, I believe something like £250,000 on buildings, and have them there unoccupied until they are all ready, and then issue a proclamation stating that the natives must go there. I say that was not contemplated, although technically that may be what the law requires, and the only alternative was to act as the department did act, to issue a proclamation pretending to apply to the whole of Johannesburg which, in reality, it was well understood, was made to apply to such portions of the natives as had already, or could obtain, accommodation outside. It is not the natives, with all respect to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell), who found that proclamation such a terrible thing. It was certain individuals who benefited by the slum position in Johannesburg, and who do everything in their power to make it impossible for the Government or the municipality to get those natives out of the slums into the locations. The criticism, as my friend calls it in this House, is not calculated to assist the native at all, but it may assist the very persons who do not like the natives to clear out of the slums, because they lease those slums to the natives. I must say I regret this is again raised, because I say advisedly, after the answer given in February last, there was no necessity for raising this question again, least of all for raising it in the manner it is raised here to-day. The hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) disputes the right of the Government to allow prospecting in the native locations. All I can say is that the previous Governments have thought they had the right, and this Government also thinks it has the right. I, as a lawyer, also» think we have the right, and I do not think the hon. member can seriously want me to convince him this afternoon that there is anything illegal in giving that right to persons who want <span class="col_3461-3462" refersTo="page_0391"/>to prospect within the native locations. It is very clear to me that if we do not do that, we shall suddenly be doing something very unjust towards the native, because we shall prohibit him from using his property in the same advantageous manner as that which the European has the right to do. The hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton) again returns to his fences. I am not prepared to go into that discussion any further. I do not think it will carry us further.</p>

<p>*It is not the natives who object, but the owners of buildings in the slums where natives live. The hon. member for Fordsburg (Mr. J. S. F. Pretorius) asks whether the Government intends to remove the Vrededorp location. The Government is, of course, very anxious to do so, but now the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) objects to it I think I must bring the two hon. members together, to see what can be arrived at. If I understood the hon. member for Bezuidenhout he is opposed to the Vrededorp location being removed. I think that it must be left to Johannesburg to see which policy is the best. The Government is anxious that an end should be put to the slums condition in Johannesburg. The proclamation to which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is so strongly opposed expressly provides that a whole district of Vrededorp must be evacuated. Of course, if we meet with such opposition as we have received from those who at that time took the matter to court, and such as we are now receiving, then we cannot be blamed that further improvement has not been made. The hon. member for Fordsburg also asks what our intentions are about prohibiting the inrush of natives. No, that is just where the whole evil originated. It was just to prohibit the natives from again rushing in, just as fast as natives went away to a part which we had ordered to be evacuated, that the proclamation which has been referred to was issued. The proclamation has, however, been invalidated by the Supreme Court, and then the natives for the most part streamed in from other places, and it was made impossible for us to actually prevent them rushing in again. As for the streaming in of natives from outside the towns, the Government has no authority at all in the matter. If the necessary location accommodation exists so that all the natives in the town can be housed in the location, then the position will be improved.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) (Mr. Reyburn) asked what about the alarming native unrest? I think the hon. member for Weenen (Maj. Richards) is right that on a matter of that kind we should say as little as possible in this House. It is no doubt, quite correct that the wild talk which has been going on in Natal and other places has had the effect of making people feel a little uneasy, and no doubt has had a very bad effect upon the native mind, especially the raw native. All we can do is to see that we get the necessary power for the future to prevent this from again happening or going on. The hon. member for Weenen (Maj. Richards) has drawn my attention to the setting aside of land for native purposes, etc. In regard to that, we shall, of course, have full opportunity of discussing the whole question both in committee and after those Bills come from select committee to this House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CLOSE</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to come to a very important matter which has been raised by the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick), and that is the question of the right to allow mining operations on native reserves. If I may say so, I do not think the Minister has given the attention to that point that it deserves. It seems to me that the point boils down to this, that in previous legislative enactments of the Transvaal there are certain restrictions on the alienation of reserves set apart for natives. As we all know, the legal position of every native reserve depends upon the conditions under which those reserves are constituted. In the Transvaal, with which this point is particularly concerned, certain lands were reserved and set apart for natives in the constitution and letters patent of the Transvaal of 1906, Clause 51 (3) laying down&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No lands which have been or may hereafter be set aside for the occupation of natives shall be alienated or in any way diverted from the purposes for which they are set apart, otherwise than in accordance with a law passed by the legislature.</block>

<p>My position is simply that I wish to ask the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attention to this, for the purpose of seeing whether he will not get his legal advisers to give a considered opinion upon this whole question. The point which has been raised is of such importance that I hope the Prime Minister will give an undertaking that the matter shall be submitted to the legal advisers as to whether, under sub-section (3) of Clause 51 of the constitution and letters patent of the Transvaal an express Act of the legislature is not required for the purpose of dealing with any land set aside for the occupation of natives. That point is emphasized by Section, 147 of the South Africa Act, which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; no lands set aside for the occupation of natives which cannot at the establishment of the Union be alienated except by an Act of the colonial legislature shall be alienated or in any way diverted from the purposes for which they are set apart except under the authority of an Act of Parliament.</block>

<p>The constitution of 1906 having said that lands so set aside shall not be alienated except by an Act of the legislature, this is a case which falls expressly under section 147 of the South <span class="col_3463-3464" refersTo="page_0392"/>Africa Act. It seems to me that there is a great deal to be said for the contention that both in the Transvaal law and in the Act of Union, the Act which can be considered to justify the setting aside or diverting of these lands is an Act which is expressly directed to that purpose. It must be an Act of Parliament expressly intended and devoted to that particular object. The Prime Minister says that the native will be prevented, if this construction as suggested is correct, from using the land in the same advantageous manner as Europeans. With respect, that begs the whole question, because the whole question is whether the land is set aside for a particular purpose which cannot be used in the same way as by Europeans. The whole question is whether the object of the Acts is not to prevent the use of native reserve lands for any other purpose than as lands for natives, reserved and set aside and to be used entirely for natives. What we want to get at now is not whether the question of recent rights given to Europeans in native areas are or are not legal, but we want to go to the whole principle whether any such grant of rights in native areas is of any value at all no matter who has done it before, in view of the terms of these Acts. The principle is one of such importance that, although the Prime Minister has told us that in his view as a lawyer there is nothing in the point. I would like to ask him whether he has given special and careful attention to this point, and considered it in all its bearings on the different statutes. I trust we shall get an assurance from the Prime Minister that the matter will be referred to the legal advisers.</p>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>The point raised by my hon. friend (Mr. Close), the legal point, is a very important orfe, but I should be sorry if the Prime Minister were led to the idea that the legal question is the only one involved because it is not so. The Prime Minister took me to task with a great deal of eloquence when I raised the matter at the beginning of this debate but I do not think that he answered my point at all. It is not a question of legality. I think it is an open question as to the legal Tights of it, but I do not want to go into that at all. The question is that here are certain lands, not lands that belong to natives as private owners, but here are certain lands which are vested in the State in one form or another, either as trustees for the natives, or directly as Crown lands. They are vested in the State for the purpose of being kept as native reserves, and I submit that it is no answer to that to say that it you do not grant prospecting permits you are depriving natives of the same benefits from the land as Europeans would have if the land belonged to them. The question is, are we as a State, as a Government, going to freely throw open to prospecting lands which have been set apart as native reserves or locations? The Prime Minister, as portion of his answer, said that all Governments had done that. I am not going into that. I am quite prepared to believe that other Governments have done it. I say it comes least of all well from this Government, which came into office on a great policy of segregation, that here in one year they give prospecting permits for people to go and prospect in native reserves and locations. I say that is a bad policy. If we are going to be serious about this question of segregation, or even if we believe, as I do, in encouraging natives to remain in their own reserves, even then we ought to be very careful about granting prospecting permits to prospect and exploit native reserves and locations. I would go so far as to say that. We should not grant them at all. I would like to allude to the point raised by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell), also a very important point. I think we have the right to object to the manner in which the Prime Minister dealt with that. The Prime Minister dealt with that as if the hon. member was attacking the policy of providing locations and of requiring urban authorities to provide locations for natives within their borders. He was trying to show how it should not be done. Perhaps if the Government could see how it should not be done they might come to see how it should be done. The Prime Minister went further than that, and he almost said that my hon. friend was in league with certain people who are making a profit out of these slums.</p>

<p>I think that is a thing the Prime Minister should not have said. I do not think it was the right way of dealing with the matter. He said, too, in answer to the hon. member for Fordsburg (Mr. J. S. F. Pretorius) that he and others who wanted the location at Vrededorp cleared of natives, had to deal with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell), who was against that policy. The hon. member is not against that policy. He is criticizing the Government, as he has the right to do for issuing a proclamation which was obviously unfair and unjust, and impossible of execution. It made every native a potential criminal by insisting upon his going into a location when there were none for him to go into. I think the hon. member has a perfect right to criticize the Government, and he should not be held up as if he were acting in defence of those who are making a profit out of slum areas.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister has developed the habit of recent years, of descending with Olympian wrath upon anyone who stands up in this House to espouse the <span class="col_3465-3466" refersTo="page_0393"/>cause of natives, and of suggesting that, by doing so, he is creating native unrest. I remember the undignified remarks we had to listen to from the Prime Minister a year or two ago when we were debating the Colour Bar Bill, and a manifesto was presented to him by the churches and missionaries of South Africa. We still remember with feelings of shame the language and attitude he adopted on that occasion. Without suggesting that he has gone anything like as far this afternoon, I do agree with the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) that we are entitled to take exception to his attitude. Because I have brought to light the ineptitude of his department in handling this matter of the natives in Johannesburg, and the administration of the Urban Areas Act, he turns round and tells his followers that I am against the policy of that Act, that I do not want the slum areas in Johannesburg cleaned up, and that, possibly without intending it, I am playing the game of these slum landlords in Johannesburg. That sort of talk will not make for calm and temperate criticism in this House. I put it to members of the committee as to whether I did not put my case plainly and calmly. When the Native Affairs Department, without pausing to consider, issued a proclamation which, in its terms, said to every native in Johannesburg that he had to go and live in a location, they well knew that there were no locations for them to live in. I join issue with the Prime Minister in his suggestion that there was no reason why they should take legal advice before taking such a course. I will not sit down for a moment under the implied snub when he suggests that I am meddling with matters which it is not necessary to discuss, and that I am really talking against time. That was another delicate suggestion by the Prime Minister. The department and the Minister must expect to have criticism if their system of native Government in Johannesburg is to issue one proclamation after another, and have the court set them aside on various grounds. I confined my case of alleged injustice in my opening remarks to the issue of this proclamation at the time when there was no accommodation. The Minister has rejoined to that by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Assuming you are right, that is only a potential injustice. Show me any real injustice, any real prejudice the natives in Johannesburg have suffered.</block>

<p>I will reply to him. I pointed out that, although the proclamation applied in terms of the whole of Johannesburg, it was urged that administratively it was being applied only to certain portions. Let me tell him this, that even in those portions some 1,500 natives actually sent a petition to the municipality asking for accommodation, and their attorney said the signatures of another 1,500 or more were being secured. No reply was sent by the municipality at all. The reason was that the existing accommodation was practically all booked up. Even in the areas which were to be cleaned up and in respect of which the natives had been served with notices to get out, there was a very much larger number of natives than the accommodation was capable of taking. So that the injustice is more than a mere technical one; it also existed in the administration of the proclamation, and that fact was actually brought home in the court proceedings. If the Prime Minister wants verification of what I say, let him send for the records of that particular case and he will see the facts are true and cannot be disputed. Yet I am told that when I raise a matter of that sort I am raising it unnecessarily and, as I say, I incur the Olympian wrath of the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly this lack of provision of land for the accommodation of natives, both urban and rural, is very serious. I notice in the Native. Affairs Department&#x2019;s report it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The control of native land &#x2026; and the satisfaction of the native land requirements are matters of growing prominence and anxiety.</block>

<p>We all understand the Minister is to bring in a comprehensive measure to deal with this matter, but at the moment there is a good deal that could be done administratively to ease the situation or to prevent its growing as bad last it might. It is not sufficiently known throughout the Union what the desperate position of the native is with regard to land. We have natives forming three-quarters of the population of the Union, and only one-eighth of the land is reserved to them. These figures are striking, and, if fully appreciated, we would have less strenuous opposition from intelligent Europeans to the provision of more land for the native. In the Orange Free State, where the natives outnumber the Europeans by nearly three to one, the proportion of land reserved to them is only 2 per cent.&#x2014;not 2 per cent. That is an impossible state of things, but let me remind the Minister what he already knows, of what is happening in the Free State. It so happens that in Thabanchu a certain area of land was secured to the Baralong tribe, and legislation was passed by the old Free State Volksraad to prevent the land being thrown open to others. But land has been sold to Europeans during the past ten years, and it is going on still. While the Minister is not in a position to provide more land for the natives at the moment, administratively he might prevent land which has been ear-marked under treaty from passing out of the possession of these people. It is a very poor consolation to be told, as we were by the Minister, that provision for extra land for the natives will be inquired into. I hope something more will be done.</p>

<p>In regard to the point raised by the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron), there is a considerable amount of complaint in Natal of the infiltration of natives from the Free State into Natal. A resolution was recently agreed to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this conference is of opinion that Natal is already over-burdened with natives of all types &#x2026; and that natives coming in for service should be compelled to return after their term of contract expires.</block>

<p>In my own constituency natives have come in and actually been allowed to squat there. Under the existing Natal laws no native is entitled to come from any adjoining province into Natal and settle there unless and until he obtains the consent of the Minister of Native Affairs. That provision has been carried out in the past, but from what I am told it is now in disuse. My hon. friend here says it is now Union, but a serious state of affairs has arisen in Natal owing to the infiltration of these natives. They have come from the Vrede district and settled on the Buffalo flats.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>We do not. When the Native Affairs Commission came to Newcastle a number of farmers pointed out the unsatisfactory position which had arisen owing to natives coming into Natal from the Free State. Some steps should be taken to stop that undesirable state of affairs. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Reyburn) made an attack on the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) and the hon. member for Umvoti (Mr. Deane) by stating that through their incitements there was a certain amount of unrest amongst the natives of Natal. I challenge him to give me one instance where either of these hon. members made any statement calculated to incite the natives of Natal. The trouble arises, not from the hon. members for Illovo and Umvoti on this side of the House, but through statements made on the cross benches. There is a statement by the Minister of Public Works, who, addressing the master builders&#x2019; conference here, stated that no native could live a civilized or decent life under 8s. a day. Are there hon. members opposite who agree with that doctrine? I read a statement of a meeting of the I.C.U. which is reported in &#x201C;Die Burger.&#x201D; The report stated that about a thousand natives attended the meeting of the I.C.U. held at a mission station on the borders of Zululand, and about 50 or 60 miles from the nearest town. A native speaker said he was prepared to be burned alive in order to aid his people. The hour, he said, was not yet come, but it would soon come, and in the meantime they must stand together and organize so as to get a minimum wage of 8s. a day for men and 2s. 6d. for women. That demand for 8s. a day originated from the Minister of Public Works, and statements of that sort by a Minister are calculated to do irreparable injury. Are hon. members opposite who represent agricultural constituencies in agreement with the dictum that natives should receive 8s. a day? The Minister of Public Works has put ideas into the heads of natives which cannot possibly be carried out, as the country cannot afford to pay natives 8s. a day. Will the Prime Minister tell us if he agrees with propaganda to establish trade unions for natives, not only in the towns but in the country? Do hon. members realize what our position is going to be if this propaganda continues? In 1923 the present Minister of Labour and the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Reyburn) owner and editor respectively of the &#x201C;Guardian&#x201D; of Durban, stated in that paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are of the deliberate opinion that every worker in an industry should be a member of a trade union, and that every one from the general manager down to the picannin should belong to a union. Not until this is achieved will it be possible for workers to prevent their masters playing off one section of the workers against another.</block>

<p>I notice the item, bonus for Bantu studies, £250. Will the Minister kindly explain this item? Some time since an economic survey was made of the natives in the Herschel district by Professor MacMillan. It revealed a somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs, showing that the natives were very poverty stricken. We have laid pretty severe taxation on them to the extent in 1925 of £925,000. Then the duty on cotton blankets brought in last year £332,000, most of which was paid by the natives. Could the Prime Minister have an economic survey made of the Transkeian territories? There is an impression abroad that the economic position of the natives is going back, and that in recent years owing <span class="col_3469-3470" refersTo="page_0395"/>to taxation and, perhaps, a want of initiative, the economic position of the natives to-day is worse than it has ever been.

<p>I should like some information with regard to general dealers&#x2019; licences in the native territories which fall under the Minister&#x2019;s department. His department is responsible for the issue of general dealers&#x2019; and traders&#x2019; licences on the territory and they have adopted the principle that no licences are issued where there is already a trading station within five miles. That principle is being applied to the three European districts adjoining the native territory in the Transkei. In European districts, where a farmer wishes to apply for a trading licence, he is met with the difficulty that the department says if the proposed site is within five miles of another store which serves the native trade he cannot get a licence. I submit that is unfair and it is not enforced in any other European district of the Union. It is a sound provision so far as the native territories are concerned because we do not want to see it overtraded, but why should it be applied to a European district? If I like to start a store within half a mile of another one what has that got to do with the department and why should they come and say they will apply the same principle as in the native territories proper. It is undue interference. If you go to any village in the Transkei you can have as many stores as you like, but if you go half a mile out of the village then you must not be nearer than five miles from another store; that seems an inconsistency, but I am not pressing that point. I put it to the Minister that in European areas the department should not apply the principle that the nearest store should be five miles away. I believe the Prime Minister should not apply these restrictions in the European areas. They are unnecessary. You get a small store with, say, £500 worth of stock serving native trade and a man comes along prepared to put up a store stocked with agricultural implements, farming requisites and so on, to benefit the surrounding farming population, a store whose owner is prepared to buy agricultural produce, but he is prevented because he is within five miles of another store serving the native trade. I ask the Prime Minister to look very thoroughly into this matter.</p>

The Prime Minister&#x2019;s attitude in the past has marked him out as having a high attitude with regard to public purity. According to the list the granting of licences to members of Parliament is open to criticism on the ground that obligations between members of Parliament and the Government tend to undermine the prestige of Parliament itself.

<p>May I, with respect, point out that on Vote No. 4 you dealt with the Prime Minister&#x2019;s salary, and there is no word mentioned about native affairs. It so happens that the same person is the occupant of both the office of Prime Minister and the office of Minister of Native Affairs.

<p>The point I wish to put is that the mention of this at the bottom of page 14. and also page 112, coupled with the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; at the top of page 112, gives the House the right to treat that salary as being repeated here. It is extraordinarily inconvenient to initiate a discussion on native affairs on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s vote on which there is no mention of native affairs, and then to come to the native affairs vote, where you have quite different details to discuss. The mention of the word &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; with those footnotes means practically the incorporation for the purpose of that rule of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s salary as Minister of Native Affairs in that particular vote, although, of course, you do not vote the amount over again.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>I raised this point with a specific object. We all know that the Prime Minister of this country has a very large number of functions to perform. We know he is occupied in his duties from year end to year end, and we know that under the Act of Union the Prime Minister&#x2019;s salary is £1,000, and as Minister of Native Affairs, it is £2,500. I feel in view of the fact that when he comes before this House in his capacity as Prime Minister he is there to defend the actions of himself and his colleagues on matters of high policy, and that that is the time to attack the Prime Minister in the higher capacity in which he acts, but I do feel when he comes forward as Minister of Native Affairs&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. member still argue that hon. members are entitled to move a reduction in the salary?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#payn">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, not at all. Your ruling I accept, but I do say that in future I think that Ministers who occupy a dual position should be prepared to come to this House and defend the dual position they occupy, and any member who wishes to challenge the Prime Minister on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s vote, should have that opportunity, and when he comes forward in his capacity as Minister of Native Affairs to defend his own or the policy of the Government on native affairs, then we should have the privilege of discussing that policy from a broad point of view. The salary should be split, and I think that is necessary and desirable and in the interests of this country, because to-day we must all admit that we are trying to define a native policy in this country; we are trying to build up a policy, and, therefore, the Prime Minister or the Minister of Native Affairs should not be sacrosanct. We should have the right to challenge him on any policy he may bring forward. You have ruled before, Mr. Chairman, that we are not entitled to attack a Minister on a question of policy unless there is a reduction of the vote, unless the Prime Minister&#x2019;s or the Minister&#x2019;s salary is in question. You have given us a broad-minded ruling which we appreciate&#x2014;</p>

<p>I hope hon. members will take cognisance of the fact that we are not entitled to challenge the salary of the Minister. I would like to deal with the question that has been raised by hon. members to-day. It seems to me, coming from a native territory where the natives are watching every incident that happens in this House, it seems very significant that this afternoon one member from Natal gets up and congratulates the Government upon having removed a certain section of natives from Amanzimtoti, but immediately afterwards you get another member from Natal getting up and protesting and practically saying: &#x201C;We do not want these natives thrown at us.&#x201D; What are the natives going to judge from that, from the attitude of two Natal representatives, one who says: &#x201C;Thank Heaven you have got rid of them,&#x201D; and the other who says: &#x201C;We do not want them&#x201D;?</p>

<speech by="#payn">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister knows he has received every sympathy from this side of the House in his dealings with native affairs, and then he suggests we want to bring party into <span class="col_3475-3476" refersTo="page_0398"/>this matter. Why should one party get up against the other? I say very definitely that in this House when native affairs come under consideration there is no such thing as party and never will be. When I speak in this House I realize I belong to the same class as every other member, and that my first duty is to men of my colour. When the Prime Minister suggests that when one Natal man gets up against another it is party&#x2014;I ask whose party? Your native question from whatever aspect you regard it, individually or between party and party, has reached that stage at which a white man in this country must realize it is above individualism and above party. I just quoted that one incident to show a typical situation. I want again to challenge the members from Natal. The hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) (Mr. Heyburn) raised the question of the dissatisfaction among the natives in Natal. On both sides of the House you undoubtedly have a feeling that you should undermine that desire amongst the natives to unite&#x2014;what for? To better their conditions? That is the ideal at the back of the native mind. You have both sides of the House attacking the native for trying to unite in what they call trade unionism. I do not believe that we, as a European population, can ever put on the statute book any law that is going to prevent co-operation among the natives, that natural desire which we must abide by and recognize to uplift the conditions under which they live. And yet hon. members on both sides of the House are agitating to try and create a feeling against Kadalie. Kadalie is an individual. You might blot him out to-morrow, but for every Kadalie you have today in this country you are going to have ten in the next five years and twenty in the next ten years. It is no use your trying to say that we are going to bring in laws to prevent trade unionism; it is absolutely impossible. It is like trying to stem the tide. We must try and create the same position as we have in the Transkeian territories, where we have a body of natives who meet in congress together, and they come to the Government. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We want laws, and we ask for laws to protect our people against the agitation which is going on.</block>

<p>The Transkeian Council only last week passed a resolution asking for legislation. We must try to build up an institution amongst the natives themselves so that they can recognize better that these agitators are putting themselves&#x2014;not us&#x2014;in danger. But I have fears if you allow these agitators to go amongst the natives and stir up feeling, and quote Ministers&#x2019; speeches, that natives are entitled to 8s. a day. The honest native saith in his heart&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We know the white man cannot pay these wages in the present economic state of the country, and we are not prepared to support the agitator who advocates these wages for sinister purposes.</block>

<speech by="#close">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CLOSE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make a protest against the remarks made by the Minister during the last few minutes. In his speeches in the country the Minister asked us to consider native affairs on their merits, and not from a party point of view, but he cannot take that way and ask us to shut our mouths on all points on which we hold a different opinion from the Minister. He should welcome a honest expression of opinions, so long as they are individual expressions of opinion giving vent to the speaker&#x2019;s own point of view. That is the only way in which we can get to a solution of the difficulties which the Minister is trying in his own way to meet on the native question. The Minister gets up and makes it almost impossible for us to treat the matter from the non-party point of view, and he will persist in treating every point of view in opposition to his from the party point of view. We get that thoroughly ungenerous and undeserved taunt hurled by the Minister who is responsible in his position for knowing that his words carry a good deal of weight&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Look how you people differ amongst yourselves!</block>

<p>Has there ever been a taunt in this House on the different views expressed on the native question from different points of view? The Minister has been taunted by members of the Free State, and even by his own Ministers. I rise to give expression to my own individual protest, in the strongest possible language, against the expression of the Minister, which makes individual opinion impossible, and makes it almost impossible to approach native affairs from the non-party attitude.</p>

<p>I must say that I have not for a long time enjoyed anything so much as the action of the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) here. We do not see such a show every day, and he has given us a good example of what he could do in the theatre. I only want to say that I do not take him as seriously as he takes himself. I think that we can quite rightly say that since half past four this afternoon the time has practically been wasted. Most of the members are no longer debating seriously.</p>

<p>If I am to take the hon. member for Rondebosch on his own representation, then I must, of course, say that I am not correct, because he still poses as particularly serious; but I can tell the hon. member that I only regard the matter as a little bit of theatricals. I accept that his great seriousness arose from the reply which I gave to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell). But then I just want to quote something, a report from which the House can see what kind of matters the hon. member for Bezuidenhout now wants to refer to so seriously. What he says here and the way in which he says it certainly has the effect that it will be regarded as if we, or the Parliament, are treating the natives in Johannesburg unfairly by issuing proclamations, and I deny that once for all.</p>

<p>Have you the judgment of the court there?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I read the whole judgment at the time, and added what was necessary in the matter of the reply which I gave to the hon. member to a question in February last. I corrected the hon. member then when he spoke about injustice. The hon. member then said that the court had spoken about an injustice, although the court had done nothing of the sort, and I then pointed it out to him. Now the hon. member does not say that the court said so, but he suggests it. I say that those kind of speeches, that representation of matters, as if it were true, is decidedly calculated to have the effect on the native feeling that this Government, that we Europeans, are treating him unfairly, although inequity has nothing to do with the matter. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) said here this afternoon that there was another case pending, and he practically suggested that the Government was wrong again. However, I want to make it clear now to the House what the position in Johannesburg is. The natives live there in the very worst slums, so bad that it is a scandal and a danger to the whites, but a few Indians as well as Europeans have the greatest interest in the slums, and it is to their interest that the natives shall not leave those hovels of houses, because then they would no longer be able to get the profit which they now get from them. Therefore, they are constantly employed, when measures are being taken, in seeing what they can do to prevent the people leaving there. Inter alia, because it is such a paying matter to them, they employ attorneys whenever there is a proclamation or any step is taken to see whether a flaw cannot be found by which they can evade the measure, and in that way they succeeded in the case referred to. Therefore I, and my department, took other steps to obtain the right to get rid of the slums. I ask hon. members to listen, however, to what the native commissioner there said. He writes on the 22nd of March to the head of the department as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You are no doubt aware that organized efforts are being made to upset the proclamation of areas under the Urban Areas Act on somewhat similar lines to those successfully adopted by Benson under the recent proclamation. My information is that this is being organized mainly by Indians who are slum landlords, and no doubt we shall hear more of the matter. A case was tried the other day, and a slum landlord was convicted.</block>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>On a point of order, may I interrupt? The Minister does not know that the case to which he is about to refer is sub judice. The matter is on appeal, and is going to appeal at Pretoria.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_native_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am not referring to any case that is sub judice. I read on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A number of further cases are coming on the 4th. It will be interesting to see how they go. The practice at present being adopted is to prosecute the, harbourers only. They are the people most to blame, and the conditions of some of these places which I recently examined, where rentals of 30s. and 35s. for small, ill-ventilated rooms are being charged, were disgusting. In connection with this effort, a petition was recently addressed by a solicitor to the town clerk, asking for accommodation for 550 people.</block>

<p>Now we know that that is supposed to be the excuse. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said this afternoon that there were so many natives who said that we should give them houses to live in, and that we do not possess them. This attorney is now applying for houses on behalf of 550 natives. What happens? Just listen&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am forwarding for your information a copy of the report of the M.O.H. to the town clerk in this connection which may interest you, and which you may bring to the notice of Gen. Hertzog&#x2026;. You will see that in the present instance the 550 applicants have been narrowed down at the first survey to 208 who are possibly bona fide, but I think very few of those concerned will actually take advantage of the housing accommodation available.</block>

<p>What has become of the 334? Not one of them was there. That is the way in which we are thwarted. After the answer I gave in February, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout comes in a way, to which I object, and suggests that the department was oppressing the natives. I say again that the hon. member knows just as well as I do what effect this must have on the natives. I go further, and say that no hon. member who at all realizes his responsibility to the country in this connection would do such a thing. Notwithstanding what I said in February, when I fully explained the matter, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout this afternoon comes with his loose allegations. I knew nothing about them before he made them this afternoon. If he took the interest in the matter which he represents he does, then I ask him why he did not go to the department to take care of the interests of the natives? No, his statement that he was looking after the interests of the natives he must excuse me for not accepting, whatever the reason may be. The hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) did not have the least reason for putting it into my mouth that I had accused him of representing the interests of others on the Rand. In my opinion, there is too much party feeling constantly being shown in connection with native affairs. The hon. member for <span class="col_3479-3480" refersTo="page_0400"/>Rondebosch is so glad to have an opportunity for an excuse as to why he does not agree and cannot reach the attitude of dealing with native affairs apart from party politics. The hon. member feels that he is not able to do so and to rid himself of his party feeling. When he rises, it is always nothing else but party feeling, and now he has come to excuse himself. No, the words of the hon. member for Rondebosch, by which he wants to make us believe that he is so anxious to deal with the matter apart from party, I will not accept before he proves it. If he proves it by his action, then I am prepared to accept it, but I can no longer accept mere words. The hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) has spoken to-night about prospecting licences, and said that he could not approve of it, and that it made an unfavourable impression that there were no less than three members of Parliament among the applicants. That is possible, and I do not say that the hon. member is not entitled to hold the view that prospecting licences ought not to be issued within native locations. I have, however, nothing to do with that. It is simply the law. Hon. members must understand clearly that I do not wish to suggest that I share the view of the hon. member for Illovo, but it is a view to which he is entitled, and for which there is something to be said. So long, however, as the law is so, I have no reason to make a difference between a member of Parliament and anybody else. Members of Parliament have just as much right to use general privileges as any other person. I have laid the number of the applicants on the Table, and I think there were about 108. Whether there were 20, 50, or even 108 members of Parliament among the applicants, I have nothing to do with it. They were entitled to it, and with reference to native territory the question is who makes the best offer, and with reference to Crown land it is usually who makes the first application. The hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat) asks me, seeing that we attach more and more value to native custom, what steps are being taken to have a text book of those customs prepared. I want at once to refer the hon. member to two persons about whom questions have been asked to-night by two other hon. members. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) in the first place asked what the sub-head, Bantu studies, meant. That is expenditure for a student who has qualified himself and passed an examination, inter alia, in Bantu languages, and native customs, and whom we want to encourage to study them more deeply. We require more and more of that kind of man in the service. He was given a bonus of £50. Then the hon. member for Kingwilliamstown (Maj. Ballantine) asked why money was being spent for an ethnologist. It is for the reason that we find that it is necessary to-day, and will be still more necessary in the future to obtain men who are well acquainted with the native languages, usages and customs. The customs and usages of the people are their law. We cannot possibly think of properly consolidating the native law unless we have someone, and such a person was appointed by me last year, to go into the matter more fully. He is a very capable man, and he is engaged in preparing the report which will enable us to take action. We must expend considerable energy before we shall get so far as to have what we shall require in the next five or ten years with reference to native customs and usages. Then the hon. member for Kingwilliamstown also wants to know why there has been an increase of senior clerks from 14 to 17, and of clerical assistants from 320 to 360. It is necessary, in consequence of the sound native taxation imposed by Parliament. Hon. members can understand that in consequence of the law, there had to be an increase of the staff. Then the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) spoke about an economic survey. This is in connection with the question about the report of Professor MacMillan. He went and made a certain survey in the Glen Grey district, and thereafter issued a report on it. The report was submitted to me. I do not wish to say anything about it except that I can assure the House that it undoubtedly exhibits very strong bias. One cannot help coming to that conclusion when you read it. Apart from that, I have not only one, but various reports of that kind which are far superior to that of Professor MacMillan&#x2019;s. Professor MacMillan is an enthusiast on native affairs, but he is a professor in Johannesburg who spent his vocation in Glen Grey, and after having stopped there a few months made a report which is not at all equal to the reports made by officers of my department. The officers of my department are not people who have made a study of the matter for three or four months, but who have worked among the natives from five to 20 years, and know everything. When one reads their reports, you will at once see the astonishing difference. The report by Professor MacMillan has taught me not to support anything which is drawn up by a person who merely spends his vacation among the natives.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF NATIVE AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) (the Rev. Mr. Rider) said this afternoon that we should try by administration to improve the conditions of the natives where it was possible. I hope that that is happening, and think that it is actually happening where it is possible in the interests of the State if it is not happening, where possible, I should he glad if the hon. member would point it out. But I think that it was merely one of the hon. member&#x2019;s introductions in order to strike a blow at the Free State. He said here that the Free State in regard to natives has only made 0.2 per cent. of the ground available for natives. I admit that the percentage is not large, although I think it is 0.4. But what of it? I should like to know from the hon. member whether he wants the Free State to give up its ground to the Basutos. There are at least 250,000 of the approximately 400,000 natives in the Free State&#x2014;I think it is about 300,000&#x2014;who are pure Basutos, and there is not the least reason to give up the land in the Free State to the Basutos. When the hon. member for East London (City) said that, the hon. member for Zululand indicated his approval. The hon. members from Natal are always reproaching us for not having given more ground to the natives in the Free State. Now I want to ask hon. members to remember just a little that when Natal was engaged in making money by allowing Indians to come in in groups, notwithstanding the warning of the Free State&#x2014;to-day they want the Indians to be excluded, but we are not going to do it&#x2014; there were few natives in the Free State. The members of Natal have now once for all settled amongst the natives. Our ancestors settled in the Free State on the bare veld, and the natives that were there were allowed to keep their ground. The natives to-day have still their ground, or rather would still have had it if a section of the Baralongs had not exchanged part of the territory for territory in Bechuanaland. They are to-day still there, and possess the ground. The Free State did one thing, and that is, that from the day the people got there, the Freestaters said that that ground was the ground of the white men, and would remain the ground of the white men. It is a great pity that the other provinces did not do the same thing. The other provinces, and especially my friends there, must not now be jealous of the Free State. The Freestaters followed the right policy, and have a right to the fruits of it. Now I just want for the last time to reply to the point raised by the hon. member for Rondebosch, although, as it seems to me, he did not seriously mean it. He has again argued the point that we had no right to issue prospecting licences in the native territories. I have hitherto somewhat restricted my remarks about this. I want to ask the hon. member if he really wants me to take the opinion of the legal advisers on such a clear matter? I want to ask him as a lawyer whether he thinks that to give someone the light to prospect&#x2014;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Then I will read a portion of my question and the Minister&#x2019;s own answer&#x2014;[question and answer read]. According to the Minister&#x2019;s own answer, the Supreme Court declared that proclamation to, be inequitable and unreasonable and also described the use of the Governor-General&#x2019;s prerogative as unreasonable. I said that the court set aside the proclamation as being oppressive and unjust, and how I show that his own reply admits that the court described the proclamation as inequitable and the exercise of the Governor-General&#x2019;s discretion as unreasonable. Wherein lies the difference? Does he take refuge in a quibble? What a lot of sound and fury we have heard in this attempt to discredit me in this House. It is typical of the controversial methods to which the Prime Minister descends when he lashes himself into a fury. Stung apparently by something the hon. member for Rondebosch said, he discharged all his wrath upon me. The criticism that I made this afternoon was not party criticism, it was criticism of what I thought was a stupid action on the part of the Minister&#x2019;s officials in issuing the proclamation and the Supreme Court thought the same. The Prime Minister gets up and paints a lurid picture of the iniquities of the slum landlords in Johannesburg and suggests by inference that I am fighting their cause. Of course, that is perfectly ridiculous. I am at one with the Prime Minister and with the purpose behind the Urban Areas Act in putting an end to the slums in Johannesburg, but I say this that you are not going to put an end to those slums by forcing natives to leave the rooms where they are and either leave the municipality or go into a hostel where they are herded with hundreds of other natives. If I were a native I would prefer to have even a hovel, a room, to myself rather than be herded in a dormitory with twenty or thirty other natives. I happen to know something about the petitions about which the Minister spoke. As far as the case in which a number of signatures turned out to be dud is concerned, I do not know anything about that, but I am speaking about a petition which had on the face of it some 1,200 or 1,300 signatures of natives and which was presented to the municipality asking for accommodation and no answer was given by the municipality to that request. It may be that on inquiry in that case it might have been revealed that some of these signatures were not correct, but I do know that a petition was presented and not answered. It is idle to turn it off as being the action of Indian landlords. It is true that the legal action which resulted in <span class="col_3485-3486" refersTo="page_0403"/>these proclamations being declared ultra vires was taken by Indian landlords, but I happen to know that the natives were prosecuted and they resented it. My plea this afternoon was to make haste slowly. I resent in the strongest possible fashion the Minister getting up in this House and saying of a member like myself who raised the matter in that way that I was doing it to stir up native feeling.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#close">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CLOSE</person>:</from>

<p>Now that the Prime Minister is in a calmer mood perhaps he will do me the honour of recognizing that he has entirely failed to apprehend the point that I made about native reserves. I did not say one word about prospecting. The point I was taking was in regard to the logical development of prospecting, that is to say, mining development. In terms of the constitution ordinance of the Transvaal which I quoted and of our Act of Union which I also quoted, you then come to that stage of either alienating or diverting the land from the purpose for which it was set aside. It will be remembered that I gave no expression to a legal opinion upon that at all, I expressly said it was not a matter suited for legal discussion in this House, except to this extent that there are strong legal grounds for asking the Prime Minister to have an investigation made by his own legal advisers to find whether we are not possibly correct in the construction as suggested. I would remind the Prime Minister again of Section 51 (3) of the constitution ordinance of the Transvaal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No lands which have been or may hereafter be set aside for the occupation of natives shall be alienated or in any way diverted from the purposes for which they are set aside otherwise than in accordance with a law passed by the legislature.</block>

<p>The whole point about that is that these lands having been set aside for natives, if mining is prosecuted there, it will inevitably result in alienation or diversion from the purposes for which they were set aside. So we say that while it may be in the interests of the country, after that prospecting has resulted in the discovery of a mine, that that mine should be developed, but before it is developed there should be a special Act of Parliament, an Act in which we say it can now be diverted to another purpose. The Act of Union, Section 147, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And no land set aside for the occupation of natives which cannot at the establishment of Union be alienated except by an Act of the Colonial Legislature, no such land shall be alienated or in any way diverted for the purpose for which it is set apart except under the authority of an Act of Parliament.</block>

<p>For the purpose of our own constitutional position the only point I put to the Prime Minister was, seeing these very definite words are there, whether he will not submit that particular point to his law advisers to find whether before you alienate or in any way direct such reserve land for the purposes of mining development, there shall not be a special Act of Parliament. I never said there could be no diversion or alienation. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s answer to that was at one stage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But that is not my department; I am only concerned with the prospecting stage. The next stage becomes that of the Minister of Mines.</block>

<p>Is not this just an illustration of the very necessity of this particular procedure, that here we have two members of the Cabinet setting up two distinct authorities for the purpose of dealing with land solemnly set aside under Act of Parliament. The Prime Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The natives are getting the benefit of it, because £20,000 has been paid.</block>

<p>But what has that been paid for? Surely, not for prospecting rights, but for the rights which result from prospecting. If a mine is discovered, the mineral rights and surface rights will be alienated to the purchasers who paid that £20,000. The moment they get the thing for which they paid that £20,000, at that moment they get lands which are in themselves an alienation of that ground. The rest of the land is being diverted from the purpose for which it was acquired. I did not for a moment attempt to give a legal opinion. It happens to be my profession, but one of the benefits of that profession is that one has to look at things of that sort to see how far Parliament is committing itself or otherwise to a wrong course of conduct. I think the Prime Minister should be the last man to raise a question of that kind, particularly when I put it in such a perfectly proper way as I put it this afternoon, and, especially when I only want him to consult his legal advisers to advise him on the proper course.</p>

<p>Yes, but don&#x2019;t you understand that I and my hon. friend the member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) have already agreed upon this: that as far as native lands are concerned these the natives can do with what they like. It is only a question with regard to Crown lands, and I am pointing out that in Act 35 of 1908 of the legislature of the Transvaal, it was specially laid down that Crown lands in native occupation can be prospected, etc., just as any other ground. That law is still in existence in the Transvaal. Then after that in 1910 came the Union Act in which the letters patent of 1906 were simply repeated. The Act of 1908 still remains to-day as it was in 1908. Consequently there can be no doubt about it that Crown lands in native locations are subject to prospecting as much as Crown lands anywhere else.</p>

<p>I must say I want to sympathize very much with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell). I feel very diffident in discussing native questions in the House because, if any hon. member dares to differ from the Government in discussing native affairs, he may be accused of rousing racial feeling. I thought the hon. member raised a question of very grave and great importance, and it was clear from the reply of the Minister that there were mistakes in the part of his department. In the Minister&#x2019;s attempted explanation this afternoon it seems he put his foot more deeply into the mire than this evening. I took his words down, and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proclamation was published pretending to apply to the whole of Johannesburg, whereas it was intended to apply only to certain areas.</block>

<p>I do not know whether the Minister meant what he said, that proclamations were issued which he knew had not the necessary force. If that is the policy of the Government, to proclaim a proclamation which they know has no effect in law, is not law, and has not law behind it, and it is only pretence, that is a method of administration which is calculated not to inspire confidence in the hearts and minds of the natives, but just the reverse. I do not think that any member on either side, except the Minister, thought that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was imbued in any way with trying to create feeling between the two races. As a young member, and one who is actively associated with the natives of this country, and interested in native development, I will now always fear that the Prime Minister may cast that accusation against me that I am trying to instil native unrest. The Secretary of Native Affairs distinctly said that in giving evidence last year before the committee on the Sedition Bill that it was not the intention of the Government to interfere with the legitimate development of trade unionism or co-operation amongst the natives, but to assist them to raise themselves in the scale of civilization. It does seem to me there is a feeling amongst hon. members that we as a legislative body can bring laws into this House which are going in some way to stem the natural aspirations of the natives to rise. Well, we cannot do it, and we must give them scope for the development they are entitled to have. I would like to raise a matter of local importance, and ask the Minister why he promised two years ago and last year, and why has he not seen fit to introduce, provisions for a divorce court in the native territory.</p>

<p>Divorce cases might very easily be dealt with in the territories themselves without undue expense and without the litigants having to go to the Eastern Districts Courts. But I rose to ask the Prime Minister what has been done to carry out the Native Affairs Act of 1920 in establishing local councils. It is a matter in which I took great interest. We are now dealing with other institutions <span class="col_3489-3490" refersTo="page_0405"/>for the natives, and the question is&#x2014; what use are we making of existing machinery? During the time I administered the Act we found it very difficult to make a move, as the natives are very conservative, and they were afraid that the establishment of councils might lead to additional taxation. I believe the latter point was met to a certain degree by legislation last year. I should also like to ask the Prime Minister what has been done to carry out the Natives Urban Areas Act. I understand a good deal of heated wrangling has taken place over what happened at Johannesburg, but the Act itself was a general one. The idea was to get the natives into proper town locations and machinery was established to ensure that being done. There was one provision of very special importance in that Act, and that was to get rid of the surplus natives in the big towns&#x2014;natives who might not be wanted there because of their character and on other grounds, and it was provided that they might be sent back to the places whence they came. Has use been made of that provision to clear the big urban areas of surplus natives? It is a great evil which is growing up, especially here in the West in Cape Town and surrounding places, and unless some check is imposed under that Act the country may be flooded with a large population, which is unwanted here.</p>

<speech by="#marwick">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) suggested that there is a prejudice on the part of Natal members against the formation of trades unions for natives. Under the Industrial Conciliation Act trades unions have to be registered within three months. Members of such unions must not include a person whose contract of service or labour is regulated by Act No. 15 of 1911, Act 25 of 1891 of Natal, and Act 40 of 1894 of Natal. In plain English, no native who comes under the pass or recruiting laws is admissible to trades unions, and, therefore, trades unions composed of these people are not recognized. This policy reflects the collective wisdom of this Parliament. This discussion shows the divergence of feeling between two definite schools in this House. The school of experience is all on the side of pointing out the danger of allowing barbarian natives to join trade unions. Such unions are not recognized, and are not legal. Let me emphasize from a wider experience even than that of the hon. member for Tembuland, the dangerous effect of allowing natives to imitate, and very violently imitate, the trades unionism adopted by Europeans. On the Rand in 1913-&#x2019;14 I was able to see the effect of the bad example of those who took possession of the industrial centre and were a law unto themselves. The natives tried to imitate them, and went round with the red flag and red rosettes declaring on a certain morning that any native who turned out from his hut to go to work would be murdered, and it was as much as the lives of the police were worth to go near these people. Jumpers, hammers and stones were hurled with the intention of killing those who went to work. It is all right for the hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) to speak of natives who go peacefully to the poll and peacefully back again, but they are a different breed of cats altogether, and I should like the hon. member for Tembuland to be called upon to quell riots of these people set alight by the example of those people, natives who believe trade unionism means the right to murder people who want to go peacefully to work. Those are the reasons which induced the House in 1924 to apprehend the danger that would arise from recognizing trade unionism and allowing them to run riot in the land.</p>

<speech by="#payn">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry there is this divergence in the opinions of those who are generally known in the House as &#x201C;The Back Parlour,&#x201D; but I am inclined to agree with every word the hon. member says. I have not advocated trade unionism as being good for the natives. I think it is bad. But if we are going to stop the desire among the natives to co-operate and to come together to uplift themselves, by legal measures in the House, then there is going to be trouble. We have to appeal to the common sense of the native, to show him that he cannot follow the example of these &#x201C;wild cats&#x201D; and must not be led by the nose. My friend, and many of his Natal friends, have been reviling the Cape. Well, why have we not got these &#x201C;wild cats&#x201D; in the Cape? We have not got them, because we try to deal with our natives from a peaceful point of view. We try to teach them that they must rule themselves as far as possible, and we have not got the system they have in Natal where they call the chief and tell him if his people do not behave themselves they will rub it into the chief. If they think they can rule the natives by controlling the chief and by repressive measures, they are behind the times. They have to appeal to &#x201C;the rod and iron&#x201D; to rule the people. My friend said you cannot treat the natives in the same way as you do the sensible natives of the Cape.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>My friends of Natal are apt to get hot-headed on this question. As soon as they realize that the native can be led easily, if you rule him through sympathy and make him realize the white man is here not to oppress him, but to uplift him, the better it will be. I appeal to the Minister of Native Affairs on another question. We recently had a man, Dr. Wellington, who has come into our district in the Transkei and has preached doctrines emanating from America. He came from Natal &#x2014;my friend&#x2019;s constituency over there. We have never had a man like that in the Transkei. They come from Natal and we have to put into operation the laws to get rid of these people and send them back to Natal. I appeal to my friends from Natal and the Free State to remember the natives are human. Every farmer will admit what I say. The natives on his farm are the easiest people to rule in the world if he treats them justly, but it is necessary to keep this type of agitator away who comes <span class="col_3491-3492" refersTo="page_0406"/>round selling buttons to them and telling them these are the discs &#x201C;their American friends will recognize them by when they come over in their aeroplanes.&#x201D; The blue-blooded natives of the farms are the easiest men in the world to deal with, but we must not make them think that we must rule them by laws passed in this House. We must not adopt these Mussolini methods. Rule him by reason, and not by the rod and iron. I would like to ask the Minister of Native Affairs for information about the allocation of the new native taxation, the native development fund, which we instituted a year ago. When he introduced it he told the natives the new fund would be started to be utilized for the development of the natives. I want to point out that we in this House, and the natives in the backveld, have no means of ascertaining what is happening to that fund. I do think that the Prime Minister should realize that it is necessary to let the natives know how those funds are being administered. There is a feeling amongst the natives in the backveld that this taxation is being used for some reason that they know nothing about, and I would ask the Minister of Native Affairs whether he cannot put a statement before the House, not for my information only, but for the information of these natives in the backveld, showing the money which is being raised in the different provinces, and how it is being expended. My hon. friend, the member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) brought a matter before the Minister this afternoon dealing with the trading stations, and suggesting that the five-mile radius which we have in the Transkei should be done away with in his area. I warned the Prime Minister once before to be rather careful of the advice my hon. friend here gives him. My hon. friend is in a very difficult position. He is representing a large mass of farmers in the Kokstad district, and a very few natives in the low area of the district. I am in the fortunate position of representing natives, and I warn the Prime Minister again to be rather careful of the advice that my hon. friend gave in regard to doing away with the five-mile radius, because it is going to bring a good deal of trouble to him if he carries out a change.</p>

<p>In regard to the development fund, that is annually reported upon by the Auditor-General. The right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) has asked me a few questions, first in regard to local councils and how these are getting on. These councils, I have no doubt are gradually getting on better and better, but there is still a good deal of that feeling of suspicion. The natives are so apt to think that behind it all sits taxation, especially in the Cape. Councils have been started at Middle-drift and at Tamachi near Kingwilliamstown, and they are about to be started at Peddie and also at Victoria East. Then there are several others also in the Transvaal where we are really waiting for this little one-clause Bill to go through. As soon as that is through we shall have several others that will be started. In the Free State we have it in both the locations. In Natal they are very shy, so that we have not been successful. Hon. members can understand that this is not a case where we must do anything in the way of forcing this thing upon the people. As to the steps taken to carry out the Urban Areas Act, I must say that in some of the bigger centres it is costing a good deal and taking a great deal of time to have these locations, etc., built, and the accommodation provided. These places cannot all go and spend a quarter of a million as they can in Johannesburg, and build these houses in a year or two. Let me say that I am quite satisfied that they are going on satisfactorily. As regards the smaller places, in ever so many cases this Act is applicable. I am surprised at the number of small places which have asked to fall under this Act. As far as the surplus natives are concerned, they are being repatriated, but the misfortune occurs in two ways. One is that it costs these municipalities something to send these natives back, and the other is that when they are sent back there is nothing to keep them there. The experience is even in regard to Cape Town, that you send them out by one door, and they come back again by another door. So that there will always be a certain number who are practically going round. There is nothing to stop a native from coming. I am afraid that in a few cases the authorities have not been doing their best, that they are rather trying to have a surplus of natives in the locations in order that the necessary labour may be more readily at hand. Let me say I have no reason to say that this is very prevalent, but one or two cases have been found. Hon. members will remember among others the Bloemfontein location which was reported upon by the commission last year. I think, on the whole, we have every reason to be satisfied under the circumstances.</p>

<p>I want to correct an impression which has been given by my hon. friend on my left (Mr. Payn). He seems to have gone off the deep end. I never suggested for one moment that the Prime Minister should interfere with the five mile radius in the native territories; I think it is an excellent thing. What I did say was that in the purely European areas in the Transkei the same regulations or the same provisions in these distinctly European areas should not apply as they apply in the native areas. We have in the European districts entirely different conditions prevailing and you cannot apply the same principle in granting licences in European areas as you do in native areas. I thoroughly appreciate and agree with the principle applied right through the native territories but my remarks referred to the European areas.</p>

<p>I have listened with great interest to the speeches of the hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn) and the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick). I regard them as members who can speak with authority on native questions within their respective areas, and it was interesting to find the different experiences and different view points of these two representatives. I think each expressed fairly <span class="col_3493-3494" refersTo="page_0407"/>correctly the aspects of the native question in their respective areas. We have in those two speeches a very strong testimony to the superiority of the policy we of the Cape Province have adopted as against the others. My friends from Natal must recognize that their province will have to follow the same course as we have here in order to achieve the position we occupy to-day. It is no good trying to suppress the natives. If once you put a people on the way of progress and give them a place in civilization and education and other means of training, it is no good trying to extinguish their just aspirations. One might just as well try putting a lid on a pot of boiling water as to try by repressive measures to extinguish the desire which they have for development. The longer and more insistent people are in applying such repressive measures, by so much do we increase the danger both to ourselves and to them when that safety valve does break loose. I heartily endorse what has been said by the hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn).</p>

<p>No, I am not. Nor am I for allowing Kadalie or anyone else to preach sedition unrestrained. As I have said before, we must go very slowly. You cannot apply the same conditions as exist here to the natives of Zululand. It is only by moving gradually that you can go with safety. I notice here that there is £45,000 for the cost of police, and a further £33,000, subsidies and allowances to chiefs and headmen. I have nothing in the way of criticism towards the police. They may be very useful in the Tembuland area, but as far as my district is concerned I would make the suggestion to the Minister no one occupies such a fine position for restraining evil or crime as a headman does. The average pay of head men is £18 per annum. A policeman gets £56 to £60 per annum, and he has not the responsibility that a headman has. If we paid our headmen better and made it a condition of their retaining office they should give satisfaction and that crime should cease in their areas, I feel quite sure we should arrive at very much more satisfactory results. I would also bring to the attention of the Minister and the department two other items&#x2014;agricultural supervisors and conductors. I do not know that we have a single supervisor or conductor in the Herschel district, and I think something of the kind is very badly needed. I do not know whether the Minister has been in the Herschel district, but if he has, he must have been struck by its condition&#x2014;erosion has set in, the population is increasing, and in a short time I predict that Herschel will be nothing but a barren desert&#x2014;just bare rocks and soil&#x2014;and what is going to happen to the people there I do not know. It is a very serious matter and one to which the department ought to turn their earnest attention without further loss of time.</p>

<p>If it is made a condition that European traders shall confine their energies to selling European goods, well and good, but if you have a string of stores all along the border trade will be dislocated. I hope the Minister will consider the five mile radius essential. In the Cape Divisional Council&#x2019;s control the issue of licences and the five mile radius extends right through the province. Since the Government acquired certain farms in the Glen Grey district for natives where previously the Minister had refused to allow farmers to have trading stations on their farms, he immediately did away with the five miles limit and gave out trading station rights. This is unfair to traders who have kept trading stations for many years, that they should be cut out by competition by trading stations established on farms acquired by Government for native settlement. Another point is that the general council have no facilities under the Land Bank for obtaining funds for the purpose of farms. The Prime Minister said there was no differentiation in this matter between natives and Europeans, but I have a letter stating that a native who applied for loan facilities was advised that the regulations prohibited the Land Bank advancing money to natives. The Prime Minister should consider allocating certain funds from the Land Bank to assist natives to acquire farms. It would not require a very large sum of money, and I think £10,000 or £15,000 would be quite sufficient. Mr. Herold the manager of the Land Bank told me that it would not need any additional machinery. This will be one means of obtaining the confidence of the native.</p>

<p>I think the remarks which have fallen from my hon. friend require a mild reply. He has told the House that the whole fault of our trouble in Natal is, that we do not know how to manage the natives, and that if we only copied that part of the country he comes from, we should have our natives in the same category of prosperity and development as they have their natives. It is difficult to say on what grounds he bases this claim. I have here statistics of crime and immorality, and I find that in cases of a moral character the Cape easily leads. We will take concealment of birth and in my friend&#x2019;s district the percentage of crimes for that offence runs up to 20 per cent. as against 6 per cent. in Natal. That also indicates quite a number of other vices. Then we come to indecent assault, the proportion is 2.63 as against .89 in Natal. Take theft of stock, 15 per cent. against 14 per cent. in favour of Natal. If you look through the figures you will find on comparison <span class="col_3495-3496" refersTo="page_0408"/>that we do not come out so badly. Take the individual native, and I doubt whether, although not so well informed as regards European crime and vice as natives are in the Cape, or parts of it, undoubtedly he is physically and financially a much better man in Natal than in any other part of South Africa. The hon. member for Umvoti (Mr. Deane) has drawn the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that the native locations in Natal to-day are overstocked with cattle. Cattle is a symbol of wealth, and if you go on to the farms of Natal you will find the natives are well off, lacking neither money nor comforts, and there is certainly no lack of work if they desired it. On my own farm my own native servants own 1,000 head of stock and they have unlimited agricultural ground and grazing and no more work than they feel is good for them to carry out. I think they are better off in Natal than under the conditions I see here. The trouble to-day is that they are being deliberately disturbed and the natives are as much against it as we are, and these disturbing influences have got to be removed.</p>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the point raised by the hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. Sephton) and Tembuland (Mr. Payn) with respect to the sluiting in the native areas, and also to what has been said by the hon. member for Tembuland on the advisability, through the Land Bank, of making small advances to natives. I am not pleading for advances to natives, but I would like the Prime Minister to go carefully into it with his department to see if small advances cannot be made to natives to stop the fearful sluiting taking place on native territories. I think it was the hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Moffat) who this afternoon raised the question of native demonstrators. I understood that the Prime Minister said he would be prepared to go fully into that question. If the hon. gentleman will inquire he will find that a few years ago the question was raised of seeing whether it was not the function of the Agricultural Department also to render some assistance in agricultural matters in the native territories. I feel convinced that if you will utilize the services of some of the officers of the Agricultural Department to give advice in those territories it would be perfectly possible if through the Land Bank or other means small advances could be made to the natives, to get a great deal done not alone in connection with sluiting, but I have always been struck with the fact that in the native territories there are great possibilities of small and cheap irrigation schemes. I would like an assurance from the Prime Minister that he will see that these questions are thoroughly gone into and ascertain whether there are no means whereby we could assist the natives in that direction in the future more than we have done in the past.</p>

<p>I realized that very fully when I went through those territories twelve months ago.

<p>Yes, that is something under which he is making headway. I saw one place where the natives themselves were putting a weir in a spruit and they were already diverting water from that. No doubt that will extend. As far as assistance from the Agricultural Department is concerned, I have not the least doubt that the Agricultural Department will be only too glad in any case to lend its officers. Of course, these things are very much left in the hands of the persons on the spot, the officers there, and when they advise us we always go to their assistance, as no doubt has previously been the practice. In regard to the Land Bank, I have just ascertained that the difficulty that formerly existed is the reason for the existence of that regulation. I hear that formerly the difficulty that the Land Bank found was that native lands were all quit rent and the Land Bank had not the security which is necessary. It is for that reason that I feel and I think everybody feels that something on the lines of what has been indicated here by the hon. member for Tembuland (Mr. Payn), namely earmarking certain moneys for natives, is about the only effective way and it was for that reason that I thought it necessary in the Land Bill now in committee to introduce the native land and purchase fund to which not only revenues derived from this or that and appertaining more or less to native lands and native reserves should go, but also moneys voted from time to time by Parliament. I can understand that there is this difficulty with the Land Bank, because the Land Bank, of course, has to work on a strictly economic basis and must be guided by economic and financial rules. For the rest, I need hardly assure hon. members that I am anxious that we should come to the assistance of these natives.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>There are one or two questions I want to ask on this. First of all, I want to ask about the board of trade. I notice, in the first place, that the cost of the board is very rapidly increasing. In the year 1925-&#x2019;26 the actual cost was £5,461: this year it is £14,401. Then there are certain people in this particular vote I would like some information about. For instance, there is an intelligence officer, who is getting £700 a year. What are his duties? As far as I can learn this officer is a former private secretary of the Minister; that is according to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report. Then there are two economists. I should have thought that they would have been more useful in the Department of Finance than in <span class="col_3497-3498" refersTo="page_0409"/>this one. What do they do? They are quite new appointments and they cost over ££1,000. Then, of course, the work of the board is being increased from what it was when they were first appointed. When the board was first appointed it was supposed to be purely an advisory body to advise the Government, in reference to tariffs especially. Now it has widened out and they have become practically an administrative body. Here is what Dr. Bruwer says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board is to-day practically taking the place and doing the work of a department of commerce.</block>

<p>The House was never consulted in regard to that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The board aims at becoming a recognized department of commerce of the Union Government even although the original aim be adhered to.</block>

<p>This has been tried on before. It was tried in the United States in 1912. As a matter of fact, in 1912 the experiment of entrusting tariff decisions to a department of commerce lasted just four years. We are doing exactly the same. We are entrusting the decisions on tariff matters to a department of commerce. That was not the intention of this House in establishing this board. We wanted, as far as I can understand, an impartial board that would not be the tool of the Government and simply give decisions and advice to follow the inclination of the Government, but we wanted a board the same as is established in Australia, the United States of America and, I believe, also in Canada, which would give an impartial opinion on the questions that come up before them. They cannot be a department of the Government and a department of commerce and give an impartial opinion. There cannot be an administrative and an advisory body, as the Minister is trying to set them up as. I think it is just about time that we had these inquiries&#x2014;and we have had a good many of them&#x2014;in public. We had one the other day. I see the report is on the Table, on the condensed milk business, and the result is increased taxation which is now before the House; also with regard to cream, and also sheet lead, and the result is a further proposal to lay on the tariff. What I very much object to is that these inquiries are held in camera. I do not think it is in the interests of the country that they should be. The public know nothing of them until the report is laid on the Table, and it is not even printed. In Australia all these inquiries are held in public, and I think it is the same thing in the U.S.A. All the reports and the detailed annual report there are published. I am absolutely certain, from my knowledge of human nature, and especially manufacturing human nature, that it would be a check on some of the assertions made to the board if these inquiries were made public. Members of the public who know the facts would take them up, and the board themselves, who have absolutely no experience of business, and they cannot say whether a statement is correct or incorrect, whether exaggerated or not, would hear the other side. The public would have an opportunity of putting the other side before the board if the inquiry was in public; but they have no chance now. I hope the Minister will consider that. It is of extreme importance. Then I would just like to ask my hon. friend if he will give us some information as to the duties of the board if it is correct what I have surmized. We have a statement made by the Minister of. Finance that he is going to have an inquiry into the effects of this policy he has pursued during the last few years. It would be extremely useful to the public, who take a great interest in it, if any inquiry were held in public. Let the manufacturers come and make their statement, and let the consumers also get the opportunity of giving their side as well. I infer that the board of trade will make the inquiry into the result of the policy pursued by the Government during the last few years.</p>

<speech by="#mostert">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>I have here the &#x201C;Government Gazette&#x201D; of the 25th February of this year containing a proclamation dated 21st February, signed by the Governor-General-in-Council. I take it, therefore, to be a proclamation which has been made on the advice of the Minister of Mines and Industries in respect of Namaqualand. Now I want to ask the Minister why the whole constituency of Namaqualand, consisting of the districts of Kenhardt, Namaqualand itself and Van Rhynsdorp, cames under it. In Kenhardt not a single diamond has as yet been found, and it has not been prospected. As for Van Rhynsdorp, in almost the half of it, which is only 26,000 square miles, not a single diamond has been found either. All these areas are being included under that proclamation. Why? I think the Minister has issued the proclamation by virtue of Section 5 of the Precious Stones Act of 1907. That Act does, in my opinion, give the Minister the right, but I want to ask whether he appreciates what damage he is causing to the people of Namaqualand in consequence. The people who prospected there have all been prevented from continuing their work. Now I notice in the Act of 1907 that the Governor-General from time to time can exclude areas from prospecting, but then Section 5 of the Act of 1899 is referred to, which states that prospecting licences cannot be interfered with for a period of twelve months on Crown land, nor, subject to existing owners&#x2019; rights on private land as well. I want to point out to the Minister that a man can take out a prospecting licence at the Cape and prospect at Worcester or other places, but I want to ask the Minister whether, if such a person has once put in his prospecting pegs, he must not register, with the magistrate of the district, where he has put in the pegs. The people of Namaqualand, after they had pegged, all went to the magistrate of Springbok to be registered there, and they reported the position of their pegs. According to the Act of 1899, there is only one way in which such persons can be prevented from going on, and that is if they are not prospecting bona fide. Nowhere <span class="col_3499-3500" refersTo="page_0410"/>in Namaqualand was there anything but bona fide prospecting, nor were they asked if they were prospecting, nor were they notified of it. Suddenly they were prohibited from continuing to prospect, and if, after the proclamation, they nevertheless went on with it, then they became liable under the Act to a fine of £100. What losses are the people going to have who have paid up their licences for twelve months? Does not the Minister think that if the people commenced prospecting they have the right to go on with it? If they cannot continue for the period of the licence and cannot renew their licence, then I think they have the right to be as dissatisfied as they are. I want them to point out to the Minister that I have been sent as representative of those people, and as their servant I must interpret their needs and their wishes here. Are the people of Namaqualand again to be treated in such a step-motherly fashion? If Namaqualand is to be proclaimed, why are not Hopetown, Barkly, Prieska, etc., where there has been prospecting, proclaimed? Is Namaqualand excepted, and why? Has Namaqualand done the Minister more harm than Prieska and the other districts. Is it because Namaqualand has less voters? Is the Minister going, just like the last Government, to neglect Namaqualand? I should like to know from the Minister why Namaqualand is put back so much. I want to know at what date and how, how many carats were found and registered in January and the beginning of February, and whether it only came to the notice of the Minister on the 21st February that diamonds to the value of £120,000 had been found. I also want to ask the Minister whether the men who found a lot of diamonds and thoroughly protected their claims were the people who advised him to prohibit prospecting. Did they or did the magistrate advise him? The Minister could not himself have known how many diamonds had been found. [Time limit.]</p>
