<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">That the House go into committee on the Estimates of Additional Expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue and Loan Funds during the year ending 31st March, 1928.</block>

<p>As hon. members are aware the estimates of expenditure for the current year totalled &#x00A3;27,620,000. I am now asking the House to go into committee on the additional estimates of expenditure totalling &#x00A3;1,004,085 making a total appropriation of &#x00A3;28,624,000. There will, of course, be the usual savings on a number of votes. These, as far as we can see at present, will probably amount to about &#x00A3;167,000, giving a revised estimate of expenditure of &#x00A3;28,457,000. That is a net increase on the original estimates of expenditure of &#x00A3;837,000. Hon. members will see that in this amount is, of course, included the sum of &#x00A3;435,000 in respect of reparation receipts which, in terms of an Act which we passed last year, will be applied towards debt redemption, but which have to be appropriated in this way, being a receipt of public moneys and in terms of the principle of our Exchequer and Audit Act. I do not propose to discuss the actual revenue receipts. It is still too early to do so and hon. members will agree that the appropriate occasion to do that will be when my Budget statement is delivered shortly. I only wish to state here that the receipts have been very good during the current year. There are large excesses in the estimates on nearly all heads of revenue with the exception of a few heads of diamond revenue where there will be decreases. The net result at the end of the financial year will probably be a substantial surplus. I do not propose going more fully into this position beyond saying that the figures will probably disclose a substantial surplus. If hon. members will turn to the estimates of additional expenditure before them, they will see that if you make provision for savings and if you exclude the item of &#x00A3;435,000 in respect of reparation receipts, the estimates will show an approximate increase of about &#x00A3;400,000. In that amount hon. members will find several large items for which provision has to be made as a result of Government policy and as a result of legislation at present existing in this country. I refer hon. members to a few of the largest items. In the first place, we have a sum of &#x00A3;100,000 in respect of interest on Union loan certificates; a sum of &#x00A3;100,000 for the aircraft replacement fund, which is a contribution towards defence in respect of aircraft replacements; then a third big item included is &#x00A3;87,000 in respect of pensions; a sum of &#x00A3;50,000 in respect of repatriation of Indians and &#x00A3;30,000 in respect of the final amounts payable as compensation in connection with the flour settlement,&#x2014;the cases we had to settle as a result of the arbitration proceedings. These five items mentioned give you a total of &#x00A3;367,000, so that really a very small sum remains over to be divided amongst a number of other votes which I shall proceed to discuss. I will go through the various votes and explain shortly the reasons for the excesses on the votes. Votes 1, 2 and 3 are Governor-General, Senate and House of Assembly. All the excesses here are due principally as the result of the special session of Parliament which we had in October. Under the Senate and House of Assembly additional provision had to be made for temporary staff and also the expenses of Hansard were considerably increased as far as the House of Assembly is concerned. Under House of Assembly the gross excess was &#x00A3;7,000, but against that, we have been able to put a saving of &#x00A3;2,500 as the result of the full amount not being required for the purchase of the Jardine collection of books. Putting these savings against the excess, we get a net excess of &#x00A3;3,610 on this vote. We come to Vote 4, Prime Minister. This amount is required under the Governor-General&#x2019;s warrant, obtained <span class="col_1507-1508" refersTo="page_0820"/>to cover the salaries and expenses of the new department of External Affairs and also certain increased charges in connection with the Union representation in Angola. Then we come to Vote 5, Public Debt. This amount is required in respect of interest on Union loan certificates. As hon. members will know, these certificates mature in series after periods of five and ten years, or earlier, and the rate of interest increases with the period for which the certificates run. Of course it is impossible to estimate accurately what amounts will be required from time to time for interest, because the item of withdrawals is an uncertain one. In the past, provision was made annually for the payment of interest on these certificates. From this amount, provision was made for the withdrawals and the balance was paid to the Public Debt Commissioners and used ultimately when the balance of the certificates matured. In 1926-&#x2019;27, however, we reduced the actual contribution which was made in respect of interest, because we were informed at the time that we had already probably made a sufficient provision to meet the full amount required when these certificates ultimately matured. Since then a full investigation has been made into the position, and we find our provision at the present moment is probably short to the extent of about &#x00A3;150,000. We now propose in this vote to make provision for &#x00A3;100,000 for that, and for the balance in subsequent years so that the amount will be available when the certificates mature. Some years ago an intensive advertising campaign was started as a result of which quite a large number of people invested in these certificates, and this period will expire shortly, so that we anticipate quite a large number of withdrawals and we have to make increased provision. Having regard to the interest which we pay to investors, and the actual cost of handling these certificates, we will have to consider whether we are not giving, by means of this investment, too favourable benefits to the investor. If we make a comparison of the interest we pay on these certificates, with the interest we pay on our long-dated loans, both those raised in this country and abroad, we will see that the cost to the country of these certificates is really higher than in the case of the long-dated loans.</p>

<p>It is a considerable increase if you consider the working costs of the thrift committee, which has been doing incalculably good work, and the cost to the post office in running these certificates. We shall have to consider whether we should not follow the example of England a few years ago, when they dealt with the matter and put it on a footing more favourable to the Treasury. I am now looking into the position to see whether the present terms should be allowed to continue. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), who is a valued member of the Thrift Committee, knows we have had a departmental enquiry into these certificates&#x2014;as well as the Post Office Savings bank. We have a valuable report, and are now-considering the matter. Then we come to the next item&#x2014;public debt on the same vote, reparation of receipts. That is done in terms of the legislation passed last year.</p>

<p>Several years?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I shall give the hon. member particulars how that amount is arrived at. We received from the British Treasury in respect of recoveries prior to the Dawes scheme, &#x00A3;312,000; receipts up to March 31st, 1928, under the Dawes scheme, &#x00A3;199,000; interest, &#x00A3;3,000&#x2014;a total of &#x00A3;514,000, from which is to be deducted claims which we have paid to Union nationals in respect of losses sustained through enemy action. A committee was appointed to go into individual claims against the Government in connection with these losses; quite a large number of claims were received; a number were rejected, but a number were bona fide and admitted by the Government. Sums under this head amount to &#x00A3;75,000. We are retaining a further amount of about &#x00A3;1,200 to meet further claims which we are expecting and the cost of assessing these&#x2014;&#x00A3;1,800, leaving &#x00A3;435,000, which we intend to appropriate. Of this sum &#x00A3;400,000 has already been received by the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and the balance is payable before the 31st of March next. We now come to pensions (&#x00A3;87,000) which is under three heads. Generally speaking, the excess on this vote is due to the unforeseen large commutations of the pensions of officers who retire. Under legislation passed in this House in 1923, when an officer of the public-service retires, he is entitled to have one-third of his pension commuted, and as a large number of these officers reached the retiring age they left the service, and these payments had to be met by the Treasury, which are invariably made, and the result was that insufficient provision was made under this head.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>Does this not come from the Pension Fund?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Not commutations. These retirements are largely in the police and prison services where you have had numbers of officers retiring. There is a further deficit of &#x00A3;20,000 under sub-head (g)&#x2014;contributions to pension and provident funds. A large number of non-contributing persons are retiring and are being replaced by younger men, who have been a certain number of years in the service and are entitled to contribute; the Government has to make provision on the &#x00A3; for &#x00A3; principle. We have made insufficient provision for grants to old, aged and infirm ex-soldiers&#x2014;these oud-stryders&#x2019; pensions. They are men who have taken part in wars in this country, on both sides. We have to provide a further amount. We have 3,870 on our books, who are getting &#x00A3;30 per annum. Then we come to the provincial administrations vote. The amount&#x2014;&#x00A3;600&#x2014;is very small and is for the payment of leave gratuity to the former <span class="col_1509-1510" refersTo="page_0821"/>administrator of Natal&#x2014;Sir George Plowman. The grant is to be made on the basis of six months&#x2019; leave at the rate of salary he was drawing when he relinquished his post as Provincial Secretary of Natal&#x2014;his services were continuous after having acted as Provincial Secretary. During that period the pension to which he was entitled was in abeyance, and when he retired he had substantial vacation and other leave to his credit. The Government, taking that into consideration, decided to give him a special leave gratuity and to treat him on the same basis as Mr. G. R. Hofmeyr, the former Administrator of South-West Africa. Then we come to miscellaneous services. There have been various savings on this vote under various heads, and excesses of other heads, with the result that we are left with about &#x00A3;200 under &#x201C;contingencies&#x201D;. Several large payments have been made during the year in connection with the Naval Disarmament Conference at Geneva, the tour in the Union of the Dominion Chamber of Commerce, and the visit to South Africa of the Secretary of State for the Dominions. The balance of &#x00A3;30,000 is in connection with the flour purchase. I gave to the House the other day, in reply to a question, full particulars of the amount spent in this connection. The matter is now being finally closed, and we have met all claims. The total amount paid in connection with these claims is just over &#x00A3;99,000, to which have to be added the legal costs. This unfortunate chapter is now closed. Vote No. 14, Justice&#x2014;the excess of &#x00A3;14,400 is due to the costs in connection with legal proceedings over the flour case, and is a re-vote. A further amount is required in connection with litigation against the contractors for the new Government printing works at Pretoria. Judgment has been reserved, and it is just possible that we shall have to meet a bill in connection with these proceedings. The amount required for Vote No. 15, Superior Courts, is &#x00A3;6,000, and includes witnesses&#x2019; and jury expenses, which it is impossible to calculate at the beginning of the year. The same remark applies to Vote No. 16, Magistrates and District Administration, there having been an under estimate of the cost of subsistence and transport and witnesses&#x2019; expenses. As to Vote No. 18, Police, &#x00A3;18,140, this is, mainly the result of the severe cut we made at the beginning of the year. The Treasury asked the Police Department _to provide the police for a certain definite amount. They have done their best, but it was found impossible to meet all the demands, especially in connection with police protection on the diamond diggings and the native locations at Langa and Port Elizabeth. The town councils made an appeal to the Government to help them to get the natives to go to the locations and to afford further police services, which the Treasury very reluctantly had to concede. With reference to Vote No. 19, Defence, &#x00A3;100,000 is required for the replacement of aircraft and for the construction in South Africa of aircraft machines. If hon. members desire more information on this point, I think the Minister of Defence will supply it. Under Vote 20, Interior, &#x00A3;60,745, we have the sum of &#x00A3;50,000 for the repatriation of free and destitute Indians. The number for which provision was originally made was 1,500, and although the Indian agreement has been in operation only during a part of the financial year, I understand that the number which will approximately benefit under this scheme will be 3,000, thus necessitating extra financial provision. With reference to Vote No. 21 Mental Hospitals and Institutions for the feeble-minded, &#x00A3;29,900, the amount is spread over a large number of sub-heads for salaries and supplies and services. Fort Napier, which was opened during the year, is responsible for &#x00A3;15,000 of the increase. The construction and equipment of that institution was accelerated, making it possible for the department, during the year, to carry out its policy of transferring to Fort Napier a large number of mental patients. As to Vote No. 22. Printing and Stationery, &#x00A3;17,000, here again is a case where a cut was made by the Treasury, and the department was told to come out on a certain amount, but, unfortunately, the Government, from time to time, gets the reply that the vote is exhausted. The demands of the public and members of Parliament are very insistent. We have gone into the whole matter and certain steps have been taken which, I hope, will result in considerable economy, but the position at present is that we find, on all sides, the printing bill is going up. The sum of &#x00A3;12,967 required under Vote No. 25, Mines and Industries, is set out under various heads and is due to under estimating, and to the Treasury declining to agree to a saving of &#x00A3;30,000 being made available to meet excesses on other votes. Provision is also made for the expenses of Mr. de Villiers, who is proceeding to Europe to succeed Mr. Pienaar. Vote No. 26, Union Education, &#x00A3;14,137, is for statutory grants to various universities and colleges, and although we have a considerable saving on the vote, but, owing to the operation of Column 2 of the Appropriation Act, we are unable to make these savings available to meet excesses on other portions of the vote. Under Vote No. 27, Child Welfare, &#x00A3;4,500, we have to deal with the payments of increased grants to institutions as the result of more and more children being committed to them. Under Vote 28. Agriculture, &#x00A3;100 is required to supplement the grant of &#x00A3;400 to the South African Agricultural Union. &#x00A3;500 were earned, but owing to the provisions of the Appropriation Act, no saving can be made available to meet an excess. Under Vote No. 29. Agriculture (Education). &#x00A3;250 are asked for to make provision for scholarships and bursaries which the department is giving to students qualifying in tobacco and cotton growing. We have lost a number of our young fellows, who have gone to Central Africa.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Not many of them leave to take up positions there, and the department finds it necessary to make <span class="col_1511-1512" refersTo="page_0822"/>further provision to induce young fellows to take up this career and to be employed in our own agricultural department. Under Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones, the excess is &#x00A3;23,000 and is the result of increased establishment and general expansion of business in the post office. When we deal with revenue estimates, hon. members will see that the earnings show considerable expansion, and the staff naturally increases. Under Public Works the increase is for rent, rates and lighting and increased assessment rates and additional charges for electric light in connection with new buildings in various centres. Also &#x00A3;4,000 is required under sub-head &#x201C;O&#x201D; for statutory holiday pay of artizans on departmental work in the Public Works Department. Land, &#x00A3;8,500, a special grant for the National Parks Board. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Tagger) is, I know, dubious about the necessity for this grant, but I think the Government has interpreted the wishes of the majority of the members of this House. I must point out that it will be a non recurrent item, and it is urgently required for fencing, road-making and boundary marking. The hon. member was under the impression we were spending &#x00A3;12,000 a year, but the annual grant is only &#x00A3;4,000, and, in addition, there is &#x00A3;3,000 provided by the Transvaal Administration, making a total of &#x00A3;7,000.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not sufficient.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>That is as far as we have agreed to go up to the present. Under Labour there is a small excess due to the provision for relief distress in the drought areas of the Cape. The Minister of Labour has contributed to the relief of distress, to the fund of the Provincial Council and other funds raised by public subscription. We spent in the last four or five months just over &#x00A3;20,000 and, through that, the Minister had to exceed the vote for ordinary unemployment. In two of the loan votes there are excesses due to the acceleration of work for which provision was made on the original estimates. That will decrease the provision to be made in subsequent years. The work advanced quicker than was anticipated. There are large savings on the loan votes generally, but, here again, we cannot make those savings available for expenditure of this nature. I am just informed, regarding the point raised by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan), the amounts required for commutations, are, in this case, to be provided from the revenue vote, because the annuities are payable from revenue and not from funds. I take it no exception will be taken to the four or five big amounts. They are on questions of broad policy, and there is very little in the smaller sums required for the present financial year.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Notwithstanding the pains-taking explanation of the Minister, one cannot help having the feeling that had it not been for the big surplus he has in view, a lot of these sums would not have been in these estimates. Even Ministers are only human beings, and when there is a prospect of a big surplus, the Treasury is rather inclined to slacken the control which it ought to exercise, and undoubtedly other Ministers are always inclined to spend more money. With the prospect of a big surplus they are inclined to become extravagant, as these Votes show to some extent. Every Minister and his department has some pet scheme or pet expenditure which they always want to bring forward. I have no doubt the Minister of the Interior has a great number up his sleeve, that he brings them forward on an occasion like this. I shall have a few words to say on that on another occasion; it is sufficient to say what I have said for the present. Take the Defence Vote, &#x00A3;100,000. Would the Minister have agreed to that if he had been short of money? Then there are Hospitals, &#x00A3;30,000, in round figures; Mines and Industries, &#x00A3;12,967; Postal Vote, &#x00A3;23,000. If we had been short of money, these would have been further considered. Public Works, &#x00A3;9,000, and there is also &#x00A3;4,000 in that Vote to which I do not think he would have agreed if he had been short of money. Then the National Park Vote. Would he have agreed to that if he had been short of money? I am just reminding the House of these amounts. The Minister has a big surplus in view to dispose of, and every Minister prays for an increase of grant. It is difficult, when the Minister has a prospect of a surplus of &#x00A3;1,500,000, to put his foot down and keep it there. He got the Printing Vote reduced, but could not keep it there. He has had to raise it. The police, exactly the same. I sympathize with the Minister of Finance, I know the demands of the other Ministers, and he has ten men up against him. It is difficult to resist these colleagues in a case of this kind. I will only just refer to the redemption of debt, &#x00A3;435,000. Leaving that out of account, the total expenditure this year is going to be &#x00A3;28,000,000, an increase on last year&#x2019;s expenditure of &#x00A3;640,000. That is the amount of the increase. This is an increase of close on &#x00A3;4,000,000 on the expenditure of 1923-&#x2019;24, when my hon. friend took charge of the Treasury. The increase amounts to 16 per cent. in four years&#x2019; time. In the same period the population has only increased 8 per cent. against an increase of expenditure of 16 per cent., at least double the rate of the population increase. It is only right, in connection with increased expenditure, that we should take into account the increase of population which has to bear the burden. At the same time I want to point out also that the country goes merrily on piling up the debt. This year, taking into account the &#x00A3;1,000,000 savings which he anticipates making, and &#x00A3;2,500,000 receipts for mining leases and loan recoveries, we are spending of borrowed money &#x00A3;10,000,000. We spent last year &#x00A3;9,500,000, and the public debt at the end of this financial year will amount to &#x00A3;241,000,000 against <span class="col_1513-1514" refersTo="page_0823"/>&#x00A3;208,000,000 in the year 1924, an increase again of close on 16 per cent. In fact, in four years&#x2019; time, under the regime of my hon. friend, we have increased the public debt by &#x00A3;33,250,000. I do not see very much signs of the economy which we were promised when this Ministry took office. We were denounced in fairly strong terms about our extravagance. I have been looking for economy all the time I have been sitting on this side. I have not seen much of it yet. There are one or two votes I want to mention. The department of the Minister of Labour, I see, asks for an increase of &#x00A3;9,186. On the main estimates the vote was &#x00A3;195,000, so that that vote is now over &#x00A3;200,000.</p>

They were referred to the Board of Aid, which is really a charitable institution for the relief of distress amongst women and children and the poor who cannot work. The Board of Aid could not, of course, assist them. As they said, they were not there to pay out doles to able-bodied men. They went back to the Department of Labour.

<p>Why did you not find it before? I have not the remotest doubt that if there had not been this pressure on the part of these people, this work would not have been found. Yesterday 100 adult coloured people went to the Board of Aid to get assistance. They were refused. Has my hon. friend found work for those men? My hon. friend, when he was sitting in the corner there, used to lay great stress on &#x201C;delivering the goods.&#x201D; That was a favourite expression. I have not heard that expression yet. I am the only one who uses it nowadays, as far as I can see. I want to know whether he has &#x201C;delivered the goods&#x201D; in these particular cases. Why has he not put into operation the Labour Colonies Bill which was passed a year or two ago? Nothing has been done in regard to that.</p>

<p>I quite agree. I want to ask the Minister of Mines and Industries a question in regard to the increased vote of &#x00A3;12,967 on page 9. I see an item, &#x201C;diamond diggings expenditure,&#x201D; &#x201C;benevolent grants to diggers.&#x201D; There exists an extremely serious state of affairs on the Lichtenburg diamond fields. The diggers there, according to the papers, are actually starving. As far as I can judge, since the passing of the Precious Stones Act of last year, the position there has been very disastrous. I want to take the opportunity of asking the Minister of Mines and Industries for an explanation of the position. This is the first time the opportunity has occurred.</p>

<p>There is another matter to which I wish to call the attention of the Minister of Finance. It will be noticed that in these votes there are certain provisions for leave of officers. I will take an example, Vote 20, Interior. The original estimate for leave gratuities was &#x00A3;100, and an additional &#x00A3;1,800 is now asked for. These leave gratuities are provided for the purpose of paying out in regard to civil servants who may be retrenched, or who may die, cash payments in respect of leave due to them. They are always very much too small. Let me give my hon. friend a few examples. On page 35 of the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, he will find that in 1926-&#x2019;27 we voted for the various departments a total of &#x00A3;3,000, while the amount actually paid was &#x00A3;70,010. Surely it ought to be possible&#x2014;I know the difficulties of the Treasury in this matter&#x2014;to make a better estimate than &#x00A3;3,000 against &#x00A3;70,000 actually paid. Take the year before, 1925-&#x2019;26.</p>

<speech by="#william_macintosh">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAM MACINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>While agreeing entirely with my hon. friend in regard to the growth of expenditure, I want to confine my remarks to a criticism of the way these things are put forward. The Minister has explained the amount and, as he says, it is not an unreasonable amount he is asking for, but I take it these estimates ought to be a provision for expenditure which could not be foreseen. Such, for instance, as expenditure on the aircraft. There are many items here which I contend could have been and should have been foreseen by a capable Minister and a capable Treasury. I will mention some of the items. The Minister refers to Vote 9, the question of the losses on flour. The Minister knew at the beginning of the year that this litigation was in hand. He knew he would have to make a payment on account of that, and why could not provision have been made before that? This cannot be regarded as unforeseen expenditure. With regard to the legal expenses, the Minister said they were largely in connection with this business, and provision had been made the year before. If one looks at the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report, one sees that the department itself says that the non-delivery of certain bills of cost by the 31st March, 1927, resulted in the saving in question. They knew these bills had to come in, but they made no provision. This should not come in as unforeseen expenditure, because, according to the statement here, it was known that amount would be required. The same thing applies to leave gratuities. In connection with Vote 21, Fort Napier, the Minister&#x2019;s explanation was that the hospital had been opened earlier than was anticipated, but if you look at the vote, you will see that &#x00A3;19,000 was asked for, and the total vote for the coming year is only a little over &#x00A3;20,000. It is evident the hospital must have been opened early in the year, and it seems to me it would have wanted very little prevision to have made the necessary provision for that. On Vote 26, there is the University of the Witwatersrand from &#x00A3;83,000 to &#x00A3;94,000, which seems also a considerable under-estimate. When you come to the loan votes, you find there is &#x00A3;12,000 extra required for the Port Elizabeth Technical College. The Minister of Education will remember that when the loan estimates came up last year, I called attention to the fact and produced correspondence which showed that this extra money would be required. Provision could then have been made in these loan estimates. My criticism is not of the amount of the estimates, I think they are reasonable&#x2014;that is, the percentage increase on the estimates we passed last year is not unreasonable&#x2014;but I do say that many of these estimates could and should have been foreseen, and should have been included in the original estimates.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nathan">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NATHAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to make a few remarks about these additional estimates. We were told in regard to Votes 1, 2 and 3, that the total expenditure of over &#x00A3;5,000 was incurred in connection with the special session held last October. I put it to this House and to the country whether the result of that session was worth this expenditure. With reference to Vote 19, in which an additional &#x00A3;100,000 is asked for, I would draw attention to the fact that only &#x00A3;100 was placed on the estimates last year. I want to draw attention to the fact that it does not come under (g) 7; but it comes under (g) 8. You find that the contribution to the Aircraft Replacement Fund in 1927-&#x2019;28 was &#x00A3;100, and in 1928-&#x2019;29 was &#x00A3;100, and now we find we are asked to vote an additional &#x00A3;100,000. I would like to know who directed the policy for this expenditure. It is extraordinary to deal with so comprehensive a matter by way of supplementary expenditure instead of through the ordinary annual estimates. They do not ask it for expenditure to be incurred, but for that which has been incurred. I think it is monstrous. I hope the Minister will give this House the best possible information on the policy of the air grant. I do not know where we are going to with this expenditure, and when we have it what we are going to do with it. I want some information with regard to Vote 22, Printing. We are asked to vote an extra &#x00A3;17,000. Recently I, and I think every honourable member, received a very important telegram asking us to restore a certain report. How many more of these reports have been printed without being sanctioned? Who directs the policy of the Government with regard to printing.</p>

<p>I do not think such a damaging attack as that of the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Nathan) should go unanswered for one moment&#x2014;particularly one on my department. He began by calling attention to a falsification&#x2014;(g) 7. <span class="col_1517-1518" refersTo="page_0825"/>instead of (g) 8. I feel almost shattered, but I confess it appears to he a mistake, and then in the &#x00A3;100,000 we have not foreseen there is a sudden increase of &#x00A3;99,900 merely on account of the service. I can assure the House that the surplus is only responsible for this &#x00A3;100,000 appearing this year I think the House will agree if we have a programme involving &#x00A3;100,000 or &#x00A3;108,000, and we have the money at hand we should make contracts ahead for the whole matter and save a good deal of money. I may remind hon. members, as I stated on a previous occasion, we have this large gift from the Imperial Government. About two years ago, I think, in looking forward, we wanted this to be deferred as long as possible. Re-equipping eventually has got to come, and for that purpose we increased the workshops&#x2019; staff and brought into commission D.H. 4&#x2019;s and Avelons for training. We thought that about 1930, probably, we should have them entirely re-equipped. Hon. members who visited Pretoria are aware that the workshops are a very great credit to Sir Pierre van Ryneveld and those under his command, and they rebuild every machine that crashes. We are able to make these machines last much longer after rebuilding. We are going on with the D.H. 9 with the present engine power and falling behind. The D.H. 9 was originally designed to carry 420 horse power, and equipped with 230 horse power. We decided to make an experiment, which has been quite successful, by putting more powerful engines into them&#x2014;a 430 horse power, and to get the requisite cruising speed 20 miles per hour faster than we are getting now, and to continue to use these craft for from four to six years, and gradually replace them ourselves. Although they appear in the log as No, so-and-so, they are like the Irishman&#x2019;s gun&#x2014;which got a new stock, a new barrel and so forth. The first proposition put forward was that the expenditure should take place over three years. The sooner we can get all our craft of the same speed the more efficient we are, and we propose to make contracts with the suppliers saving money over that and to re-equip them within as reasonable a time as we can, when they come into the shops, so that within two years or a few months longer, we shall have our fleet equipped with higher engine power. This order we placed took a long time in coming out. If the right hon. member (Gen. Smuts), prefers, I prefer certain details not to be stated in public. We shall have a fleet of very well-equipped general service machines, which is the type we want in this country. We are taking the best advice we can get, and I am certain that the programme we propose to adopt is one which will commend itself to the House. When we go into committee I shall endeavour to give further details.</p>

<p>I am highly gratified at the very favourable reception which these estimates have received from the House. There have been a few general criticisms with which I propose to deal. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) makes the point that these additional estimates, modest as they are compared to what we have been accustomed, would have been still more modest, but for the fact that the departments knew that we were to have a surplus. Really, the fact that we were to have a surplus has nothing to do with the amount of these estimates. On many of these items the expenditure was granted long before there was a prospect of a surplus. Take the National Parks Board. Quite early in the year a good case was made out for that at a time when we did not know we were going to have a surplus. Take the postal vote. The post office is a business department.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>If increased business comes along, they want an increased staff, but we have the benefit reflected on the revenue side. As a result of the general expansion in the business, naturally the expenditure always increases, but that has nothing to do with the fact that we are going to have a surplus. Again, take the mental hospitals and child welfare institutions. We have very little control over this source of expenditure, unless the Government, the House and the country are prepared to refuse people admission to these institutions when they are committed there by the magistrates. Naturally when the children are committed to these places we have to take them in. I agree with my hon. friend that we are admitting people to these institutions for whom other provision should be made. Take the police. I though the money we were spending on the police was sufficient, but the hon. member knows the pressure that was exercized from Johannesburg and the diamond diggings for additional police. If I get the support of this House in curtailing the vote that will be the policy, but if people are crying out for more police all over the country, we cannot keep the expenditure down. People cannot have it both ways. The other item my hon. friend mentioned was the payment of artisans for statutory holidays. That matter came up towards the end of the financial year, and we are merely bringing our employees into line with the employees of municipalities and other large employers which give their employees these benefits, and naturally the Government cannot withhold them. It is not a fact that this extra provision is being made because we have a surplus. Only when it is necessary in the public interests do we agree to these increases. The hon. member pointed to the large increase in our expenditure generally. That is a question we will debate when we get to the budget, but 16 per cent. increase over a period of four years is not very alarming if we compare that with annual increases over previous estimates. I welcome the hon. member&#x2019;s remark in regard to our administrative expenditure, and also when he pointed out we were incurring heavy expenditure on capital works. I hope the House will assist the Government and me to try and curtail the expenditure we are annually incurring on capital works. We are a young country and must expand, but we will have to look into this question of capital expenditure. <span class="col_1519-1520" refersTo="page_0826"/>We cannot go on spending &#x00A3;10,000,000 to &#x00A3;13,000,000 annually. Unless, however, you have a healthy public opinion on this question, what can you do when every hon. member has his own pet scheme? Unless the House and the country take up a different attitude, I do not think this or any other Government will be able to do much in this direction. Then the hon. member referred to a matter which was dealt with in the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report in regard to the inadequate provision for leave gratuities. So far as leave is concerned, provision is really made for that under the salary vote. The &#x00A3;100 mentioned in the supplementary estimates is a token vote to get the principle agreed to by the House so that we can pay for leave. If we adopt the suggestion of the Auditor-General it will lead to more extravagance, as the departments will be only too glad to have more money for leave purposes; at present they must try to find the money for this purpose from savings on the vote, and it is only when they are unable to do so that they come to us. I think the present method leads to economy. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Sir William Macintosh) raised the question of the necessity of closer estimating. He says that some of the items could have been foreseen. Again I may say that if we compare these estimates with those which we have been accustomed to have in the past, the present estimates display remarkably close estimating. The hon. member mentioned the &#x00A3;30,000 required in connection with the flour purchases. Last year, one large claim was outstanding. This claim was, I think, something in the nature of &#x00A3;250,000, but the company were prepared to settle for &#x00A3;100,000. What amount was I to provide? I was trying my best to save the taxpayers&#x2019; money. If I had made provision to pay &#x00A3;250,000 there would have been very little chance of settling the case for &#x00A3;25,000. Although we knew there was a prospective claim, we did not know what amount would be required, and the best course was to try and settle for the lowest sum possible. On the basis of the hon. member we might have been asked three years ago to provide half a million for claims which we knew were coming along. Although half a million or more was claimed, we eventually settled all claims for &#x00A3;100,000, and I think we followed the right course. The hon. member also referred to the bill of costs. We did provide in the additional estimates last year for the amount, but it was not paid out until the end of the year and the estimates are framed long before that. We felt it could eventually stand over as it was only part of the bigger amount. The question of aircraft replacement has been dealt with by the Minister of Defence. Here again it was a token vote to retain the principle. If necessary, we could make payments and find the money either by a Governor-General&#x2019;s warrant or other provision. It might have been necessary to find it during the year, but the policy was not settled and that is why provision was not made when the original estimates were prepared. I hope the House will now pass the vote.</p>

I have sat under both systems, and I cannot say that we are much better off with a Hansard than we are without. We can discuss it under the main estimates.

<p>Now that the Prime Minister has come in, I should like to put a few questions to him on this Vote No. 4. I should like to know in regard to the Consul for the Union of South Africa in Angola whether he has been appointed and whether he has been recognized by the Portuguese Government. There is a rumour that although we have made an effort to appoint a Consul, he has not been recognized by the Portuguese Government of Angola. The other point I would like to ask is for information in regard to the rumour that Union subjects or supposed Union subjects who are in Angola are to be transferred to South-West Africa. I understand that the consul had been appointed largely to look after the interests of these trek Boers who went to Angola a generation ago, but more recently there has been a rumour, and there have been some discussions in the papers, to the effect that it is the intention of the Government to bring these people back from Angola to South-West Africa and settle them there. We have heard no official statement from the Government. I think it would be useful if the Prime Minister would tell us what the position really is in regard to these people, and, if they have to be transferred to South-West Africa, whether it is necessary for us to have a consul of our own in Angola, because there would be no work for him once this transfer has been made. It is a question of very grave policy, too, whether it is in the interests of this country to bring back these people who have been for a generation and more in Angola and who have carried the heat and burden of the day. There is no doubt that these people from the Transvaal have in a large sense saved the situation for the Portuguese Government in Angola. They have settled, not on the coast, but in the interior. They have been a buffer there between the turbulent tribes of the interior and the Portuguese settlement on the coast. The complaint now is that in regard to land questions they are treated unfairly, and they can get no title, and there is a further complaint in regard to the question of schooling. Their own language is disregarded and, in fact, is ostracized, and if they send their children to school, it can only be to the Portuguese schools with the Portuguese language as medium, and they are not assisted in any other way. I was under the impression when the Prime Minister told us a year or two ago, that this consul was going to be appointed, that these matters were going to be put right, that that would be the work of the consul. I was informed that he had been very successful in his work, that titles are being given to our friends in the north and that the school question is being settled. Now there is this rumour abroad that so far from being successful, he has been eminently unsuccessful and that our friends are to be transferred and some refuge is to be provided for them in the Union. This would be the first occasion where our people in South Africa have come back. We have always progressed, we have always moved north, we have never come south again, and this would be the first occasion where we would have to admit defeat and our people would have to come back, and I feel very greatly concerned about this matter. I have always looked upon the presence of our friends in Angola as a guarantee that even there white civilization, as we understand it in the south, will be upheld, but if they are to be brought back it will be to admit defeat in this movement that started a generation ago, and I think our Government may be making a great mistake. I may be arguing in the air. I am speaking from newspaper reports which I have seen, and I think this is a matter on which the Prime Minister should make a statement to the House. The Prime Minister might also tell us about this increase of &#x00A3;2,200 for the secretary and staff of the Department of External Affairs. This is a department which was started recently. I believe the appointments to that body have been made since the last session of Parliament. I would like to know what has been the justification for this department and this additional staff which is now required. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s department for a number of years has been carrying on and administering the external affairs of the Union. That has been done for a number of years, and done, I hope, with a fair amount of efficiency. The only changes which have taken place in the administration are the appointment of the consul in Angola and the trade commissioner in America. To found a department to carry on such puny expansion seems to me a pure waste of money. I think it requires a statement from the Prime Minister and an explanation why this country should be put to the expense of the establishment of a new department and an increase of thousands of pounds when really there is no change at all, when things are going on just as before, when his secretary is also appointed as Secretary for External Affairs, and his assistant secretary is appointed as Assistant Secretary for External Affairs. I think this is a matter which also requires explanation, and, in view of the spirit of economy which the Minister of Finance displays, and which I am glad to see, though it is somewhat belated after four years, I think the committee is entitled to hear from the Prime Minister why this new department has been founded in this way, without any necessity whatever for it, without any <span class="col_1523-1524" refersTo="page_0828"/>call for it, without any work for it, and what is the reason for this additional expenditure.</p>

<p>Of course, if I took up the attitude of the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts), that the Department of External Affairs is unnecessary, then the vote is also unnecessary. Then everything ought to be deleted, but the Government, unfortunately, follows a different line, namely, to transact its own business, and that is why the department is created. I always thought the hon. member agreed with us, but to-day we learn for the first time that the hon. member objects to the Department of External Affairs. I always differed from the hon. member, and it looks as if we are still differing. The hon. member wants us to continue considering ourselves subjects, but we have said that we are going to be free people. I am much surprised that he should now ask why such a department was created. I just wish to add that this department does not add a single pound to the previous expenditure. If the hon. member had gone into the matter properly he would have known what took place, what was announced in our debate here not so long ago. In other words, he would know that one of the changes made is that the Governor-General is no longer the representative of the British Government in South Africa, but solely and only the representative of His Majesty the King. Therefore, all the work of the office of the Governor-General for the British Government, all the communications between that Government and ourselves no longer takes place between him and the British Government, but between this Government and the British Government, that is between Government and Government, with the result that the work of the office of the Governor-General has merely been transferred to the office of the Department of External Affairs. On the 1st July last the advice of the Imperial Conference was put into practice. There is, therefore, no new expenditure. A great part of what the Governor-General&#x2019;s department paid before is now paid by the Department of External Affairs. I now want to say a few words about the consul in Angola, and the Union subjects there. Let me say at once that I again differ entirely from my hon. friend. There is no question of a &#x201C;defeat&#x201D; when people come back from there. Who would it be a defeat of? The Government did not send them. I hope, too, that it is not thought that they were sent by any Government, because then it would only give much cause for the suspicion, which we, I think, have not the least right to encourage, that the Union Government was, or is, engaged in interfering with the affairs of a neighbouring friendly power. There can be no question of a defeat in that sense. Possibly, however, people went there to seek their fortune in another country, and did not make it. Now I just want to say a few words here about the consul for whom provision is made. Provision was made for this 18 months, or two years ago. The matter actually started before we came into office, when it was brought home to us that the people there were very unhappy, that they were not getting the treatment which would give them a chance of progress. Our Government then thought that it would be best to appoint a consul there with whom we could be in communication, and who would be able to do what was necessary for the people. We also asked the approval of the Portuguese Government to appoint a certain person who was living in Angola. Unfortunately, we were notified that the Portuguese Government could not agree to the appointment of that person. Well, he was the only person living in Angola whom we could use for the purpose. When we could not get his appointment approved, we saw that it would be necessary to send someone there from the Union, and it goes without saying that we could not get such a person for the &#x00A3;500 that we wanted to give to the person living there. We could not possibly get a capable person for that amount, and we accordingly put an extra sum of &#x00A3;500 on the estimates.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Before we could do so, the position in relation to the Union subjects (let me call them that, although Portugal contends that they, the people who went there from the Union, are not all Union subjects) was such that we could not immediately carry out our plans. Before I could make an appointment we were informed that the people had practically all decided for themselves not to remain there any longer as the treatment was so extremely bad. I have nothing to do with how much of this is true, but that is simply what is said, and the people according to the reports regarded their treatment as such that they decided to stay no longer. Let me say that their decision was accentuated by the fact that the person was refused permission to act as consul; they then practically became desperate, but we immediately took steps, and told the people that they must not be so precipitate, and that we would try to send someone from here. The Government tried to ascertain if that would satisfy them. After waiting a few months-because it takes time, the country being very big, and the people living far apart&#x2014;we received information. It came from the person whom we wanted to appoint there. He travelled round the country to find out what the people thought. We asked him to recommend the people, if they could make a living, to stop there. We found however that whatever we might do they could not stop there any longer. The result was that no consul has yet been sent from here, because in the meantime the people simply inspanned their waggons and trekked towards the Kunene. Although many of the people have been there for long, some over 50 years, they have never vet been able to get titles to land. We can, therefore, understand that they are practically indifferent as to where they are; one piece of ground is as good as another. They inspanned, and are now practically all on trek, or have already arrived on the other side of the Kunene. During the last four or five months <span class="col_1525-1526" refersTo="page_0829"/>they have been threatening to enter South-West. The people have plenty of stock. Their possessions consist mostly of stock, and the cattle, unfortunately, have lung and other sickness. The Administrator of South-West is much afraid that the people will burst in with their stock, and then, of course, the question will be so much the more difficult. I may add that the latest information is&#x2014;rightly or wrongly&#x2014;that the people have been told by what are stated to be Portuguese officials, that if they are still found there in a year, they will all be declared Portuguese subjects, and be liable to military service. The result is that, not only those who are still on farms, but also those who are outside on the land, are all making preparations to go back, and they are packing up. Even the people in the villages are doing the same. We are informed by the Mr. Meyer who went round, and, I understand there is even a deputation in Cape Town, although I have not yet seen them. According to the report the people can no longer be stopped, and they represent the treatment as so utterly bad&#x2014;I do not know whether this is true, but it is so reported&#x2014;that they want to get away. Now the question is what is the Government going to do? Are we going to treat these people who are clearly not being treated on the lines of Europeans in the Union&#x2014;I mentioned the fact that they cannot even get title to ground&#x2014;in an unfriendly way? If the facts are as stated, can it be expected that they shall continue to live in another country? They are <i>now</i> on the other side of the river. We can say that we shall not worry about them at all, and that they must look after themselves, or we must&#x2014;and I regard this as our duty&#x2014;give a helping hand and assist them to live again a decent and respectable life. We are constantly corresponding with the authorities in South-West Africa, and the intention was that the Administrator should accompany Minister Grobler in May, or thereabouts, to go and see the people themselves, but in the meantime they have got in such a hurry, and they regard matters as so urgent, that they are coming over to South-West, and there is already a deputation here as I understand. Now the question is, what must be done? Of course, it is a matter for the Government to decide after proper enquiry has been made, and a proper investigation about what is actually going on, because, as I have said, I have no adequate proof as to what the position really is. We have only reports as to why the people are acting in this way, and say that we must come to their aid. Of course, I am just as sorry as the hon. member for Standerton that the people, after having gone north from South Africa so long ago should, after all they have done there, reach the pass of having to come back again, and ask us for assistance. We must see what we can do. As I see it, it is not only the Union, but also South-West which must do something for these people, i.e., I feel that if their cause is just, it is a moral duty to do what we can, and what South-West can. It will have to be discussed between us and South-West, and the first thing when we come to the point of making provision is how many of them there are. As far as I can ascertain, there are about 3,000, including who are about to return. It will depend upon the number of needy persons how we can estimate the difficulty of the question, because all do not appear to be in need. I understand that there are about 150 families who are fairly well off, but there are approximately 70 families who are poor and needy. I can only tell my hon. friend that this is, unfortunately, a matter for which we have no provision, and all we can do under the circumstances is to try, not only to alleviate their lot as much as possible, but also to see that when they come within the borders they are given an opportunity of again becoming citizens of the country. Hon. members will, therefore, see why the consul has not yet been appointed. It is still possible that, after the interview of Minister Grobler and Mr. Werth with the people, we shall appoint someone to assist them, but whether it is necessary I cannot say at the moment. In the meantime the question of a consul is still pending, but I wish to say that a part of the money voted was, of course, spent in connection with the journey of Mr. Meyer. The distances are great, and he went all over to investigate conditions. But whether money is necessary depends upon the question how far it will be-necessary to send someone to assist the people-further.</p>

<p>How does the Minister come to get hold of so large a share of the reparation funds? I thought we in South Africa had not gone into the general pool, but we took the property of enemy subjects and out of the proceeds we were going to defray any claims for losses caused by the war, and that being so, we would not be entitled to a share in the general fund. What are we getting reparation money for? We have defrayed all the claims by our nationals for losses caused to them by war action on the part of the enemy, and we have also put &#x00A3;435,000 into our pockets. It seems a very profitable business. I wonder the Minister does not pay a dividend on the war.</p>

<p>We have not gone to the expense of instituting elaborate machinery for this purpose. Applicants have to fill up a form stating whether they took part in the war, and whether they had dependants who could reasonably be expected to contribute to their support. These forms are returned to the magistrate, who makes a report on them, and the Treasury decides what amount shall be paid. We have had complaints on previous occasions that we are not making these grants to old people with practically nothing, as they are supposed to have children who could contribute to their maintenance. The position we have taken up is a temporary measure to deal with urgent cases, but it is not a substitute for old age pensions. We are only dealing with the most urgent cases.</p>

<p>As I said at the commencement of the debate, we provided last year for about 15,000 Asiatics who, according to our ideas, would be repatriated as a result of the agreement with India. As a result, however, of the increased bonus and other steps taken, and the co-operation of the Indian Government the repatriation is progressing very well, so that although the agreement has only been in operation for six months, we shall find that about 3,000 Asiatics have been repatriated in the year.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am informed that some of these Indians after returning to India and receiving their monetary allowance there, make their way to Beira, thence into Rhodesia, where they watch their opportunity to come back to the Union over the Limpopo. If that is so, we shall be finding money for repatriating Indians for a considerable number of years. I would like to know if our money is being wasted in this way. Knowing the Indian as I do, I can say he is only excelled in ability to impersonate by the Chinaman. One would be delighted at the expenditure of this money if the Indian cannot get back, because it is <span class="col_1529-1530" refersTo="page_0831"/>economically cheaper in the long run to get rid of them than to have them here. We know the police force is inadequate, especially on the border, where they cannot properly patrol the whole area, and the repatriated Indians have only to watch for a chance to get back again into the Union after being paid to go home and to stay there.</p>

I have been told, and I should like to know if there is anything in it, that so far the overwhelming majority of these Indians who are availing themselves of these grants are old men and women who would probably have gone away in any case. They are now getting facilities, but so far as the Indian population competing in commerce and industry is concerned, I understand not many are availing themselves of the opportunity of getting away.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) as far as the type of Indian is concerned, who avails himself of the repatriation scheme, I can only say that not long ago it was reported to me that over 33 per cent. of the Indians going as repatriates are south African-born, and these are mostly minors. That shows those leaving the country go with a family. In any case, if anyone is paid a bonus now, he must take with him his whole family when he goes. What has been said, therefore, about those people availing themselves of the grant being old people, cannot be true. With regard to the numbers of those leaving, it has been stated that 3,000 is the number we estimate to leave during the coming year. That is not the case. I think the correct number of those who actually left in the past calendar year was over 3,200. That is 200 above the highest number ever reached before in spite of the fact that the agreement only came partially into operation on the 15th of August. I saw a report purporting to emanate from the emigration office in Durban that the number which left under the scheme during January was 699. I have not got the official report yet, but if that were so, it would be in agreement with the official figures I received towards the end of last year. The number of applicants wishing to leave under the scheme amounts to about 170 a week, working out at about 700 per month. If we get away 700 a month, then the number for the coming year would be about 8,000 instead of 3,000, which would be very satisfactory. The scheme during the latter part of last calendar month was only partially brought into operation because arrangements on the other side were not quite complete and therefore we have not felt to the fullest extent yet the effect of the arrangements the Government of India is making on the other side, and we expect it to increase in the course of the next few years. We have sent the commissioner for Asiatic affairs to look into those arrangements and to advise the Indian Government as to what steps should be taken. We know more or less what steps the Indian Government proposes to take, but they want expert advice. The question has been asked with regard to control of illicit entries into the Union, and whether that control is effective. Of course it has never been absolutely effective and it is difficult to see how it could be made absolutely effective. Illicit entries into the Union are found continually, but I have never heard any complaints of illicit entrance via Beira or Rhodesia. That would be difficult because the journey to be made would be a long one and expensive, and prohibited Indians going that way would be easily traced because the number of Indians in Rhodesia is very small and there is every reason to think Rhodesia will legislate on this question in much the same way as we have legislated in this country. If that were done it would be a protection for the Union against illicit entry that way. Complaints have been received that there are a good many illicit entries coming into the Union via Delagoa Bay. That is difficult to control. They leave by train for some places in Swaziland and then cross the Transvaal border, and most of them seem to settle in Cape Town or in the neighbourhood of Cape Town. Several cases have been brought to my notice where they have entered in that way, but there is one very important step that has been taken recently, or is being completed now, and that is to get the co-operation, the moral support, of the Indian community resident in South Africa against illicit entry into the country. I must say that, to a very large extent, we have succeeded, and are succeeding in getting the Indian community generally in this country to set their faces against illicit entry into the Union. If we completely succeed in that, as we have succeeded very largely so far, I think that would be a very important step in the right direction.</p>

<p>I will just reply to the best of my knowledge. The hon. member (Col.-Cdt. Collins) asks whether there is any fixed or maximum sum for a family.

If the hon. member will put a question on the paper, I can get the information and give it to him. In regard to the various classes of Indians leaving, that is a question that is continually asked, but I think I can inform the House that, while the number of those leaving under the old repatriation scheme was restricted or ly to the labouring classes, others are increasingly being included now in those who leave the country. One proof of that is the fact that from the Transvaal so many left the country under the repatriation scheme last year, I think to the number of about 1,000. The Transvaal Indians, as hon. members will know, belong mostly to the trading class.</p>

<p>Alexander Bay area is now a well-known area, and the Government propose, in the immediate future, to declare that area a State alluvial digging under section 75 of the new Act, and we propose employing a staff of about 60 people. It will have to be staffed, of course, on a comparatively small scale. If the diggings come up to their reputation, it would not require many people there to extract the abnormal, almost fabulous, wealth. We propose taking the great majority of these 60 or 70 people from people in Namaqualand. There are a large number of poor people there, and we intend giving them employment so far as these new diggings will give it.

<p>I hope the Minister will think very deeply over this question of starting this experiment of a State diggings. If it were something really important it might be justified, but he is going to lay down the precedent of a State digging without really achieving anything at present. I do not see in what way the 60 men you are going to employ there will be any relief of the distress or unemployment as it exists in Namaqualand or elsewhere in the Union. The only effect of this step will be to lay down a precedent of State diggings, and I am very much afraid that the Minister is making a small beginning of something which, in the end, may be a very serious business for this country, so I hope he will not start light-heartedly on this little experiment.</p>

<p>It looks very casual, judging from the Minister&#x2019;s attitude, and the scanty information he gave us. He seems to have been pushed by the hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. Mostert) into this thing. He is going to lay up for himself a rod in pickle, because he may be certain that the rest of the country will not agree to these State diggings being confined to men from one particular district of the Union. He will find that for the 60 friends he makes in Namaqualand, he will make 6,000 enemies elsewhere, and you will undoubtedly start an experiment which you will be pressed to follow up in other parts of the country. The Minister knows the parlous state of this whole diamond question, and he is now opening a loophole which, in the end, may become a very serious rent in the whole position. I hope he will consider the matter very seriously. He says this vote is for a few roads, but I would counsel the Minister very seriously to go slow with this thing. Why coniine it to Namaqualand? Why not the Witwatersrand? You see, you are simply opening a door and beginning a movement which you will perhaps not be able to control afterwards, and I would counsel very grave caution about this matter. The Minister seems to be acting in a very casual spirit, and most light-heartedly. It must be against every instinct of his own, and against the whole policy that he has been laying down in the diamond Act. I think it is a very dangerous thing. He may say the baby is a very small one, but it may grow up a giant. I hope he will think over very carefully this policy of employing 60 Namaqualanders. They are very deserving people, and I have every sympathy with the Namaqualanders, but you are going in for a principle as the result of which in the event of something rich being discovered in Lichtenburg tomorrow, Lichtenburg will say &#x201C;Not a single man from any district shall come in here.&#x201D; The Transvaal mines have been the magnet for everyone in South Africa, but if the Transvaal find they are being treated in this way they will say&#x2014;&#x201C;Very well, we will stick to our own. If we are to be excluded from Namaqualand, why should others not be excluded from Lichtenburg, or from Wolmaransstad, or any other place?&#x201D; You are starting a differential system here, a system of local favouritism, which no Government can carry through successfully. It must break down, and I hope the Minister, who has evidently been rather thoughtless in this matter and has probably been driven into it, will retrace his steps before it is too late.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that the leader of the Opposition is opposed to the Namaqualand diggings, and a State digging. He says that it is something new. Well, he himself wrote a book in which he says the world is progressing, and that we must not lose sight of it. In this case, too, we must bear things in mind. There are many necessitous people in Namaqualand. The people in there were oppressed under the former Government, who now come and say that we may not do anything for them. It is only in my constituency that the people are so patient. There is no doubt that the Government can make money by this venture. I can understand that the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) would like to make thousands of pounds out of it. His people have already come to Namaqualand, and I told them: You have already made thousands of pounds out of diamonds. They replied: Yes, but we want to make more. I do not know whether the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) employed the leader of the Opposition this afternoon as his agent. I believe the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) has already made enough money. The hon. leader of the Opposition must know that we have had no rain in Namaqualand since 1924, and that the people are having a very bad time. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) says he sympathizes with the people, but it seems to me he is lost to his people. Namaqualand will always be grateful to the Minister if he opens the diamond fields to them.</p>

<p>If the Minister had done something to secure the welfare of these people and to advance their prosperity, we would naturally claim credit for it. If his policy took that shape, he would be a most popular man on the diggings. I have here a letter just received from the secretary of the Diggers&#x2019; Union at Elandsputte on the Lichtenburg diggings which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">I have been extremely busy &#x2026; attending hundreds of cases of distress as a direct result of the tardiness of the Minister in throwing open new ground.</block>

<p>The amount provided&#x2014;&#x00A3;650 for relieving want and starvation, an increase of &#x00A3;450 on the year&#x2019;s original estimate&#x2014;is wretchedly inadequate. The writer of the letter is a prominent man, occupying a responsible position on the diggings. I want to remind the Minister of Mines and Industries, and the Minister of Finance also, of the half a million export duty which is directly derived from the product of these diggers. Every tax or other cost put on diamonds is paid by the consumer, but if the digger did not produce six millions a year, half a million of revenue would not accrue to the Government from that source, and this sum is irrespective of the considerable revenues received from licences and various other things. While the Government is thinking about further claim proclamations, and preparing for the lottery system, these unfortunate people cannot afford to wait&#x2014;they cannot smoke cigars and drink expensive wine whilst they are waiting, as the big producers can.</p>

The Minister says that he wants to start in a small way, and I think it will be wise to do so. The hon. member for Namaqualand said that there were very rich areas. That is right, but I also have a little experience of diamonds. It happens that you find a lot on one spot and on an adjacent one there is nothing.</p>

<p>I did not go to the Namaqualand diggings, but my children did. The hon. member for Namaqualand and the Namaqualanders will be glad if people go there, not to steal, but to assist the development. It is a mistake on the hon. members part if he wants to keep the diggings for merely a group of people. Then the country will not develop, but remain as it is. Why is the hon. member so afraid of people from outside? He does not want any strangers there, but I will tell him that I have already heard of his own people who are not satisfied with him because he will not give them a chance either. It is a dangerous experiment by the Minister. It has been said that few people succeed on the diggings. Now the Minister himself wants to control diggings. Is he not afraid of failure? Is it not dangerous for the State to make such an experiment? I have nothing against the Minister&#x2019;s trying to do good to the country. I know he is a sensible man and will take care it does not go too far. I am so tired now of the personal attacks of the hon. member about the interests I have in diamond digging that I say that it is only my children who are working in the Transvaal as honest diggers. It seems to me the mouth of the hon. member is watering, and that it is only that the grapes are sour. The hon. member for Barkly (Mr. W. B. de Villiers) also made remarks.</p>

<p>Then it is certainly also a shame to sell so much liquor in the Cape. I ask hon. members who make so many comments whether they would not also have bought claims if they had an opportunity. It is a wrong attitude for the hon. member for Namaqualand to take up, wanting to keep the diamonds only for Namaqualand people. Our view is that when such things are discovered they ought to be given freely to the people, and they <span class="col_1537-1538" refersTo="page_0835"/>should not be preserved. The hon. member for Namaqualand now wants to make State diggers of his constituents. Does he want to convert them into hirelings of the Government? It is quite wrong to take away all independence. The Minister and the hon. member will see that it will lead to many difficulties. Let us adopt a broad standpoint. Let the people who want to spend their money there, and run the risk of losing it, do so. I can assure hon. members that if such discoveries were made in Johannesburg I should have no objection to people coming from other parts of the country. Capital is required everywhere in South Africa, even in Namaqualand. The hon. member for Namaqualand wants to make his people slaves working for a fixed wage. I believe that the complaints about hunger and distress on the alluvial diggings are a bit exaggerated. There are indeed cases of distress, but there are also many people on the diggings who have become happy there. I do not agree with all this shouting about the diggings. On the other hand the Minister can always interfere, because, according to the Act which was forced through the House last year, he can do what he wishes. I know the Minister is sensible and will be careful, but he must not follow the hon. member for Namaqualand. As Providence has put those valuable things in the ground, we must develop them in some way or other. It was always the principle in South Africa to mine for minerals. I do not want to criticize the Minister for keeping the diamond fields closed, because I know it was necessary to regulate the trade. That will not always do though. It is also wrong that a man who does not wish to, can prevent digging taking place on his ground. Who will have to pay if the proposed State diggings are a failure? It will be the taxpayer of the country who will have to do so.</p>

<p>I just want to answer certain statements that have been made here. I think the Minister is acting rightly in seeing that the rich resources of our country do not go into the pockets of a small number of private individuals. Although my district is interested in the matter, I approve of the scheme of instituting State diggings to open up the wealth for the large mass of State citizens. I feel that it is not right that, as in the past 20 to 30 capitalists subscribe a sum of money and in that way cause the other farmers and diggers to get very little. Where it is true that great wealth exists in diamonds, it must not be allowed to a few private persons, but the mass of the diggers must have an opportunity. The objections of the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) are unsound. Let us try here to make a fresh start. A beginning must be made, and this is the opportunity. I feel it is not reasonable that the resources of our country discovered at a certain spot should be reserved for the population there.</p>

The hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay) is always condemning or making some sneering remarks at capitalists. In this, however, he is not doing any good either to the diamond industry or to the diggers. After all, who buy our diamonds? It is not the poor person, the carpenter, the bricklayer, the stonemason, or any other member of the working classes.

<p>I am afraid the remarks which have fallen from the hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris) may harden further the heart of the Minister, and he may not listen to the appeal to support the poor digger who is also providing precious stones for the aristocracy. Evidently my hon. friend is not up-to-date in the diamond trade. The great bulk of the diamonds are not purchased by wealthy capitalists. To-day the housemaid wants a diamond engagement ring, and generally gets it, jewelers guaranteeing the diamonds, saying that if they are not real the ring may be brought back and the money returned. Consider the large number of marriages which take place every month. There is an engagement for every marriage, and every girl expects a diamond ring, and that is what comprises a great part of the steady middle-class trade which the big capitalists do not want us to talk about. They always speak as if only extremely rich people buy these gems, but it is the steady demand I have suggested, throughout the world, that is depended on, and that output is steadily growing greater. The hon. member for Beaconsfield complains that whereas De Beers once supplied 80 per cent. of the gross output, that company is now cut down to a 30 per cent. quota; but he carefully refrains from explaining that the increased price of diamonds brings the value of that lessened quota to a higher sum than the previous percentage of the whole. The value of stones put out to-day by De Beers is greater than when they supplied 83 per cent. of the entire output.</p>

<p>I would like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the manner in which these figures in the vote are placed before the committee. We have &#x201C;district mining development, original estimate &#x00A3;4,000, revised estimate &#x00A3;6,500,&#x201D; an additional amount to be voted of &#x00A3;2,500. I do not think anyone in the committee suspected that under the words lay a proposal of first-class importance, namely the institution of State diamond diggings. In Vote 25, head 7 of the main estimates, there is district mining development &#x00A3;4,000 for 1927-&#x2019;28, and nothing whatever for the current year to which these estimates relate. The Minister has said this is only an instalment of the expenditure the Government will incur in starting the diggings. It is difficult to understand why, if the Government is going to start a large industry of this kind they have made no provision on the main estimates for the coming year. The additional expenditure for this year now expired is only &#x00A3;2,500 on to the &#x00A3;4,000, and nothing is said whatever on what that &#x00A3;4,000 has been spent. The Minister might say whether any part of this &#x00A3;4,000 has been spent on the encouragement of diamond diggings. What is it for&#x2014;&#x201C;district mining development?&#x201D; I thought when I saw it that it was something for the encouragement of mining in outside districts. We know that that course has been recommended by a very well-informed committee which was appointed by the Minister himself two years ago, and we had from the Minister, if I mistake not, various references to the possibilities of something being done to carry out some of the recommendations of that committee. Here we are brought up face to face with a sum of &#x00A3;2,500, which we are told is merely an instalment of an expenditure of which the limits are not hinted at even to us for starting a new policy of State diamond mining. Probably you would rule me out of order, Mr. Chairman, if I tried to discuss that policy. We discussed that in connection with the Precious Stones Bill some time ago. Personally I am entirely opposed to anything of this kind. It does seem to me that, apart from the question of the way in which these figures are presented to the committee, when the Minister passed his Precious Stones Bill, which was welcomed by people who are in a position to speak on the diamond trade, it was welcomed and passed through this House because it was recognized that the Government were going to do something to limit the production of diamonds, and thereby protect the whole diamond industry, on which the finance of this country so much depends. Now we are going to have a State diamond diggings started, apparently, and, as my right hon. friend said just now, if you are going to start it in one place, what is to prevent it being started in another? What is the policy of the Minister in starting these diggings? He says he is going to employ 60 men. If he is going to employ 60 men it is perfectly useless as a relief work. He might put them into some of these colonies which were to be established under the Bill passed last year. If this State digging is to be limited to the employment of 60 men from one district, it is not worth doing from the point of view of employment.</p>

<p>What is the object? If the object is not employment, but to produce as many diamonds as possible, the Minister is going back on his own policy and is going to initiate a policy which is going to do an infinite amount of harm. If he does mean to employ large numbers of people either here or in other places, and if he means to spend a lot of money on it, the only result will be that there will be a large increase in the production of diamonds and that is a thing which, by common consent, with the exception perhaps of the hon. member there, everybody in this House would deprecate.</p>

<p>I am sure my hon. friend will deal just now more fully with what the Government really intends here, and I am sure hon. members will see that the whole thing is justified in the interests of the State. I just want to refer to what the hon. member (Sir Drummond Chaplin) stated about making provision in the main estimates for this very important step which we are taking. The position simply is this, that when we framed the main estimates this matter had not been decided on, but the Government wants to undertake preliminary work and for this work we are taking a small sum here, and making provision in these additional estimates, but supplementary estimates will be introduced later on when the full provision for the Government&#x2019;s scheme can be debated. I am only sorry that I had not made a note of this, or in my opening remarks I would have drawn attention to the fact that we are embarking on this important step.</p>

<p>I am not surprised that the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) and the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) seem very perturbed at this experiment and at the important principle in respect of which this provision is made. I hope the Minister will really deal with the matter seriously. I agree with the right hon. member that once this principle is accepted it will be futile to say you are going to confine it to Namaqualand. The question of the right to work is a question which should be taken into consideration. I want to quote a statement on that question made by the Minister of Labour in a wire which he sent to &#x201C;Forward&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>

<block name="#quote">The only remedy for unemployment is work.</block>

<p>I am sure the Minister of Mines and Industries will accept the principle mentioned there and that instead of limiting it to 60 men in Namaqualand, he will say, &#x201C;We are starting this; we must use it as a means of providing work for hundreds of diggers who have been thrown out of work.&#x201D; The next point is: I would like to know whether in making this provision of &#x00A3;650 any estimate was made of whether this sum is going to cope with the distress on the diggings. In the light of the statements in the press and from hon. members in this House and the statement of the hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay) it is quite clear that to provide &#x00A3;650 to deal with distress on the diggings is really playing with the matter. It is not, in my opinion, a matter of any importance for the purposes of this vote as to whether this distress has been caused by the policy of the Minister or not. Because the Minister resents that suggestion. I think I might quote something else, because I do not think it is fair that the hon. member for Pretoria West should be alone blamed for that suggestion. I want to quote from the same wire from the Minister of Labour&#x2014;</p>

The item seems to me to be mis-described, and it ought to be&#x2014;&#x201C;district mining gambling.&#x201D; It seems to me that diamonds will be the ruin of the Minister as they have been that of many other people. In the previous sessions he has treated us to the nationalization of industries, and we have now got down to the nationalization of gambling. There will be no greater misfortune than there will be if this is successful. If it is not successful, &#x00A3;3,000 may be lost, but if it is successful, nothing will prevent the public from insisting on the Minister going on with these diamond ventures of his. The history of alluvial diamonds in this country does not lead us to suppose that in the long run people will be able to make a success of these alluvial diggings. I would like to go further and say that these deposits were discovered by private enterprise, and now they are going to be filched by the Government.</p>

Private persons peg these claims perfectly legitimately and are also going to be sequestrated. The whole scheme is bad and is a gamble; the Government is supporting the nationalization of a most unsatisfactory industry. I add my voice to those who have asked the Minister to pause before taking this step. If he does take it, it will be one of the most disastrous steps which this Ministry has ever taken, and they have already taken several disastrous steps.</p>

<p>For the life of me I cannot understand hon. members opposite endeavouring to impute improper motives. The trouble the Minister has brought upon himself is this&#x2014;that, instead of spending &#x00A3;10,000 every year on the construction and repair of roads, bridges, etc., in mining areas, he has failed to do so. This grant originally figured in the 1921 estimates under the heading of &#x201C;K&#x201D;. What I object to is that the Minister has not taken power to spend &#x00A3;10,000. This amount is due to the mining industry annually. The intention was to open up new mining areas. The sum of &#x00A3;10,000 has been on the estimates, but the mistake the Government made was in not spending the money on that development. I cannot see what hon. members opposite are making all this fuss about.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) does not understand what he is talking about. The vote we are discussing is for the purpose of starting a State diamond mine in Namaqualand. This is quite a new departure, as the country has never yet gone in for State mining, and the taxpayers should know the extremely important departure that is being made in policy. We have already embarked on iron and steel manufacturing, and now we are going in for State diamond mining. That is the reason we are discussing the matter. I understand the Minister intends to employ 60 men, but I doubt whether that will be sufficient if he wishes to give work to all the unemployed men in Namaqualand. If he does, his proposal to employ 60 men will be futile and childish. If the Minister starts diamond mining it will simply be the thin end of the wedge, and thousands of men from the drought-stricken districts will flock to Namaqualand. Will the Minister be able to resist the demands of these men to be employed? Drought now exists in an aggravated form in Ladismith, Calitzdorp, Oudtshoorn and Prince Albert districts. There are hundreds of men who want work, and why should they not be employed on these State mines in Namaqualand? It is futile and childish to say they are going to find work for 60 men. It cannot be done. This is an extremely important departure, and the Minister will find that his hands will be forced. My hon. friend behind has shown that you cannot confine it to 60 men. I should like to know what the Minister of Labour has got to say on the point. I am against the scheme entirely. I ask the Minister if he has really thought it out. Has he thought out the whole of the conditions that will arise out of this? I do not think he can have done so, otherwise he would fight shy of starting this State mining. It is a great blunder in which they are going to waste hundreds of thousands of pounds. I warn the Minister and the Prime Minister that they are taking a wrong step. I think we understand what the consequences will mean.</p>

<p>You shall have a full discussion on this question, I assure you. Before we embark on a fresh enterprise, committing the State to a new departure in policy, there should be a full report before the House telling us what the scheme it, what are its merits, who is to be employed, and who is to be in charge, the rates of pay, and the conditions of service. Why, we do not impose a new customs duty until we have had a report before us. This may be a small thing in its inception, but carried to its conclusion, it will be one of the biggest departures in this country, and yet we hear about it fortuitously in reply to a question put by the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin). Considering the importance of the question&#x2014;the State setting up as a diamond digger in this manner&#x2014;the House has reason to complain it has been badly treated by the Minister of Mines in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) for the extremely frank and clear way in which he put this particular question we are now discussing as it appears to him and his friends. I think we are indebted to him for telling us quite frankly that he regards this as the dawn of a new era, the era of State socialism in <span class="col_1545-1546" refersTo="page_0839"/>South Africa and more particularly State mining. He has always wanted the whole mining industry nationalized and he sees in this, quite rightly, too, the first instalment, the beginning of that policy and he naturally tells the Minister and tells us that he regards this as an extremely small instalment of what we may expect, but he hopes that this principle of State mining will be extended far and wide throughout South Africa. I do not share the views of the hon. member for Troyeville. I, personally, hope it will not get as far as that. May I say a word or two to my hon. friend, the member for Delarey (Mr. van Hees)? I want to hear what he has to say about this principle of Namaqualand diamonds for Namaqualand and Transvaal diamonds for South Africa. I want to know what he is going to say to his constituents when he goes back and tells them that because of the over-production of diamonds they are not to be allowed to dig, but the State itself is going to set the good example of curtailing diamond production throughout the Union by opening up State diamond fields in Namaqualand. Perhaps I might ask the hon. member if he is going to favour us with a word or two in this House on the vote of &#x00A3;650, benevolent grants to diggers. I see two hon. gentlemen sitting opposite to me representing the digger community in the Transvaal. Up to now we have not heard a word about diamonds from those two hon. gentlemen. The impression seems to be getting abroad that the Minister has put them over his knees and smacked them like naughty boys. The whole question of State mining has been investigated by a commission, and that commission reported in the strongest possible terms against the State ever embarking on State mines. Nothing more hazardous, nothing more foolish, could one possibly imagine. I thought we got some good, sound sense from the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) when he said that the worst thing that could happen to this country would be for this particular venture to prove a success. It is our duty to protest in the strongest possible terms against this particular proposal, and I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

In the gold law passed by the Leader of the Opposition, there is specific provision for the first time in the history of this country for State mining, and everyone knew at that time and everyone knows it now, that to have a State gold mine presupposes a capital of anything from a million and a half to three millions, and that years must pass before you reach the productive stage.

<p>No, it is not so. I said that we proposed employing 60 people and most of these people would be taken from Namaqualand. It would be the height of folly with 1,500 people in the state in which they are to-day in Namaqualand to transport from Lichtenburg and other parts of the Union only 60 workers at tremendous expense and inconvenience and to exclude people from Namaqualand. The Government has never at any time laid down that Namaqualand is to be a preserve or reserve for the Namaqualanders, and as to his chief accusation that I am being pushed by the hon. member for Namaqualand nothing is further from the truth. The hon. member for Namaqualand has consistently protested against the proclamation prohibiting prospecting in Namaqualand, and he has been consistently pressing us to give leave to farmers to prospect on their private farms. Both these requests have been refused consistently by the Government, so where I am being pushed by the hon. member I do not know. I do not allow myself to be pushed either by the Opposition or by my supporters when I feel I am right, and when I feel it is a case of two and two making four. Why was not the right hon. member vocal last year in the interests of Namaqualand and the interests of equality when we made the proclamation?

<p>That is not the point now. The hon. member has a wonderful aptitude for always missing the point. We do not propose excluding anybody from Namaqualand except in this initial stage when we require only 60 people. If, unfortunately, we find that we are restricted to these 60 people well then, of course, we cannot help it. I have never suggested that there should be State alluvial diggings for the relief of poor people or for relieving unemployment. I discussed this principle fully on the Bill last year. I pointed out the difference between the comparatively paltry cost of developing a State alluvial digging and, for instance, developing a State gold mine. Hon. members have such conveniently short memories. Did I not tell the House last year that without any comparative effort on the part of the Merensky people, they in six weeks with 18 men found no less than from &#x00A3;150,000 to &#x00A3;160,000 worth of diamonds, and if we, with 60 men in our employ start on a State diggings the great thing we shall have to guard against, perhaps, will be finding too many. As most of the diamonds are on the surface and can be hand picked, it would be the height of folly to leave them there in their natural condition. If you walk about there on a windy day you can pick out stones on the surface. It is of the greatest importance that the State should take charge of that ground and, at any rate, remove the diamonds than can be hand picked. What alternative is suggested? We have several wiseacres, among them the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). What alternative do they suggest? I defy them to suggest an alternative. I defy them to say that they contend we should throw Alexander Bay open to the public. Do they contend that? Do they contend on the other hand that we should leave this Crown land, this Eldorado which is unique in the history of this country, that we should leave it to anybody who pleases to trespass on Crown land and remove any diamonds they like? If they do not suggest that, what do they suggest? Do they suggest that the State should take out these wonderful riches and hand them over to the poor whites and make each one a capitalist? No, they have not the gumption to be able to suggest anything at all. Whatever their suggestion may be it will be as hopeless as their attempt to throw out this smoke screen. We intend to deal with Alexander Bay because it is something unparalelled in the history of the country. These stones are of particular value. There is said to be to-day a shortage of this class of stones in the market of the world. The State does not propose, for a moment, simply to win these diamonds and force them or off-load them on the market. The State can remove these diamonds, especially the lot that can be hand picked, and naturally the Government will have to use its judgment with regard to the state of the diamond market. With regard to these 100 discoverers&#x2019; claims&#x2014;as to the rest of Alexander Bay, I have no approximate idea of the number of claims, but I suppose they would be some thousands&#x2014;as to these 100 claims alone, it is calculated to take six months at least to remove the diamonds that can be hand picked. They are of extraordinary value, and as long as they remain there they are a danger, encourage people to come there and trespass, and to attempt to remove them surreptitiously and illicitly. Mr. Brink, whose name was mentioned last week, says that never in his 40 years&#x2019; experience has he seen stones like these. I wonder if hon. members visited the South-West offices when these stones were on exhibition? They were of extraordinary quality, and the average finds, as regards the major portion, were of big stones. If that is the case with only a portion of the hundred claims in the course of prospecting, what must you expect from the deliberate digging and winning of stones from all the rest of Alexander Bay, a considerable portion of which is considered by people who did the prospecting, as rich as, if not richer than, their own hundred claims? What are we to do with that? Do hon. members seriously suggest that we must simply stand by and let things drift? I now come to the reckless statement of the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) that I am, or the Government is, responsible for the suffering and misery on the diggings. I deny that absolutely. I answered that the other day in reply to a question, and do not intend to dwell at length on it again. I stated that we, as a Government, have continually warned people against going to Lichtenburg. I do not say that the Government is simply going coldly to stand by and see misery continue, but I agree with the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mr. Geldenhuys) that the condition is grossly exaggerated. For years and years we have had misery and suffering, just as there is in the slums of any big city. I go on the information of the mining commissioner, and I may tell hon. members that the present mining commissioner at Klerksdorp, Mr. Mathews, who has had much experience, is very popular amongst the diggers, knows their language and speaks to them in Afrikaans. He knows their wants, because of his large experience on the fields. You can go into the estimates for years past and you will find that this particular item&#x2014;benevolent and charity allowances&#x2014;has always been small. When people come to the mining commissioner for these grants they come in small numbers, and that is why it is difficult for me to accept the sweeping assertions that hunger is being suffered by thousands of people. The other day I pointed out that they had 36,000 natives in their employ. These people do not come to the mining commissioner and ask for bread. If they do, he deals with them. Pauper conditions are dealt with by, and pauperism is under the jurisdiction of, the Provincial Council.. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) let the cat out of the bag. He naturally wants to throw Namaqualand open to the whole world, and if that were done a fine state of affairs would ensue. Is that what the right hon. the Leader of the Opposition suggests? <span class="col_1549-1550" refersTo="page_0841"/>Is he, and is his party, prepared to throw Namaqualand open? What is the practical course they suggest? It is said we have dealt very badly with hon. members opposite by not taking them into our confidence sooner. I stated publicly what the position was, and if hon. members do not take notice of these utterances, I cannot help it. I made no secret of it. When the Bill was introduced and was before the House, it was known what extraordinary riches were at Alexander Bay. Did hon. members think that we would simply let it drift and do nothing? What was the intention of inserting Section 75 in the Act? The hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris) has suggested that we should control the production of Alexander Bay. Of course, that is what we are trying to arrange with these people in regard to their hundred claims, but it is absurd that the State should control its own production. It is ridiculous to suggest that the State, which has a revenue of at least &#x00A3;2,000,000 from diamonds, would spoil the market and off-load diamonds onto it. Of course, the matter would have cropped up in any case, and hon. members would have had an ample opportunity, as the Minister of Finance pointed out. We will have to come to the House for a considerable sum for these diggings.</p>

<p>It is needless for me to give the Minister the assurance that nothing was further from my mind than vote-catching, but one thing I grant him, and that is that not even his worst opponent will accuse him of vote-catching in the speech he has just made. If there is one man who has thrown thousands of votes away, it is the Minister with his mining policy and the way in which he stands by the small man. A very big principle is at stake. On this innocent little vote nothing was said at all by the Minister, and it was only through a casual question by the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) that we came on the track of this at all, and found that it was not the ordinary vote for roads in mining areas and the usual mining development, but it was the initiation of a new experiment in State mining. Naturally, as soon as we heard that we pricked up our ears, and tried to get information from the Minister in the most civil and best-tempered way possible.

<p>We will follow it up. The Minister is laying down a precedent which I for one will not be a party to. This experiment which is now being started in a small way may develop. As the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) has suggested, it is not a question of starting a small surface experiment with 60 Namaqualanders, but tomorrow it may be applied to other parts of the country, and logically it will be applied. The Minister will be forced to apply it elsewhere. I think we are starting on a course which has never been put into practice in this country before. The Minister may say this is a small thing. It is, however, undoubtedly the beginning of a very big business, and, although it may be a promising thing to-day, to-morrow the experiment may be tried under circumstances which will bring disaster to the State. There is another point. The Minister is going to mine in this area, instead of keeping it closed as hitherto, and no one has suffered from the embargo on mining he levied in that area. The Minister cannot, however, confine the mining to this particular spot. The result is that he must give the same opening to his friends next door who hold 100 claims. On what principle is he going to restrict mining to himself and his few friends next door? The whole thing is going to be looked upon as a case of favouritism. The Government starts with mining itself, it allows a few of its rich friends to work their claims, and nobody else gets a chance. It raises an amount of suspicion and prejudice, and not without reason, in the public mind, which no Government can withstand. The result of the Minister&#x2019;s course will be that the only people working in Namaqualand will be the Government and the syndicate, for everybody else is barred. I think that whatever view is taken of this matter, it is a disastrous experiment, a disastrous beginning in State socialism, and will expose the Ministers and the Government to very grave suspicion, and in the end they will regret it. I am going to vote against this. The Minister forced the clause through in that disastrous Bill of his which by this time he must bitterly regret, but now he is going to put some of the clauses into operation it is time for us to do whatever we can to put a stop to it.</p>

<p>I was going to tell the House what I was informed by the deputation on behalf of the Diggers&#x2019; Union. I was asked why I proposed to employ only 60 people. Obviously, owing to the fabulous richness of the ground, 60 diggers will be a very large number, and they will be able to find a very large number of diamonds, but, as a matter of <span class="col_1551-1552" refersTo="page_0842"/>fact, the deputation from Lichtenburg represented to me on behalf of the Diggers&#x2019; Union&#x2014;which is an organization of all the alluvial diggings&#x2014;that they objected to working for wages. What, then, is their grievance, if we employ 60 Namaqualanders? The Government will naturally see to it that these people are paid a very fair wage.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know the figures yet. I will give them later on when the scheme is worked out. You have no right to extort from me details of a scheme which has not been completed. We can adopt a general principle without having fixed all the details. These people of Lichtenburg don&#x2019;t want to earn wages, they want to be diggers, and that is characteristic of the average digger. I have had, I suppose, hundreds of applications from men to be taken on. At any rate, there are hundreds of people who would be willing to go there from all parts, but if the people of Lichtenburg as an organized body protest against any wages at all, surely I am entitled to say we can get the people in Namaqualand. There is no idea of laying down a hard and fast rule about it. The right hon. gentleman says this is the thin end of the wedge. On what principle does Re say that? We foreshadowed it when the Bill was under discussion, and I compared this proposal with that in the Transvaal Gold Law, and explained why no Government had ever acted on the provision in the latter measure, because it presupposed the investment of a very large capital, and you would have to work years before you came to the producing stage and, finally, it would be speculative. On the other hand, with the rich alluvial diggings your capital expenditure is insignificant, and if the thing is a failure, it will be a very small one. But we are assured, and we are fully convinced, that it will not be a failure. I said at the time the fixed policy of the Government was not to go in generally for State alluvial digging. That is the policy of the Government. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) says if you employ 60 you will be importuned by others and you may have to take on hundreds. That is an absurd argument. The Public Works Department carry out schemes and employ people, and if they have a scheme that employs 50 people, I have never heard it said that they have been importuned by hundreds of others to be taken on as well. As regards the rich friends, one of them is the right hon. member&#x2019;s own friend. These people are the discoverers, and the right hon. member knows well enough that we have power to limit their output. I explained the other day on the motion of the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) that you had an exceptional case in Namaqualand.</p>

<p>It is with fear and trembling one takes part in this debate after hearing the Minister. The Minister has developed the art of rudeness to a large extent, but I am glad that he did not succeed in &#x201C;putting it over us.&#x201D; We accept the word of the Minister of Finance that it was entirely an oversight, but for the Minister of Mines to let us vote for a new principle on a question of State mining without knowing we were voting money for it was rather thick. What did he say when the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) discovered this?&#x2014;and the House is indebted to him for the discovery&#x2014;the Minister said &#x201C;Yes, certainly we are going to have State mining. It was provided for, didn&#x2019;t you know?&#x201D; The Minister asked whether any of the members of the House had visited the South-West offices and seen these diamonds. Yes. I was one of the lucky ones; I saw these diamonds, and I have also visited Alexander Bay, and I have seen the condition of affairs there. I was received with courtesy, and I have looked over the ground, and I want to say this wonderful El Dorado has, I think, been painted optimistically. I was allowed to go everywhere, and I didn&#x2019;t see diamonds lying on the ground, and you are inclined to look when you are in such a rich area. As for just walking about and picking them up in the hundreds, the Minister is quite wrong if he thinks that will happen. He certainly led us to believe it was to be Namaqualand for Namaqualanders only, but when the hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) and the hon. member for Victoria West (Mr. du Toit) demurred, he, evidently in an aside, said &#x201C;No, it is not only to be Namaqualanders,&#x201D; and they appeared to be satisfied at once. That is not the main question. The main question is that of State mining pure and simple. I find it difficult to explain what one feels about this matter. If the framers of the original gold law, who put the clause in that the right of disposal of precious minerals and stones belongs to the State, were told to-day that is was going to be accepted as the right of the State, or the Government of the day, to take precious stones out for the benefit of the State chest, they would have been horrified. That was never the idea. What is going to help the nice district of the hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. Mostert) by the State employing, say, 100 officials and scraping out &#x00A3;50,000,000 worth of diamonds and locking them in the State chest, and just breaking the market whenever they want? Will that help better than by having a different system whereby the public would gain more benefit and the greater amount of money would be circulated? Certainly, the district will be better for it, as will the public of South Africa.</p>

<p>I never thought the Minister of Mines could be brought so far as to go into State mining, and as for the Minister of Finance, conservative as he is, for him to turn round and say he is going to have State mining in the country, well, I can only think that it is because he wants to see his surplus for next year. It is certain this year the revenue from diamonds has decreased. It is on the cards it will decrease much more next year, and it seems to me the Minister of Mines has got the consent of the Minister of Finance because they think that, by having State mining, they will get such an amount in the State chest, that it will enable them to keep things going. One cannot understand a conservative man, like the Minister of Finance, going in for State mining. The Minister of Mines says he has hundreds of applications from men wanting to take on the job. They are people of my own race, and I am the last man to throw aspersions, but you are only going to give them a small wage, and it will subject them to serious temptation. I do not know how you are going to control it. I hope the Minister has thought out a scheme. I certainly think he should hesitate before he submits people to that temptation which they are going to have on this Alexander Bay mine. The Minister tells us that we have got no right to extort any particulars from him. What right has he got to extort any vote from us when we have no particulars? Surely he has no right to extort a vote from us when we are entirely in the dark.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>We have had two speeches from the Minister of Mines and Industries since the 8 o&#x2019;clock resumption, and I think I may fairly describe them as truly characteristic of the Minister, because when he came to deal with the arguments which have been used on this side of the House, it was most interesting to note the various adjectives which he used. All these speeches were of course &#x201C;ridiculous,&#x201D; all were &#x201C;foolish,&#x201D; they were an attempt to &#x201C;extort&#x201D; from him information which he was not bound to give. I think hon. members opposite must have imagined themselves back in their own caucus. He told us, as a reason for this State mining scheme, that the Government have discovered an El Dorado and he painted us a picture of diamonds lying on the ground at Alexander Bay in such quantities that it was dangerous to allow anyone access to that area. I am much reminded of the Iron and Steel Bill. When that Bill came before the House, we were told about a mysterious report which no one had read and this House was invited to agree to an expenditure which might be four or five millions, although the evidence in support of the scheme was not before the House. If we were to ask ourselves, as a body of business men asked to embark upon this project, what information the Government had put before the House to justify it, we would have to say that there was nothing more except that in the judgment of the Minister it would prove to be an El Dorado. One stops to enquire how it is that in the year 1928 it has been suddenly discovered that this area at Alexander Bay is so fabulously wealthy. We know that in 1926 it was traversed by prospectors, and yet the Minister tells us that it is so rich that diamonds of extraordinary value can be found on the surface. I venture to say that the information of the Minister is not accurate and that he is confusing the information in regard to diamonds found at depth on the <span class="col_1555-1556" refersTo="page_0844"/>former ocean beaches. It is a fallacy to assume that merely by loosing 60 men on those fields the State will be in possession of millions of pounds&#x2019; worth of diamonds. That does not correspond with the information which is available, and it does not correspond with the information which the Minister put before the House when he was dealing with the Merensky claims lust year. On this Alexander Bay area mining, if once started, cannot be conducted at a uniform depth. I put it to the committee, in support of the view we have urged on this side, that the Government should go slowly before it embarks upon a venture of this nature. I would like to draw a parallel in the case of Pomona, In that particular case the language that was used in the preliminary stages in regard to the prospect of finding diamonds was quite as optimistic as that of the Minister. There were numerous people who believed that another Eldorado had been found. As a matter of fact that deposit did not maintain its richness for very long. It was found that a large amount of capital was required, and that to proceed with mining operations involved the employment of expensive machinery. Today that industry which is the nearest approach to what has been discovered at Alexander Bay can only exist by the use of expensive machinery and highly qualified staff and the other appurtenances of a regular diamond mine. If for a moment we consider the point of view that this should be a State digging, the Minister is proceeding in the very worst way in order to make it a success. He proposes by means of hand-picking to take out the eyes of the proposition, thus leaving ground of a lower grade for subsequent development. All we can do is to ensure that if the Minister is not prepared to be convinced he ought at least to make certain that the country has the fullest information as to the step he proposes to take, so that if it does prove to be a failure the responsibility can be assigned to the proper quarter. I fully endorse what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) said, that it was the clear duty of the Government to make clear to the committee what we were embarking on. I feel the Minister of Finance in inviting a fair and open discussion is doing justice not only to the House, but to the country, which is asked to take this novel step in diamond mining in the Cape Province. I want to make another point on the advisability of having State mining either in the Cape Province or elsewhere. I would first point out that when Parliament passed the Precious Stones Act it was laid down in Section 75 that it would be competent for the Governor-General to proclaim areas which should be mined or dug according to regulations. This House is not in possession of those regulations and it is entirely in the dark as to the methods by which this work was to be done. The Government might at least have framed their regulations and given us the opportunity of knowing just how the expenditure was to take place, and yet to-day we are asked to vote this money and to adopt this principle and we have not the slightest idea what are the regulations that are going to regulate the conduct of this venture. I would like to ask the Minister on what principle is he going to select the managers of this concern? Are these persons to be public servants? What is the nature of their employment and are they going to have pension rights? Are they going to be ensured continuity of employment and what exactly will be their position? [Time limit.]</p>

Let me assure him again the distress is very great. I will give the Minister two reasons that are the ordinary and natural outflow of this Act, which cannot be prevented. It is law.

<p>All Europeans&#x2014;at Lichtenburg. I wish to make this statement that probably not more than 7,000, 8,000 or 9,000 at the utmost of the men who hold claim licences are actually digging. This Lichtenburg area is the core of the whole distress. A digger always lives in a castle in the air. He believes that to-morrow he is going to strike it rich. They are men who are independent in their spirit and they are, on the whole, a very decent community. If you take a man who has been earning 5s. a day for years and you take a digger, the digger is much the better man. He is still a man who has not lost hope. They are charitable to one another and they assist one another. You have merchants and mechanics. The place consumes more petrol in a day than Johannesburg itself. The digger now is told&#x2014;and I am blaming him as much as anyone&#x2014;that he must ballot in future for his claims. He cannot participate in a ballot unless he has been for six months a bona fide digger. He is waiting. He will not forgo his chance of being a bona fide digger. He gets more and more into distress. I would urge the Minister again&#x2014;he has made a promise to the diggers&#x2019; committee&#x2014;that as soon as ground is thrown open to these people distress will be relieved almost immediately, and I also ask him not to inquire too closely whether a man has been a digger for six months or not. With regard to Namaqualand, I agree with the hon. member <span class="col_1557-1558" refersTo="page_0845"/>for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter) that I would like to have seen regulations and know exactly what is being done.

<p>What has Lichtenburg meant for this country? It has produced &#x00A3;6,000,000 worth of diamonds&#x2014;new money&#x2014;which is distributed immediately amongst this whole population. It is still to me a question whether a proper investigation should not be made&#x2014;a commission appointed&#x2014;not to inquire into the local position, but into the world position, to see whether we should say, &#x201C;Stop production.&#x201D; It would have been a far better principle if we had created machinery to control the sale of the alluvial diamonds, but allowed them to produce as much as they please and allowed them to build for themselves a fortune for the future. I was informed in October, 1926, when Mr. Joel urged the stopping of production in the Union, and that the Government, quite rightly, should take the necessary steps to control production, a company was registered in London to exploit alluvial diamonds in British Guiana. It means that our alluvial digger is restricted for a digger elsewhere. I do not say State mining is unjust, but there are radical differences between the State mining of diamonds and the State mining of gold. In regard to gold a large capital is required, but alluvial digging is essentially a thing the small man can exploit for his own benefit. At the present time there being such a large number of people on the diggings, the Government has been unwise in launching into the State taking up this thing without explaining exactly what the position is going to be. In the first rush these people did enormously well, and there was very little distress. A little over a year ago I dealt with the position, and then there were no hostels, schools, police. These things were remedied by the Government, which I thank very heartily for it, but now you come and put into operation a diamond policy which means a restricted output and you can only expect that some diggers are going to suffer. If you had allowed production you would not have seen the debacle we have seen. You have big people at the other end who can bully the Government. You make a market for the mine producers.</p>

<p>No, but you speak with more voices. Instead of attacking the Minister of Mines and Industries, I would be inclined to attack some of the other Ministers for not opening up the land. As far as this question is concerned, I think every hon. member will admit quite frankly that with regard to diamond diggings there is a tremendous amount of wasted energy. When one travels by train one sees ground turned up mile after mile, and what a difference there would be if, instead of this wasted energy, they could have cultivated 18 inches or two feet of that soil. This is not a question of party scores, but a serious matter. Here we have an industry which is not providing a permanent solution of the unemployment question, while the youth of the country reared on the diamond diggings find that their education is stopped and they cannot be turned into good citizens. These alluvial diamond diggings are really a blot on South Africa, They form a speculative industry, and we would be far better employed if we turned our attention to finding openings of a more permanent character for the unemployed, rather than discussing the opening of new diamond fields. I do not know anything about the manipulation of the diamond market, but we are met on the one side with the cry that we must restrict the production of diamonds in order to maintain the price, or else the industry will be ruined. On the other hand, we have a cry to open up more diamond fields in order to provide more employment. It is a most difficult position for any Minister, and I sympathize with the Minister of Mines. I was rather disappointed with the speeches of the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) and of the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Coulter), for, when asked what would be the best thing to do under the circumstances, they made no reply. I am sure that if any member could put forward some beneficial suggestion, <span class="col_1559-1560" refersTo="page_0846"/>the Minister of Mines would be prepared to consider it. Instead of doing that, the Opposition have merely raised the bogey of State enterprize. Although it may pay them to-day to try and frighten conservative people in the country districts with this bogey of State enterprize, there is no body of men in South Africa who have done more to foster municipal enterprize than hon. members on the Opposition side, for they were in control of the destinies of this country for many years when many municipal schemes for the supply of light, water and transport were brought into being. I take it that the right hon. member for Standerton and his party claim to stand for the best interests of the people, and that if there is anything that the State or municipalities can do to benefit the people they should do it. Private enterprize takes the plums of industry, but where there is no profit to be made out of an undertaking, hon. members opposite say that is a fit subject for the State to undertake. After taking the plums of private enterprize, they leave the State to perform essential services and to look after the unemployed and the unfit who have been broken on the wheel of private industry. When the Opposition were in power, they were in favour of municipal housing, because the people who were erecting houses realized that a large portion of the community was unable to pay what was called an economic rent. They were thus just as much guilty of instituting undertakings of a socialistic character as this Government may be when it employs a few men digging diamonds. The Opposition is merely vote-catching, because it has put forward no suggestions to improve the conditions of the diamond diggers or to help the men they are supposed to be fighting for.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OOST</person>:</from>

<p>In connection with the speech of the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) about the attitude of the Opposition on State mines, I should like to put one question to the hon. member for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins) as to how it is that, though they are now so opposed to State mines he and his party accepted section 1 of the Act. Section 1 says clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Subject to the provisions of this Act, the right of mining for and disposing of all precious stones is vested in the Crown.</block>

<p>This Clause 1 has been drawn in this form on the motion of the hon. member of the Opposition. But now that it comes to the application, very great principles are suddenly at stake. I congratulate hon. members opposite on their beginning to show anxiety about great principles, because there was a time when they regarded all principles as slippery stones, which one allowed easily to go through one&#x2019;s fingers. I am glad that they are at present however concerned about the maintenance of principles. Of course, Clause 75 provides quite clearly that the State has the right of establishing State mines, but it goes further. What did hon. members opposite do when they were in power? They leased mining ground. The step from leasing to personal work is very small. In the one case the hon. members did not dare to take it, and in the other the Minister tackles the bull by the horns and says that we must do it ourselves. There is no difference in principle. The Minister is in principle only following the example of the other side when in office. There is only a large difference, which is that members opposite threw the proceeds from the State mines into the barrels of the Greeks, into the bottomless pit, in other words used them for current expenditure, while the Minister of Finance said that he would use the money for redemption of debt, the debt made by hon. members opposite, the unproductive debt of &#x00A3;16,000,000. I hope the effort of the Minister in connection with State mines will be a success, and that it will be followed up, because I am convinced that the great wealth which Providence has given South Africa ought as much as possible to be developed by the representatives of the people, that is the Government as well, cheaply and as beneficially as possible. The wealth thereby obtained must be used for development, not only of agriculture, but also of actual industries, because the precious stones surely merely constitute unreal industries, and the actual industries must be developed with the gold from the mines. I have another question to ask the Minister in connection with Namaqualand. He said that 60 or 70 people would be taken from Namaqualand to collect the diamonds, but that in future he would not only open Namaqualand for Namaqualanders, but for all South Africans who can be considered for the purpose, and this is only right. Now I want to tell him that people have come to me and said that before this Act came into force they took out licences on Government ground, because Alexander Bay is just as much Government ground as that of East Rand, where gold-bearing ground is leased as I have explained. Now I understand that the people on Government ground took out licences and put in certain pegs before the Act came into force, but, owing to the general prohibition, are now prevented from prospecting. I understand that they are losing the money which they invested, and in some cases pegged off large areas. I think that this will not be right, from a viewpoint of justice, and I should like to know what the Minister&#x2019;s intention is with regard to these people. I understand most of them are from the Transvaal. I repeat that I think the step the Minister is taking in this extremely difficult question of the alluvial diggings will in any case receive the general approval of the people in future.</p>

<p>I want to continue what I was saying about the practical difficulties in the way of this project, and to question whether the fields are as fabulously rich as painted by the Minister. This land can be truthfully described as practically a desert. If 60 men are taken there with their guards and officials, <span class="col_1561-1562" refersTo="page_0847"/>the Government will be compelled to provide roads; the sum now under discussion is designed as a first contribution. Transport will have to be provided, housing is non-existent. Where is the water to come from, not only for working, but for human consumption? It cannot be piped from the Orange River, because for a considerable distance from the mouth it is brackish. The Government may have to erect condensing plants on the coast. The Minister talks very casually about these 60 men, but the number will grow enormously, and afterwards there will be a demand for continuance of operations to which the Government will be bound to respond. What is the demand of Lichtenburg to-day? The Government is being called upon to proclaim more land; the position will be the same in Namaqualand, where the demand will be for more men to be taken on. The Government should endeavour, as was done in South-West Africa, to prolong the life of these fields as long as possible and ensure for the people of Namaqualand steady employment with the possibility of farmers bringing their produce to any settlement that may be established, so that there shall be that long flow of prosperity which it would have been possible to secure at Lichtenburg if the Government had acted with common sense. If I was asked how to ensure it, I would say take advantage of your own section 74. Parliament has given that power to the Government because largely it had in mind these fields. It is described in the marginal note as an alternative method of disposing of alluvial claims. Power was given to the Government to lease claims.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>Then why did the Government last year claim and take a 50 per cent. share in mines on private property? I thought, according to the Government, that all precious stones in the Union belonged to the Government, whether on private land or on Crown land. They are reserved to the Government as its property. Surely the Minister is strangely inconsistent. The principle of allowing a fair share to the Crown exists here, and instead of the Government taking the risk and liability of mining themselves, they should have called for tenders. Parliament, by sub-section 6 of section 74, contemplated that tenders would be called for by the Mining Leases Board. Why not adopt the procedure which exists upon the Rand? If the areas have a certain commercial value, the Government would get full value, but the risk of loss would be thrown upon the private capitalist. It would have been quite possible for the Government to provide that labour conditions would be proper, and that workmen would be properly housed in every way. It could have secured the highest rate of return that calling for tenders would give it, and it could have taken by means of appropriate quotas steps so that the life of the fields could have been extended for 10 or 15 years. Before I sit down, may I ask the Minister of Mines and Industries another question? He has recently issued a proclamation which, although it is described as issued under section 7 of the Act, really because of its terms seems to be a proclamation which was issued under section 115. He has, by means of territorial restrictions, endeavoured, I think quite rightly, to restrict production in the interests of the whole country, but ho has told us to-day that so far as State mining is concerned they have millions of pounds worth of diamonds at the diggings, and as I gathered from him, their intention is to produce them as quickly as possible. Apparently he reserves the right to sell them when he may please. Are we to understand that the Government are going to ignore section 115, so far as that is concerned? I ask him to make a definite statement on this point. If we assume, for the moment, that the total available sales market is &#x00A3;12,000,000 per annum, and if it is necessary to have quotas for large alluvial producers, and there is a fixed quota for the mines, does the Minister propose to intrude on this allocation and, by selling as much as he may please from this supposedly rich Government digging, interfere with the quotas which have been allocated to the other producers, mines and alluvial diggers? I do think it is due to the diamond industry that a definite statement should be made on that point. I have risen to-night to support hon. members on this side of the House who have expressed their objection to the initiation of this principle of State mining. It could be described as socialism. I might even evoke a smile from the Minister of Defence if I said it was &#x201C;socialism in our time.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member does not yet know! I will tell the hon. member on an appropriate occasion, but I have not time now. May I say this, that the objection to State diggings or mining that is contemplated here is an objection which can be taken on broad business lines. This Parliament is asked to take the responsibility of giving this wide power to the Minister with no more information before it than this assurance that an El Dorado has been discovered. There are no reports from the Government mining engineer available, and no reports from mining experts are before the committee. I wonder if the Minister of Finance usually embarks upon projects with that light-heartedness. I wonder if he wishes this House to think that that is a proper course consistent <span class="col_1563-1564" refersTo="page_0848"/>with prudent financial procedure. And if the Minister of Mines and Industries continues to preserve a stony silence, I hope this debate will serve to show the country that here we have the Government again, as in the case of the Iron and Steel Bill, proposing to commit the State to a dangerous principle without proper and adequate information.</p>

<p>The hon. member (Mr. Coulter) was quite right in accusing me of smiling at some of his remarks. I think if he reads his own speech tomorrow, he will see that it is full of curious contradictions. At the end of his speech he was denouncing the Minister for not having made it quite clear that he was not going to flood the market with diamonds produced by the Government from these enormously rich diggings. At an early stage he was pointing out the inevitability of the Government losing a great deal of money over this enterprise. These are rather difficult things to reconcile. Then he said that this was a futile enterprise. Look at the enormous difficulties we were going to be landed in. Here was the Minister instituting a State digging on an enormous scale, of course, with 60 men, and when he has picked out the eyes of these diggings he will be forced to go on working because he cannot possibly drop the enterprise and put the men out of employment. As my hon. friend said some time ago, in another relation, really that applies to every bit of work the Public Works do. Having painted that sad picture, he proceeded to say that actually as a practical proposition you should use this deposit in order, really, to build up the prosperity of Namaqualand, and that if the organization would continue working in a steady way, producing diamonds at a steady rate from the diggings, at that rate according to the information we have of the wealth of these diggings, this enormous prosperity of Namaqualand could be extended in order to last ten or fifteen years.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>That is not at all the same kind of digging. At Luderitzbucht the mines have been going on for years. The hon. member says that the deposit at Alexander Bay must be the same thing, because it is an alluvial deposit. The alluvial diggings at Bloemhof, Christiana and all these places, obviously must then go on for years and years. The trouble is that the facts are against him, and these diggings do not go on for years. There are alluvial deposits and alluvial deposits, and from all our information these are not alluvial deposits that will take a large number of years to work out, and the information we have is that what there is of them is extremely rich. I would like to correct my hon. friend behind me (Mr. Oost) in quoting that first clause of the Diamond Act laying down that the right of disposal of precious stones belongs to the Crown. He is evidently taking hon. members opposite as quite serious in that view. What the hon. member told us was that the proper way to do it is, under Section 74, to lease it. The secret of the attitude of hon. members over there is that they would like to let it on lease for someone to make a good, big sum out of it. Members are fully aware that a valuable parcel of diamonds was found after a trivial amount of digging. I would like to see the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) with a bit of ground which is practically a treasure box leasing it out to someone. Cannot we also imagine the liberal way in which he would deal with it? He would say, &#x201C;It is a rich thing, we will call for tenders. Someone will make a good thing of it.&#x201D; If we had taken that course and let it out to tender, no-one would have been more denunciatory than the hon. member himself in pointing out that, in a proposition of this sort, no really scientific estimate can be made. He was one of the first to urge the protection of State interests.</p>

<p>The hon. member has probably never heard of that old adage that an ex-poacher makes a fair game-keeper. We have also sat on that side and we do not take hon. members&#x2019; criticism of this enterprize at all seriously. We know that if they were sitting in our places the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan), and the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) would never dream of leasing out what is practically a treasure chest on any sort of terms. They would say, &#x201C;It is too risky, we will work it ourselves.&#x201D; Parliament is rather like one of those fluids in regard to which one found in the early days of learning chemistry that looking at a vessel from one angle the fluid was one colour, and from another angle it was another colour. Hon. members, if they were over here, would regard this matter in a one-coloured way, and sitting over there they take the other coloured view. Let us deal with this thing seriously. I can only say our technical advisers advise us there is not the faintest risk of loss, and this is the best way in which we can deal with the matter. I simply ask hon. members to regard it in this way. They know perfectly well what the position is. I venture to say if they sat on this side of the House they would not dream of adopting the other two alternative methods, namely, throwing it open as a public diggings, or leasing it, but they would say, &#x201C;The best thing to do to avoid reasonable criticism is to take it in hand ourselves and get these diamonds out of the <span class="col_1565-1566" refersTo="page_0849"/>ground in safe deposit as early as we can.&#x201D; It is the common sense thing to do, and all this talk of the great principle of State mining makes me smile when one considers what an enormous piece of State mining it would be to dig out a few acres to a limited depth of alluvial deposit. I merely rose to point out the hopeless inconsistency of the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter) who first told us it was going to be a desperate failure and then chided the Minister for not guaranteeing the House that it was not going to flood the diamond market, flood the mines and flood the diggings.</p>

<p>I do not think we need deal at great length with the speech of the Minister of Defence, because it was merely a series of flippancies. Some of us do view this subject with rather more seriousness. May I say to the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) it does come strangely in these latter days to hear this party accused by a member of the Labour party of speaking with two voices. May I say to the Minister of Mines and Industries that if this discussion has been a somewhat full one, the sole person to blame for that is himself. This discussion arose because the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) asked him what was this innocent looking item of &#x00A3;2,500. Instead of getting up and giving the House a full explanation of the difficulties he had to confront and the solution he proposed to adopt, he said in the airiest possible manner, as if it were &#x201C;Pass the mustard,&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, that &#x00A3;2,500 is merely the preliminary expenditure before we open up the State alluvial diggings at Alexander Bay&#x201D;. He sat down as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world. He got up again at 8 o&#x2019;clock and, in an injured voice, gave us some of the details that he thought would justify that policy. He said he had made known his intentions in a speech at Graaff-Reinet. Most of us no doubt follow his speeches with passionate interest, but it is possible that some of us did not happen to see that declaration. I may be forgiven for suggesting that the fitting place for making statements of this nature is this House, however important Graaff-Reinet may be. If he had adopted that course from the outset, told us what the proposal was, what was involved and what the reasons were, he might have been spared some of the doubts, suspicions and questions that have been put upon him. In a voice ringing with righteous indignation he said: &#x201C;Have you any right to extort from me the details of a scheme I have not yet worked out?&#x201D; You could see the man was genuinely indignant that we should put this question, and yet he ignores the fact that we are asked to vote the preliminary money to launch a scheme which he has not yet worked out. We have the common sense right to expect from the Minister that on a new aspect of Government policy, whether right or wrong, he should fake the House into his full confidence. We might vote the preliminary money, and the Minister might find he is not yet able to work out this scheme of his, and the money would be wasted. Apparently all the Minister knows is that the diamonds are there. With regard to these 60 men, who are they going to be, how are they going to be recruited, and what control is there to be over them? As the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) has pointed out, no sum is down on the main estimates for this scheme. I gathered, in my innocence of local conditions from the Minister, that diamonds are growing there like mushrooms, that in the course of an afternoon&#x2019;s walk you can come back with a pocket full of gorgeous diamonds, and that it is highly dangerous to leave them there&#x2014;when tourists would make trips to Namaqualand and come back with their pockets full. We heard the real truth however from the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter), who has not been there, but is speaking from his experience and knowledge of the conditions, and from the hon. member for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins), who has been there. Why cannot the Minister leave matters in status quo until he has worked out a proper scheme, and he can come to this House and convince it of its merits? Alexander Bay has been known and Namaqualand has been populated for the last century, and I have not yet known of people walking away with pockets full of diamonds. The hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) says and I believe him&#x2014;that these diamonds are not found on top of the veld, but considerably below. How is the State going to control these 60 men? Surely a premium will be placed on dishonesty and I.D.B. To expect the State to get efficient winning and not to have a lot of diamonds sticking in the hands of these people, in the process, is absolutely chimerical. It is absolutely fantastic, and I do not know how it is going to succeed. That is why I will persist in my motion, because we are taking a leap in the dark. When the Minister has worked out a decent scheme, let him come back and ask for a sum of money. I can see the hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. Mostert) having a list, not of 60, but of 360 or 660 men for the Minister, all of them friends or constituents of his.</p>

I would even support balloting for farms.

<p>Although I am very largely interested in the diamond industry, I am not taking a very active part in the debate, because I fear that any long discussion on the subject would probably have a very bad effect on the diamond market. I do not blame the Minister of Mines, because certain statements with regard to the richness of Alexander Bay were absolutely dragged from him. I can say from my own knowledge that Alexander Bay is the richest diamond field ever discovered in this or any other country. The Minister of Mines said that the direct revenue received by the State from the diamond mines was about &#x00A3;2,000,000 annually. There is, however, in addition, the indirect revenue which is very considerable. Then there is South-West Africa which the Minister did not include in his calculations, but if through the reduced price of diamonds from South-West Africa, brought about by the unrestricted sale of diamonds from the alluvial diggings, the revenue of South-West Africa is adversely affected, the deficiency would have to be made good from the Union Exchequer. The Union derives in revenue from the diamond mines about 40 per cent. of the total profits. The Union has a larger revenue from diamonds than the De Beers Company. I think it is very important that the Government should maintain the healthy state of the diamond market. The De Beers Company, which sells less than 25 per cent. of the world&#x2019;s purchase of diamonds, control their output. The other companies also control their output. If these companies with a less interest in the industry than the Government has are controlling the sale of diamonds, it stands to reason that the Government with its larger interest should control the output over which it has control. The greatest safeguard I can see for the permanence, stability and maintenance of a great asset is that the Government should exercise strict control over the mines and alluvial fields. We don&#x2019;t object because the mines practically control their own output. The chairman of De Beers, speaking at the annual meeting of that company in December last, in the course of his speech said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The discovery of rich alluvial fields in Lichtenburg has materially affected the four big diamond mining companies. Before diamonds were produced from that district the output from alluvial diggings for the ten years ended 31st December, 1926, averaged &#x00A3;1,854,550 per annum. For the twelve months ended 30th September last the total value of alluvial diamonds amounted to &#x00A3;6,258,300. For the two-and-a-half years ended 31st December, 1926, before the increased production had made itself felt in the trade, the total output by the four big producers&#x2014;De Beers, South-West Africa, Premier and Jagersfontein&#x2014;amounted in the aggregate to &#x00A3;23,057,000, an average of &#x00A3;9,222,800 per annum. Basing an estimate on the diamonds delivered to the syndicate by the four big mining companies from the 1st January last to the end of November, I am not far wrong in saying that for the 18 months ending 30th June, 1928, the deliveries will not exceed &#x00A3;9,600,000, an average of &#x00A3;6,400,000 per annum. We cannot continue decreasing our output to meet the enormous finds of the alluvial diggers who produce diamonds as rapidly as possible, and throw them on the market within a few days of their being unearthed, regardless of the effect on the whole industry and the mining market generally. If the big diamond companies adopted the same policy there would be such fall in prices that very few diggers would be able to work. Up to now the alluvial production has been uncontrolled and unchecked, but under Clause 115 of the Precious Stones Act the Government is empowered to limit the maximum quantity in value of any precious stone which may, during any period defined in any proclamation or regulation, be recovered from alluvial or disposed of after being so discovered. To meet the new situation the four big mining companies have generously and sympathetically reduced their sales at the late of &#x00A3;2,800,000 per annum, approximately about one-third of their normal deliveries to the syndicate, while the alluvial diggers have increased their production by over 237 per cent.</block>

<p>This is reliable and proves the absolute necessity in the interests of revenue and of the industry itself for the Government to take control, because control has passed away from De Beers to the Government, and it is the Government&#x2019;s bounden duty, and I do not care what is said on this side of the House, to control the output or diamonds in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>It is regrettable to notice the difference of opinion between the Minister of Finance and the hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. Mostert). The Minister of Finance assured us it was not a question of principle. It was a nice fat nest-egg belonging to the Crown, and they were going to keep it. The Minister indicated that the excuse was the same old one, only a little one, only about 60 men, but the authority behind says it is not a question of the 60 men, but a question of a great principle behind it all. If it is such a great treasure trove, why is it this wonderful plan of the Government was so successfully disguised in the item as it appears on the vote? I propose to vote for the deletion of the clause on three grounds. One, because it is the embodiment of the principle of State mining; two, because of the disguised form it has been brought before the House; and three, very definitely the deliberate refusal of the Minister to give us the information we, as a House, are entitled to.</p>

<p>The Minister admitted that the scheme, if not addled, was not yet fertilized. He took up the attitude that he would not have information extorted out of him. If that is to be the attitude of Ministers of the House then it is time we, in the House, made a definite stand and protested against that attitude adopted by one or two Ministers and condoned by the others. The Ministers must share responsibilities. The objection to the item, revealed as a result of this accidental discovery, is that behind the item is an important and big principle. The objection is that you are going to commit yourself to an unknown expenditure, and we do not know where it is going to end, and you also commit yourself to the establishment of a. State-aided staff of some kind or other. The Minister waxes wrath about 60 men giving all this trouble, but don&#x2019;t we remember the candid confessions of the Minister of Agriculture and others about the thousands of applications that came to them for employment in the Department of Agriculture? Have we not had equally candid revelations in the last few days, of the way people try to get jobs? When we open up a business of this kind we let ourselves into the same kind of difficulty and danger that we have repeatedly experienced for the last two years. I, for one, vote against it largely on that ground. I vote against it also on the ground of the fact that it has come before the House in such a wholly improper manner, because the Government and the Minister have no right whatever to get a vote from the House unless the House knows and is given an indication in the form of the Vote what the money is to be obtained for. I protest most strongly against this procedure being adopted, and I protest most strongly of all against the attitude of the Minister in refusing to give information. I again repeat my surprise that the Minister of Finance should condone, to the extent even that the Government has condoned, this way of getting money from the House. The Minister of Finance kept on repeating one point and that was that these stones on these fields are all the property of the Crown. If you carry that argument out logically, then you are going to extend it to the principle of prohibiting all leasing, all prospecting on Crown lands, and the Government will enter seriously into the business of State mining on all Crown lands because all minerals and precious stones on Crown lands belong to the Crown. Then you go one step further and you have the same argument applied to all lands where the rights to precious stones are reserved to the Crown. It seems to me that the Minister of Finance, in his anxiety to cover a departure, because it is a serious departure from his previous views on the subject of State enterprise, has made use of one of the weakest arguments that I have ever heard fall from his lips. It is a wholly illogical argument, and it is not consistent with the line which he generally takes in this House.</p>

<p>I certainly very much regret that the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) has given as one of the reasons for his opposition to this item the fact that the Government has disguised it and so tried to get the money out of the House. I explained the matter this afternoon and I thought every member of this House had accepted the explanation which I gave. It is not sufficient for the hon. member for Rondebosch, and I want now to repeat it. I told the committee that when my colleague approached me for the necessary money to defray the preliminary expenses of this scheme, I informed him that I thought it was a very important principle and that we should not get the Governor-General&#x2019;s warrant for the expenditure until the principle had been affirmed by the House. The amount was put on the estimates in the manner that it has been put on because we have an item in the Mines Department for district development. That is the appropriate place. I told the House this afternoon that, unfortunately, when <span class="col_1571-1572" refersTo="page_0852"/>I explained at very great length, as hon. members will admit, all the various votes, it had escaped my attention at the time that in this vote we are making provision for carrying out these operations. Otherwise, I would certainly have drawn the attention of the House to it and explained it at the time. When the matter was raised by the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin), the Minister of Mines at once told the House what it was for. There was no idea at all of concealing or disguising the vote. I do not think the hon. member for Rondebosch is fair in basing his opposition to this vote on the ground that we have decided to obtain the necessary money by a method of concealment or disguise. He says that I have departed from a principle for which I have always stood, and that is my opposition to certain State enterprises. I have not departed from that at all, but we must deal with important matters like this in a practical manner. The Minister of Mines has informed the House that you have at that particular spot practically an El Dorado. The information we have is of such a nature that it would be foolish, and the Government would be lacking in its duty if they dealt with this matter in any other way. Are hon. members really serious when they suggest that we should either throw open Alexander Bay or that we should part with a valuable State asset by leasing it to other people? Why should we go and share this very valuable asset of the Government with anyone else in the country. The Minister has informed the House it would be very difficult to calculate on a scientific basis what it would yield, and therefore it is almost impossible to tender on a basis which would be fair to the Government, to the State and to the person exploiting the proposition. It is for that reason you can be certain if it were put out to tender the Government would suffer. Here we are taking practically no risks. For the expenditure of a comparatively small sum the State is going to have whatever riches are in the ground at Alexander Bay. Now to try and frighten us with the bogey of State enterprise and State mining&#x2014;well, that won&#x2019;t hold water with people at all. The Minister was right when he said if we try to deal with it in any other way, we should lay ourselves open to the attack from the other side of the House that we were neglecting the interests of the State and parting with a very valuable asset. For that reason, I wholeheartedly support the policy the Minister proposes to follow. It is the intention of the Government to devote whatever profits are derived from this venture to capital account.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>There is one phase of the question which has not been touched on and it is very important. I have here the record of the recent registration in Pretoria of an Anglo-American flotation with a capital of &#x00A3;405,000. It has acquired properties in the rich area of Namaqualand and is to work diamonds, gold, copper and so on. I ask the Minister what is he going to do in regard to that company. Is he going to proclaim the new area for the promoters? If so, what about limitation of output and overproduction? We are faced with the suggestion that there is danger of over-flooding the market with this article of luxury and that there will be general depreciation in its value. I do not think the position calls for an alarmist view of that kind. The market is not likely to be flooded, because all are agreed that control is necessary. In this chaotic condition of the industry we are fast getting into the sentiment of the country outside that there is an undue preference in favour of the big producers and the diggers are to be sacrificed to the big interests. That is going to be the trouble. It is not really a question of how much for &#x201C;alluvial&#x201D; and how much for mines, as it is of how much for &#x201C;diggers&#x201D; and how much for the mines and company producers. There is the West African territory. That is alluvial. There is Namaqualand now, and that is also alluvial. Big producers in alluvial areas must be included with mining companies and be allocated a quarter in the half total output. What the diggers want is quite a fair thing. They say share it fairly; do not give the preponderance of output to people who control. They do not make the demand; the consumer makes that. All they do is simply to feed the market with what it wants. Most remarkably extravagant statements are made of capital invested in diamonds by buyers and that is one reason why the diggers press for an enquiry, and will press for it until they get it. We need an independent commission to go into the whole thing, and to see what can be believed and what cannot. A recent paper states that &#x201C;it is reported that the diamond syndicate has about ten millions worth of inferior diamonds unsold.&#x2019;&#x201D; A local paper yesterday said it had been three millions, and now it is one and a half. Sometimes they say fifteen or fifty millions, but this is camouflage&#x2014;because they do not over produce. We know as far as the Premier Mine is concerned the big interests have made an attack on that and persuaded the Government, who are partners, to draw &#x00A3;100,000, and give that company&#x2019;s allocation quota for six months to De Beers&#x2014;a very profitable transaction indeed to these people, this company&#x2019;s shareholders. A financial paper says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">All the Premier Company&#x2019;s deferred shares are now held by the De Beers Consolidated mines; they carry the entire voting power. It is felt that local people have not been getting a fair deal and that those who represent only the big interests have the ear of the Government; that they will secure more than 50 per cent. of the output, and that the diggers will be squeezed out. The Government are now going to open claims in Namaqualand, and evidently to allow an entirely new company to get to active work. Is the Minister going to allow this new company (which is said to have three millions worth of diamonds proved) to add to the normal output? What is going to be the future of the diggers&#x2019; industry which has lasted for 57 years? Is the digger going to get a fair deal or not? <span class="col_1573-1574" refersTo="page_0853"/>These people cannot disappear; there is no outside work offering for them.</block>

<p>I can see that the Minister is going to increase the number of diggers in Namaqualand, and to allow this company too, apart from the existing diggers. Where are we going to? At present the national asset is in the hands of overseas people who seem to have no interest whatever in it except to extract all they can. The Minister told us that he was ready to take evidence from anybody. Well, let it be before a commission. There is not a Minister who has been in one of our local diamond cutting factories.

<p>I still contend that the proper place to raise this matter was on the Precious Stones Act. The Opposition tells us that this question of Government diamond mining is a new idea suddenly sprung on us, but last year the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) voted for it. Clause 75 of the Act states that the Governor-General may proclaim land or any unalienated Crown land, a State mine or alluvial diggings.</p>

<p>The Government showed that an alternative scheme was at the back of its head. There was no word of criticism last session because the Bill was to satisfy the hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris) and the gentlemen behind him, who were out for control. The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Coulter) seems to have the idea that every alluvial field is identical. The difference, however, is this, whereas at Pomona you have diamonds to the carat, at Alexander Bay you have carats to the diamond. In the latter case you have a very rich alluvial area, and in the former a very low grade area. The two places are entirely different. Up to the present the diamond output has been most effectively controlled by the sales. We are now launching out on a new principle of controlling diamonds through the producer. That is where the trouble lies, and that is where the Minister is getting into deep water. He has fallen foul of the hon. member for Delaray (Mr. van Hees) and others, because we are introducing new machinery to control diamond production in its stages of production. The hon. member for Beaconsfield told us that the producers have voluntarily agreed to restrict the output, but there has never been any attempt to say that the companies are prohibited from producing at the mines. We are shifting control on to production and preventing the alluvial digger, with all his troubles, from producing. I have had this opinion that when we introduced a control Bill we gave the Government all the necessary machinery for control. After finding all these rich fields in Namaqualand and Lichtenburg all the Government had to do was to delete Clause 20 of the Diamond Control Bill and then the Government had all the machinery necessary for complete control of the alluvial diggings as well ready. The danger of the present time is the launching into these deep waters, not knowing where we shall land. We have been landed into the question of knowing how to get rid of rich claims we have found in Namaqualand. I can understand people are &#x201C;licking their chops&#x201D; and they are feeling sorry that these good things are going by the board. In finding a solution we have either to control the sale of diamonds from South Africa, or we have to control it at its production at its source. By trying both it will land us into the trouble the Minister is already beginning to reap. The Minister of Finance told us that it was the intention to devote the proceeds of these rich finds in Namaqualand to revenue.</p>

<p>Yes, to capital, but the danger we have is not from the Namaqualand output, but from the poor stuff being produced in Lichtenburg and Premier. That is causing the trouble in the diamond market at the present time. What I wanted to suggest is that if the Government is going to derive a large revenue from these high grade stones in Namaqualand, then why not take the low grade stuff, bort, which is about 5s. at the present time, but I think it has gone up within the last few days to somewhere about 10s., the stuff we call rubbish, turn it into ebrasive, grind it down, and let it go out of South Africa and use the sales of the high quality stones from Namaqualand to buy a large amount of this poor stuff up and take it off the market.</p>
