<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>During the debate on the second reading, of this Bill I was rather severely attacked in reference to the matter of changing the electrification between Pietermaritzburg and Durban to the northern section, that is to say from Pietermaritzburg to Glencoe Junction. Unfortunately, as I had already spoken in that debate, I had not an opportunity of replying, and now I take the first opportunity of saying a few words in regard to this matter. I wish to say at once that I take the sole responsibility for making that change in regard to the part of the line which was to be electrified. When I came into office I stopped the going on with the electrification of the line between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, and sanctioned the electrification of the line northward.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>It had not really been started. No money had been spent so far as concerns the starting of that work. Let me say at once that I have never yet seen any reason to regret that decision. I believe to-day, as I believed then, that I acted in the interests of the country, and in the interests of the railway department in the change that I then made. It has been said that I did it off my own bat, as it were, and did not consult the Railway Board and the general manager of railways. I do not pretend to know the exact time when I may have consulted the board and the general manager, but I was in the closest possible touch, in fact, during the whole time I was in office, with the Railway Board, and there was not a day passed when we had not a consultation on some matter or other, and I have not the remotest shadow of a doubt, in my own mind, that I consulted with them. I have here also the report of the Railway Board dated 31st December, 1921, addressed to the Minister of Railways and Harbours, in which they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the instructions of the board the general manager and the consulting engineers <span class="col_1451-1452" refersTo="page_0795"/>have submitted reports dated November, 1921, dealing specifically with the electrification of the section of the Natal main line between Pietermaritzburg and Glencoe Junction, on the basis of a carrying capacity for general traffic of 30,000 tons gross, as against 20,000 tons gross on which the engineers had previously been ordered to report. In submitting these reports the board is of opinion that the recommendations contained therein should be carried out.</block>

<p>I adopted what I believed was the best plan. If it did cost a little more time it was for the benefit of the country and of the Railway Department. What does the general manager himself say at the same time? I have also a report from him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The traffic on the Natal main line has expanded and we have reached the stage when to provide for its continued development and progress we must either electrify the line north of Pietermaritzburg or else employ a heavy capital outlay in doubling the line.</block>

<p>That deals with the question of whether I did not consult either the board or the general manager. What was the position about that time, September, 1921. We were then very hard pressed to get the traffic down from the north, south towards Durban. Where there was most congestion was in that section of the line from Glencoe Junction right down to Pietermaritzburg. Not only that, but the traffic on the Natal line was rapidly increasing. When Merz and McLellan&#x2019;s first report was put up, in June, 1919, we were carrying about 13,000 tons per diem. In 1921, we were carrying some days, I do not say on the average, 18,370 tons a day, and there was every sign of this going on. It was obvious that we must have increased facilities. As the general manager points out you could get these facilities best through electrification. What was the position south of Pietermaritzburg, the line between Pietermaritzburg and Durban? We had doubled that line. There were two lines running between Pietermaritzburg and Durban at that particular time. One had just been opened. I think it cost about £800,000. We could carry all the traffic that came along, so there was no necessity to electrify that line, but there was a very pressing necessity as these reports show, for electrifying the line north of Pietermaritzburg. Therefore it appeared to me, as I believe it will appear to most hon. members when they know the facts, merely ordinary commonsense that we wanted further facilities not south of Pietermaritzburg but north of Pietermaritzburg, on that section of the line which was so congested between Pietermaritzburg and Glencoe. As a matter of fact, that was the opinion of the board, as I have already shown from their letter. It was also the opinion of the general manager, and it was the opinion at that time of the consulting engineers, Messrs. Merz and McLellan, because what do they say?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In accordance with your instructions we have re-examined the question of electrifying the Natal main line between Durban and Glencoe, taking into consideration the altered circumstances which have arisen since the preparation and completion of our original report in June, 1919. We now submit the result of our investigation. In our original report the calculations and estimates relating to the electrification of the Natal main line were based on the assumption that the traffic to be dealt with would be not more than 20,000 gross tons per day in the down direction. We understand that since our report was submitted the traffic has practically reached the figure mentioned and there is every reason to suppose that in the next year or two the traffic will have increased still further provided the necessary facilities are provided. It is recognized, however, that if a greater traffic has to be dealt with the capacity of the line must be increased by one way or another. Two alternatives present themselves, namely to add sufficient traction where necessary or by increasing the capacity of the existing line by electrification.</block>

<p>A little later on they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our experiences prove that where electric operations is once introduced the advantages arising therefrom are such that the use of electricity is extended as a matter of course. For this reason we are convinced that the electrification of the Natal main line would be fully justified.</block>

<p>So they recommended electrification in preference to doubling the line. Would any fair-minded man occupying the position we did at that time not have done exactly the same as I did or as the Government of the day did? They state it is no use going on with the line in the south, but we must give facilities north of Pietermaritzburg when rapidly increasing traffic was coming along, I do not see how it was possible, applying ordinary commonsense to it, to come to any other conclusion. It has been suggested that we might have doubled the line north of Pietermaritzburg instead of electrifying it. That was very carefully considered. Here is what the general manager says on that very point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under steam working a double track would be necessary, at least two sections would have to be doubled. The doubling of the track north of Pietermaritzburg would enormously increase the capacity of the line, but is not a remedy for present-day difficulties in Natal.</block>

<p>The recommendation of the general manager himself was against doubling the line. I say quite advisedly it was discussed, and at one time I was in favour of doubling the line, but electrification was going to give us far and away better results. In the same report in Table 8 we have the financial results of electrification. It was estimated that the actual working expenses with steam were £577,000 and with electrical working £339,000, or an annual saving of £237,000. That was in the report of Messrs. Merz and McLellan. Under those circumstances, how could a man decide otherwise <span class="col_1453-1454" refersTo="page_0796"/>than decide for electrification as against doubling the line. Another charge has been mentioned this afternoon by the hon. member for Germiston (Mr. G. Brown) and that is that we did not give sufficient time to the engineers to prepare their plans, and hence mistakes were made. Let me point out, in the first place, that in the first report dated June, 1919, it was not a question merely of the survey by the consulting engineers of the line between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, but of the whole line between Durban and Glencoe, which was surveyed, and the estimates were given for working that line, as shown in Tables 5 and 6&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general outlay on the electrification, Durban to Glencoe, is £3,374,000. The financial results of the electrification, Durban to Glencoe, are a profit of £388.000 or 40 per cent.</block>

<p>The essential difference was that the first survey was made on the basis of 20,000 tons per diem. We wanted a survey made from Pietermaritzburg north to Glencoe on the basis of carrying 30,000 tons per diem, which is a very material difference; and Messrs. Merz and McLellan sent Mr. Lydell to prepare estimates at once on that basis. I have no recollection whether we told him to hurry up. I do not know, I frankly admit at once. It must be remembered it was a little over five years ago. The only reference to time I find here is on page 10&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is mainly owing to these gentlemen (Messrs. Titren, Watermeyer, MacCoombe, and Cheadle) working at high pressure, that it was possible to have this report prepared in the shortest time possible.</block>

<p>This does indicate that he was pressed for time. I cannot imagine that Mr. Lydell, who was a very qualified engineer, did not insist on taking ample time to arrive at correct estimates. He knew his reputation and his firm&#x2019;s reputation, which is world-wide, was involved in this, and besides, he had the foundation laid in the previous report. He had the report dealing with the line from Durban to Glencoe to go upon. He acknowledged assistance from men who are amongst the leading men on the railways&#x2014;Mr. Titren, now superintendent of motive power, Mr. Watermeyer, now in charge of the electrification on the Wynberg line, Mr. MacCoombe, now the secretary of the Electricity Board, and Mr. Cheadle, operating superintendent on the line itself. It is his own fault entirely if he did not get sufficient time, and I do not see how that explanation can carry any weight,</p>

<p>I have never heard any complaint from him about the time. Under those circumstances I venture to think that no blame attaches to the then Government from that point of view. I have endeavoured to put before the House the clearest and frankest explanation of what took place, and if hon. members will look at the reports they will see such is the case. In conclusion I would like to assert this quite clearly and frankly&#x2014;this alternative was not hurriedly adopted, but carefully considered. Although I do not recollect a specific consultation with the board on the matter, knowing the close terms on which I worked with the board&#x2014;sometimes I saw the board twice a day&#x2014;I cannot conceive that in giving the fullest and frankest consideration to the whole thing a consultation did not take place. In addition, this alteration was concurred in both by the Railway Board, by the general manager and the consulting engineers. In the circumstances, we were more than justified in taking this up.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SNOW</person>:</from>

<p>After the speech of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) it is only fair that the House should be informed that the Select Committee on railways, but for a concession it made to the S.A. party, would have inserted a paragraph in the report condemning the action of the ex-Minister of Railways on electrification. However, after our experience we shall not be sportsmen enough to do that another time.</p>

<p>Who says you&#x2019;re sportsmen?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#snow">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SNOW</person>:</from>

<p>I respect that after the way in which the S.A. party has abused our sportsmanship we shall see that this does not occur again so far as the railway committee is concerned. Out of consideration for the feelings of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) no paragraph appeared in the report condemning his autocratic action. I did expect that the hon. member would stand up and attempt to defend his action which is indefensible. Sir William Hoy and Mr. More were dead against electrification at the start. If hon. members want any further information on the subject they should refer to the report of the Select Committee which states that in 1921 the Government decided to abandon the Durban-Pietermaritzburg scheme altogether and instead decided to electrify the Pietermaritzburg-Glencoe section. In the taking of evidence a difference arose as to the authority for departing from the original plan to electrify the Durban-Pietermaritzburg section to the present electrification of the Pietersmaritzburg Glencoe section of the Natal line. The general manager&#x2019;s evidence on this matter is contained in questions 1352 to 1360 and 3597 to 3599. I asked Sir William Hoy in question 1352, who expressed regret that &#x201C;the Minister proceeded somewhat precipitately,&#x201D; whether that meant that he went against the wishes of the Railway Board and the witness, and took entire responsibility for prematurely embarking on the scheme. Sir William Hoy, in the course of his reply said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He informed the railway commissioners and myself that he had practically decided to postpone electrification and at a meeting of the Durban Town Council he said it would probably be five years before he proceeded with it. The day after the meeting Mr. Orr, one of the commissioners, said to the Minister, &#x201C;Before you make your decision finally don&#x2019;t you think you should get a <span class="col_1455-1456" refersTo="page_0797"/>report from the general manager. We have never been consulted about it and neither has he.&#x201D; And that was correct. I had not been consulted, and neither had the board . . .</block>

<p>Subsequently Sir William Hoy made a report to the Minister and the Railway Board and they then decided to proceed with the line to Pietermaritzburg to Glencoe. I asked Sir William&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is quite clear that the Minister acted on his own responsibility and not on your advice.</block>

<p>Sir William replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not know on whose advice he acted when he made his statement in Natal, but it was not on mine or on that of the Railway Board</block>

<p>It is clear that this Government is not responsible for the electrification scandal but that the ex-Minister of Railways is mainly responsible for spending this huge sum of money. Judging from the interjections, I suppose some hon. members want to make this a bioscope show where they would be more at home than they are here, but I want to try to prove that the whole scheme was prematurely embarked upon and that it was a grave blunder to electrify a single line, when the general manager and Mr. More, A.G.M., Durban, were in favour of first doubling the line under steam. On page 658, Q. 3527 Mr. More was asked if he would have preferred the line being doubled under steam, and he replied in the affirmative. Then in Q. 3532 he said that the construction of the double line would have cost £1,500,000; further in Q. 3535 he was asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Would you say that it is the general opinion of the staff that it would have been a better economic proposition to have doubled the line and subsequently to have electrified it?</block>

<p>and he replied, Yes, all of which goes to show that the opinions of the general manager and other responsible persons were ignored, and that the ex-Minister is mainly responsible for the decision to spend an enormous sum of money in a premature scheme of electrification and also, on his own initiative completely change the original plan that had been approved by Parliament.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I am surprised to hear it claimed that the resolution was passed to meet the wishes of the South African party members. The resolution as passed was drafted by the Chairman, Dr. Visser; and when the draft was put into the hands of the committee, it was considered for the first time. It is strange that we have Mr. More quoted now, as the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Snow) was one of those who would not consider his evidence. It was brushed aside, and he said it was useless. I am surprised to hear it quoted here to-day by him. I should like to give some further quotations. The hon. member put this question to the general manager. It was not really a question but a statement meant to fasten the blame on the hon. member for Cape Town (Central)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is quite clear that the Minister acted on his own responsibility and not on your advice&#x2014;I do not know on whose advice he acted when he made his statement in Natal, but it was not on mine or that of the Railway Board.</block>

<p>Another question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You say Mr. Jagger decided on the line north of Pietermaritzburg?&#x2014;Yes, and let me be perfectly fair about it. He did say &#x201C;I am going to have electrification; I am not going to double the line.&#x201D; What I think he overlooked was that I had made provision and was making provision for an improved line north of Pietermaritzburg, and if my advice had been followed, all that work would have been completed to-day?</block>

<p>The question was put to the general manager, and I am sorry to bring the general manager into this discussion, but this attack has been made on the late Minister, the member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Was that agreed to by you?&#x2014;That was agreed to by me, recommended by me, and approved of by the board.</block>

<p>The Minister had the right to put his opinion forward, and his opinion was that the change should be made. He recommended it, and the general manager agreed, and the board approved of it. Then it was asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So it was really the board, and yourself, who recommended the scheme?&#x2014;Certainly, but the point I want you to understand is that there was a misunderstanding in my mind as to what Mr. dagger&#x2019;s intention was, and as a result of that, the whole recommendation I made was abandoned.</block>

<p>What more do you want? Supposing the general manager gave the strongest evidence against the Minister of Railways, was the hon. member for Salt River honest in supporting this report? The hon. member read part of it, and I am going to read the whole of it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1921 the Government decided to abandon the Durban-Pietermaritzburg scheme altogether, and, instead, decided to electrify the Pietermaritzburg-Glencoe section. In the course of taking evidence a difference arose as to the authority for departing from the original plan to electrify the Durban-Pietermaritzburg section, to the present electrification of the Pietermaritzburg-Glencoe section of the Natal line (see general manager&#x2019; evidence, Qs. 1352-1360 and 3597-3599). Your Committee finds that the change was duly placed before Parliament in white paper No. U.G. 47 of 1921 on a letter from the secretary to the Railway Board recommending it for approval on the board&#x2019;s authority, supported by reports from Messrs. Merz and McLellan and the general manager of railways, the latter supported the consulting engineers in recommending the change.</block>

<p><span class="col_1457-1458" refersTo="page_0798"/>That was the report of the Committee and now how can hon. members get up and endeavour to get behind that report? I would like to return to another portion of the report, and it is a unanimous report drafted by the hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the initial stages of the inquiry statements were made in evidence which made it necessary for your Committee to go into the matter in more detail than originally anticipated, and as the inquiry progressed it became more and more evident that principles were involved which required elucidating, and to get the true position therefore, the inquiry become complicated and of great length. Your Committee finds, as a fact, that when entering into agreements with the consulting engineers, the administration, through the High Commissioner, consulted with the chief mechanical engineer and the chief electrical engineer then in London, but omitted to consult with the civil engineering staff in South Africa.</block>

<p>I do not hear a word of complaint about that. They go back on their own report and try to blame the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sufficient stress cannot be laid on the necessity of fully consulting all technical advisers before important contracts are entered into.</block>

<p>The whole cause of the trouble was that the technical advisers in South Africa were not consulted. It seems very strange that members who sit upstairs and consider an important report like this, drafted by their Chairman, and accepting it should now come down here and try and get behind it.</p>

<p>My name has so frequently been drawn in as having signed the report as Chairman of the Committee that I think a few words from me are necessary. The white paper that the hon. member for Cape Town (Harbour) (Maj. G. B. van Zyl) referred to, of course, had to be submitted to Parliament. When a change of programme had been decided upon they had to come to Parliament. The white paper was subsequent to the change of programme. I want to say something in reference to that report. I, as Chairman of the Committee, wanted to have unanimity and in the original draft which I prepared there was a clause which absolutely ascribed on whom rested the responsibility of changing over the scheme. The member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) one day said that this side of the House treated the other side in too ladylike a fashion. I am sorry to say that my side of the Committee treated the other side of the Committee in too ladylike a fashion. When they found that these words were put in that clause of the report, my side was satisfied to draw attention to those questions that the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Snow) has drawn attention to on page 15, clause 6. We thought everybody who read that report would see where the screw was lose and we, therefore, thought it was not necessary to draw in the name of so distinguished a gentleman as the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). whom everyone in the House holds in the highest respect. I want to ask the hon. member a question. If the hon. member denies it, I accept his denial. It came out in the evidence that at the lunch given to him at Durban by the Chamber of Commerce the hon. member said he was definitely against electrification in Natal altogether. When he found out afterwards that pressure was brought to bear upon him, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you must have electrification, I am in favour of switching off to the north.</block>

<p>That is the cause of the whole trouble. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) as Minister of Railways was an autocrat. You will see there that Mr. Orr, a member of the board, protested that neither the general manager nor he (Mr. Orr) had any say in the matter at all. The cause of the switching over of the electrification in Natal and the increase in expenditure must be borne by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central).</p>

<p>He was man enough this afternoon to accept the responsibility.

I want the House to know that it was out of consideration and courtesy to hon. members on the other side that we left out the name of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central). This has been to me a bitter lesson and I know now and I shall know in future how to treat members of the Opposition.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure that the House was looking forward eagerly to hearing the hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser) and we are very pleased that he has condescended to give some light on the subject of this electrification in Natal in his capacity as chairman of the Railway Committee. What this House was looking forward to was an explanation by the hon. member as to why he entered into that sleeper contract. Perhaps his silence is also to be ascribed to his &#x201C;ladylike&#x201D; feeling towards the South African party. We who take an interest in parliamentary government and the purity of public life did expect the hon. member to say something in regard to his entering into that notorious contract. There was a meaning behind his silence. The conclusion is this, that he dare not enter into the discussion and give an explanation to the House. Perhaps that is something to be said to his credit, and if there is one weak point in the defence of the Minister of Railways in the speech he made the other day it is in regard to this question of the sleeper contract. I am not discussing the technicalities, the legal position of the contract, but what I have to do with is the political morality in regard to that contract.</p>

<from><span class="col_1459-1460" refersTo="page_0799"/>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>Here you have a contract entered into by the hon. member for Vrededorp, who is chairman of the Railway Committee. He entered into that contract without tender; no tender was asked for. It was done behind the scenes without the public knowing anything that was going on. If the hon. member had been successful in that contract he would have sat for three successive years and most likely as chairman of the Railway Committee have sat with the contract in his pocket. Is that conducive to purity of government and purity of administration? I will not pursue that question any further. I wish also to refer to the criticism which the Minister of Railways levelled the other day at certain members on this side who criticised the conduct of the Fruit Control Board in reference to their management of the fruit export business. I must say that I have followed with amazement the speech of the Minister. He worked himself up into a state of great excitement because members of Parliament, who represent the farmers&#x2019; interests in this big national industry, got up and criticised the conduct of the control board, which last session the Minister deliberately set up as a State institution. We are accused of ulterior motives and, not only that, but the Minister also insinuates that we were guilty of dishonesty. I would ask the Minister to descend from that lofty pedestal of his. Let him remember the doctrine which he always preached, that Ministers are the servants of Parliament and the servants of the people. Take my own case. The Minister said that the hon. member for Caledon came into the House and made an attack simply for political purposes. He did not even extend to me the courtesy of accepting the spirit which I displayed in making those remarks in regard to the control board. I made it perfectly clear to the Minister that I was speaking in no partizan spirit. I even went so far as to say that I did not wish to condemn the control board, but I simply passed on to the Minister facts which had been laid before me as the member representing the Elgin area of the Caledon district. These farmers, representing the Elgin Co-operative Society, at great sacrifice to themselves, came a big distance to inform their member here in Cape Town of their difficulties and when I conveyed those facts to the Minister in a calm and non-partizan spirit, the Minister gets up and accuses me of political bias and says that I simply got up in a spirit of dishonesty in order to mislead the House and the country and the fruit farmers. I brought those facts to the notice of Parliament. What was the result? The control board, in reply admitted that there was a bank-up of fruit at the docks and a serious one, a fact which was concealed from my constituents up to February 25. Then for the first time it was explained to them that there was a bank-up. They further admitted, in the main, the details I gave as to the cancellation of freight by the board. What justification does the Minister adduce for this attack upon me? As far as I understood his remarks he based it solely upon this, that I was invited by the chairman of the Fruit Control Board to discuss the situation with him. I gave the public press the version of what took place between me and the chairman of the board, and by that version I stand. Whether the Minister is prepared to accept it does not concern me. But the Minister goes further. I have here a letter written by the chairman of the Fruit Control Board explaining what took place between me and him, but he never states what the Minister stated in his speech, that the offer made to me was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you, Mr. Krige, decide to discuss this matter I am at your disposal. Let me know.</block>

<p>No. The offer by Mr. le Roux was an incidental offer in the lobby, and I explained to him at once that I could not at that moment accept the offer. Several days transpired between that interview and the time of my speech in the House. No further request was extended to me to interview the control board. Apart from any invitation are members of Parliament to be assailed by Ministers and their conduct questioned and motives ascribed to them because they do not first resort to the offices of the officials who are in the pay of Parliament, before ventilating grievances which vitally affect the interests of their constituents? I would like to know who is responsible to the people. Are these officials responsible to the people, or is Parliament? Those boards and officials multiply yearly, and I say it would be a sorry day for this country when this Parliament loses or weakens its control over the public service of this country. Take the Minister himself. The Minister knows that when we have grievances against the administration of the Railway Department we do not go to hole-and-corner meetings with these officials or with himself. No, we take these grievances as we find them and as they are brought to us, by our constituents, and the Minister is brought to book in the House. I shall certainly not surrender that privilege, that sacred privilege, which we as members of Parliament have, in regard to the Fruit Control Board. The Minister charged me with trying to undermine the confidence in this board of the farmers. Let me tell the Minister the members of the board are unknown to me, with the exception of the chairman. We have here got to do not with persons, but with a big national industry. I did not for a moment intend to influence public opinion against the control board or to undermine confidence, but the Minister, by making that statement and that charge, only presupposes that the control board had a very weak case to put up in defence of these complaints. There is nothing sacred about this control board. If there are complaints members of Parliament have a perfect right to ventilate them in Parliament. This is the place where complaints are to be ventilated; this is the body that represents the people and this is the body which the people look up for redress from their grievances. Take the case of the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford). The hon. member for Newlands is a <span class="col_1461-1462" refersTo="page_0800"/>recognized business man of repute right through South Africa, but his business ability is impugned by the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not want your advice; you may have a big knowledge of business and a big knowledge of shipping, but we do not want your criticism; we do not want your advice on an important matter of this sort.</block>

<p>The hon. member, apart from being a thorough business man of repute, is also a practical fruit farmer, a man whose has put more capital into fruit farming than, I suppose, the members the Minister has put on that board. An hon. member of that stamp comes forward to speak on behalf of that industry of which he knows so much, and the Minister flings at him the imputation that he comes forward for party purposes and that he is trying to undermine the influence of, and the confidence in, the control board. I want to bring some important questions to the notice of the Minister. One is whether the Minister is aware that the Union-Castle Company made an offer to take all the fruit which the farmers had for export at a reasonable figure? If that is so why was that offer not entertained? What the farmers feel is that it would be better to have an arrangement with one responsible company, a company which has in the past done a great deal to assist the development of the industry and which, to a certain extent has come forward and done what it could to provide the necessary accommodation and cold storage in their vessels. They feel also that once that arrangement has been come to with this responsible company and difficulties arise, as have now arisen in this case, that such a company would more easily meet the wishes of farmers in the way of fruit than if you had to deal with different shipping concerns. The second question is this, and I consider it to be of very supreme importance. It is whether the Fruit Control Board has the legal power to discriminate between one fruitgrower and another in the way of giving priority for one class of fruit over another and penalizing, by heavy freight, those people who get priority at present? The exact interpretation of the law on this point strikes at the very root of co-operation among farmers in the fruit business. I would advise the Minister to take the best legal advice upon that point, and after he has obtained such advice, to take the farmers and the public into his confidence upon that point. The farmers are under the impression that the law gives power to the board to discriminate between certain classes of products like eggs and fruit, but that the board has no power to discriminate between one class of fruit and another. If this point is not cleared up the Minister may find that, there being strong feeling among the fruit farmers on this legal aspect, they may be forced to go to the Supreme Court, and if the Fruit Control Board were to be unsuccessful upon a point of this nature, I am afraid that would really undermine the authority of the board and shake the confidence of the fruitgrowers in their administration. I hope upon this important point the Minister will make due enquiry and then take the fruit farmers into his confidence.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RICHARDS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser) has informed us this afternoon that he has learned a very bitter lesson. His meaning was, if I can gather it at all, that when you come in contact with honest men, treat them as rogues and act accordingly. Now the evidence in connection with the point raised is overwhelming. If there were even such a thing as an honourable understanding in connection with the late Minister&#x2019;s responsibility which, of course, is absurd, as the records show that it was never even discussed, but if such an honourable understanding existed, we know that the first people to break that honourable understanding were his own colleagues behind him, if it were true&#x2014;which it is not&#x2014;that there was any evidence in the committee to connect the hon. member for Cape town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) with the responsibility for the mess-up that took place in the carrying out of the contract, the hon. member&#x2019;s collegues were the first to come into the House and abuse the understanding. But there was no such evidence. The committee came to their finding on the perfectly reasonable and logical basis that the right thing had been done in switching off from one section of the line to another. Every authority supported it strongly. Let me read this by the general manager&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If electrification is not proceeded with now it will be a national calamity. If we spend large sums now on new steam engines and on works necessary to carry the increased traffic provided for, it means postponing electrification for some time to come.</block>

<p>We know perfectly well what evidence was before the Select Committee, and what the meaning of those words was. Whoever was responsible, it was the right and only thing to do. Why, then, all this clap-trap&#x2014;although this is hardly the language to use in a discussion of this sort, which should be on a high plane. The reason is simply this. Those who are trained in war know that the best form of defence is offence, and it is with the object of drawing off attention from their own many shortcomings, rail and sleeper contracts and what not, that this purely artificial attack is put up against the late Minister for Railways. But there are still a number of matters in connection with this contract which have not yet been cleared up, and the Minister of Railways and Harbours has shown a great reluctance to clear up these points. There is this matter of split rails. All we know is that 25 per cent of rails lying in stock have been condemned by our experts out here against being laid at all. We know, further, that these rails were purchased in a certain market&#x2014;Belgium&#x2014;and were passed by someone who cannot have carried out his duty to this country as effectively as one would have expected him to do in connection with such a tremendous order as that. We go further, and the selected rails, passed by local engineers as apparently sound, have been placed on the <span class="col_1463-1464" refersTo="page_0801"/>open lines, and a tremendous number of these have failed in outer curves, and have split between the web and the rail. We know that in value rails have had to be removed in thousands at a tremendous loss and cost to the country. That has taken place in connection with the electrified lines to a greater extent than in any other part of the country. We know that the damage is confined almost entirely to the outer, and not the inner, curve. We ask wherein lies the explanation? The Minister knows perfectly well the explanation and the reason, but for a reason we cannot fathom, he will not tell the House what is responsible for the damage, and what steps are being taken to prevent it from recurring. I ask him to be perfectly frank, and I ask, has any party of Swiss engineers, builders of these particular engines in Natal, been over the Natal section lately. Have they inquired into the running of these units and their effect on the construction of the road&#x2014;their effect on the wear and tear of the lines? If it is true that they have been over these lines, inspected these things, and come to any decision as to the cause, has the Minister received any report, however technically or guardedly worded, or any suggestion from them as to where the cause for the damage lies? If he would tell us this he would have gone a long way. But I would like him to go a little bit further. This matter cost the country thousands and thousands of pounds, and will lead the country to yet further trouble. Has any evidence been brought to show that these units, which were recommended to the country by Messrs. Merz &amp; McLellan, are actually the very best type of units to be got for our purposes? On the contrary, if that is not so, was that type of unit not more or less obsolete in some respects, when we took these units over? Is the fault not due largely to the centre of gravity being too low? Was this not at the time pointed out by the manufacturers? Any hon. member who knows anything about mechanics and understands the meaning of the word, unsprung balance, knows that when the centre of gravity of an engine is too low you have no means of distributing the vibration&#x2014; the rails have to take the whole of the strain, and go under. On the other hand, modern steam engines have a high centre of gravity, and the strain is distributed. This afternoon I would also ask him to say whether he had any report from his own department or his own departmental officers as to this line, if so, has he sent it to Messrs. Merz &amp; McLellan for their opinion on it, and has the report come back to South Africa? If so, whom does Messrs. Merz &amp; McLellan hold responsible? Do they say there is a mistake in connection with these electrical units&#x2014;I think it is most unlikely that they will say so, because they were responsible for the construction of the engines&#x2014;or do they still hold our own officers responsible? The country is entitled to an answer.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Brig.-Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BYRON</person>:</from>

<p>I would not have intervened in this third reading discussion except for some unfortunate phrases in the speeches of the hon. member for Vrededorp (Dr. Visser) and the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Snow). The House has entrusted most important duties to the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours, which has to deal with an expenditure of £28,000,000, equal to the annual consolidated revenue of this country. It would appear from the speeches of these two hon. members that this committee is liable to be influenced by considerations other than its duties to this House. As a member of that committee I resent it, and after sitting on that committee for three years I can only hope that these two hon. members speak for themselves only, and not for any other member of the committee. It is a most unfortunate thing if this House should lose confidence in this most important committee, and it is just as well to remind the House that not only is there a House of Assembly, but there are also the public and the country which have to take note of these things, and if they lost confidence in the committees appointed by this House it means a very bad and regrettable state of affairs indeed. We have to deal with technical questions of vast importance and far-reaching consequences and not being professional men, we can only have an imperfect acquaintance with these matters; careful attention, therefore, has to be given to the evidence bearing on these important matters. We have a chairman of the Select Committee whose conduct with regard to the contract which has been discussed has been left unexplained by the Minister, and it puts us in a very awkward position indeed. It is to be regretted that the Minister did not take the opportunity he had on the second reading to make the frankest and fullest disclaimer of the contract of the chairman of the Select Committee. It is not too late yet, and I hope he will assure the House that such contracts will not occur again. That is his plain duty. As to the matter discussed earlier with regard to electrification the whole thing boils down to two single facts&#x2014;the change of policy which decided that electrification north of Maritzburg should be installed rather than south of Maritzburg. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has been blamed for this, and a good deal of political capital has been sought to be made out of the position. It turns out that the change was an admirable one of policy, and that when it was explained to those who had to endorse it&#x2014;the general manager and the railway board&#x2014;which were just as keen and enthusiastic on it as the then Minister himself. I do not know how it is possible for any individual to say that this change was otherwise than to the benefit of the country and it will eventually prove itself to be to the great economic advantage of the railway system. Another point which the Select Committee went into carefully and brought out&#x2014;but, unfortunately, could not be discussed in this House&#x2014;was that any undue excess of the estimates was mainly due, not to the late Minister of Railways and Harbours, but to the fact that the fullest advantage was not taken of consulting the railway professional staff we have in this country. Had this <span class="col_1465-1466" refersTo="page_0802"/>been done I make bold to say at least one million would have been saved. We are fortunate in having in this country a railway technical staff that is second to none, and is surpassed by none in any other administration in the world; and we have learned the lesson that it does not pay to go behind this vast technical and above all local experience which these men have obtained. I hope this House will not get the idea&#x2014;which would be incorrect&#x2014; that the Select Committee of Railways and Harbours is a white-washing institution Nothing of the sort takes place as far as I am aware. I suppose the chairman of the committee is speaking of himself&#x2014;of the ladylike institution&#x2014;if it is a ladylike institution he is &#x201C; assisted by a husband &#x201D; from outside with regard to these resolutions.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. BROWN</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for East London (North) (Brig.-Gen. Byron) that it is a pity this discussion has arisen at this stage; but there are one or two points which seem to have been evaded by the hon. member for Weenen (Maj. Richards) and other hon. members who have spoken&#x2014;that the cost of electrification has exceeded by nearly l½ millions the cost as first estimated. The evidence given before the select committee should be read by hon. members as well as the committee&#x2019;s recommendations. I am not looking for the hon. member&#x2019;s scalp, nor do I believe that he made the change for an ulterior motive&#x2014;he believed that he was doing something in the interests of the country. But that change threw out his engineers&#x2019; plans by five months, and that went very largely towards the extra expenditure. A large amount of money was spent because the work could not be done in proper sequence, so that the scheme has to carry a burden which it would not have to bear but for the alterations and for the contractors having to do the work before the plans were completed. The contractor&#x2019;s engineers and Mr. Wallace, the chief engineer, distinctly stated that this threw the plans out by five months. I believe that the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) did what he thought was right. I think, however, when Parliament has decided on a scheme involving a million of money, anyone in authority should be chary of altering it without coming back to Parliament for its authority.</p>

There will be plenty of time to use these arguments when the general election comes, but I do not see any possible chance of that until 1929, otherwise billets worth £2,500 a year and jobs for pals will then disappear. On two or three occasions when Ministers replied to questions, supplementary queries were put to them, but they refused to answer.

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to preface my remarks by saying that I do not pose as a fruit farmer. I would like to refer to the question that arose between the Minister and myself on the second reading in order to prove the second part of my case. I think the Minister agrees that I proved the first part, the existence of dirty trucks. The other part of my case, to which, however, the Minister took very great exception, concerned the board&#x2019;s letter to the &#x201C; Cape Times,&#x201D; in which it was stated that they cancelled the freight engaged on the &#x201C; Llandaff Castle &#x201D; on January 24th, but on February 2nd, over a week later, they seriously sat down to discuss with a committee whether they should cancel the &#x201C; Llandaff&#x2019;s &#x201D; freight, or the &#x201C; Bendigo&#x2019;s &#x201D; freight. After reading this letter several times, I think that probably a mistake has arisen, and that the board did not cancel the freight on January 24th, but possibly February 24th, which would clear up the point, for there is no reason to call a committee to discuss the advisability of doing something when you have already <span class="col_1467-1468" refersTo="page_0803"/>done it. If the Minister will agree that the board&#x2019;s letter is wrong, then I have proved my case. Was the freight by the &#x201C; Llandaff &#x201D; cancelled on January 24th, nine days before they called the committee together to decide whether they should cancel it or not? I would like now to refer to the action the board took in granting priority of shipment to certain soft fruits. I have considerable sympathy with the pear-growers, whose position is this: First they have to pay cold storage for fruit awaiting shipment; for that they are compensated by a lower rate of freight, but against that their fruit will be deteriorated by remaining three or four weeks in cold storage. Then, at the end of March, four weeks&#x2019; shipments of pears will be shipped and will have to find a market in England simultaneously, and this will very considerably reduce the price, hence the growers are in no way compensated for receiving a lower rate of freight. The pear-growers are very disappointed, for this year has been a particularly bad one as regards the crop. Under ordinary circumstances, a short crop should mean a higher price, because of lessened competition. He had a good opportunity of getting a good price for his pears, because there was a short crop, but, owing to the bulking of the whole of the pear crop for four weeks, and the sudden swamping of the market with a four weeks&#x2019; supply, the effect was the grower would get a low price.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>How are you going to avoid that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>By doing what the growers ask, by giving priority of shipment in the order of priority of arrival at the docks. That has been the sheet-anchor of the farmers all through. They have fought for this principle ever since this matter has been going on. That was their only protection against all kinds of difficulties. They insisted that the fruit should be shipped in the order it arrived. I ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that the deciduous exchange was asked a short time ago whether they were prepared to go back from that one principle, and whether they did not refer it to the co-operative societies, who, in reply, said they would not go back from that principle that the fruit should be shipped in the order of its arrival. When we were discussing this matter last, the Minister took up the position that we were making a mountain out of a molehill, and that we were frightening the farmers, and he took up the position that there was not much cause for anxiety. I am rather inclined to agree with the Minister and with the board. The Minister&#x2019;s excitement about the subject has made the farmers more anxious than they were before, and has aggravated the position to a great extent. He is therefore responsible for the anxiety. I think myself that the position to-day does not give cause for anxiety, such as the position of affairs did the year before last. I think the position has improved very much. That being the case, I want to ask the Minister why he talks of the necessity of abrogating those principles which the fruitgrowers have stuck to for so long, and why he gives the excuse that it is an emergency measure? In his letter of the 10th, published in the &#x201C; Cape Times &#x201D; on the 16th, he refers to the decision to alter that practice as a decision which should not be taken as a precedent, but should be taken in the light of an emergency measure. I feel if you alter this fundamental principle so easily, you are going to get into trouble. I doubt the Minister&#x2019;s judgment in saying that the state of affairs is so bad with regard to the soft fruit that we have to abrogate the fundamental principles which have governed the shipment of fruit. I do not think there is sufficient cause for having done this, and if anybody has frightened the farmer on this export business, it is the Minister himself. I should like to ask the Minister to tell us in his reply, when this decision was come to, were all his permanent members of the board present, and was it a decision of his permanent advisers as a whole? I am still of the opinion I was, before I heard the Minister&#x2019;s statement, that the best way to deal with the position is to revert back to the status quo ante. The hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) suggested one of the shipping companies, I think it was the mail company, would be in a position to guarantee the lifting of the whole of this freight. To my mind the fruit farmers would be in a better position to get their fruit shipped if they came to some arrangement with the company of that nature, because they are naturally in touch with the whole of the freight market of the world. The fruit farmer now knows what he did not recognize a year or two ago, and that is, he is bound to pay a certain amount of money for dead freight. He pays now about ten shillings a ton on dead freight, but if he could go to the shipping company and ask them to take his freight at five shillings a ton more than the rates that have been charged, he would then be five shillings a ton better off at the end of the season; that is, if the shipping people would take the risk of the dead freight, and not the farmer. Now the whole risk of the cost of dead freight falls on the fruit-grower. It would be better for the fruit-grower to know the exact price he is going to pay in freightage, and let the shipping company charge a price that would cover the risk for dead freight. I should like to give a few figures to the Minister on another matter arising out of the remarks of the hon. member for Winburg (Dr. van der Merwe) that the sun of English commercial supremacy was quickly setting. The Minister probably knows what weight to attach to the remarks of the hon. member. As far as I know, I have not seen any figures which in any way bear out the statement of the hon. member for Winburg. I will give the figures regarding the export of locomotives. The international export of locomotives of the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States of America, and France in 1913 was £6,889,000 and out of this total of international <span class="col_1469-1470" refersTo="page_0804"/>exports the United Kingdom exported £2.782,000. In 1926 the United Kingdom, out of a total export of £6,045,000, exported £3.043,000. These figures are up to 1926, and are, therefore, right up-to-date, and they show that the export of locomotives from England was more than the total export of Germany, United States of America and France combined. That does not look as if the manufacturers of the United Kingdom need spend any sleepless nights on the matter, and I urge the hon. Minister to think over these figures because they rather confirm the opinion that the locomotive from the United Kingdom is the best value in the market. I am not one of those who criticize the hon. Minister for taking the cheapest article. I am with him when he says he is running a business concern and that he wants to buy in the cheapest market. But I do not want him to be confused between cheapness and low price. The lowest price is not necessarily the cheapest, and the opinion of the world in the export of locomotives in 1926 is that Great Britain is the cheapest in the long run.</p>

The hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) asked me what the amount will be which the board expects to pay in dead freight this year. It is quite impossible for me to give a reply to that. It will have to be ascertained, of course, after the deciduous season is over. He has also asked me whether all the permanent members were present. My information is that the following permanent members attended: Mr. le Roux, the chairman, and Mr. Pare, with Mr. Buller, a representative member, and who represents the deciduous growers on the board. He has again said that he thinks the whole position would be met by the repeal of the Act and by placing the whole matter in the hands of the farmers. I have indicated on a previous occasion that I cannot agree with him. We cannot possibly go back to the condition of chaos which existed in regard to the whole of our fruit export before the control board came into being, and now, especially with the large increase in the available products of this kind, it seems to me that it would be a very great mistake indeed to go back to the old position. The hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) and the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) have both referred to the question of the position of the exporters of pears. I thoroughly agree with my hon. friends when they say that the position of the exporters of pears undoubtedly may become very serious if there is a drop in the selling price during the month of April, when the pears will be exported. But the point I want to stress, and which seems to have been lost sight of, is that the decision of the board in connection with giving preference to grapes was taken in consultation with the pear growers, or rather with their representatives. When Mr. le Roux, the chairman, and Mr. Buller saw me before they took this action, and asked me for the <span class="col_1471-1472" refersTo="page_0805"/>necessary authority, I put the question to them whether they had consulted the interests concerned, and they assured me that the growers of pears had been consulted through their organizations, and that they agreed that, in view of the longer life of pears as against the shorter life of grapes, to the action taken. I think tribute is due to the growers of pears for their unselfish action in this regard, because it seems to me that they acted according to the true principle of co-operation. The hon. member for Newlands, though I do not know that it is necessary to go into the question again, has again raised the question of the action of the board in regard to the cancellation of freight on the &#x201C; Llandaff Castle.&#x201D; I can only again repeat the facts as they appear from the correspondence. The position is that, on January 24th owing to the failure of fruit to come forward, the board cancelled the refrigerated space on the &#x201C; Llandaff Castle.&#x201D; They met the growers on February 2nd, and fully explained the whole position to them. The growers then endorsed the action of the board. Hon. members must bear in mind that the space which had been booked on the Australian boat stood, because it was not possible to cancel that. In the middle of February, on the 17th, the flood of fruit began to come forward, and the board then endeavoured to get the Union-Castle Company to agree again to let them have the space on the &#x201C; Llandaff Castle,&#x201D; but the Union-Castle Company refused, and said that they had made their commitments to the exporters of baled goods and, consequently, they were not able to accede to the request of the board. But the position is that when the space on the &#x201C; Llandaff Castle &#x201D; was cancelled on the 24th January, there was every justification for the action of the board. The fruitgrowers, who, through their co-operative society, were consulted on the 2nd February, agreed with the board that the action was necessary. It was only by the middle of February that the whole position changed. I had rather hoped that the hon. member for Caledon in his speech this afternoon would have referred to the extraordinary action of the Union-Castle Company in now sending forward to the control board a bill for the difference between the refrigerated charges and the charges for baled goods, which, of course, must be paid by the growers.</p>

<p>I say that legally the company can maintain their position, but I hope they will realize that it will not be easy for the fruitgrowers to pay that bill. They charged the board with the difference in the freight for refrigerated space and baled goods. Of course, my hon. friend will not lose sight of the fact that there is a considerable saving to the company, for it stands to reason that the expense of carrying refrigerated goods from South Africa is very much higher than carrying baled goods. The hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) has rather resented my criticism of the position as stated by him. I have never objected to criticism of the actions of the Control Board because, as three of the members of that board are paid through funds supplied by this Parliament, the right of hon. members to question the actions of those three members of that board is unquestionable. But what I want to stress again, and what must not be lost sight of is that this is an independent board of six members and that the Government have three nominated members on that board.</p>

<p>The point is this.

It would be fair after they have failed to procure the necessary information that they should then come to Parliament and complain against the actions of the board as represented by three of the members. My complaint against the hon. member for Caledon (Mr. Krige) is this, that while he was given an opportunity by the chairman of the board to be placed in possession of all the facts from the point of view of the board, he did not avail himself of that opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. Lydell said that they were hurried. Does the hon. member dispute the fact that in their hurry they forgot to include Masons Mill? This work was omitted, and if such an important item was omitted there must have been something wrong in the manner in which the estimates was framed. Let me say, in justice to the general manager&#x2014;the hon. member will find that in the evidence&#x2014;that when once the Minister responsible had taken the decision with regard to the change-over, he (the general manager) felt in duty bound, as a loyal officer, to agree and give him every assistance. The hon. member for Weenen (Maj. Richards) has asked me a number of questions, and pressed the point that I must be frank. All my hon. friend&#x2019;s questions&#x2014;referring to the split rails in Natal, the units, and the wear and tear of the rails&#x2014;I have previously dealt with, I have, on previous occasions, repeatedly told the House that when the split in the rails occurred the officers were consulted. Let me, however, stress the point which the hon. member does not seem to appreciate, that these defective Belgian rails have not been placed in the track on the Natal line, and also that splitting has occurred in all classes of rails&#x2014; British, Continental and American included&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) asked a few questions during the debate to which I want to reply. They are in connection with Imperial affairs. He said in the first place&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There should be a distinct and separate representative of the British Government in each dominion.</block>

<p>And he wanted to know what the attitude of my Government was about it. I can only say this, that what he says ought to take place, will, I think, take place. But he will understand that how it will take place, and through whom, are questions about which only the British Government itself, as the Government concerned, can decide. He asks further that expression should be given to the opinion that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Each dominion must see that it is represented by men of the highest status to be found in London.</block>

<p>That is in agreement with the view of the Government, and for this reason it has already been agreed that the High Commissioner in the future will have a diplomatic relationship towards the British Government. He said, further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whilst it is obvious that we can have representatives of the Union in foreign capitals, in many cases it would be waste of money.</block>

<p>I want to say that I entirely agree with him on that point. Now that we have received from the last Imperial Conference the acknowledgement by Great Britain of our sovereign national freedom, with full abandonment by the British Government of any claim to control, or superior authority, with the acknowledgment of all rights or privileges, both local and foreign as equal free peoples, it would, in my opinion, be the greatest stupidity if we resolved upon the costly appointment of diplomatic representatives abroad, except there where it is necessary for trade or other reasons of State that such a person should be appointed. The hon. member further spoke generally about our status, and he commenced by the acknowledgment of the independent status of the dominions by the Imperial Conference. I want here to thank him for the compliment he paid me in his speech. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have nothing but admiration for the speeches the Prime Minister made in England. I have told my constituents that I cannot see a single word to object to in any speech he made, and I am very glad we are all agreed on this point.</block>

<p>I am particularly pleased to hear that. It was not always so, and I think I am entitled to say here: &#x201C; There is nothing that succeeds like success.&#x201D; Who would have said that it was the same member who, on the 13th November last, only three months earlier, delivered a &#x201C; trenchant speech &#x201D; to his constituents on the &#x201C; independence issue.&#x201D; in which he challenged me &#x201C; to come into the open? &#x201D; On that occasion he said, inter alia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What we all want to know is what Gen. Hertzog means when he makes speeches on the question of independence.</block>

<p>And later in his speech he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would be very important to know exactly what he means. Does he mean that this country should be recognized by the dominions, by Great Britain and by foreign powers to be so completely independent that in case of war there should be no question as to its neutrality being admitted and recognized. If he means that, it is nothing less than . . . secession, because you cannot be inside the Empire and outside the Empire at the same time. You have to make up your mind which you are going to be.</block>

<p>Now to think that the person who three months ago spoke like that can now get up in the House and give his blessing to the recognition of our sovereign independence by the Imperial Conference, is indeed satisfactory, and must make us all hopeful with regard to other matters of a similar nature which still remain to be settled. It is a pleasing sign to me, because I regard it as a proof that the difference of opinion on matters of this nature is mostly based on prejudice and ignorance. It is clear to me what in November last caused the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) to so dislike the word &#x201C; independence.&#x201D; He then still believed in the bogey which is so often trotted out by his own party, and especially by his leader, the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts). He could therefore, of course, not find it possible to agree that the dominions should be acknowledged by foreign powers as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">completely independent.</block>

<p>And he, of course, had to contest every attempt at getting our sovereign freedom admitted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">it being nothing less than secession.</block>

<p>Filled with the fear before him, he could not imagine our attitude in relation to the empire as anything else than that of subordination, and he had to regard the empire as a sort of superstate, again like his leader, the hon. member for Standerton. South Africa he of course considered subordinate to that super-State. We can therefore well understand that the hon. member at that time could not believe that we were so &#x201C; completely independent &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You cannot be both inside the empire and outside at the same time.</block>

<p>In other words, according to him, it could mean nothing else than that we could not, according to bur status, belong to the empire, and at the same time be a sovereign free people. Of course, that is clear. Of course, with such a conception of the empire, viz., a super-State, the hon. member was quite right. You cannot have an empire which is a super-State, and of which another country is a subordinate part, and still lay claim to that part being free. That is very clear. He was thus quite right when he said in November&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1479-1480" refersTo="page_0809"/>You have to make up your minds which you are going to be.</block>

<p>Now I want to point out that it is just here that the Imperial Conference did its great and significant work by acknowledging the status of the dominions. It was also a case with the members of the Imperial Conference of&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have to make up your minds which it is going to be.</block>

<p>Whether you are going to be a member of an empire State of which no subordinate part can have sovereign freedom, or of so many sovereign free States united in voluntary cooperation, or associated as the British commonwealth of nations. Let me say that the Imperial Conference gave a decided and final answer to the question. The Imperial Conference definitely rejected the view of the empire held at the time by the hon. member for Standerton and the hon. member for South Peninsula, in favour of the existence of so many free sovereign peoples freely united in mutual co-operation towards the rest of the world with a view to mutual benefit. The Imperial Conference, therefore, acted very clearly according to the formula of the hon. member for South Peninsula&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It made up its mind which it was going to be, dependence or complete independence.</block>

<p>The Imperial Conference disposed of the question of sovereign independence, and by its decision once and for all gave a final and unequivocal decision in favour of sovereign independence. It seems to me that the hon. member has submitted to this decision. I heartily congratulate him, thereon, and I also wish to express my pleasure at the way he has shown in his speech that he fully appreciates and values the good and beneficial results of the decision of the Imperial Conference. I say in all earnestness and honestly, that I congratulate him on it. But he will understand now when I say that I am sorry that he, at the same time, felt himself obliged to detract from the good work of the Imperial Conference. I can quite understand why he did so. The great significance of the declaration of the Imperial Conference is, of course, just as clear to him as to anybody else in, or outside of, the empire. It is clear to him also that the declaration also contains a decision against which it is futile for him or his party to any longer resist. He therefore felt obliged to accept the decision, hut in view of the speech three months before to his constituents, he had now to make it appear as if he had always held that opinion, even from that time. That is why we find the lame remark at the beginning of his speech, where, in view of the declaration of the Imperial Conference, in a depreciatory way he says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most of us thought this was already the position, and was fully recognized in England and the dominions.</block>

<p>I should like actually to be told by the hon. member who are included in the words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">most of us.</block>

<p>Is it his leader, the hon. member for Standerton, the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan), or the hon. member for Illovo (Mr. Marwick) with the Natal members? Who are most of us? I should like to know that. The statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most of us thought this was already the position</block>

<p>would not have sounded so stupid if it had not come from the hon. member or his party. From me, or from the Nationalist party, it would have come quite naturally, because ever since the 7th December, 1912, I have never preached anything else about our status than the doctrine now recognized in the declaration of the Imperial Conference. On the other hand, the South African party, with its leader in the van, has never done anything else but deny and oppose that doctrine. What is more, it is precisely the preaching of that doctrine by us, and by me, and, let me say, the denial of it by the hon. member for Standerton and his colleagues in the Cabinet, which led to the crisis in 1912 by which the South African party ceased for good to exist, i.e., the old South African party. It is due to that, that the hon. member for Standerton sits there to-day, and I here. Otherwise, we should have both sat there or both here.</p>

<p>I shall not, nor do I wish to. It has nothing to do with the matter. The whole question is what brought about the split between him and me. It was nothing less than his heresy in connection with the empire question. I call it heresy because the Imperial Conference, if it did anything, has finally killed the idea of the hon. member for Standerton about the empire in 1912. The statement of the hon. member for South Peninsula is therefore deplorable, because if he is right, then practically nothing of any State importance or significance was effected by the declaration of the Imperial Conference. If that is so, if the old feud has not been settled, and if that declaration is so ambiguous that we must take it that it allows the feud of the past (from 1912 to 1926) to continue, then I want to ask my hon. friend to bear in mind what it will mean and must mean to the maintenance of the empire to which he attaches so much value. Let him think of that. I could not imagine anything more damaging to the sentiment within the dominions, not only here in South Africa, but in all the dominions, towards the empire, than if it were said to-day that that declaration of the Imperial Conference has left undecided the whole question whether we belong to an empire-State or not. Fortunately, <span class="col_1481-1482" refersTo="page_0810"/>I am fully convinced that that is not so. The Imperial Conference completely settled that question, and decided against my hon. friend there, and I recommend him to accept it and to put up with it. No, I feel that the hon. member well knows that his denial of the importance of what was done by the Imperial Conference is a mere subterfuge, to save him from the dilemma in which he has been placed by the policy of his party in the past, and by the speech which he made to his constituents three months ago. If anyone were to ask me now what the Imperial Conference had done, what was to be said to its credit, then I must say that it is not difficult to give an answer. In the first place, it made an authoritative declaration about our national status. I repeat that it made an authoratative declaration about our national status. That had never before been done although I find from the records in my office that the hon. member for Standerton in 1921 himself made an attempt to obtain a declaration from the Imperial Conference of that year.</p>

I accept that he did not do it, but nevertheless I half think that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort knew of the point Why does he say that he made an attempt? And if there is anything which makes me smile and convinces me of the injustice which took place on such occasions and in such debates, then one can find in the records the eloquence with which the hon. member for Standerton debated with himself the desirability and necessity of obtaining such a declaration, and then to read that five years thereafter, on the 18th September, 1926, the same member who was so eloquent went about on the platforms in the country, and eventually went to the town hall of Johannesburg, and there speaking in connection with my statement in Cape Town, that I was going to England to insist there on such a declaration?</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member knows well enough, because he must have read my speech, to refer to it in his speech. But I will repeat what I said. I am not afraid. I said on the 6th September&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I notice that an idea has got abroad that at the Imperial Conference in October it is my intention to ask that we shall have a written constitution regulating our national and international status. I wish at once to say that I shall do nothing of the kind. The Union being a free and independent State, nothing more is to be gained by committing that to writing, but what I shall urge is that the necessary steps shall be taken for our national status, equal to that of Great Britain and any other of the dominions, and entitled to international recognition, shall be so published and declared to the world, that we shall no longer have men like Mr. Patrick Duncan pretending ignorance and through their ignorance, causing irreparable injury.</block>

<p>But let me return to my friend&#x2019;s eloquent declaration in 1921, and compare it with what he said in September, 1926, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We know (continued Gen. Smuts) what a declaration like that means.</block>

<p>I should like the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) to tell me in what respect the declaration that he wanted to obtain differed from the one I suggested. That would be very interesting. I have my suspicion, but I should very much like the hon. member to tell me. Then he goes further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been felt in this country and Great Britain that a declaration such as Gen. Hertzog has adumbrated means the break-up of the British empire.</block>

<p>And this is the same hon. member who recently went about from platform to platform on his pilgrimage through the country, and what did he do? He said that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He and his party are the men who always stood for the sovereign independence of South Africa to prevent the British empire breaking up.</block>

<p>Let me honestly acknowledge that the British empire has been broken up by the declaration of the Imperial Conference, but it is the empire of the hon. member which has been broken up. It is that empire State into which with that group-unity idea he wanted to push us and make us subordinate appendages. That is the empire which he has quite rightly been torn asunder, but how then can the hon. member still come and tell us that he and his party were always protagonists of an independent sovereign South Africa? What does he say more? He says that I have now come back from the Imperial Conference and have been converted to his belief. Really, anything more ridiculous and insincere I can hardly imagine. But, as I said, the first thing that was done at the Imperial Conference was that an authoritative declaration was made about our national status, a thing which has never yet been ventured upon by any previous Imperial Conference. I think that that at least is something which can be placed to the credit of the 1926 Imperial Conference. But, in the second place, the Imperial Conference, in the declaration, in clear language acknowledged our independent sovereign national freedom, and, as I have already said, the empire policy of the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) is entirely defeated. But in the third place, the declaration <span class="col_1483-1484" refersTo="page_0811"/>at the same time contains the settlement of a weighty political issue for the dominions I have already pointed out that people like the hon. member for Standerton, and his party in this country, were up to that time the protagonists of an authoritative empire to which the dominions, at any rate as far as foreign policy on important points was concerned, would be subordinate. And with that empire idea, the Nationalist party and I would have nothing to do, and we would not meddle with the existence or creation of such an empire. We always persisted that the dominions, by virtue of their self-government, had a claim to complete sovereign independent freedom, and that issue was settled once and for all by the Imperial Conference. As to South Africa, the decision of the Imperial Conference was favourable to the doctrine preached by me, and against that held by the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) and his party. Well, one can easily understand from this the anxiety of the hon. member for South Peninsula (Sir Drummond Chaplin) and, I may also say, the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) to find an escape from their past, by saving&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Most of us thought that this was already the position, and was fully realized in England and the dominions.</block>

<p>Let me say that the hon. member for Standerton and his party have completely forgotten their former doctrine. They have quite forgotten the policy the hon. member followed for so many years, and let me say again that I sympathize with them, because to hopelessly defeat a healthy party, such as the South African party was in 1912, on an empire policy, which was subsequently declared to be null and void, is really no small matter. I can therefore well understand that an escape is to-day sought from that position, but let me add that I am very glad that at any rate in this connection we have obtained a united sentiment and conviction, united feeling over a question which in the past gave rise to much that was utterly injurious to our country as well as to our people, and I am convinced that if we want to be a prosperous people and a happy people, then the more we can avoid further disputes on questions relating to our national freedom, the more we are agreed on that, are honestly at one, and convinced that we are a sovereign free people, the more it will do us good as a people. It will also further be the best thing for what hon. members opposite appreciate more than I do, viz., what they call the empire. I say again, appreciate more than I do, because with regard to the empire, I have never yet, since De Wildt, departed from what I stated there, and I could repeat again now what I stated there. The empire is only useful to me as far as it is useful to the people and the country. If it is useful to South Africa, and I think hon. members opposite will be much more prepared to concede this than in 1912&#x2014;</p>

<p>I discussed the matter there which was topical at the moment, viz., a federal empire which we were to join. Those were my words literally, but on Monday, the 9th December, I was called up on the telephone to attend a meeting at which the hon. member for Standerton was present. I was then accused by the then Prime Minister (Gen. Botha), in the presence of the hon. member for Standerton, of having said that I wanted to suck the British empire like an orange and then throw it away. I said to the Prime Minister that that was not so, but he repeated it a second time. I then again told him that I had not <span class="col_1485-1486" refersTo="page_0812"/>said it.

<p>We Were all anxious to hear from the Prime Minister about the status of this country. The Imperial Conference has been an occasion of great importance, not only for the empire, but for this country in particular. The Imperial Conference has brought <span class="col_1487-1488" refersTo="page_0813"/>to a conclusion dissensions which have been raging in this country for many years. The Prime Minister went there, not as leader of a party, but as the spokesman of this country. He took part in those proceedings, and he has come back to tell us what has been done. We were anxious to hear from him, in an impartial way, what has been done. Not only we in this House, but the whole country were anxious to hear from him a clear, fair, impartial statement about the work of the Imperial Conference, and the results so far as they concern this country. Instead of that we have heard this afternoon a statement full of partisanship and full of bitterness, a speech which breathed the atmosphere of all these bitter years through which we have passed in this country. As the hon. the Prime Minister was making that speech I was thinking of his concluding words on his arrival in Cape Town, when he said he was sick of all this bickering, and he raised a hope, which I echoed from my heart, that we might steer into a better course in South Africa, and get out of the atmosphere of dissension and bitterness, and look to the things which concern our welfare as a nation, and not merely from a party point of view. The Prime Minister has uttered in the House his first word on the Imperial Conference, and his first word on our status, and I ask him does he think he has done himself justice on this subject; does he think this country, this poor country, deserves to be addressed in the terms in which he has addressed it.</p>

I want to approach the work of the conference in that spirit. I don&#x2019;t want to make charges; I don&#x2019;t want to refer to any party aspects of this question, but I want to discuss some of the national aspects of the work which was done by the conference. Let me say this. In my opinion this conference has rendered a great service. The report of the conference is a great document, a most valuable document, which we all ought to be very grateful for. I go further. So far as the Prime Minister took part in the work, I think the gratitude of South Africa is due to him for the share he took in that work. I do not think it is fair to the component parts of the empire, or to the other statesmen who took part, that we should represent it as if it was his work alone.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly suggested and stated. It is unfair. I think this conference has done important work, and work for which we have every reason to be grateful. Let us be clear about what it is. Do not let us misrepresent the work or exaggerate it, let us view it in the proper light, because, if we misrepresent this work&#x2014;and the result which has been achieved&#x2014;and exaggerate it, there is sure to be a reaction afterwards. The work is good enough to stand on its own merits. It need not be misrepresented or exaggerated. The Prime Minister was, perhaps unconsciously, in his statement, misrepresenting the work of the conference. Let me mention two cases. My hon. friend, the member for Peninsula (South) (Sir Drummond Chaplin) asked months ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Will Gen. Hertzog tell us what he means by independence?</block>

<p>As far as this report is concerned, the word &#x201C; independence &#x201D; is carefully avoided. The question addressed by the hon. member for Peninsula (South) to the Prime Minister is not, in direct terms, answered in this report.</p>

<p>When the House rose for dinner I was dealing with some of the statements made by the Prime Minister which, I feared, might lead to misunderstanding. I want us to be perfectly clear and explicit about the work of the Imperial Conference, and the results, so far as they affect us. Now there is another matter raised by the Prime Minister, which I want to deal with at once, as I am afraid it also might lead to misunderstanding of the position. The Prime Minister said that it had been the position of this party, and especially of myself, that the empire was or should be a sort of super-state, that there should be a super-state, a super-organism which had or should have authority over the dominions, that this had been the position taken up by members on this side of the House, and by myself in especial&#x2014;that there should be, or that there was, such a super-state in the empire. I do not want to enter into controversial matters now; nothing is further from my mind; I want to-night to steer clear of all matters of controversy, and see how far we are in agreement on the great matters which have arisen in connection with the last Imperial Conference, and I am bound to say this: That I have never held such a view in all the years that I have spoken of the empire&#x2014;and I have given the matter great attention and have said and written a great deal about it. Nowhere, as far as I can remember, have I expressed the view that there should be a super-state in the empire, to which the component parts should be subordinate. On the contrary, I have always said that there should be a union of free and equal states within the empire, a small league of nations. From the beginning, I have always held that view, and it is my view still, nor do I know that members on this side have ever held any other opinion. There has been, there should be, no super-state. It is a misunderstanding on the part of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has for years laboured under this obsession, that some evil-minded persons, some persons with dangerous aims in the politics of the empire, were trying to establish a central authority to which the component parts of the empire would be subject. I do not think there has been any such policy.</p>

<p>Oh, my Glasgow speech? I have made many speeches, and, of course, one may sometimes say a thing which is capable of various interpretations, but I thought this matter out in my own mind years ago, and, so far as I am conscious of any opinions on the subject, I have always consistently held this view, that there must be a new form of free government in the world, that the empire might be the beginning of such a form of government, not a government by subjection, but a government by consultation, a government which would be a free union of equals. And those ideas I expressed in regard to my conception of the empire. I fought the idea of imperial federation. Hon. members know, it is on record, as somebody said at the time, that I had&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">torpedoed imperial federation,</block>

<p>simply because I have stood for this other alternative of free and equal union. And later on, when I had the opportunity to push this further idea home, I did my best to have it established in the central conception of the League of Nations. Do not let us get sidetracked in this debate. What I have stood for is what this conference has declared, and I am very glad it has been done.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>No, perhaps not. I may say, in reply to what the Minister of Finance has said, that these are very difficult matters. Unless you are a constitutional lawyer, unless you have had great experience of the working of political institutions, you cannot expect people to understand these matters clearly. What I say is that there is no new departure in this report, that the committee of the Conference of Imperial Relations purported to make no new departure. What they meant was, so far as it was possible without laying down a formal constitution for the empire, to express as clearly and succinctly as possible the actual practice which had grown up, and to follow that up by the removal of anomalies, historical anomalies which everybody admitted should be removed. I made an attempt some years ago to have some of these anomalies removed. The Prime Minister referred to a document which he has found amongst the papers in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s office. I made a gallant attempt; there was no idea of &#x201C; hands-upping.&#x201D; That is an opprobrious term which the Prime Minister should not apply to me. He knows that it does not fit me. Why apply it?</p>

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>No, circumstances were against me. The Prime Minister was right in <span class="col_1491-1492" refersTo="page_0815"/>his speech at Pretoria when he did not speak in bitterness, as he did this afternoon. Circumstances were against me in those days. Great changes have taken place, not so much in South Africa as in other parts of the empire. The Prime Minister met a different body of colleagues in the conference from those whom I met. The Prime Minister may take it from me that it is largely due to the fight that I put up for these new ideas that they had gained ground in the empire. There were more people willing to do things in the new light than there were years ago when I made my abortive attempt. There was no running away, not in the least. Now, I want us to understand what has been done, because I think the work done is good enough and great enough to stand on its own merits, without exaggeration, and without misrepresentation. The Imperial Conference purported to express in formal language and in deliberate language what was the practice, and to remove anomalies, and they have done that in a way for which I give them every praise. Do not let us to-day give any occasion for the idea that some revolutionary change has taken place in the empire. If you do that, it will recoil on you. Let people understand that this is the evolution which has been going on for a number of years, and to which expression, perhaps final expression, perhaps not, but to which formal expression has at last been given. That expresses the truth, and do not let us make people understand in the backveld or in any other part of the world that there has been a sort of somersault in the empire, that there has been a revolutionary change&#x2014;there has been nothing of the kind. If you look at the report itself you will see that this is what it purports to do, and what it purports to express. The report of the sub-committee on imperial relations opened with the statement that they could not, nor did intend to, write a constitution for the empire. They meant to recognize facts and put them in black and white, and they then proceeded to write down the formula which has been accepted as the new status. We have all read it; we are all pleased with it, and we all think it expresses the true position as it has developed and exists in the empire. Then they go on to say that this has been an evolution. The point that has been reached is the climax of an evolution that has been going on, and they say that there have been several alternatives which have been ruled out. They mention imperial federation, and they state the only alternative left was by way of autonomy for the dominions, and they make the further statement that every self-governing member of the empire is now master of its own destiny; there is no distinction; in fact, it is subject to no compulsion whatever. They state this, not as a new principle, but as a fact.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>A fact which many people would never recognize till now, especially in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smuts">

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but that is the value of this report. I agree with the Minister. The value of the report is that it is an explicit recognition of fundamental facts and existing practices, and that it removes doubts and suspicions. The report goes on, after a reference to India, to say that there are still existing administrative, legislative and judicial forms which are not formally in accord with this position and which have to be reformed, and they go on to mention what I call the historic anomalies and they provide machinery for the reconsideration of these with a view to then subsequent removal; the whole underlying idea of the report being this, that it expresses what exists in fact, but is sometimes subject to doubt, and also subject to historic anomalies. I find that this is the nature of the report, and I have been following with some care the statements which the principal actors have made about their work, and I want to quote to the House some of the statements made by some of these actors who were responsible for this document, as to what it purports to do, and what is the position as they understand it. In the first place, let me take the speech of Lord Balfour, who was chairman of this subcommittee, at Edinburgh University, of which he is chancellor. He refers to the great work of the conference, and he asks this question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What then was the change that has taken place? That is the question which we are asking to-night, and what everyone has been asking. What is the change exactly brought about at the Imperial Conference? People ask themselves this, and the reply was far from obvious, because it never had been denied for many years that the dominions were autonomous.</block>

<p>I will ask hon. members to listen to this, because it is all-important to clear up difficulties that might arise hereafter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been explicitly stated by persons in authority, not, indeed, in any mere formal fashion, but what was even more impressive than a formal statement, it bad been stated in the course of speeches as an accepted fact and stated before audiences which would certainly have expressed any objection had they entertained doubts on the subject.</block>

<p>The position of dominion equality had been accepted as a fact again and again. Then he goes on to refer to the war, and the great practical unity of the dominions in the war effort they made. He refers to the peace treaty and the part played by the dominions there alongside of Great Britain, and he winds up with this statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At this moment when at Geneva the League of Nations meets, the representatives of the dominions go there, of course, on equal terms with any other nation in the world.</block>

<p>He quotes this as existing practice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is quite true that, as a matter of arrangement among ourselves, the representatives of the empire are in constant and friendly communication. All their constitutional <span class="col_1493-1494" refersTo="page_0816"/>powers as members of the league are identical with the constitutional power of any other state in the world from the greatest to the smallest. Now, if that is so, and if it was so before the conference of 1926, what, you may perhaps say, was there for the conference to do? In the first place, I think this absolute equality of status, was, perhaps, more obvious to the home country than it was to one or two at least of the dominions.</block>

<p>Well, Lord Balfour is a deep man, and I am not going to probe into his thoughts. But evidently that was the practice, but there was some doubts and, in one or two of the dominions there were questions. I have heard these questions too in South Africa. He goes on to say that there were other small troubles, these historic anomalies and so on which were constantly being dragged in by constitutional lawyers and people who take a narrow view of the empire.</p>

<p>Yes, and the sort of politicians one comes into contact with sometimes.

<block name="quote">That was never held here, never I believe by thinking people. It was held, perhaps, in certain of the dominions, and it was all-important that when the Prime Ministers met together last November that they should singly and severally in their collective capacity, as well as in their private capacity, give their authority to what we in this country have long believed to be a true doctrine, the doctrine of the equality of status.</block>

<speech by="#smuts">

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister is wrong. The question of equality of status was never questioned. The trouble was about the minor anomalies and forms, and the question was whether the time had come for these changes. I can assure my hon. friend that among thinking people in authority in Great Britain I have never found this doctrine questioned since 1917, when that resolution was passed about imperial federation. I had never heard this question of the autonomy of the dominions and their equality with the Mother country questioned in any way. This is the statement of Lord Balfour, that the conference did not purport to do more than give expression to what they believed to be the actual position in the empire, and I find the same position is taken up by the other leading actors. I have here a speech made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir A. Chamberlain, a few days after the conference at Bristol, and this is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He had come from the conclusion of the Imperial Conference with the profound assurance that all which lay at the root of his father&#x2019;s policy was henceforth safe. Whatever might be the methods by which our unity expressed itself, in any time of stress or trouble the several self-governing nations of the British empire would stand one and undivided before the world. Before the conference a certain anxiety prevaded the empire as to what might be the result and consequences of it, but we have come out of the conference with a better understanding of one another than we had ever had. There had been the removal of suspicions, misapprehensions and fears that his Majesty&#x2019;s Government here in Great Britain assumed an over-lordship over the other free governments of the empire which no British statesman for 30 years thought of claiming, much less of exercising.</block>

<p>It is this bogey which has become almost an obsession with the Prime Minister, that some one was trying to lord it over the dominions.</p>

<speech by="#smuts">

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain says that one of the most solid and beneficial results of the conference has been to lay that ghost, and I hope the speech of the Prime Minister this afternoon is the last time we shall hear about this. Let the ghost lie; do not let us raise it again. No one wants the super-state, and no sensible person wanted it, or should have wanted it, and, therefore, let us lay it to rest and face the world as free men, and not as slaves labouring under some fear of subjection. He goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The nations had, in the intimacy of personal conference, not merely agreed upon a report, but had put ideas into a common stock, out of which each one had gained a greater appreciation, not only of his liberty, but of his responsibilities, a greater assurance that his liberties were not only safeguarded by the observation of these responsibilities, but could find the fullest development only in the close union of all, and the pursuit of common ideals and policy.</block>

<p>Sir Austin Chamberlain goes even further. He says not only was there this written result which we find as a formulation of status in the empire, but there was an exchange of ideas; misunderstandings were removed, and all felt that in the continuance of the empire, and in the pooling of resources and the sharing of responsibilities there would be the best prospect for each and all. Mr. Bruce, on his way to Australia, passed through Canada, where he made a number of speeches, and I find that at Ottawa he was reported to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1495-1496" refersTo="page_0817"/>The result of the Imperial Conference created no new constitutional position. It defined clearly what had been the practice since the war.</block>

<p>I quote him simply to bear out this position I am stating&#x2014;that this conference simply did their best to express the existing practice and position of the empire. Mr. McKenzie King, the Prime Minister of Canada, spoke in a similar sense in Toronto at a great party meeting&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No attempt was made to lay down a constitution for the empire; the committee on imperial relations sought rather to formulate an authoritative sanction for rights which they contended should no longer be questioned.</block>

<p>On the same day he made a speech in which he tried to meet some of the criticisms of the Prime Minister of South Africa, who had been reported as making some statement about the empire which had had an upsetting effect in Canada, and he tries to reply to it. The statement which was cabled as having been made by our Prime Minister here was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Gen. Hertzog said that the empire signified to us nothing more than a mere name indicating our common adhesion, together with other peoples, to the Crown.</block>

<p>I do not know whether the Prime Minister made it, and I make no charge on the basis of this report. It was reported in the London papers that he had said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The empire is a mere name, and expresses nothing more than common adhesion to the Crown.</block>

<block name="quote">It looked to him as if Gen. Hertzog had been trying to remove obstacles to imperial unity, and a wrong interpretation was placed on his words. The attitude of Gen. Hertzog and President Cosgrave at all times suggested a desire for imperial unity.

<p>Our Prime Minister made a similar statement in Cape Town on his arrival, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have no fear of that empire any longer (Cheers.)</block>

<p>Quite right; the change has not been with the empire, but with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister went on to say</p>

<block name="quote">And the reason why I have no fear of that empire any longer is because of what has been done and achieved by the Imperial Conference. The Imperial Conference has done this, which I consider the greatest work which has ever been done by any Imperial Conference&#x2014;it has brought things to definite clearness.</block>

<p>Now I say this, that all this shows that the Imperial Conference, instead of creating a revolution and making a new departure in the empire, has been logically following the course which it and the empire have always followed, stabilized the position by expressing clearly what has been the practice hitherto. We would be committing a great mistake, and we would be doing serious injury and opening the door to very grave misunderstandings in future, if we gave countenance to the idea in any form that more than that was done.

<p>If the Prime Minister considers for a moment what his words mean, they do not express the opinion even of his own party. Many of his own people, in spite of all the hot air about secession and rebellion, in their very heart of hearts were not anxions to go out of the empire. And the proof is the great and sudden conversion that has happened. Like a bolt from the blue, the party has shifted its ground, dropped secession and the republic and all constitutional questions, and accepted with both hands what is so graciously given to us. That only proves that my feeling is correct&#x2014;that there has not been this will to go out of the empire to which our Prime Minister gave expression.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows me too, and when he is in trouble he will turn to me. I do believe that if we gave this country a chance, we have a God-given opportunity to-day to get out of this bog in which we have been wandering for years. The principal difficulty has been the constitutional question. People of all parties have been longing to get out of that atmosphere and to devote themselves to practical questions of progress and construction. Hon. members opposite may be mistaken in their ideas of public policy, but they have also done their best in the last couple of years to push on this country. Why can&#x2019;t we drop all these foul recriminations? We have this chance now that is given to us by this great settlement in London. Let us follow it up, and see whether it is not possible to build up a new atmosphere of co-operation and constructive effort in South Africa. It is because I have come to this debate in this spirit that I deplore the tone of the Prime Minister. I am sure that speech did not represent his real self. He was fighting a bogey, something he had conjured up in his own mind. We are friends, we want to work together; to build up a new atmosphere, and to build up our own country now that the greatest difficulty has been removed from our path. I trust that when the Prime Minister returns to the subject, as he has promised to do, that he will do so in this spirit, and that we shall all agree to let bygones be bygones, and not twit each other as to what happened years <span class="col_1499-1500" refersTo="page_0819"/>ago, and not stand by what was said in 1912, but move on and give this country at last a chance for which it has been longing for years.</p>

<p>I must say that my political history teaches me to prefer the spirit of harmony which has breathed out of every word of the leader of the Opposition. I am very glad to see that the right hon. gentleman is no longer going to attack the National party, or the leader of the party, the Prime Minister of South Africa. I am also glad that the position has changed so entirely since the days before the Prime Minister left South Africa, for when he left South Africa and made his speech in Cape Town, we had all the newspapers of the north and south dissenting from that speech. When he made his first speech in London, we had a chorus saying the constitutional position laid down by him was absolutely wrong, and that he was only speaking for his own party. The &#x201C; Rand Daily Mail, &#x201D; &#x201C; Star.&#x201D; &#x201C; Cape Times,&#x201D; and the Argus &#x201D; all said the statements he made were not in accordance with facts. I am very glad to hear from the leader of the Opposition that all these statements by the Prime Minister were absolute facts at that time. I am speaking rather as a doubting Thomas&#x2014;not at the present time, but from 1912 onwards&#x2014; for when my honoured leader and friend was speaking of the British empire as consisting of a number of equal States, I felt it very difficult to accept that position. When the leader of the Opposition, after the conclusion of the war, said we had a higher status in South Africa, I felt equal difficulty in accepting that position. I could not see at what stage South Africa had become a nation equal in status with the different nations of the British empire and of the United Kingdom. I had the same difficulty that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) had. I am not going to join in the chorus of condemnation, because the chorus includes the leader of the Opposition. I am not going to join in that chorus of condemnation of the hon. member for Yeoville, because I believe at the time he made his speech his statement was absolutely correct. We had the bigger battalions against each other, so we can sympathize with each other. The opinion I have always held is this, that at no time prior to the last Imperial Conference did the dominions have equal status with the United Kingdom. In that I differed from my leader, the leader of the Opposition, and certain leading statesmen, not only of this country, but of England, but the vast majority of the people of this country were in agreement with me. Most of them liked that position, but I did not. That was the difference between us. Speaking for myself, I knew of no stage at which the different parts of the British empire obtained equal status, and I could not see how that status could ever be reached unless the &#x201C; senior partner &#x201D; made a declaration in favour of the &#x201C; junior partners &#x201D; to that effect. When you have judges laying down the law, they say, &#x201C; This has been the law for all time,&#x201D; although they may have given utterance to it for the first time. I would like to make clear the position of those who, like myself, tried to find out what the position was. The leader of the Opposition never enunciated the doctrine that the dominions were equal in status to Great Britain. He enunciated the doctrine that we had acquired a higher status.</p>

<p>The speech as reported was not pandemonium, hut a very sensible-sounding one, only it was on the wrong side. I do not think there is very much that we are quarrelling about on this point. The right hon. gentleman and all the members of his party took up the position that we were not equal to the United Kingdom. They all of them told us in this House that this country had no right of secession; no right to secede from the British empire. Has the United Kingdom the right to secede if she wishes to do so? If she has the right to secede, and the dominion of South Africa has not the right to secede, then they cannot be equal, or words have no meaning. Will any of those members acknowledge that right to secede, and will any of them deny that right as far as the United Kingdom is concerned?</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I am not talking about morality, but what can be done constitutionally. With regard to this declaration from the Imperial Conference, obviously where absolute equality has now <span class="col_1501-1502" refersTo="page_0820"/>been freely conceded by the Imperial Conference that right exists. The fact of that right being conceded makes it much more difficult to exercise any rights of that kind. That is the true position, and that comes very near the point which my hon. friend opposite made when he said there is a moral right. There is not a single man in this House who can hind South Africa or following generations, but we all feel glad at this declaration of equality, made for the first time by any Imperial Conference and believed for the first time by a large majority of the people, that it is taking away for the first time in the relations of South Africa and the empire a large amount of friction and difficulty and the obstacle to the harmonious co-operation in the working of the different parts of the empire. I am giving a considerably larger amount of credit to my leader than that which he has taken to himself. I believe that the Imperial Conference constituted a break-away entirely from the history of the past. I admit one thing which has been simmering in the minds of men for many years and that led to this declaration, for up to the stage of that declaration by the Imperial Conference, there was no equality of status between the different parts of the empire, and that equality was laid down for the first time at the Imperial Conference. I believe that, for the first time, has made a change from the days when self-government was granted to South Africa. What I am saying is largely of historical interest, because, so far as what is attained is concerned, all sides of the House are in substantial agreement. My friends will surely allow me to deal with some of the disputations and troubles of the past. Some months ago I declared that the constitutional question is dead in South Africa, and I think that is true. Equality of status has been attained, and it makes it unnecessary to deal with that matter to-day&#x2014;sentiments which are honestly held by a large proportion of the inhabitants of South Africa. They have the same sentimental feeling that I have, that is, to see a separate independence of South Africa, and not an independence within any other part of the world. We are, however, prepared to concede the position to-day, and to say that the position has changed by this declaration, and we shall not make this sentiment a stumbling-block to the country, and we are prepared to admit that it is a position which provides the solution to these difficulties. Without that declaration, you would not have got the same feeling. At the same time, we are not so bound to republicanism as those on the other side who are bound to the extent of wanting republican colours in the flag. These matters are largely matters of historical interest to-day. We are pleased with the result, and it gratifies all of us. Practically everybody thought they were bound to South Africa alone, and felt they were working for a higher status which has culminated in this higher status to-day. I believe that is the position on all sides of the house, and I think, after the declaration, all sections will work to make that point, that there is no racial division in South Africa. You have very little racial differences outside the big towns. Go to the countryside of the Transvaal, and I think the hon. gentleman opposite will bear me out, that so far as the countryside of the Transvaal is concerned, you will not find racial differences. No. You find-your greatest feeling is between people of the same race.</p>

<p>Before this debate closes, I think it is only right that I should say a few words in answer to the criticism made by two members of the Opposition, in connection with the conference held between the Government of India and our Government in connection with the Asiatic question in South Africa. Let me begin by saying that I quite agree with what was said by at least one hon. member opposite, that this matter is a very delicate one, and that everything which is said in connection with the matter must in future be said with a great deal of care. The actual kernel of the agreement between our Government and that of India is that there shall be co-operation in the future between the two Governments for the solution of the Asiatic question in South Africa in such a manner which, at any rate, the largest part of the population of South Africa regards as the only practical way, viz., along the way of repatriation, or as it is better named, assisted emigration of Indians out of South Africa. That supported emigration from South Africa has been agreed upon between the two Governments, and the success of it depends, it goes without saying, on practical cooperation between the two Governments. And just because it is a matter of co-operation between them and us, it is possible that in South Africa, and also in this House, things may be said which will make it impossible for the Government of India to do what they have undertaken, viz., to assist us with the repatriation. I am very glad that the appeal which I made in this House when I gave a résumé of the agreement was well responded to on the part of responsible people in India. The agreement was not universally welcomed in India, nor was it approved in all respects. I think I can say that the view there as to the agreement is correctly given by Ghandi, who has expressed himself much in the same way as the hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt), who said it was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">like the curate&#x2019;s egg, in some respects good, and in others not good.</block>

<p>But yet the preponderating view was that, in the circumstances, it was the best that could be done to preserve peace and quiet between South Africa and India, and to solve the question in South Africa as far as is possible at the moment. As hon. members know, it was notified in India that the matter would be discussed on a certain date, but to avoid an unpleasant discussion in the legislative assembly of India, and also in the press and in the country, the leader of the Opposition, to call him by that name, agreed that no debate should take place in the legislative assembly. I am very glad that the same spirit inspires the Indians, the leaders of Indian public opinion in our country. A few days ago a conference of Indians took place in Johannesburg. Sharp criticism was made there by certain Indians on the agreement entered into, but yet the decision on the question was just like that in India, viz, that, although there was much to be deprecated from their point of view in the agreement, it was still worth much in the circumstances, and that they would assist in carrying it out. I just want to say here that we are indebted as a Government, and as a people, for the co-operation of the Indians as decided at the Johannesburg congress, to the activities and influence of the Rev. Mr. Andrews. He came to South Africa with the intention of advizing the Indians, and to obtain co-operation between us and India. We had a conference, the result was made known, and then Mr. Andrews employed his energies to get the Indians in South Africa satisfied, and to make them co-operate in carrying out the agreement. I say that we are indebted to him for the good work which he has done in the interests of India and South Africa. Let me add here that with regard to the debate about this matter in this House, I think there is in general no reason to complain about the attitude of hon. members of the Opposition. From the beginning it was a foregone conclusion in the discussions in the select committee and elsewhere, that the debate on this matter would be conducted as one which should be above party politics, and the members of the select committee from beginning to end regarded the matter from that standpoint. I want here to express my conviction that from the beginning they aimed at the interests of South Africa with regard to this matter. I also want to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the press in general for the good work they have done in the matter. I had an opportunity last year, and again this year, to appeal to the press to do their best for South Africa in this delicate matter, and to try to keep the whole matter above party politics, and to keep out of the papers everything which could excite feeling, either here or in India, and which would hinder a satisfactory solution. Last year, and again this year, before the agreement was published, I had the opportunity to take the leaders of the press into my confidence about everything that had taken place, and I am glad to say that the press almost, without any exception, did its duty, and fully justified the trust reposed in it. What I have said here about our hon. friends opposite is said in general. I am sorry that I cannot say it of all the hon. members who took part in the debate a few days ago, and I am speaking more particularly of the hon. members for Ermelo (Col.-Cdt. Collins) and Newcastle (Mr. Nel). When I think of their two speeches, then I must say that I have seldom heard more irresponsible speeches in this House in connection with such a delicate matter, as the relations between ourselves and India, and the agreement which has been entered into. The hon. members must not forget that every word uttered in this debate is probably cabled to India. As I said, the agreement aims at co-operation between the two Governments in connection with the aided emigration of Indians, and everybody will understand that the Government of India, in the assistance it can give in connection with the repatriation of Indians, cannot go further than what its own people will permit. If speeches are made here which provoke feeling there, <span class="col_1505-1506" refersTo="page_0822"/>then it will practically stultify the whole object of the conference. Therefore, I am very sorry that that tone was used in the debate. The only thing that counteracts it is that I know that hon. members who spoke like that do not represent the view of their own party, and that the great majority of their party support the agreement which we have entered into, and the attempt to find a satisfactory solution in that way. Let me say further to the hon. members that if they think the agreement is so objectionable and so absolutely conflicting with the interests of South Africa&#x2014;</p>

The hon. member for Ermelo commenced by saying in general that in entering into the agreement with India, we had sacrificed everything, and he went further and said that we had betrayed the interests of South Africa.

<p>Let me ask whether the prohibition which there is on emigration by them has been sacrificed. The hon. member will acknowledge that in that respect nothing has been given away. Let me ask the hon. member whether we have given away anything in connection with the franchise in the existing laws. Did we, by the agreement, agree to give the vote to the Indians in the Transvaal, Natal or the Free State, or that they would get it at any time? Did we agree to the deprivation of the municipal franchise in Natal, which was taken away a few years ago, should again be altered, and that we should return to the old position? I do not think he will say yes. An Act was passed by the House last year which also affects Asiatics, viz., the so-called colour bar Act. Did we agree to its being amended? I do not think the hon. member will have the courage to say yes. It remains unaltered. Have we lightened the prohibition so far as it exists to-day with reference to the going of Indians from one province to the other, from what it has hitherto been? One of the two members said here that he wanted to appeal to the Free State, which has always kept Indians out of that province, to protest against the new position which we were now creating. Now I ask whether the existing laws prohibiting Indians going from one province to the other have been made more lax. I want to ask, further, regarding the existing laws in the Transvaal whether any of them have been altered. All of them remain the same as they have hitherto been on the statute book, and there is no agreement to alter those laws. Let me go further and ask whether the right which Parliament has, or which any Government has to at any time hereafter pass legislation it may like in connection with the Asiatic question has been sacrificed.</p>

It is an understood thing, even by the other side of the conference, that the right which South Africa has to deal with the question in the future by legislation was not affected in the least. I stated that in broad outline clearly to the House when I announced the results of the conference. If I made a wrong statement, then one would surely have expected a repudiation. That has not taken place, and thus it can be accepted that if the way we are now following does not turn out a success, we can introduce legislation.

<p>I will tell the hon. member one point which we conceded, something which was asked by the Indian Delegation, and upon which we met them. It was that if the Indians make use of our aided emigration scheme and receive our bonus, they shall not in future be asked on the day they leave South Africa to sign a document that they forever renounce the right of returning to South Africa, and give up the right of domicile. It was altered to read that they may not return during the first year, but that during the second or third year they will still have the opportunity of returning on certain conditions. The conditions are that if a whole family have gone as a unit, then the whole family must return as a unit, and that everything which has been paid by our Government to allow them to go to India, shall be refunded by them on the other side before they embark. The reason why that agreement was entered into is very plain. It was to assist emigration from South Africa. It is in the interest of repatriation simply because a large number of the Indians that go out under the repatriation scheme are people who have not been in India for years, and who as to more than a third of their number have never yet been in India. If these people were asked, therefore, on the day they left our coasts to renounce all right of returning, then they argue that they are burning their boats behind them. They do not know the conditions in India, and the whole position is, therefore, so uncertain that they might prefer to remain in South Africa. <span class="col_1507-1508" refersTo="page_0823"/>If, however, they are given an opening to return to South Africa on certain conditions, then there will be many more Indians who will avail themselves of the emigration scheme. It is in the interests of repatriation that this one concession was made. The scheme has been worked out, and we have provided the best possible guarantees that it shall not be abused.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>We will analyze it. If the hon. member referred to the Asiatic policy of the country in general, then I ask him how that tallies with what was subsequently said in the debate by the hon. member for Dundee, viz., that in the agreement we had entered into, we had simply carried out the policy of the previous Government in connection with the matter. I repeat that if the hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt) is right, then the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) is quite wrong and vice versa. What does the hon. member actually mean by saying that we have abandoned the policy of the past entirely? Is it not a duty of the Government of the country to uplift all portions of our permanent population. I ask the hon. member if it is the policy of his party that a portion of the permanent population of South Africa should not be up-lifted, that we should adopt a policy of repression towards a portion of the population. If the hon. member says that that is not his policy, then I ask him what objection he has to the clause in the agreement where we speak of the upliftment of the Indians who are permanently established in South Africa. A policy of repression would not only be heartless, but also shortsighted. If the hon. member, by his statement that we have abandoned the policy of the past means that we have dropped the policy of repatriation, then I say he has wrongly read the whole agreement, and entirely misunderstood it, because the whole spirit of the agreement is nothing else than, in co-operation with the Government of India, to repatriate Indians. As far as I know the history of the Indians in South Africa, the scheme as worked out at the conference is the first comprehensive and practical repatriation scheme which will be carried out with the co-operation of the Government of India while the Government of India retains its self-respect and honour.</p>

<p>What about the land question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. I must say that there is one point in respect of which the policy followed in the past has been very effectively altered, and that is with regard to the immigration of Indians from abroad. According to the so-called Smuts-Gandhi agreement which was given effect to in the Indian Relief Act of 1914, wives of Indians domiciled in South Africa could always still come in, if such an Indian did not have another woman to whom he was married or with whom he lived, or had had children by another woman. Moreover, minor children of an Indian could also come in, i.e., children under 16 years, and the result of that was that about 600 more Indians came into the country every year, while we, on the other hand, did our best to get Indians out of the country. On inquiry, it appeared that the 600 Indians were almost all young boys, almost no women or young girls. It appeared that a very large percentage of the children only came for a very short time to South Africa, and were then sent back again to India. The reason is quite clear. When once the children were in South Africa they had the right, under the existing law of domicile, and after that right was given to them they returned to India. They retained for their lives the right to come back to South Africa, and to live and carry on business here. That was not the intention of the Smuts-Gandhi agreement, and in the new agreement we have in place of that incorporated the clause which was also included in the resolution of the 1918 Imperial Conference, by which the coming in of the children would indeed be permitted, but only if it were clear that the family, as a family, was domiciled in South Africa. If the mother did not accompany them, or was not living in South Africa, the children would in future not be permitted to come in, and if we go into the figures we see that by this provision about 85 per cent. of the immigrants who were still coming in every year are prohibited. Immigration has thus practically been stopped. In connection with that, the hon. member for Ermelo said, viz., that according to the agreement the Government had resolved to give decrepit Indians returning to India a pension. I already, by means of an interjection while the hon. member was speaking, asked him if he wanted us to do so. He then evaded the point. It is surely clear from the agreement to anyone using his commonsense that, instead of a bonus to old, decrepit Indians who possibly take a large family with them, a small pension can be given. In other words, he will, instead of a lump sum, be able to receive a small payment when he returns to India. This can take place instead of a bonus or as an addition to a bonus, but in any case it is something which it is not necessary to do; it merely may be done, and it is clearly said in the agreement that it entirely depends on the sole discretion of the Union Government. It was only suggested to encourage further emigration. Is the hon. member opposed to that? At the same time, it is provided that the sum which can be made available for that purpose shall not be more £500 per annum. What, then, <span class="col_1509-1510" refersTo="page_0824"/>is the objection of the hon. member for Ermelo? He said, further, that the agreement stated that art Indian, after he had been away three years, lost the right of domicile, but he now makes out as if the Government intends so to alter the existing Immigration Act that it shall be made to apply to everybody, and he said that the result would be that we should be deprived of our South African citizenship. The hon. member should first of all inform himself fully before he dares to say such a thing in the House&#x2014;a thing which is quite incorrect. The right of domicile on the part of anyone born in South Africa or who acquired that right in South Africa is not in the least affected by such amendment of our immigration laws. If anyone comes from Europe, even if he has never yet been in South Africa, then domicile or the right of domicile has absolutely nothing to do with the matter. The question is whether he can com ply with the immigration laws or not. If it has nothing to do with the man who comes to. South Africa for the first time, why should it apply in the case of the man who leaves our coasts and comes back again? In the circumstances. I think the view of those hon. members has not the least value. Let us now come to the question of education, to which, on the ground of what is said in the agreement, there was considerable objection by the two hon. members. With regard to higher education, I can say that if the hon. members object to what is said in connection with the matter, then they must object to the existing condition of things. There is an institution for higher education in the country to-day at Fort Hare, where Indians are admitted. There is a number of Indians studying there and receiving higher education, and they come from Natal. All that is said in connection with higher education is that the Indians in the country to-day shall not be excluded, and that if there are complaints that there is no proper accommodation for them, then the Government will consider the removal of any existing grievances in that respect. [Time limit extended.] A further observation has been made about what is said in regard to lower education, with special reference to Natal. I am glad that the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) assures us that he is not in favour of a policy of the repression of Indians, and that he is in favour in so far as the Indians are a permanent part of South Africa, and will remain so in the future, that it is our duty as a Government to see that their upliftment shall be provided for. It goes without saying that if this is not done, the whole population of, South Africa will suffer through it. Why, then, should the provision be objected to that we would submit the desire of the delegates from India to the Provincial Council of Natal, to wit, that in Natal an inquiry shall; made into the condition of education for the Indian Community? Let me tell the hon. member that that need for an inquiry to place the position of the Indians on a better footing was not first expressed by us. If the hon. member will take the trouble to read annual reports of the Natal superintendent of education, he will see that it is clearly stated there The superintendent of education in Natal has almost annually pointed out the position, which is highly unsatisfactory, and he says that it cannot remain so, and that something must be done. All we said was that as there is dissatisfaction, and Natal itself admits that there is room for improvement, we would submit the wishes of the Indian delegation to the Provincial Administration of Natal, and would ask whether Natal will not do the same thing as the Cape has done in connection with coloured education, viz., to appoint a commission to inquire into the position and to make a report, not to the Union Government, but to the Provincial Administration of Natal. It is for the administration of Natal to deal with the position as it pleases. Has the hon. member any objection to that? No, he has none. And, therefore, that objection also falls away.</p>

<p>Is the Union Government to pay for the education?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The Union Government to-day pays a subsidy for education of all children throughout the country, including Natal. Now we come to a point mentioned by the hon. member for Dundee, and it is in connection with trading licences. A construction is given to the clause which, as I said by way of interjection, cannot be read into it. What is meant by the clause is precisely what it says. Let me read the clause in question again to the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the time for reviewing the existing trade licensing laws comes, the Union Government will give all due consideration to the suggestion made by the Indian delegation, that the power of direction of the local bodies should be amended in the following ways.</block>

<p>That must be read in conjunction with what precedes, viz., that it is difficult for the Union Government to take steps which are opposed to public opinion, and because of the difficulty which arises from the constitutional system of the Union, viz., the duties entrusted to the central Government, the Provincial Council and the small local bodies. As a matter of fact, it was made clear at the conference that we have the provincial system in South Africa, and that primary education, under which primary education for Indians is included, was not a matter for the Union Government, but for the provincial administrations. There was no complaint in connection with the other provinces, but specially in connection with Natal, and it was made clear that the principle of the Union Government was not to interfere with the functions of the Provincial Councils, unless it was in the interests of the Union and that therefore as a Government we could not interfere in the matter. The Indian delegation also admitted that those licensing laws existed, and that it is not practical <span class="col_1511-1512" refersTo="page_0825"/>to-day to alter those laws. Those laws if they are ever to be altered and made more favourable have only a chance to be so altered if along the lines laid down in the agreement, we have in a great measure solved the question; in other words, if the success of the agreement has brought about the removal of the fear on the part of the white men of the competition by Indians.</p>

<p>The emigration scheme. If the question is solved in such a way that the fear of competition by Indians is in a great measure removed, then there is a friendly spirit, and then it is possible to amend the licensing laws as is there desired. What they want at this stage is that their wish should be recorded in the way done, so that if the time arrives that the Acts are revized, it will be clear to us and to the provincial administration, which alone has the right of acting in the matter, what the wishes of the Government of India are.</p>

<p>In any case I have explained the position of things, and I have repeated what I stated in an interjection, viz., that that interpretation was also given in India by Gandhi himself, because one of the things about which he complained was that legislation remained unaltered and that the position remained as it was in the past.</p>

<p>Now there was another argument of the hon. member for Ermelo, which was repeated in the question asked by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). It was asked how many of the Indians belonging to the trading class would leave South Africa. The hon. member for Ermelo only spoke of the Transvaal. In this connection I want to ask a counter-question. How many of the trading class would in any case leave South Africa unless we obtained compulsory repatriation?</p>

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>How many of them would, in any case, have left South Africa under the Bill introduced in 1924 by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan). In his Class Areas Bill the vested rights of the Indians were protected, and in the Bill which I introduced last year the vested rights of the Indians were similarly protected, in other words, all the traders in the Transvaal are, for the most part, themselves the cause of the state of affairs existing in the Transvaal. What was the position with regard to the issue of licences in the Transvaal until quite recently? Anybody could go to the post office, and, on payment of £1, could get a licence to establish a business. I think, therefore, that it is not quite right to come here now and expect us to introduce legislation to take away the vested rights which the people acquired and have possibly possessed for years and to simply put them out of the country. It is, I think, not fair to expect that. But by the agreement with India with regard to repatriation, there is, in any case, more chance than formerly that the number of trading Indians leaving the country will also be larger than formerly. Now, however, I ask the hon. member for Newcastle what their solution is if they do not concur in the agreement.</p>

</speech>

<p>The Bill of last year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I will not take the whole Bill, but just one point on which the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) has laid great emphasis, viz., the sale of ground to Indians. That is accordingly his solution. Let me, in the first place, point out that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) in 1924 introduced the Class Areas Bill, which was mainly based on the report of the Asiatic Commission of 1921. The recommendations of the commission say that only in parts of Natal Indians should in future, under certain circumstances, no longer be allowed to buy ground. That stipulation was not contained in the Bill of 1924. Thus, if the hon. member for Newcastle has a grievance in this connection against the present Government, then he must also have it against the last Government. But let me further point out to the hon. member that the Asiatic Bill that I introduced was referred to a select committee, which took a great deal of evidence last year, especially from Natal. And what was the evidence from Natal. To a great extent the evidence was opposed to the provision in the Bill preventing Indians from buying ground in Natal, because the Indians who are now spread over Natal, would all, so they feared, go to Durban and its neighbourhood. What solution then do the hon. members suggest? Do they want compulsory repatriation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>No.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that he does not wish it, because if he did, then I can assure him that it is quite impracticable. The hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) already expressed the fear in this connection last year, that it would lead to reprisals in India, and that we should feel the effects of it. In compulsory repatriation the Government of India would never collaborate. That would not only arouse dissatisfaction among the Indians in South Africa, but the people of India, also, would compel the Government there to keep out every single Indian who came from South Africa. They have the international right to do that, and the result would therefore be that emigration of Indians from our country would entirely stop. Does the hon. member then wish voluntary repatriation, by which, in every possible <span class="col_1513-1514" refersTo="page_0826"/>manner, the Indians will be encouraged to go to India, and which will have the co-operation of the people and of the Government of India? But that is exactly what the conference effected. It is the only way of getting the co-operation of India, without which repatriation would be a failure. Does the hon. member not agree that voluntary repatriation is worth much more?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad the hon. member admits that it is worth something. Does the hon. member now think that a compulsory system in which India does not co-operate can be a success? If we were now to continue with the Bill of last year&#x2014;the hon. member knows what a storm it caused among the Indians in our country, and among the people of India&#x2014;then the only result would have been that the Government of India would have opposed the repatriation. The hon. member says we must go diplomatically to work. Will he say that that was diplomacy? Without the good spirit of co-operation which now exists, repatriation would be a failure. Let me point out that the voluntary repatriation since immediately after it was commenced has worked well. Since 1921 about three thousand per annum have been repatriated, but when the hon. member for Yeoville introduced his Class Areas Bill in 1924 emigration suddenly stopped, and was practically nil when we shortly afterwards came into office. We had to decide upon doubling the bonus, but yet we could not bring it up to more than one thousand a year. But when it was decided to hold a conference, and a better spirit commenced to prevail, repatriation immediately increased, with the result that last year 2,200 were repatriated. This shows that repatriation of Indians can only be a success if a good spirit prevails in India and among the Indians in this country. It would never have been a success if we had gone on with the Bill. What do the hon. members want then? Do they want repatriation with the co-operation of India, which is a success, or do they wish us to go on with the Bill and, in that way, make emigration a failure? Which of the two does the hon. member for Newcastle wish? I think any reasonable person, and anyone considering the interests of South Africa, will have to say that he choses the way which the conference adopted. I do not think that I need add anything more, because I hope there will be another opportunity later to return to the subject, when I introduce legislation into the House to give effect to the agreement in certain respects.</p>

<speech by="#alexander">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to have the opportunity on this occasion of congratulating the Government on two very great diplomatic achievements. The first one has been so ably dealt with on both sides that it would be quite unnecessary to do more than make a passing reference to it. But with regard to the Imperial Conference, I could not help thinking that it was admitted on all sides that matters often in doubt with regard to the status of the dominions, were until the Imperial. Conference gave a declaration, simply empty talk, and the Imperial Conference set the seal of judgment upon what had been merely contentious talk on the part of people before. We know that constitutional practice always goes far ahead of constitutional law. I venture to say it will be necessary also for Parliament to alter the Act of Union, because the Act speaks of Union under the Crown of Great Britain and Ireland, and that phraseology is out of line with the modern position. South Africa and the whole of the British empire and the other nations within the empire owe a great debt of gratitude to the Prime Minister for having raised, and for having so successfully carried through, this matter, that so far as one can see the declaration has been received with satisfaction throughout the civilized world. I consider that to be the greatest diplomatic achievement that the present Prime Minister could possibly have attained. The other great achievement has been this agreement with India in regard to our great Asiatic problem. I would never have spoken on this subject but for speeches delivered by two members of the Opposition, which, with their capacity to do mischief and injury to this great work, were so disturbing to me as a member of the select committee, that I felt it would not be right to allow those speeches to go by without any attempt to put the true position before the House and the country, and also to voice my protest against irresponsible and mischievous utterances of that kind which undo the work of great and sound statesmanship. Let me refer to this assumption that the Government have suffered a diplomatic defeat on this matter. So far as this Government is concerned, no greater diplomatic victory has ever been obtained than when we reached the unanimous decision of two governments on one of the most thorny and difficult problems which not only this country, but any part of the British empire, could have to face. I would like to ask hon. members whether they are telling the truth in regard to this, or whether the &#x201C; Cape Times &#x201D; which is always quoted to us is representing the true position, after the Minister of the Interior made the announcement to this House. The leading article stated, inter alia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In bringing this about, the Union Government has done good service to South Africa, to the world, and to the cause of the empire.</block>

<p>Some hon. members never face the problem, but talk as if it were possible to get rid of the Indians by some act of violence or by deportation, forgetting the fact that the majority of Indians in South Africa were born here. According to the figures put before the select committee, there were 161,339 Indians in this country, and of this number 102,323 are South African born. It has always been laid down that deportation cannot be applied to people born in South Africa. At the <span class="col_1515-1516" refersTo="page_0827"/>Imperial War Cabinet in 1917. Gen. Smuts, referring to the difficulties regarding the Indian question, said that it was because of the fear of the Union being swamped, and not because of the Union&#x2019;s attitude towards the question of Asia, that South Africans had adopted an attitude which had assumed the outward form but not the reality of intolerance. Gen. Smuts said he felt certain that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Once the white community in South Africa were rid of the fear that they were going to be flooded by unlimited immigration from India, all the other questions would be considered subsidiary, and become easily and perfectly soluble.</block>

<p>The only way to put a stop to illegal immigration across the Union border was by agreement with Portuguese East Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member cannot expect me to break off in my argument to answer his interruptions. Mr. Burton used these words at the Imperial Conference in 1918, and I give this as the answer to the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as we are concerned, it is only fair to say, and it is the truth, that we have found that the Indians in our midst in South Africa, who form in some parts a very substantial portion of the population, are good, law-abiding, quiet citizens, and it is our duty to see that they are treated as human beings with feelings like our own and in a proper manner.</block>

<p>That is the answer to the hon. member. Now just a word with regard to Natal. Hon. members who speak for Natal do not do justice to the position. They always speak as though there is an alien population introduced against the wishes of the people of Natal, entirely ignoring the historical facts of the case. The House and the country should know that when Natal was annexed in 1843 this is what the proclamation said&#x2014;</p>

I do not say that everything in this settlement satisfies me any more than it has satisfied the Indian community, but what I do say is that, and large and as a substantial settlement between two great nations, it represents, not a diplomatic victory, but a diplomatic achievement on both sides, and it has solved one of the most difficult of racial problems touching the question of a nation&#x2019;s honour. There are two things which have made this a difficult problem in South Africa. One is the fear on the part of the Europeans that they were going to be swamped. That fear since the stoppage of immigration of Indians in 1913 has been entirely groundless. The rate of increase of the Indians is less than the rate of increase of the Europeans. The figures show every census that proportionately the Indians of South Africa are not increasing but rather diminishing in relation to the European. The proportionate number of Indians has been steadily going down, according to the figures. Let me endorse what the Minister has said, that your emigration or repatriation scheme would be absolutely foredoomed to failure if some such agreement had not been arrived at. When the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan) was Minister of the Interior, and it was known that there was legislation coming forward dealing with the Asiatics, what was the result? The result was that the figures in regard to voluntary repatriation steadily went down, and the Indians said <span class="col_1517-1518" refersTo="page_0828"/>that as a point of honour we will not take advantage of this scheme to go back to India. There is only one way of steadily reducing the number of the Indian population, and that is to carry out the spirt of this agreement.</p>

<p>The rate of increase is less for the Indian population than for the European. If the hon. member will come to me when the debate is over I will be pleased to give him the figures. They are established facts and not my figures. If once the hon. member, and those who think with him, see the reduction of the Indian population, they will applaud that agreement with both hands. A large encouragement and a bonus are to be given. It has been estimated that in a few years&#x2019; time, as soon as this agreement gets into full working order, there will be an emigration from this country of 10,000 Indians a year. They will be received on the other side, not unknown and unrecognized, but the Government of India will receive them and give them a chance to settle on the land, in connection with their settlement schemes. They have not had that before. If there are countries in the East which like Indian labour to be sent to them, our emigrants will have a chance of participating. I must say I was surprised that in this civilized country there should be an hon. member who used that sneering phrase dealing with uplift. I am surprized that an hon. member should take exception to the fact that the Government was trying to uplift one section. Let us look at the matter in an impartial way. Whether you look at the Indian as a nuisance or a danger, or whether you look upon them, as I regard them, as good South Africans, it is surely to give them the best chance of rising to the highest scale in civilization. How can anybody object to a section, which he regards as submerged, from being lifted up? It is in the interests of South Africa that this uplift should take place. I would also like to remind hon. members that what has happened is that oppressive legislation has been postponed&#x2014;that is the one tangible thing the Indians have obtained from this agreement. It was for me a great satisfaction to receive a telegram from the Rev. Mr. Andrews to the effect that the Indian congress unanimously accepted the Round Table conference agreement and promised help to work it. These hon. members will feel thoroughly ashamed of themselves when they see the working of this agreement, and the important thing it will be for South Africa. Some years ago one of England&#x2019;s great poets addressed a poem to Queen Victoria in these words, which are fit to be quoted in connection with this great achievement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And statesmen at her council met</block>

<block name="quote">Who knew the seasons when to take</block>

<block name="quote">Occasion by the hand, and make</block>

<block name="quote">The bonds of freedom wider yet.</block>

<p>Then there is the invitation to the Government of India to send their representative here, which will mean that all these difficulties and possibilities of friction ought never to recur, because there will be somebody here as the representative of the Government of India to act as an intermediary and to render the agreement smooth in its working and capable of being carried out in the letter as in the spirit. These hon. members to whom I have already referred have made one other mischievous remark, which is that South Africa will not tolerate interference&#x2014;an absurd remark to make. Do they realize that this is the first instance in the British empire in which two governments, one of which, that is India, is not a dominion, have been able themselves to arrive at an agreement without any consultation with or interference from any other Government although there is a Secretary of State in the British Cabinet who specially directs the affairs of India. In spite of that fact, this matter has been settled between these two governments without interference of any sort or description from London, and without the Imperial Government participating, which is a great diplomatic achievement. There was the greatest possible freedom for these two governments to come together and consult together to arrive at their conclusions without having to consult, and much less having been interfered with by, any other Government. I sincerely hope that whatever problems will come before this country the Government will go on the lines on which they have scored these two great diplomatic achievements&#x2014;the declaration at the Imperial Conference and the settlement of the Indian question. They have ignored racial considerations and prejudices and passions and party considerations. They have stood with their feet upon the rock of justice. So long as the Government keep their feet there I feel perfectly certain that every fair-minded man will realize that we have a Government which has emerged from the state of being politicians and have become statesmen.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the Government will not accept a motion for the adjournment of the debate seeing that members are tired after a long day. I would like to have been able to study the speech of the Minister of the Interior, but I understood this much of it, that he gave a very strong lecture to the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) and the hon. member for Ermelo (Col. Cdt. Collins) because they have dared to criticize the agreement which the Government have entered into. The Minister, however, must recognize that we do not all look at things from the same point of view, and that we have to represent our constituents whether their views please the Government or not. We have to say what we think is best in the interests of our constituents and the country generally. The Indian question affects Natal more than any other province, and Durban more than any other town. The people in the other provinces do not recognize the position of Natal and Durban and the seriousness of the position, because the other provinces are practically free from this problem and feel it very slightly. I would like to give a few figures to show the position. The figures were submitted to the conference <span class="col_1519-1520" refersTo="page_0829"/>by the Union statistical department. In 1921 the Indian population in South Africa was 161,339 divided as follows Natal 141,000; Transvaal 13,405; and the Cape 6,498. In 1926 the estimated Indian population in the Union was 173,959 divided as follows: Natal 151,000; Transvaal 15,747, while there was an increase of 100 or so in the Cape. In 1921 the Indian population in the thirty-mile coastal belt of Natal was 113,000 or 80 per cent. of the whole, while the Indians in the Durban district numbered 52,494. I think these figures ought to be considered. The Indians form a large proportion of the population of Durban and occupy a strong position in connection with our affairs. We are up against them at every turn; they mix with us in business and in pleasure and we are up against the problem every day. In 1921 63 per cent. of the total were born in the Union and 37 per cent. outside. In 1925 the land owned by Indians was 89,689 acres or one acre in every 125. The acreage of the coast belt was 73,873 and outside 16,000 acres. That shows what a firm hold they have. The trading licences issued through the Inland Revenue Department by the Natal Municipalities numbered, in 1925-&#x2019;26, 6,587, of which the large majority were general dealers and dealers in livestock and produce. Between 1921 and 1926 the births amounted to 36,766 while the number from deaths and repatriation was 24,000, leaving a net increase of 12,600 in five years. The Indians voluntarily repatriated since 1914 numbered 20,384 which is very small if taken per annum. The total expenditure since 1914 to date in bonuses, grants, fares, etc., was £186,000. These statistics show that the Indian population of the Union is increasing steadily and rapidly notwithstanding their comparatively high death rate and the repatriation which have been going on for some time. The statistics also show there has been a serious decrease of voluntary repatriation since 1923. There are various reasons and one is that word was passed round to the Indians not to go to India in such quantities because of the expected legislation. It is true the native and European population has also increased. It all points to the conclusion that the population of Natal is becoming overcrowded and that there is not room for Europeans, natives and Indians if they go on increasing at the present rate. Some of them must clear out or there will be continuous friction. There has been some already, as the Minister knows, but the only cure for this problem is that the Indian population in Natal shall be decreased.</p>
