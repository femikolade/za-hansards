<heading>UNION-CASTLE COMPANY AND FREIGHT AGREEMENT.</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>As hon. members are aware, the Government has for some time had before it proposals from different shipping interests in connection with the transport overseas of South African produce. Although there is adequate regular transport for our non-perishable exports, I think it is generally realised that this is not the case where our fruit and other perishable products are concerned. The volume of our perishable exports is steadily growing and for some time it has been increasingly evident that it is already beyond the capacity of the regular shipping services. For the proper marketing overseas of fruit, eggs and other perishable products, it is necessary that the transport should be regular as well as of such a nature as will enable them to be placed on overseas markets in proper condition. All possible avenues have been explored with the view to making arrangements for the provision of refrigerated shipping space, suitable, adequate and regular, to meet the demands of both the present and the future. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Government has been successful in achieving this and that an agreement has been entered into with the Union-Castle Company which will result in sufficient refrigerated space being regularly available to meet the demands for some years to come. The Perishable Products Export Control Board, which has, of course, been consulted in the matter, entirely concurs in the arrangements which have been made. The company has undertaken considerably to increase the refrigerated accommodation in its mail and intermediate ships, to arrange with some of the other regular lines to act similarly and to make itself responsible for the provision of other tonnage to lift regularly the bulk of the remaining cargo which cannot be coped with by the regular steamers. In this connection the refrigerated space in all the mail ships, with the exception of R.M.S. &#x201C;Saxon&#x201D; and &#x201C;Walmer Castle,&#x201D; is to be increased to approximately 2,500 tons of 55 cubic feet, whilst refrigerated accommodation up to 3,000 tons is being provided in the new mail ship at present under construction, and a similar amount will be provided in any mail ships constructed in the future. Shortly, the Union-Castle Company has undertaken to provide, if required, weekly refrigerated space for perishables during the deciduous fruit season 1928-&#x2019;29 up to 3,500 tons of 55 cubic feet, this weekly space being increased year by year until in 1932-&#x2019;33 up to 5,000 tons per week will be provided, if required. During the citrus seasons of &#x00CD;929 and 1930 up to 6,500 tons of space weekly is to be provided, whilst in 1931 and subsequent years, up to 7,000 tons per week will be provided, if required. The rates of freight for the conveyance of perishables will be the same whether the cargo is carried in the company&#x2019;s own ships or in other ships provided for the purpose, the fruit rates being 52s. 6d. per ton for citrus and 70s. per ton for deciduous, whilst the rate for eggs has been reduced to 70s. The freight rate for frozen beef has been established at 9-16d. per lb., which is equivalent approximately to &#x215B;d. below the existing rate from the Argentine to Europe. Arrangements are also being made for the provision of suitable accommodation for the transport of chilled meat upon six months&#x2019; notice being given. The foregoing rates include, in the case of Southampton, where the great bulk will be landed, conveyance free of all additional charges to Nine Elms Station in London. Included in the agreement are maximum rates for the conveyance of non-perishable products in connection with which considerable concessions have been secured in some cases. For instance, the maximum rate on wool, mohair, hides and skins has been reduced by 7&#x00BD; per cent., whilst among other reductions secured are reductions on brandy from 80s. to 70s., wine 60s. to 50s., dried fruit 50s. to 45s., third grade raisins 45s. to 40s., fruit pulp 60s. to 35s. and cotton 35s. to 32s. 6d. The company has undertaken if wool is pressed to the Australian standard to reduce the rate by 15 per cent. instead of by 7&#x00BD; per cent. One of the most important reductions is that secured in connection with maize, the maximum rate for bagged and bulk maize being fixed at 22s. 6d. and 21s. 6d. per 2,000 lbs. respectively. Provision for the conveyance of Government cargo <span class="col_1071-1072" refersTo="page_0602"/>from Europe to South Africa is also incorporated in the agreement, the rates for rails, metal sleepers, and for railway specialities, and other similar goods embraced in what is known as the basis rate classification, being the same as at present. But I am sure my commercial friends will be pleased to hear that all other cargo on Government account is to be conveyed at the same rates as those paid by the ordinary importer. The freight arrangements to which I have referred are applicable not only to goods shipped by Union-Castle steamers, but also to goods shipped by steamers of the conference lines generally, and it has been deemed desirable, therefore, to incorporate them in a separate agreement instead of linking them up with an agreement relating to the ocean conveyance of mails with which one company only is concerned. I may say that the Union-Castle Company concurs in this procedure. A separate agreement for the ocean conveyance of mails has not yet been entered into, but the House will be advised as soon as any arrangements in this connection have been completed. Suggestions have been made to the Government from time to time that a Shipping Board should be established to advise the Government on freight questions and shipping matters generally, and that on such board should be representatives of commerce, industries, agriculture, etc. Consideration is at present being given to the matter.</p>

<p>Before a person gets a meal he often has an appetiser and afterwards has a liqueur with his coffee in the lounge. As the clause is worded he cannot do that. The interpretation, apparently, is that the appetiser and the liqueur will not be consumed with a meal. I will therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>In paragraph (c) the Minister puts bottle stores under the same hours as those laid down by the municipalities for the closing of shops. That means in a place like Bloemfontein the bottle stores will have to close at 5 o&#x2019;clock in the winter and 5.30 in the summer. That is a hardship to the railway men and shop assistants who finish business at the same time. These men will then have to drift into the bars. Will it not be better to let them purchase liquor at a bottle store rather than drift into the bars? In the Free State they have bottle stores closing up to 8 o&#x2019;clock, but they voluntarily close at 6 p.m. I should like to move an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>I know, but only on the action of the licensing court, and then not everywhere. In the Transvaal all the licensing courts close the bottle stores on Saturday afternoons, except, I believe, in Boksburg. That is a reasonable proposition. It is a very unreasonable proposition to say that a man, having received his wages, cannot go and spend it on groceries, but he can go and buy from the bottle store.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barlow">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARLOW</person>:</from>

<p>I admit the hon. member&#x2019;s argument, but we can easily alter that. I do not want the opening on Saturday afternoon. I want it for the ordinary closing. They make you close your business at 5.30, and in some Free State towns at 5 o&#x2019;clock and some at 4.45 p.m., and that is the time I do not want the bottle stores to close. On Saturdays I am prepared to allow it to close in the afternoons.</p>

<p>I think there is a good case to be made out for it. On one occasion I went to see the licensing board at Wynberg, and I found there that shops must close at a certain time and on certain half days, whereas, during that same time, you leave bars and bottle stores and the like, open. It is nothing else but putting a premium on the sale of liquor. Every other shop in the place is closed except the liquor shops. I understood this Bill to be a Bill to promote temperance.</p>

<p>You do not want to promote the sale of drink, or to put a premium on the sale of drink. In the small town I belong to every shop is closed at a certain time on Saturday afternoon, except the liquor shops. Is that fair? Is that the way you regulate the sale of liquor? To my mind, it is a monstrous state of affairs that a man cannot go out to buy groceries, boots, etc., on Saturday afternoon, and yet, at the same time, he can go to a bar or bottle store and drink as much as he likes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I may say that the reason why this section has been inserted is that it has been laid down by the Cape courts, amongst other courts, that your bottle store and the wholesaler are shops in the <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0604"/>same sense as other places, which sell groceries, etc., are shops. Therefore, they are subject to the Shop Hours Ordinances of this country. That being so, we are simply clearing up that position that whatever hours are contained in this Bill they are subject to what the Shop Hours Ordinances say in regard to shops. Therefore, there is not much point in increasing the length of time beyond the hour of closing of the ordinary shop. This section as it is put in this Bill was never intended to apply to bars. A bar is not a shop. It is something very sui generis. We are dealing with your bar licence later on specifically. The proper place, I think, for the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) to voice his feelings would be when we come to the hours for bars. I do not think on the frame of this Bill his objection would fit into this particular clause.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>As far as I understand the law, at present the Cape hotels and the Natal hotels have the right of sale for off-consumption. I do not think that could affect the case, because they have this right of off sales under the hotel licence. I will go into that matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reitz">

<from>&#x2020;Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister will go into that point. There is one other matter and that is we are passing a Union Bill subject to Parliament and Union laws, and here, under sub-section (c), we are placing the liquor trade, so to speak, at the mercy of provincial legislation. We have had some curious examples of provincial legislation in the past, and yet we say here that these places shall be subject to any sort of regulation or legislation passed by the provincial authorities. In other words, we are relinquishing control as a Union under this section, and handing it over to the provincial authorities. That seems to me a wrong principle.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The trouble is, as I have pointed out, that the courts have held that your bottle stores, as being shops, are subject to the same conditions as any other shop. As a matter of fact, we could leave out sub-section (c) and it would not really affect the position. Assuming that we were to extend the hours, the provincial council could come back and repeal, as far as I understand, our provision under the Shop Hours Ordinance.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I said it had been held that they are shops.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#alexander">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in regard to certain provisions they may be shops, but not so far as hours are concerned. At present in the Cape the hours of bottle stores are fixed by the licensing board. In many respects their hours are shorter than the hours of ordinary shops. The Minister may be thinking of the Half Holiday Act, in respect of which the bottle store has been held to be in the same position as a shop. The point raised by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) was to my mind a reasonable one. It was a perfectly reasonable amendment, and the remarks of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) were perfectly apropos to this point, too. On the one hand shop hours are regulated by the provincial councils which, in some cases, hand over their authority to the local authority and, on the other hand, the licensing boards are constituted to decide when it is for the convenience of the public to close the licensed premises. If the board considers the shop hours are the proper hours at which to close, they have full authority to do it under this Bill. But you constitute a licensing board, and you say they should decide what is for the convenience of the public, and then you tie their hands and say if they decide the bottle stores should keep open an hour longer than the shop hours, they will not be allowed to do that. If you are going to leave it to the licensing board, then the sub-section should come out. If the boards think the arguments of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout are sound they can themselves reduce the hours. The hon. member says that in the Transvaal they have reduced the hours on many places to the same hours as shops. The temperance member for Bezuidenhout wants to tie these people hand and foot. If we had prohibition legislation I could understand that, but I cannot understand why you should prejudge the matter and tie the hands of impartial bodies. Let them decide in any given area what the hours shall be. It should be left entirely in the hands of the licensing board. I think this particular sub-section should not have appeared in the Bill, because it is mixing up two totally different things, the hours fixed by the local authorities for shops and the hours fixed by the licensing boards for licensed premises.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#krige">

<from><span class="col_1077-1078" refersTo="page_0605"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>I also think that we are taking away the right of fixing the hours from the licensing boards and giving it to the provincial councils. The licensing boards will then be completely powerless. It was always the Cape practice that the licensing boards decided the hours for bottle stores, hotels, etc. Now, according to this clause, the Minister indirectly wants to give the power of fixing hours to the provincial councils. In that way they will get greater power than Parliament, and if the provincial council fixes the hours, we must submit to it. The Minister should understand that there is a big principle at stake. We cannot compare a liquor licence with ordinary licences. The liquor traffic is controlled in a different way. The licences are always controlled by two different bodies; now the Minister wants to allow the provincial council to fix the hours. I think radical alterations are necessary in the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#reitz">

<from>&#x2020;Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>Another reason why this sub-section should stand is that we are out for uniformity. If this matter is left to the licensing courts, you will have one bottle store closed at 6 o&#x2019;clock and another at 4 o&#x2019;clock in neighbouring districts, and that would be too absurd.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I thoroughly endorse the reason given by the hon. member for North-East Rand (Dr. H. Reitz). I do hope the committee will understand that if this clause is not passed, you will see, as you have seen in the past, the spectacle of every shop in Cape Town closed on Saturday afternoon; but the bottle stores all open. Is that a desirable state of affairs? Is it desirable that the ordinary working man coming home on Saturday with his wages in his pocket should have staring at him the temptation to spend that money in liquor, and no opportunity to spend it on other things. The points the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander) has raised are mere technicalities. We have simply said in this section that we recognize that a bottle store is to all intents and purposes a shop, where a commodity is sold. I will be glad to be told why you would not call a bottle of liquor a commodity which you sell like a pound of butter or a pound of tea. We say that, having entrusted shop hours to the provincial councils, the bottle stores, which are shops, shall be subject to the same closing hours as any other shops. Where is the conflict between the two? We go on in sub-section 6 to fix certain maximum hours beyond which, even with the consent of the provincial council, they cannot go. The broad principle is this&#x2014;that a bottle store should not be open on Saturday afternoon or Wednesday afternoon, or any other afternoon when the shops are closed. On the Rand, owing to the divergence caused by different licensing courts, you may buy a bottle of brandy on Saturday afternoon in one town, but you cannot buy it in another town. But if you cannot buy a pound of tea in a grocer&#x2019;s shop in Springs you cannot buy it in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>We have two wise men running this Bill outside the Minister, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) and my hon. friend on my left. They are both getting it into a mess. My hon. friend on my left says we want uniformity. How can we get uniformity under this clause? He only knows Pretoria and the Transvaal; he does not know South Africa. This Bill, it appears to me, is made for the Cape and the Transvaal, and you forget all about the smaller provinces. I withdrew my amendment because I had been told by the Minister that the law has been laid down that a bottle store is a shop, but I take it it was in the Cape Act that was done. It has not been so laid down in the Free State. How can the provincial council come in? Has it any jurisdiction over the hours?</p>

<p>I am prepared to accept that course, because there is no doubt whatever that whether it is deleted or not, the provincial councils can deal with the matter of fixing those hours. There is no doubt whatever that they have the power to deal with that. The whole of my argument on which I have based my support of this is on that. If it is wrong it falls away; if I am right there is no need for the clause, because the provincial councils can deal with the matter. Whether the provincial councils have exercised that power all over South Africa, is a different matter, of course. They may have excluded bottle stores from the scope of their legislation, and have the licensing court hours effective.

<p>The Minister did not apparently enquire why this particular section was put in. I am amazed at the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) not seeing the undesirability of bottle stores being kept open when the shops are closed. I do think that the Minister would be unfair to the select committee&#x2019;s unanimous decision in dealing too hastily with this and abandoning this clause without hearing the pros and cons discussed. The decision was come to as a result of the position which exists in the whole of the Cape and the Transvaal. Last year the provincial council passed a Shop Hours Ordinance in the Transvaal in which they made every shop in Johannesburg close at 1 o&#x2019;clock on Saturdays, which did enormous harm to the traders, and they let the bottle stores remain open until 6 o&#x2019;clock. The result was to divert trade which had normally gone to the shops to bottle stores.</p>

<p>I hope the Minister will not accept the amendment of the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow). I am decidedly opposed to extending the facilities of licensed premises.

<p>I also think that the amendment should not be passed. I hope the Minister will not agree to it.

I cannot understand hon. members saying that shops should be closed and bottle stores opened. I should like to see a vote on the clause.

<p>The point of the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Coulter) will certainly have to be considered because it seems to have been overlooked. With regard to the amendment by the hon. member for Paarl, does he see that if he puts in these qualifying words, then the restaurants he speaks about, that is the existing ones, will be subject to no hours at all and will be able to sell for 24 hours out of the 24.</p>

<p>I realize that the amendment moved by the hon. member for Paarl (Dr. de Jager) would defeat the object of a large number of preceding clauses, but I certainly think some exception should be made in the case we will say of places like the Caf&#x00E9; Royal and Opera House restaurant, Cape Town. According to the Act, those places would be compelled to be closed except when serving legitimate meals at stated hours. I think additional words should be added, and I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>The result, if we accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Paarl is that we should allow restaurants to be created in districts of Cape Town, which would be to the great disadvantage not only of the people living in Cape Town, but the community in general, whereas the amendment I have moved would apply to restaurants like the Caf&#x00E9; Royal or the Opera House. I attended a certain dinner at the Opera House recently and if this Act is brought into operation, they will be deprived from having anything in the way of presentations and so on. I think the licensing board should have the power to grant extensions to such places on the restaurant licence which has been embodied in the Bill. There would be no danger to smaller communities. My amendment applies only to those places where there are 10,000 parliamentary voters, so that it would only apply to the big towns in South Africa.

<p>I think it would perhaps be well if we should fix the ordinary closing hour all over the country&#x2014;10 o&#x2019;clock or 10.30, whichever the sense of the committee regards as a proper time, but then we should make provision for those special interests in the bigger centres of our population. There is nothing so deadly as a town when all its licensed houses close after 10 o&#x2019;clock, and I notice that in Cape Town. Some shops have their lights on, but the only bright thing in Cape Town is the light in the bars. I do not want to go too far on that point&#x2014;it may, of course, be only an individual expression of opinion&#x2014;but there is certainly something depressing in the atmosphere of Cape Town which makes the consumption of alcohol somewhat more necessary here than in other places. No one wants to go into personal experiences. I find it possible to live in Pretoria six months in the year without a drink&#x2014;I will not go further than that. I appreciate the fact, of course, that there are certain dangers which to a certain extent are met by having this 5,000 parliamentary voter requisite put into the clause, and the licensing board looking into the matter properly and not regarding a position of this kind as one for universal use. But take an area like the central one of Johannesburg, which serves theatre-goers and amusement-seekers, who still exist&#x2014;the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) will correct me on the point if I am wrong. Reasonable requirements should be catered for in towns like Johannesburg and other large towns in the Union, so that people going to places of amusement may obtain liquid refreshment. Hon. members may say that this will lead to a greater consumption of drink, and it may be wise to eliminate the hours from 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m., and thus reduce the number of hours. This would affect only large towns, and certainly in these cases we would have a later hour, namely, 11 p.m. The general closing hour could be 10 or 10.30, I am indifferent which it is. Nine o&#x2019;clock closing is quite well enough for people who do not drink at all, but it is not fair for hon. members who do not drink after nine p.m. to limit the rights of those who wish to drink after that time. Only those who wish to partake of liquid refreshments in a small degree should vote on this question. People who go to <span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0610"/>theatres or bioscopes, and a person who leaves the Houses of Parliament late at night and tries to get something to stimulate himself after the labours of the day, would be affected by a provision of this nature. It would be unwise if we had to make the closing hour of Parliament earlier on account of the earlier closing of bars. There are so many arguments which can be used&#x2014;</p>

<p>I thought I had exhausted them from both aspects. As to the theatre licences, theatre bars should close at the same time as the theatre closes, for then 99 out of every 100 people who have been visiting the place go home. The closing hour of theatre bars, therefore, might be coterminous with the closing of the theatre, or even half-an-hour earlier. Take the big establishments in the centre of Johannesburg or Cape Town&#x2014;the Mount Nelson Hotel, the Queen&#x2019;s Hotel and other hotels&#x2014;why on earth should they not be allowed to continue to sell liquor up to 11.30 p.m. for that particular class of person which patronizes them?

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot refrain from expressing a feeling of sadness at the Minister&#x2019;s speech. When the Bill was first introduced the general closing hour was fixed at 9 o&#x2019;clock, with privileges in certain places up to 11 o&#x2019;clock. In the select committee, however, it was pointed out that under such an arrangement the great majority of licensees obtained privileges. Under that system four out of every five bars in Johannesburg enjoyed midnight privileges, the result being that from 100 to 150 establishments are open for the sale of liquor in Johannesburg up to midnight. The unanimous opinion of the police was that it was a wholly wrong and undesirable system. I am with the Minister for having a reasonable hour, for making it universal and for having no privileges. Going on those lines we fixed the 12-hour drinking day from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. The Minister has suggested that nowhere outside America are such restrictions in force, but that is not the case. In London, the night life of which is just as hectic as that of Cape Town, possibly a little more so, these are the closing hours. The overwhelming proportion close at 10 p.m., in the City of London 10.30 p.m., and in certain portions of the West End 11 o&#x2019;clock. Even in the heart of the busiest part of the amusements centre, 11 o&#x2019;clock closing is good enough for London.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Taking the population figures of London, we find that in districts inhabited by 4,990,000 people licensed places close at 10 o&#x2019;clock or earlier, and districts inhabited by 294,000 persons 10.30 to 11 o&#x2019;clock, while the closing hour in the provinces is 10.30 p.m., in Scotland 10 p.m., and in New Zealand and the whole of Australia, except Queensland, where there is a Labour Government, 6 p.m. In Canada they have no saloons at all. When he suggests the extension he proposes here as a normal and legitimate thing, I would point out he is proposing to do something done nowhere else in the Empire. We have had 12 o&#x2019;clock closing in Johannesburg for years, and I want to read the testimony of the police department on that 12 o&#x2019;clock closing. We had Colonel Grey, C.I.D., Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Young, the chief magistrate of Johannesburg, Mr. Hime, the magistrate at Pietermaritzburg, Colonel Trew, Mr. Alexander, chief constable at Durban, and Mr. Trigger, chief of the C.I.D., and almost unanimously they supported the 10 o&#x2019;clock closing. They said the harm done by bars and saloons is largely done by the last two hours of drinking. This Bill attempts to mitigate some of the evils of drinking, and when the police come along with this unanimous body of testimony and tell us that the crime and drunkenness which exists in the Union and is increasing is largely due to this drinking late at night, then the Minister takes grave responsibility in proposing to extend these hours to 11.30. The Minister is going further than in his original proposal in the Bill. He has wiped out entirely the fair compromise adopted by the select committee, and it is a step which is unwarrantable. Public opinion is demanding more restrictions on the sale of liquor. I do not care if I am called a temperance fanatic or a kill-joy, but I do not believe it is good to have these canteens and bars open in this way and spread up and down the length and breadth of the country. Does the Minister realize the canteens of the Cape will be allowed, if the licensing board permits it, to keep open till 11.30 at night? The committee must take a graver view of this than the Minister does, and he must bear with me if I go into this matter and fight this case.</p>

<p>I want firstly to ask the Minister whether he is not prepared to apply the same clause not only to hotel licences, but also to club licences? In that way par. (8) might lapse. If the Minister has read the evidence before the select committee, he knows that it was unanimously <span class="col_1089-1090" refersTo="page_0611"/>in favour of clubs and hotels being put on the same footing. Hon. members know that all the witnesses thought that clubs and hotels should come under the same provision. I agree with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) about the hours of closing. Evidence was also given before the select committee on this point. The evidence is of great value, because it came from men of experience in the liquor trade, and we ought to consider it. It was almost unanimously against late closing. The object is not to introduce some fanatical clause or other, but to fight drunkenness. The evidence, particularly of the detectives, shows that drunkenness was to a great extent caused during the last two hours licensed premises were open, think that we ought not to except certain towns. It will be a reasonable compromise if the Minister fixes 10 o&#x2019;clock for closing right through the country. Here we have a practical measure for fighting drunkenness. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">In line 3, to omit &#x201C;half-past&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Yes, but not in the same form.

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I might agree to a proposal to make the general closing hour 10 o&#x2019;clock, but I am strongly in favour of our having provision for exceptions. My amendment allows for an exception, and I think it should also apply to clubs. I shall not vote for the amendment to give clubs longer hours than the latest time allowed to hotels. If a hotel may not be kept open after 11 or 11.30, clubs must also not keep open later. I think the two things hang together. Then I also want to make it clear that this is a matter for people in large towns. The provision will only apply there. Hon. members must not think that my amendment proposes to apply it to Wakkerstroom or other places. There is a limitation in the amendment that there must be more than a certain number of voters in a town before the provision can be applied. I think we ought not to go too far in the direction in which we are now being pushed of protecting our population against itself too much. If it is necessary to protect the population so much against itself, then things are at a sad pass in our country, nor do I believe that we shall attain our object if we take away all the people&#x2019;s temptation. We shall bring them into new temptations. Therefore I do not at all agree with the view that we can make a nation sober by legislation. There is only one thing which can do that, and it is religion. Take the Mohammedan religion, where a great amount of temperance has been effected by religion; nothing else than religion will protect people against themselves. Therefore I am always a little surprised at the churches wanting to use the fleshly weapon too much, and the spiritual too little. I feel strongly that only by forming the views of the people shall we be able to do much in reducing the drink evil. Education in the spiritual sense will increase temperance, but the churches, instead of doing that, are possibly going a little too far in their striving for local option, etc. Will the power of the Bible be less than that of local option? I think that we should devote our attention more to educating public opinion on the proper use and the impropriety of abuse of drink. The object should not be to remove all temptations, because then we should be creating another source of temptation. All the people do not want to be abstainers, and the latter should not therefore attack other people so much. I do not care for smoking, but on that account I may surely not prohibit others from smoking. We must take the line of not fighting against the use, but the abuse of drink, and I think the crux of the matter lies in this provision. We must be careful not to protect the people against itself by compulsion.</p>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the Minister that it is advisable to establish a sound public opinion, but I am perfectly certain that the sound public opinion which has already been established in this country goes much more strongly in favour of the Minister&#x2019;s views of three years ago than the views he has expounded this afternoon. I have risen to appeal to the Minister to allow us to abide by the Bill, and withdraw his amendment. If there is one thing more certain than another to anybody who knows this country and is obliged to move about in various places, and at various hours, it is that the evil of drinking so far as bars are concerned, is very largely confined during the hours of 10 o&#x2019;clock in the evening and later periods. Here in this one street alone,&#x2014;and I speak of what I have seen&#x2014;between here and the railway station there are four bars and I have on more than one occasion seen young fellows come out of a bar in the upper part of the street and as they went along, if they had not had so much temptation they would have gone down to the railway station and gone home. They went into one bar after the other after 10 o&#x2019;clock or half past 10 at night, and it is only too easy to conceive what will be the end of these young people eventually. I agree with the Minister that you cannot make people temperate by Acts of Parliament, but I say that Parliament should adopt certain reasonable precautions so as not to put too much temptation in the way of people who are inclined to take too much drink. I can tell the Minister that so far as Australia is concerned, in Victoria, I believe, the bars are closed at 6 o&#x2019;clock at night and I <span class="col_1091-1092" refersTo="page_0612"/>think the same in Western Australia. In New South Wales they close at 8 and in Queensland at 9. To show the Minister how this works, I was at a place in New South Wales where the border of that State joins the border of Queensland. In New South Wales the hotels close at 8 and in Queensland at 9 and there was a regular pathway across from the one side to the other owing to the fact that one bar closed an hour later than the other. I only use that as an argument to show to the Minister that if he will not press for these later hours which his amendment does press for, I really think he will be doing a good national service. That is my conviction from a good deal of experience, and while I do not in any way want to pose as desiring that the people of this country should grow up in puritanical habits, I do say that as far as late night privileges for the sale of liquor are concerned, they are not in the interests of the general section of the population and especially not in the interests of the younger section of the population, and on that ground I would appeal to the Minister to let the clause stand in the Bill as it is. I believe, as I said before, that he would have the strongest public opinion in this country with him in adopting a policy of that character.</p>

But why should respectable people be so restricted? Why should the sale of drink stop at 10 o&#x2019;clock? In the large towns and villages it only commences to get lively at 10 o&#x2019;clock.

<p>I sincerely hope the Minister will abide by his amendment. I live in Johannesburg. The theatres there come out at 11 o&#x2019;clock and you see a stream of people going to the Carlton Hotel, for instance. I have never seen any drunkenness at that time of night in Johanesburg. All this talk about late hours being a source of danger is wrong. I see as much of the country as most people and I very seldom see any drunkenness late at night. For a young nation like ours we are going in for far too much grandmotherly legislation. We are not a drunken nation. I admit there are certain fever spots which can be dealt with separately. But to have all this mollicoddling legislation forced upon us seems a wrong principle altogether. It will end up in a spirit of lawlessness such as they have in America. Instead of going to reputable places young people will go to dances and theatres with flasks in their pockets. I believe if the country wants to go &#x201C;dry&#x201D; we will all cheerfully submit, but until it decides to go &#x201C;dry&#x201D; we have no right to look upon the liquor trade as a sort of leper and outcast, and all these little petty restrictions seem to me against the spirit of a nation like ours, a nation of individualists, and I hope the Minister will stick to his amendment.</p>

<p>I think the Minister has done the churches a very great injustice by suggesting that they ought not to press for the assistance of the State in restricting the liquor traffic and preventing drunkenness. The Minister made out that the churches merely wanted to make a fleshly weapon of the State. The churches want in the first place to exercise moral influence, and to form a healthy public opinion. The Minister will surely agree that the State is called upon to cooperate with the Church in this respect, and that the Church has the fullest right to insist on legislation so that the temptation before the population can be reduced. If the churches have not a right to come to the State in connection with such matters, then the position will indeed be pitiable. The Church appreciates the great influence of the material circumstances of the people, upon which they have to work to acquire spiritual influence. What folly it would be for the Church to do spiritual work in District 6, if at the same time it neglected to call forcefully upon the State for proper housing. They hang together, and where we see that the State has the power to remove temptations to drunkenness from weak people it is the duty of the Church to insist on the State doing so. As the Church knows that there are so many licensed places to-day that are a tremendous temptation to the man who cannot resist them, especially so in the late hours of the night, the Church is entitled to call upon the State to restrict the hours. It is not a question of abstinence or prohibition. Between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. enough liquor can be bought and sold, and I think 10 o&#x2019;clock is fair. I think that the restriction of the hours is one of the chief means of fighting drunkenness. Thousands of families, mothers and children, will be glad if the bars and other drinking places are not kept open so late at night, and the Church will be grateful to the Minister if he makes the closing hour earlier. The hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. van Niekerk) said that Col. Grey was in favour of the hotels keeping open to 11 o&#x2019;clock. The hon. member clearly did not read the evidence. He suggested to the select committee: 10 a.m. till 2.30 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to. 9 p.m. That is 8&#x00BD; hours, and he regards that as adequate. I hope the Minister will give his attention to this important point, and that the House will admit that the limitations of hours will contribute very much to reducing the drink evil. If the Minister&#x2019;s amendment is passed, then the conditions in certain parts of our country, especially in the Cape Province and Natal, will be worse than before.</p>

<p>If everybody drank as little as I do we should have to introduce a new method of taxation. The customs dues would drop tremendously. I am a member of many clubs in Johannesburg. I do not go to the bar, but I do go to a club sometimes as late as 10.30 or 11 p.m., and I have seen comparatively little drunkenness, very little indeed, and I do not think the police need complain as far as the clubs are concerned. We are trying to make people sober by legislation,&#x2014;at least some of our friends are. I sometimes wish they would succeed, but this is a wine-drinking country, a wine manufacturing country. We are exporting every year increasingly larger quantities of wine overseas. We are out to compete with wines which are imported, and you are trying to strangle the industry by this Bill. We might just as well introduce the law which they have in Greece in regard to the length of ladies&#x2019; dresses. You would have officials walking about with measures in Adderley Street and other streets seeing whether they complied with the law or not. We do not want that. I want the Minister to consider this: I am in agreement with his amendment, but there may be certain licensees in certain areas who do not want these facilities. Would he so make it that this would only apply with regard only to the increased payment of dues to those who desire the proposed increased facilities? You may have a certain area in which certain people do not wish to have their places open after certain hours. If you make this general there may be other places not desirous of doing that.

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member for Winburg (Dr. van der Merwe) is again wrongly interpreting the Minister&#x2019;s words about the Church. The Minister made no charge against the churches. He only expressed his opinion as to the most effective method for obtaining temperance, and this time he is right. It is certainly a fact that the more you prohibit liquor the more you induce people to disregard the prohibition. The wine farmer can drink day and night if he wishes to, and yet he drinks much less than the man who has less opportunity of getting liquor. In Europe some years ago I saw much more drunkenness in England, where liquor hours and bars were very much restricted, than in Holland, where there are just as many drinking places as cigar shops, and that is saying a good deal. Does the hon. member for Winburg think that anyone who is inclined to go to excess will drink less if he has to drink at times other than the hon. member wishes? In France, where anyone can drink as much wine as he wishes, there is much less drunkenness than in England. The laws regarding drunkenness are the same in both countries, and cases of drunkenness in England are five times as many as in France. The best way to make people temperate is to teach them temperance as the wine farmers do their children. If you go to work as the hon. member for Winburg wishes, you will encourage intemperance, however good your intentions may be. There are, e.g., more cases of drunkenness among the coloured people and natives of Pretoria and Johannesburg, where there is prohibition, than in the whole of the Cape Province.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The necessity fo&#x00EF; liquor legislation arises from the abuse of alcohol, and not if it is temperately used. Unfortunately, in this country, an increasingly large number of people, I am afraid, abuse alcohol, and it is for them that we have to legislate. It is idle for the hon. member to talk of the temperate man. We are forced to legislate because of those who abuse alcohol. As to those who are not temperate, it is proved that the greater opportunities you give them for drinking the greater the abuse. The evidence of the police given before the select committee was that, grandmotherly legislation or not, it is for the good of the country that you close down hotels and facilities for drinking at 10 o&#x2019;clock. I ask hon. members not selfishly to think of their own privileges, but to remember that they are legislating for the common good. You cannot pass any measure of restrictive legislation without treading on somebody&#x2019;s toes. Are we going to legislate on the principles of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz), or are we going to cure the ills from which the country is suffering&#x2014;ills which are filling the gaols as the result of the unrestricted sale of drink? To which class do we belong? It is idle to talk of grandmotherly legislation. It was generous of those who support temperance ideals to say that hotels shall be open till 10 p.m., whereas the original Bill said 9. That was a fair compromise, and was supported by police and other testimony before the select committee. We were wrong in specifying by name any four towns. I move, as an amendment to the amendment proposed by the Minister of Justice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">In line 8, to omit &#x201C;11&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;10&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This would mean a general 10 o&#x2019;clock closing, but in towns with more than a 5,000 quota there may be an extension to 10.30. That is some reform, but not very much, on the present system. We are not legislating for good fellows like the Minister of Justice, but to remove temptation from the way of those who cannot help falling victims to the evils of liquor. I will quote from some of the evidence submitted to the select committee. Col. Grey, chief of the C.I.D at Pretoria, advocated shortening the hours immensely by cutting them <span class="col_1095-1096" refersTo="page_0614"/>down to eight and a half, but privileged hotels should he allowed to remain open later. Mr. Mitchell, chief of the Bloemfontein C.I.D., supported closing not later than 10 o&#x2019;clock, as most men abuse liquor between 10 o&#x2019;clock and midnight. Mr. Hime, chief magistrate of Maritzburg, thinks that 10 o&#x2019;clock is late enough. Mr. Alexander, chief constable of Durban, said that the closing hour should not be later than 10 o&#x2019;clock under any circumstances, and that there should be no preferential treatment. Col. Trew, Deputy Commissioner of Police, is of the opinion that 11 o&#x2019;clock is late enough, and that drunkenness will be decreased by limiting the hours of sale. Maj. Trigger states that the restriction of hours has been beneficial, and he would support an absolute 10 o&#x2019;clock closing hour and no privileges. Thus the police testimony is practically unanimous in supporting 10 o&#x2019;clock closing. I beg the committee not to go a minute beyond 10.30: 11.30 would be simply disastrous. I cannot understand the Minister, who has to administer the criminal law, and knows what evils flow from excessive consumption of liquor, dreaming of pushing proposals into the Bill beyond the (original proposals and amendments suggested by the select committee.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">To add at the end &#x201C;: Provided that under a hotel liquor licence liquor may be sold to guests residing on the premises for consumption on the premises by themselves upon all days at any hour of the day or night&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Many members assume that by a stroke of the pen the Minister will be able to order every place to close at 11.30 p.m. This could not be done except with the authority of the licensing board, which would have to be satisfied that the reasonable requirements of the population demand the extension. If the licensing board comes to the conclusion that the hours should be extended it is unreasonable to say that bars must close earlier. So far as I know, the Minister was not a party to any compromise, but that was the action of the triumvirate. The argument which has been used is because some people abuse liquor we must all do without it. If a man cannot resist liquor he should be put under restraint; he should be put on the black list. To be told that because some people cannot resist liquor we must all be deprived, is going too far. If a man becomes drunk I would put him in an inebriates&#x2019; home and keep him there until he gets sober. This amendment is perfectly reasonable, and I hope the Minister will stick to it, and that he will get the necessary support to carry it through. There is a provision in the Cape and the Transvaal that, so far as a guest living on hotel premises is concerned, he has never been restricted. So far as I know at present, there is no restriction at all so long as it is for his own consumption. That I think should be provided for. If people come from abroad, and have been to the theatre at night, you should provide for them if they live in hotels. We are always glad to welcome the tourists, and one of the things we should provide for is that bona fide guests living on hotel premises should have facilities for obtaining liquor I am moving the amendment to the end of sub-section 7 that the hours shall not apply to guests living on the premises of an hotel provided the liquor is for the consumption of himself.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the Minister moved the amendment, and I want to appeal strongly to him to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Winburg (Dr. van der Merwe). If he will not accept it, I hope the hon. member will ask for a division. We cannot adopt the standpoint that a man must not be protected against himself. All our legislation has that objective. Unfortunately, there are many people who cannot protect themselves and, therefore, we are here to pass laws. The hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. van Niekerk) states that the late hours for the sale of drink do not increase drunkenness. If there is anything that is dangerous, it is the late hours at night when drink is sold. We see it every day about us, that when a man has once taken a little drink he wants more, and he will continue late into the night if he can. We cannot argue in that way and close our eyes. One of the best ways of fighting the drink evil is shortening the hours. The hon. member for Piquetberg (Mr. de Waal) said that the hon. member for Winburg would cause the consumption of liquor to increase. I hope that his opposition to the supporters of local option will become less on that account, seeing we are still assisting the wine farmers if the sale of liquor increases through our action.</p>

The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) went so far as to say that we were trying to make a grandmotherly law. I have respect for everybody, but I can assure the Minister that the churches honestly desire to assist him to make a good law. The hon. member for Piquetberg (Mr. de Waal) has given us to understand that we cannot prevent drunkenness by legislation. But what is the reason for this Bill? We are surely here trying to improve the legislation in connection with the abuse of liquor, and so to stop drunkenness. I am sorry that the speech of the Minister has given a wrong tone to the debate. I am not a total abstainer, but I am getting tired of the continuous sneering at the total abstainers, and I agree with the hon. member for Winburg (Dr. van der Merwe) that we must not allow people to stand drinking the whole night.

<p>It has been said, and my hon. friend the Minister has also argued, that you cannot make people sober by legislation. That may be the case, but you can make people more facilities you get for obtaining a drink, they have for obtaining drink. That is the universal experience. That is the practice now in most countries, English-speaking countries at any rate. The rule to go upon is to reduce, as far as practicable, the facilities for getting drink. Here, in this particular case, you are going to increase the facilities for getting drink by keeping bars open late at night. It is nonsense to say that the people who go to the theatres do not get drunk. That is not the point. There are heaps of people about at night who will keep going into a bar and having a drink. In my experience most of the people go straight home from the theatre. The point is that you give facilities for men who are wandering about the streets, to go into these bars, and thereby you increase drinking. It is the experience the world over that the more facilities you get for obtaining a drink the more drunkenness extends. I am very sorry that my hon. friend should have given way on this point.</p>

<p>I support the amendment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I think 10.30 is quite late enough. I am not a temperance man. On the contrary, I take liquor and I like it. But I know that the less drink I take the better it is for my health, and I also know that the sooner the licensed places close the less liquor I and my friends will take. I have had experience. I went to the theatre. I did not know that the bars closed at 10 o&#x2019;clock. When I came out I was very anxious to have a drink, and I could not get a drink, and I had to go home without having a drink, and I think I was ever so much better for it. As regards the amendment of the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander), I think it is quite unnecessary to allow a man, simply because he happens to be sleeping at an hotel, to get liquor at 3 or 4 in the morning. The hon. member gave the case of a man who suddenly becomes ill. That does not often happen, and there are other medicines besides alcohol. It is open to abuse. A man may order liquor, and give it to his friends. Who is going to watch what he does with it once he gets it into his bedroom? I do not think a licensee would supply drink at 3 or 4 in the morning. I submit the amendment is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>I was very impressed with the evidence brought forward by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) and the hon. member for Winburg (Dr. van der Merwe), the evidence given by Col. Grey, and also their fine testimonial to the value of this gentleman&#x2019;s evidence. But I am afraid if these two members will refer to page 565 of the official evidence they will find they have been rather misled by the expurgated evidence of the total abstinence party. I think it would be well for the House to consider this gentleman&#x2019;s evidence as a whole. I think the clause quoted finished with &#x201C;this alteration would diminish drunkenness greatly and facilitate police control,&#x201D; and Col. Grey then goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">And assist the licence holders by reducing their very long hours. The section makes the latest hour of closing 11 o&#x2019;clock at night. This is considered too early in the case of big hotels, and it is thought that reasonable facilities should be given for persons leaving theatres, bioscopes and public meetings to get liquor up till midnight. In Pretoria all the hotels with privileges are allowed to remain <span class="col_1099-1100" refersTo="page_0616"/>open until 11.30, and in Johannesburg till midnight.</block>

<p>I should like the hon. members to listen to this personal expression of opinion by Col. Grey, who, according to these two hon. members, you can absolutely depend on, and whose advice you can take. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">I consider that the licensing boards should be permitted to fix the hour up till midnight for hotels in the bigger towns where people do not go to bed so early as in the small country towns, and where the hotel may very well be closed at 11 o&#x2019;clock. If hotels in the big centres have to close their bars at 11 o&#x2019;clock, the public will be deprived of getting liquor at a time they require it. They will either have to buy it in bulk or go without it. I do not advocate an extension of the bars which close at 9 p.m., as they do not provide accommodation for travellers.</block>

<p>You have to remember that this clause relates to bars, hotels and wine and malt liquor licences, and that the bars finish altogether in nine years&#x2019; time. It is quite clear that Col. Grey advises that in the larger towns the licensing boards should be permitted to fix the hour up till midnight. I do not suggest they should be permitted to do so, I am quite willing to take the Minister&#x2019;s amendment, but I do say if we are going to quote evidence&#x2014;</p>

<p>I should like to read out what the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) has already quoted in part, namely, the evidence given by Col. Grey before the select committee. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) has already mentioned part of what Col. Grey said, and I must admit he also mentioned that Col. Grey was in favour of hotels in the large towns keeping open to 11 or 12 o&#x2019;clock. We must, however, not forget that a wrong impression is created by Col. Grey&#x2019;s evidence. He spoke of bottle stores when he declared himself in favour of closing from 2.30 to 3 o&#x2019;clock, but in connection with hotels his evidence is as follows. [Evidence read.] I want us to be very careful with this evidence. Col. Grey said very clearly that it was his conviction that people coming out of theatres or meetings wanted to take something, and that we had no right to prevent them. I admit that there is police evidence against him on the point. It is quite true, and I admit it. I personally think that we ought to pass the clause as it reads in the Bill, namely, that the places should close at 10.30. I am convinced that that is best, and I hope the Minister and the committee will agree to it. The prevention of drunkenness has been mentioned. Most drunkenness occurs on the Witwatersrand. Of the approximately 50,000 convictions for drunkenness, there were 28,000 on the Witwatersrand. I know, of course, that a considerable part represents natives, but the proposition that the opportunity makes the thief also applies to whites, and therefore we should allow as little opportunity for consumption of liquor as possible. That is the reason why I proposed that the police bars should be abolished, but I could get no support for that motion, not even from the abstainers. I want to say here that I agree that we should make different provisions for the large cities than for the countryside. Life in the towns is different from that in the country, and we must allow for it. We all want a sober nation. Both the supporters of temperance and the abolitionists want that. We all aim at stopping drunkenness. The question, however, is how to manage it, and about that we do not all agree.</p>

Some of us run the danger of saying there is no need for these facilities because we do not require them our selves, but we must live and let live. Personally, I see no harm in a man who has been to a theatre going to an hotel for supper and having some wine or whisky with it. It does not follow that all these places will necessarily remain open until 11.30 p.m. We should be going much too far to adopt the very sweeping restrictions which have been proposed.

<p>The arguments which have been adduced have convinced me more than ever that this amendment is necessary.

This restaurant licence, if introduced into this clause, will give the opportunity for people who want it. I advocate this not merely for the convenience of it. Take the people who come into Cape Town from the country. Surely they must have an opportunity of a drink before returning on a cold winter&#x2019;s night by motor car. If they want food they should have the opportunity of obtaining it, and this opportunity of putting &#x201C;restaurants&#x201D; in this clause is a reasonable thing to ask.

<p>I just want to deal with the amendment of the hon. member for Paarl (Dr. do Jager). I can quite understand its intention, namely, that when the loose bar licence disappears after ten years, it shall suffer as little damage as possible. But if the amendment is passed we should unfortunately after ten years have two kinds of restaurant licences, namely, one for mealtimes, and another which is much broader and more extensive. The amendment would mean that in ten years we should have a condition which none of us want. What we should like to see after ten years is a licence of the same kind throughout the whole country, and we should be making two kinds by the amendment, namely, one for mealtimes, and one that would be practically the same as that of the present loose bar. We cannot do that. As for closing at 11.30, I think everybody ought to be in favour of it. I think the same good sense which hon. members will show in rejecting the amendment of the hon. member for the Paarl will also induce them to accept my amendment providing for 11.30. I cannot understand that there can be a head which is partly that of a dullard and partly that of a sensible person.

<p>May I deal with one argument advanced by the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) in support of the Minister&#x2019;s amendment? Pointing to the terms of the amendment, he says that it would appear that the grant of this extended licence up to 11.30 will be the exception and not the rule, and that we need not worry, that the ordinary closing hour will be 10 or 10.30, as decided by the committee, and only in a few exceptional cases will this be done. Let me tell him, and the Minister knows it very well, that this is a vain and delusive hope. Under the existing Transvaal law in section 29 it is provided that &#x201C;the licensing court may when it shall be satisfied of its being for the convenience of the public&#x201D; grant a licence-holder midnight privileges, that is, privileges between 9 and 12. In other words, according to the wording of that section, when the licensing court is satisfied that the convenience of the public demands it, it may grant this midnight privilege.

<p>I should like the Minister to explain whether, if his amendment is passed, the general rule will be closing at 10 o&#x2019;clock, and that his amendment will only apply to large towns? It cannot really be the intention to have 10.30 in respect of a few towns, and then to put his amendment which also applies to large towns. My amendment is to make 10 o&#x2019;clock the general rule. Thereafter we have the amendment of the Minister which, of course, can be dealt with separately on its merits. I heard from the Minister this afternoon that he really did not much mind whether the general rule was 10 o&#x2019;clock or 10.30. Now I just want to say a few words about the quotation of police evidence made this afternoon. I fear we were all a little hasty in our quotations. Even the hon. member for Pretoria (South) (Dr. van Broekhuizen) will see that Col. Grey&#x2019;s words quoted by me only apply to bars. He is making a distinction between hotels and bars. He said that 9 o&#x2019;clock was late enough for bars, but for hotels he did not mind it being a little later, especially in the better class hotels. This clause, however, means that both hotels and bars can remain open late. There are members who will say ft is only for ten years, but during those ten years thousands of people may still be ruined by drink. The hon. member for Piquetberg (Mr. de Waal) has again emphasized his principle of temperance, but he has done it so often he may as well drop it now. We do not want to bring about prohibition by the Bill. <span class="col_1103-1104" refersTo="page_0618"/>because then we need not even take the trouble to discuss it. I cannot understand the temperance of some members, who say that 12 o&#x2019;clock does not allow enough time to drink. I consider that terrible intemperance. I hope the Minister will give me the enlightenment asked for.</p>

<p>It does not mean that a man shall drink during 12 successive hours, but that a man can take the small drink he wants at 10 or 11 or 11.30. Another point is the agreement which the hon. member proposes. I might be prepared to support 10 o&#x2019;clock as a general rule if the hon. member is prepared to support my amendment of 11.30. If he is not so prepared, then we must first vote for 10.30, but if the hon. member will accept my motion for 11.30, I am prepared to argue about 10.30 or 10 o&#x2019;clock.

<p>I listened to the carefully edited pamphlet which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) read out, and the impression I gathered and I think every member of the committee gathered was that the police officers throughout the Union were in favour of 10 o&#x2019;clock being the closing hour. I will read out the evidence given by Lt.-Col. Trew, an officer of very great experience, which was given before the select committee, and is not from a carefully edited pamphlet. He said that in the Transvaal they are kept open until midnight and in the Cape until 10 o&#x2019;clock. It is extraordinary that they have different closing hours. He also said that he thought they should have universal closing hours. He was then asked another question, and in reply said he considered it better to close these hotels at 11 p.m., which would meet the convenience of the public. He was asked&#x2014;&#x201C;Would that be reasonable?&#x201D; and his reply was&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes, for a population of over 20,000.&#x201D; Mr. Barlow asked him&#x2014;&#x201C;You curtailed the hours at Worcester and minimised drunkenness? Is that the only place where you have curtailed hours?&#x201D; His reply was&#x2014;&#x201C;Also Wynberg, but we have not noticed much difference there.&#x201D; If you analyse the evidence the consensus of opinion is that 11 o&#x2019;clock should be the closing hour in the big towns. If you accept the amendment you are following the opinion of the police officers in regard to hours.</p>

<p>I can&#x2019;t help that, there is so much talking going on. My amendment provides that where a club provides its members with meals and bedroom accommodation, it will be able to supply liquor to 11 o&#x2019;clock. The club which is simply a drinking club, and does not supply meals or bedroom accommodation, shall observe the same hours as an hotel or bar. They will close at 10.30. I do that because it has been represented to me that quite a number of clubs have sprung up which are purely drinking clubs and the members of which are able to get liquor after the ordinary hotels and bars are closed. Some of these clubs are, no doubt, quite well conducted, but quite a number of them, I am told, are not so well conducted, and I do not see why because a man is a member of such a club, which does not supply meals and bedroom accommodation, he should be able to drink for half an hour longer in his club than the person who goes to a bar or an hotel for a drink. I say this is quite a democratic proposal that a man, whether he belongs to a club of the sort I have described, or goes to a bar for a drink, should observe the same hours. As I have already stated, I do not seek to deal with the club which is really a club and a home as we understand it, that is a club supplying meals to its members and giving bedroom accommodation to its members. My amendment simply deals with the other class of clubs which, I think, we ought to place on the same footing as hotels and bars.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister won&#x2019;t agree to this amendment. The function of a club is not to supply sleeping accommodation to its members. Its function is to make provision for social meetings of its members. I could mention the Nationalist Party Club, the Labour Party Club and the South African Party Club in Johannesburg. I believe I am right in saying that none of them supply bedrooms. It is not the function of a club to supply bedrooms. The hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt) has missed the real legal status of a club. In a club you are really in your own home. The club belongs to the members, and a man who takes a drink or a meal in a club is legally doing very much what he would do if he took a drink or a meal in his own house. That is the fundamental difference between a club and an hotel. I hope either that the hon. member will withdraw his amendment, or that it will not be accepted.</p>

<p>I want to support the point of view put forward by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz). I think it is entirely wrong to subject clubs to the same rules as a bar or an hotel. A club is an entirely different proposition. A club is a place where people come together, not for the sake of drinking, but for the sake of social recreation and other things which they cannot get otherwise. I know it is said that you have clubs that are mere drinking shops, etc. Then don&#x2019;t let the licensing board give them a licence. Don&#x2019;t let them give a licence unless they are satisfied that the club is a bona fide club and not a mere drinking club, and that it is observing the rules laid down for clubs.

<p>I do not see why a club should have this, privilege and not an hotel. It has often been argued that a club should be treated as a man&#x2019;s home. There is nothing to prevent any club member if he wants to treat his friends on a Sunday, buying a bottle of liquor the day before. I have no objection to a member who is living in a club being treated just as he would be treated if he were in his home, but he has no right to buy liquor on a Sunday at his home.</p>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt) to realize that in the country districts, in the small towns, we have clubs. From the way this subject is dealt with you would imagine that clubs exist entirely to supply liquor. In these little clubs in the smaller towns it is absurd to require them to have bedrooms, etc. These clubs are for the purpose of social gatherings amongst the community, and I do not think drink enters largely into their consideration in going to those clubs. I do say that there is too much of this wanting to hedge everything about with unreasonable stipulations of this, that and the other kind. I would ask the hon. member for Dundee to consider seriously withdrawing this amendment, and leaving out the stipulation about bedrooms, etc. I, as a member of a big club and of small clubs, resent immensely the implication that these small clubs exist entirely for drinking purposes. Surely to goodness the licensing boards are the people to decide whether or not any corporation of men is a true club or a body got together for drinking under the guise of a club. It is for the licensing board to decide that, and I think if a stronger line were taken administratively the matter would soon settle itself. On behalf of the small clubs I do say that it would be an injustice not to give those clubs the same privileges as any club in a big centre. After all, because you have 20,000 inhabitants in a place, it does not follow that you are entitled to any better privileges than if you have only 5,000. I do not think this discrimination <span class="col_1109-1110" refersTo="page_0621"/>of numbers carries any weight whatever, and I say that the small clubs are entitled to as full privileges as any other club, whether it is the Rand Club or any other in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>We are now dealing with one of the most difficult problems of the whole Bill. That is the question, if you lay down by law as we have done, that an hotel must close on Sundays and only serve liquor with meals, what are you going to do with a club? It is estimated that the club membership in Johannesburg is 38,000. Allowing for duplication, the number of members of clubs in Johannesburg is 35,000. This is a serious business. If you are going to close down the hotels, in order presumably to discourage drinking from bars on Sundays, are you going to allow the bars of twenty or more clubs to be open on Sundays to serve members and their friends, and then think you have put an end to Sunday drinking? I thought the one thing we did try to keep sacred was Sunday, and that we wished to try and discourage as far as we could drinking from bars, whether clubs or anywhere else, on Sundays. I hear an hon. member behind me say a club is a man&#x2019;s home. Have you a bar in your home? You walk into a club and you see, perhaps, a little more refined, what you see in the hotel, men standing beside a bar drinking. For the purposes of a liquor licence and the sale of liquor, to say your club is your home, you might as well say the hotel where you are staying is your home. We are getting down to something which is very fundamental. I am going to read more extracts, and perhaps the hon. member for East Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) will listen carefully and see that I read fully and fairly. Let me read what the chief magistrate of Johannesburg says in regard to some clubs&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">At the present time we have so-called clubs with a membership totalling 5,000 to 7,000 each. The election of members is a mere farce. The sole object of the clubs would appear to be the promoting of the sale of liquor, and not the provision of those amenities connected with ordinary club life.

He goes on to refer to the increase of drunkenness and immorality at certain clubs, to certain scenes at cabarets, and unfavourable reports by the police.

<p>The licensing board in Johannesburg has granted licences to a large number of clubs. The opinion of those who have to deal with this matter is very definite, that an enormous amount of evil is done by Sunday drinking in clubs Men, instead of spending Sunday in a natural way, hang over the bars of these clubs. Any secretary of one of these popular clubs will tell you that the takings on Sunday are greater than any other day of the week. Why? Because Sunday drinking is obviously much more than week-day drinking, and because the ordinary bars are closed and people who cannot go to the bars go to the clubs and drink there. It is unfair to the trade to make them pay heavy licences and compete as they do and yet say to the clubs: &#x201C;You can have a membership and an almost nominal entrance fee, and you shall be allowed to sell all day on Sundays when the other bars are closed.&#x201D;</p>

There is nothing to be said as regards the better class clubs such as the City Club and the Civil Service Club and some clubs in Durban and Johannesburg, but there is not the remotest shadow of doubt that if this goes through there will be a tremendous increase in clubs which are simply drinking clubs. In the suburbs of Cape Town to-day between Cape Town and Wynberg, there are places which are nothing less than drinking places. A man joins such a club to be able to go down on Sundays and get the drink he wants. I think it is an extremely dangerous extension, and I sincerely hope the committee will not agree to it, because as sure as we sit here it is going to lead to increased drunkenness. Because you are putting a premium on these clubs; you say that every bar must be closed so that they can be kept going. I think the Minister has gone too far in this business.

This is quite a different aspect of the matter, and I hope the Minister will withdraw his amendment. I feel that we should not allow any sale of liquor on Sunday. If it is at meal times as in hotels, if a man takes a meal at a club it may be permissible, but I want the club bar to be closed on Sunday, so that the servants can have their Sunday rest. Mr. Young says clearly that if the clubs and hotels are to be put on a like footing, the clubs should also get the same privileges as the hotels.

<p>We may well ask, after hearing the speeches of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) and the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), what is the use of perpetuating the machinery of the licensing boards and adding to their powers if all these evils exist? The hon. member for Bezuidenhout read an extract from an authority that in the opinion of those who have to deal with clubs, in Johannesburg and elsewhere, a terrible state of things exists. That is a reflection on the licensing court and the police authorities. These hon. members seem to think that the more restrictions you put on the rational use of refreshments, the more temperance. It is not so at all. We are getting to be more temperate in the use of alcohol. The most pronounced teetotalers are the inmates of hospitals, gaols and asylums, whilst they are there, but they do not remain so when they come out. As a lifelong advocate and practitioner of the temperance movement, but as a definite anti-prohibitionist, I am fully persuaded that the well-being of a nation is not along the lines of prohibition. The effect of a club is to check intemperance by providing more rational means of recreation. Surely no hon. member will draw a close parallel between a bar and a club. In a bar there is only one form of recreation&#x2014;drinking&#x2014;and in a club there are twenty different forms. It is unreasonable to go too far in these matters. I most ardently desire to have a good measure placed on our statute book, but would warn those who take extreme views that &#x201C;too far East is West,&#x201D; that is if they press too far in one direction they will arrive at the very opposite place to the one they wish to reach. Unreasonable restrictions are only another step on the road to prohibition. The next step will be in the home, and it will be criminal for a man to draw a cork in his own house after 8 p.m. The results of prohibition are not yet so convincing as to induce us to advance very far along that road. It is a great mistake to force the pace even in temperance matters. We must try to reach our goal by education, and the provision of rational amusements so that people may have better means of spending their money on sensible forms of recreation rather than on drinking. Clubs provide one <span class="col_1113-1114" refersTo="page_0623"/>of these means, and if a club is not properly conducted it should not last for more than a year. Its licence can be refused. It is absurd to go on legislating for the whole of South Africa with only two places in your mind&#x2019;s eye&#x2014;Johannesburg and the Western Province. Undoubtedly very great evils in connection with drink occur in these two places. It is a misfortune that the Bill was drafted by three residents of a large town who are not acquainted with the desires and means of recreation of people living in smaller towns. Those who, like myself, ardently desire to further the cause of temperance would be well advised to check the pace of those excellent, well-meaning people who wish to bring about the millennium at once. I challenge anyone to prove that the improvement in temperance is even chiefly due to temperance propaganda. It is due to a different set of circumstances: Education, travel facilities, sport and even the cinema. I am not going to say that the drink traffic must not be seriously regulated. The State should impose reasonable restrictions and prevent abuses. It has always done so, ever since alcohol was retailed for consumption. We are divided into two classes&#x2014;one thinks that alcohol is the devil in solution, and many are actuated by the kill-joy element. We must try and steer a medium course. Above all, we must be very careful that we do not degenerate into a bureaucratic country. We must have liberty in our homes and our clubs. If there are abuses in the clubs, the licensing courts and the police will, I hope, do their duty.</p>

<p>But I would like to point out that clubs as a whole are run very well. It has been said in Johannesburg there are 35,000 to 38,000 members of clubs and that there are individual clubs with over 5,000 members. I doubt if there is one club in Johannesburg with 5,000 members. I have been on many of the committees there and if any complaints were made against the election of certain candidates, they were carefully scrutinized by the committee. The names are screened for seven days and it is open to members of a club to object to any applicant. Candidates have been expelled who have been found guilty of drinking too much. The secretaries and committees of the clubs are jealous of the reputations of these clubs, and I hope the Minister will stick to his amendment because it is very sound. This movement to restrict them to 11.30 is an attempt to curb them of privileges they enjoy at present. I think they will be perfectly satisfied with the amendment of the Minister, which seems to be perfectly reasonable. Some objection has been taken by some hon. members to Sunday drinking. They do not seem to mind people drinking as much as they like from Monday to Saturday evening, but, oh no, not on Sundays. I cannot understand why a drink should be prohibited to a man on Sunday, but not in the week-day. It has been said that the takings of a club are more on Sunday than on other days, and that that is unfair to the trade. Why? The trade has now to close on Sundays and if clubs do take more money on Sundays it is because the other bars are closed. If complaints are made against clubs, then I say you should deal with them as you do with all licensed premises. Close them up. I have known complaints which have come before the licensing board and which have been found to be entirely unjustified.</p>

<p>Hon. members will notice that I propose turning 10 o&#x2019;clock into 10.30, and 11 o&#x2019;clock into 11.30, so that the hours will not be longer than as printed. The amendment also proposes that people can obtain liquor every day of the week. Whether hon. members admit it or not, there is a great distinction between hotels and clubs. An hotel is a public place, a club is private. In many cases the club belongs to the members, and in any case it is private. If we want to attack the private rights of the members, we have doubtless just as much right in principle to attack the rights of ordinary people who live in a house, in so far as liquor is concerned. There is no difference in principle. Clubs also differ in another respect from hotels. In the rules of the club it is provided that no profits shall be paid to any individual, if there is a profit it is used for the benefit of the club itself; while in an hotel the profits from the bar go into the pockets of private people. I have no great love for clubs. I visit clubs very seldom. I prefer hotels. It is perhaps bad taste, but it is my taste, yet I agree that we have no right to interfere unduly with the people to whom the clubs belong. We cannot interfere more and more with people who differ from us. I have already said that smoking causes me discomfort, that I do not care for it, but I should not go and interfere with another&#x2019;s freedom although his freedom is offending me. I find smoking an inconvenience. I shall certainly vote against the proposal to interfere with the clubs. No one is obliged to go to a club, but what right has anyone who stays away to place restrictions on the people who own the club, a private place? I think myself that my own amendment encroaches on the rights of club members. Each club has its own regulations. One closes at midnight, another later still. An hon. member asked me what country clubs did at night. The most pleasant functions of country clubs usually take place in the evening. That applies, e.g., to the country club in Pretoria. Dinners, or things of that kind, are more pleasant in country clubs than in the town hotels. We have nothing to do with the clubs, and no right to restrict them. Even my amendment interferes with their liberty. As for Sundays, the argument that we shall not prohibit anyone from drinking in his own house on Sunday applies, and we have not the right to prevent people from going to the club for a drink instead of having it in their own house. We must not go too far with the restrictions, because we run the risk of creating criminals and new evils. The arguments which can be used for interfering with the rights of a private house can also be used with regard to private clubs. We have here again the peculiar combination of licence holder and total abstainers. What binds the two? It is the same bond that exists in America between the abolitionists and the liquor smugglers. It is a very strong bond.</p>

<p>I do not know to which wing of this new Pact the Minister thinks I belong, but I am going to move an amendment to his amendment, because I think it is not right that the hotel should be debarred from selling on Sundays and the club not debarred. I am not expressing any opinion whether they should be allowed to sell on Sundays or not, but my contention is if the hotel is not allowed to sell, the club should not be allowed to do so. The Minister said that because you do not smoke yourself you should not prevent another man from smoking. That is quite true, but if you say a man shall not smoke on Sundays in hotels you must also say he shall not smoke on Sundays in clubs. The Minister said: &#x201C;What right have we to say to a club member that he may not get liquor there on Sundays?&#x201D; We have equally as little right to say to a traveller who has come to a strange town: &#x201C;You do not happen to belong to any club, so you cannot get liquor to-day, except with meals.&#x201D; He has also said: &#x201C;Why should we prevent a club member from giving a dinner on Sundays?&#x201D;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like now to move the amendment that I withdrew. I cannot follow the argument about a comparison between a club and a man&#x2019;s home. If you do use that argument you must see to it that it logically applies. If a man wants to give his family liquor on Sundays in his own home he cannot buy it anywhere; so you are putting the club man in a much better position than the head of a household. If members of a club want it, why should they not also buy it the day before? There is no comparison between thousands of people who band themselves together in a club and the ordinary householder. It is assumed by members who want to make this distinction that you cannot have a club without a liquor licence. You can have all the social amenities of the club without a liquor licence, and there are many parts of the world where there are clubs without liquor licences. You may have that, just as you may have a very good home without any liquor being there. At any rate, it is not a necessary part of a club to have a licence. I do not think the analogy applies at all. What is the position is this&#x2014;that we give clubs a very valuable thing called a liquor licence. They have to pay for it. You are giving the hotels the same valuable thing. Why should the privilege be so much more extensive in the one case than in the other? The clubs sell for profit. You cannot get liquor at cost price at a club. If you buy it on Sunday in a club, you have to pay for it. It is not that I am speaking on the principle of Sunday trading, but I do say that if you prohibit it in regard to other licensed premises, why not here? Some of the clubs may become huge Sunday drinking places. My amendment is to place these clubs, as far as I can, in the same position as an ordinary hotel. I move, as a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>Foul years in succession Bills have been introduced for local option, and I believe in the fourth year the Minister said that legislation would be introduced with the same object as that of the supporters of local option, namely, to prevent drunkenness. At meetings held in my district, the people have again demanded local option legislation, but I said no, that is wrong, the Government is going to introduce legislation for the same purpose, and let us give them a chance.

<p>That is the point of my amendment. Supposing you have a big charity dance or a hospital ball such as are constantly being held in the City Hall here. The majority of the people expect to get some refreshment and it means a temporary bar. An occasional licence does not apply to this case at all. It means, if not amended, that at a big function such as would never be held in licensed premises, you would, under this clause, not be able to sell liquor after 10.30.

<p>The purchases can be made, of course, at the place up till 10.30.

<p>The reason is that the farmers sell much earlier and are up much earlier. Eight o&#x2019;clock is late on a farm, and the provisions will handicap work on the farm. As no one will be inconvenienced by my motion, I hope the Minister will make no objection to it.</p>

<block name="#quote">In line 38, after &#x201C;wine&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or brandy&#x201D;.</block>

<p>That means that the farmer who has a wine farmer&#x2019;s licence will be entitled to sell brandy. If we provide in this clause that a wine farmer can sell wine at certain hours to persons who do not hold licences, and Clause 88 is changed by the amendment of the hon. member for Ladysmith (Mr. J. J. M. van Zyl) so that anyone with a wine farmers&#x2019; licence can also supply brandy to a non-licensee, then it would mean that he could sell brandy at any time. Therefore we must now discuss whether he may also sell brandy. What is the difference? He can sell four gallons of ordinary wine, and why should he not be allowed to sell brandy? Earlier in the debate I spoke about the trouble in my constituency, where 50,000 gallons of brandy are distilled annually. The farmers cannot make wine there because the climate is against them. What are they to do with the 50,000 gallons? They cannot sell it under their wine farmers&#x2019; licence. The only thing they can do is to sell it to the man who has a licence, with the result that he only gets about 1s. 6d. a bottle, after deduction of the excise, because he is entirely dependent on the licence holder. The price is too low, because it is good stuff. I will not speak of my own experience, but about that of people who know more about it than I do, and they also say it is good, and equal to the produce of the Western Province. Why, then, cannot the man sell his liquor even if it is possibly less than four gallons? Why must he go to a <span class="col_1123-1124" refersTo="page_0628"/>licensee? The Minister knows the difficulties, because he met the people. I admit the brandy in the Western Province finds an easy market by means of the co-operative societies, and this makes it easy to sell only to licensees, and therefore the farmers in the Western Province are much in favour of the restrictions, because then they compel the small farmer to join up with them. But what are the people to do in the parts where there is not enough produced to be able to establish a co-operative society? The objection has also been raised that there will be trouble in connection with the excise, and if the stuff does not go through the licence holder it will be difficult to collect the excise. But if under the existing circumstances in my district brandy is distilled, the excise officer comes round to see how much a person has produced, and he can sell nothing before the excise is paid, then this objection falls away. It is a serious matter to the people who have hitherto made a living out of it. There are also even in the Cape Province parts where the small farmers are not able to form a co-operative society. We have repeatedly heard in the House that the wine farmers are respectable people. Let us then treat them as such, and give them when they make first-class brandy an opportunity to sell it. I therefore move my amendment, which provides that the farmer can make delivery after sunrise.</p>

<p>The farmer&#x2019;s day begins at sunrise, and these deliveries take place early in the morning.
