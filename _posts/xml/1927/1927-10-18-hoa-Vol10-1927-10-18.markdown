<heading>RAILWAYS: ACCIDENTS AND COMPENSATION.</heading>

<question by="#papenfus" to="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<num>II.</num>

<from>Mr. PAPENFUS</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Railways and Harbours:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) How many accidents have taken place on the Administration&#x2019;s lines during the period 1st June to 30th September of this year, and the cause of the accidents;</li>

<li>(2) at which places did such accidents occur, stating in each case whether such accidents have been fraught with loss of life or of property only; and giving particulars in each case of the number of deaths and of the number injured, and the loss by damage to property of the Administration;</li>

<li>(3) what claims for compensation have been made as a result of such accidents; and</li>

<li>(4) what compensation, if any, has been paid in respect of such accidents?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#papenfus">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>The hon. member presumably has in view the more serious accidents in which passenger trains were involved, and a statement giving certain information is being prepared and will be laid on the Table of the House at the earliest possible date.</p>

<question by="#papenfus" to="#minister_of_lands">

<num>III.</num>

<from>Mr. PAPENFUS</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Lands:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he received a deputation in Pretoria of representatives of the Wanderers&#x2019; View standholders early in December, 1926, relative to the conversion of the State&#x2019;s interest in the said stands as ground owners into freehold in favour of the said standholders;</li>

<li><span class="col_49-50" refersTo="page_0091"/>(2) whether the deputation in question informed him that a tentative agreement had been entered into between the standholders in question and the lessees from Government, as to the latter&#x2019;s interest and rights, and that the conclusion of such agreement was dependent upon the Government&#x2019;s decision as to what the State demanded for its interest in the land;</li>

<li>(3) Yes, but the decision of the Government, View lessees are still awaiting the Government&#x2019;s decision in the matter, and, if so, will he furnish reasons, if any, for such delay?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_lands" to="#papenfus">

<from>The MINISTER OF LANDS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) Yes.</li>

<li>(3) Yes, but the decision of the Government which is favourable to the standholders, has been communicated to the Rand Townships Registrar who has been requested to formulate a procedure whereby the interests of the Government, the standholders and the township owners will be safeguarded. I would, however, remind the hon. member that this matter has been the subject of discussion and negotiation for many years&#x2014;long before I assumed office&#x2014;and that he is well aware of the difficulties involved.</li>

</ol>

</answer>

<question by="#papenfus" to="#minister_of_lands">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. PAPENFUS:</from>

<p>Arising out of this answer, may I ask the Minister whether a further communication from a townships officer to the standholders would take another ten months? I understand from the Minister&#x2019;s reply that a communication will be sent from the townships officer to the standholders.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_lands" to="#papenfus">

<from>The MINISTER OF LANDS:</from>

<p>No, the Rand Registrar pointed out to me certain difficulties which I can explain to the hon. member (Mr. Papenfus), but it will take too long to do so here. I said, &#x201C;Meet these people and draw up a scheme which will be acceptable to all of them.&#x201D; The whole matter has been approved of and it is only a technical difficulty.</p>

<heading>PUBLIC SERVICE: COURT MESSENGER, DURBAN.</heading>

<question by="#marwick" to="#minister_of_justice">

<num>IV.</num>

<from>Mr. MARWICK</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Justice:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) In what terms did the Minister telegraph to the hon. member for Umbilo, at the end of June or early in July, 1926, in consequence of the hon. member&#x2019;s report to the Minister as to the serious cash deficiency in the court messenger&#x2019;s office, Durban;</li>

<li>(2) what communication was made by the Minister to the magistrate, Durban, at the same time or previously as to the advisability of dismissing the person responsible for the shortage?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#marwick">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) So far as I can remember, I was informed that a member of the messenger&#x2019;s staff had misappropriated funds belonging to the messenger and I replied in effect that the matter should be reported to the magistrate at once. This was done by the messenger.</li>

<li>(2) I did not make any communication to the magistrate at the time. The messenger&#x2019;s books were subsequently audited and it was not found at that time that any monies due to the Government had not been paid.</li>

</ol>

<p>The member of the messenger&#x2019;s staff was dismissed by the messenger and was subsequently prosecuted and acquitted.</p>

<question by="#anderson" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. ANDERSON:</from>

<p>Arising out of that reply what interest or concern has the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Reyburn) in the court messenger&#x2019;s office that he should report upon a cash deficiency or receive a communication involving the dismissal of an official?</p>

</question>

<question by="#speaker" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. SPEAKER:</from>

<p>That rather anticipates the motion.</p>

<p>Then I would like to know whether the Minister will lay on the table the report of the hon. member for Umbilo and that received by the magistrate on the same subject.</p>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#anderson">

<from>&#x2020;The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>There is no report made at all that I know of. I got friendly information from the hon. member for which I was very grateful and I indicated the right course to be followed, which was followed.</p>

<question by="#speaker" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. SPEAKER:</from>

<p>The hon. member may put his first question.</p>

</question>

<question by="#anderson" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. ANDERSON:</from>

<p>The question is: What interest or concern has the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Reyburn) in the court messenger&#x2019;s office that he should report upon a cash deficiency or receive a communication involving the dismissal of an official?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#anderson">

<from>&#x2020;The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>I know of no interest that the hon. member has in that office or any concern that he has. I imagined that he was giving me information on the subject. Nor was any question of the dismissal of an official involved, because a messenger is not an official.</p>

</answer>

<question by="#anderson" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. ANDERSON:</from>

<p>How came the hon. member for Umbilo to be interested in this matter at all, whether the messenger was an official or not?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#anderson">

<from>&#x2020;The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>I have stated that as far as I am aware he is not interested in this matter. Surely that is fairly clear.</p>

</answer>

<question by="#marwick" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. MARWICK:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister if he will reply to my question: in what terms did the Minister telegraph to the hon. member for Umbilo? That has not been disclosed.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#anderson">

<from>&#x2020;The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>The terms were that it should at once be reported by the messenger to the magistrate. My idea was that steps would be immediately taken for prosecution if on inquiry it was found that the statement was correct. As a matter of <span class="col_51-52" refersTo="page_0092"/>fact he did take steps because he at once reported it to the magistrate.</p>

</answer>

<question by="#marwick" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. MARWICK:</from>

<p>Is the Minister prepared to say that the statement made on oath in court that telegram contained an indication that the person responsible for the deficiency should be dismissed is incorrect?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#marwick">

<from>&#x2020;The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>That is possibly quite correct too. I have not seen the telegram for some time and if the telegram said that, I should imagine that it was a perfectly correct attitude to take up.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. MARWICK:</from>

<p>Will the Minister lay it on the table of the House?</p>

<from>&#x2020;The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>If the hon. member had followed the debates he would know that was debated years ago in this House. Why should one do it again? I would advise the hon. member to look up the Hansard reports which would answer that question at once.</p>

<from>Mr. MARWICK</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Justice:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) From what date was Mr. Mottram, an attorney, appointed as messenger of the court, Durban;</li>

<li>(2) is he required to devote his whole time during office hours to the work of his office, and what is his rate of pay;</li>

<li>(3) upon what date during office hours did he appear as attorney for an Indian client before the Rural Licensing Court, Pine-town; and</li>

<li>(4) what remuneration did he receive for this service, and if he has paid the amount to Government revenue, when was it accounted for?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#marwick">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) From the first of July, 1927.</li>

<li>(2) No. Messengers of the court are not members of the public service and they are free to undertake other work except that by section 13 (3) of Act 32 of 1917, a messenger may not practice as an attorney or agent. The messenger does not draw a salary. He is entitled to the fees which he earns under the tariff laid down in the Magistrates&#x2019; Courts Act of 1917, but it is a condition of his appointment that he is to pay to Government revenue the excess of his net earnings over &#x00A3;1,500 per annum.</li>

<li>(3) I am informed that he did not so appear and that he has not practised as an attorney since his appointment. A few days after his appointment he appeared as a private citizen to oppose an application by an Indian before the rural licensing board at Pinetown and he received no fee in connection therewith.</li>

<num>IX.</num>

<from>Mr. C. P. ROBINSON</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Justice:</p>

<li>(1) Whether a fidelity bond was entered into to safeguard the Treasury against loss in respect of monies handled by&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) Mr. T. H. Spargo, court messenger, Durban;</li>

<li>(b) Mr. A. van Belkum, deputy messenger, Durban, and, if so, for what amount in each instance;</li></ol></li>

<li>(2) what is the outstanding deficiency for which Mr. Spargo is now liable to Government;</li>

<li>(3) has the liability under the fidelity bond been met;</li>

<li>(4) if not, what valid reason can be given for non-payment; and</li>

<li>(5) will the Minister lay upon the table a copy of Mr. Spargo&#x2019;s letter of appointment as court messenger, Durban?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#robinson">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) Yes, for &#x00A3;1,500; (b) No. The messenger appoints his own staff and is responsible for them so that a fidelity bond was not required.</li>

<li>(2) &#x00A3;1,479, and the amount paid over by him to Government was &#x00A3;7,000 odd.</li>

<li>(3) No.</li>

<li>(4) It appeared that the same form of bond had been used by the magistrate as had been used for fidelity bonds for messengers in Natal before. The messenger of Durban, however, was not appointed by me on the same conditions as before, under which he was entitled to retain the whole amount of his earnings. I made it a condition that net profits over &#x00A3;1,500 per annum were to be paid into revenue. The bond which had been entered into provided for restitution in cases of theft or fraud. It was submitted to the law advisers who advised that the terms thereof were not sufficiently wide to enable the company concerned to be successfully sued in respect of the fulfilment by the messenger of his contractual obligation towards the Government. The question of a civil action against Mr. Spargo, personally, was considered but careful enquiries disclosed that he has no assets and that it would be throwing good money after bad to institute proceedings.</li>

<li>(5) Yes.</li>

<heading>WOMEN&#x2019;S ENFRANCHISEMENT BILL.</heading>

<speech by="#brown">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. BROWN:</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">For leave to introduce a Bill to provide for the extension of the franchise to women in the election of members of the House of Assembly and Provincial Councils.</block>

<p>The general position is, and one I have always pleaded, to allow the Bill to be introduced. I ask hon. members is it fair on a great question like this not to allow one-half of the population to receive this treatment. Once or twice when this question has been introduced it has been received with laughter, and I ask hon. members, suppose they had a question which was dear to their hearts and for which they were striving, how would they like it if it was met with laughter by this House. There are hon. members who are honestly and conscientiously opposed to the extension of the franchise to women, but that is no reason why they should stifle discussion and not allow the other side to have their say. I submit that the House should pass the first reading, and let us debate the Bill on its merits. The question is, have women a right to a vote, are they justified in demanding a vote, and is this House prepared to give them a vote. We are the only free civilised country in the world that has not extended the franchise to women. If the Bill is thrown out, it should not be thrown out without some of its supporters being heard. The question is one which has not been debated in this House for two years; much water has flowed under the bridge since then, and many new facts have come before us. I would submit I hope I have said sufficient to make the position clear that hon. members who are opposing this Bill should not adopt a dog-in-the-manger position, but should give the supporters of the Bill an opportunity of stating their reasons in favour of the Bill. Give them an opportunity of being heard, and let us come to the second reading, and give us an opportunity of being heard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#brown">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. BROWN</person>:</from>

<p>I second the motion. To those of us who have been interested in this matter it is a matter of grievance to see the ribald manner in which the question has been received in previous sessions. I hope to-day the Bill will be introduced, and that it will be treated as an important matter before the Parliament of the country, and that it will at least be debated on the second reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_watt">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS WATT</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to support the motion, because I think this Bill is long overdue. We have discussed the matter time after time, and the weight of public opinion outside this House is certainly in favour of passing a Bill such as this into law; and I hope the House will see fit to approve of the motion and allow the Bill to be read a first time. It is quite likely when we come to the details of the Bill, some of us may take exception to some of the clauses, but as far as the principle is concerned I think that there can be no question that the women are entitled to have a say in the making of the laws of the country. They are fellow citizens, they are taxpayers, and are as much interested in the laws passed here as are the men, and from every point of view including that of intelligence and citizenship, they are equally entitled to a voice in the election of members of Parliament. I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether, assuming the Bill is introduced, the Government will give a day or two for the consideration of the second reading. Otherwise it seems a waste of time to have a Bill read a first time and then for it to go by the board, owing to the fact that Government has taken all the available days for Government business. The Prime Minister would meet the wishes of the country if he gave facilities for a second reading debate on this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#close">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CLOSE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say a few words to explain my position. Ever since I have been in the House I have consistently opposed the principles of the Bill, and I am just as strongly opposed to them as I have ever been. Nevertheless, I have never voted for the rejection of the Bill on the first reading, because it is only fair that on a very important matter like this the people interested in the Bill should have an opportunity of having the measure fully discussed in Parliament, so that the country may hear the views for and against the proposal re-stated. I also wish to voice a protest, for on the last few occasions when the matter has been before us, the House has not given that serious consideration to the subject which its importance undoubtedly deserves. When I vote on the principle of the Bill I reserve my right to vote as I have done before.</p>

I have noticed that where <span class="col_59-60" refersTo="page_0096"/>women become members of town councils they have done good work. I am convinced that if the franchise is given to women more than one man will have to be silent when they rise as they will introduce more honesty and earnestness into the House.

They have knocked at the doors of this Parliament for many years and the question has been treated in a manner that is hardly a credit to this House. It is refreshing to hear the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) having the courage of his convictions. I would like to see the other members of the Labour party who have so often clamoured for women&#x2019;s franchise, have the courage of their convictions, but they are all silent, all muzzled.

What I do urge is that the women <span class="col_61-62" refersTo="page_0097"/>of South Africa are as worthy to have the franchise as the women of every other country which has given women the franchise. The women of this country have a right to the franchise and I say that it would be a disgrace and a shame to withhold it from them any longer.

<p>No, a member of this House interjected something about a red herring. I said it is neither a red herring nor a blackleg. I would ask hon. members on the opposite side how many of them will vote against this Bill in committee unless it includes native men and women. We know what the feeling of the Cape members of the South African party is on that question, and we also know that if it includes native women, the rest of the members of that party will vote against the Bill. These are some of the questions that will have to be faced in the committee stage, and I say the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Papenfus) is consciously or unconsciously misleading the women of South Africa when he leads them to believe that they are in sight of the vote in South Africa. They have got the vote of the Labour party. Where we are going to split is when we come to the details of the exact qualification and the question of who shall get the franchise. There is the question of age; there is the question of colour, and there is another question where many men say that if a woman pays income tax she should have a vote, and if she owns property she should have a vote. I would be only too pleased to think that every member who votes in favour of the second reading would be equally solid when it comes to the committee stage, but it is not so, and we must face the position. As far as I am concerned, and I believe as far as the members of the Labour party are concerned, we are going to vote in favour of this resolution. In spite of any attempts that may be made to make party capital out of it, in spite of jeers which may be hurled at us, we have been and are, in favour of the enfranchisement of women and we are going to vote in favour of this resolution.</p>

We have yet to see what exhibition the Minister of Labour will give us. I am surprised he is sitting still and with such a vacant look on his face. After the way the women of Durban treated him recently surely he has a good word to say for them. They presented him with gifts, they literally threw eggs at him. It looks very bad indeed when three Ministers representing the Labour party are running away from one of its cardinal principles. Women&#x2019;s franchise is one of the main planks in the principles of the Labour party. Here they have an opportunity of standing up to their pledges and they decline to do so.

<p>If members say a thing long enough they will believe it. You have to take the record of the Labour party. Members may jeer as much as they like, and I am prepared to jeer back, but I am not going to make this a party question. The Labour party is the only party which has given women the vote in South Africa. When the Labour party was in power in the Provincial Council of the Transvaal they gave women the vote in municipalities. The South African party have been in power for many years in the Cape, and they never gave women the vote. Time after time they voted against it. Time after time the Labour party brought forward a measure and the South African party joined hands with our friends over there and dished that Bill. I will throw out this challenge to the South African party&#x2014;let us have a division on this. Let us fight it, and the hon. member for Colesberg (Mr. G. A. Louw) will vote against it, and the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) will vote against it although you have made it a party plank with your tongue in your cheek and you know it. Still worse, if it were passed through this House another place would throw it out. The leader of the South African party in the Senate is dead against the Bill. Why should we make this a party Bill? I have always voted for women&#x2019;s franchise and every man on these benches has always voted for it. Take the records of this House. What happened last time? We passed it through the first reading and the second reading, and then we sent it to a select committee and it was thrown out.

<p>I am talking of this House. A large number of South African party men refuse to vote for any Bill which does not include coloured women, and a large number refuse to support it if it does include coloured women. That is the danger and the difficulty. If we had no coloured class in South Africa the women would get the vote this afternoon. The difficulty is that we have coloured and native classes in this country. Take the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander). He has always been a strong supporter of women&#x2019;s rights. He refuses, and says so openly, to vote for a Bill which contains a clause which does not allow coloured women to have a vote. To go through the country and say the Labour party is opposed to their getting the franchise is a deliberate untruth, and anyone who says it after now is telling a lie. We may have our faults; no doubt we nave. We recognise ours, but we have stood by women&#x2019;s franchise through thick and thin. The women have never reciprocated as far as the Labour party is concerned. The people who are running women&#x2019;s franchise to-day are anti-Labour. Women are entitled to the vote, and if the Labour party were in power to-morrow they would have the vote, and if Labour could do anything with the Nationalists to-morrow, they would do it. We will not do as the hon. member for Rondebosch said: &#x201C;We will vote for it to-day; but to-morrow we will throw it out.&#x201D; The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) told the truth. We must tell the women of South Africa that they have not a hope of getting the vote, because it will go to a select committee and be thrown out on a colour bar again. That colour bar will not be brought in by members of the Labour party; the Bill will be thrown out by members of the Nationalist party and the South African party. The public of the country should know, and the women should know that even if we passed the first reading and the second reading it will be thrown out on the colour bar. Why humbug the women of South Africa? It cannot be done; you cannot carry this Bill through the House as it is constituted to-day. The South African party have no right to tell the women of South Africa that Labour is opposed to them. Labour is not. The Labour party has always laid down the principle of equal rights for women. The South African party have never done that. They have always put women on a lower level as far as wages are concerned than men. For them to come forward and accuse Labour of fighting against the women&#x2019;s cause is wrong and undeserved, and I rise to protest against it.</p>

I admit his statement that up to 1924 the Labour party were wholeheartedly and loyally in support of this principle, and I admit that when the Labour party had power in the Provincial Council they enfranchised, in regard to municipal votes, the women of the Transvaal. I propose to continue the process of examining the record of the Labour party since 1924 up to the present date. Up to 1924 the Labour party was ploughing a lonely furrow. I propose to examine in detail what the Labour party in its <span class="col_65-66" refersTo="page_0099"/>new political alliance, its new political orientation, has done in the cause of women&#x2019;s suffrage ever since. It had a cardinal opportunity for displaying the sincerity of its views when the Electoral Act came before this House in 1925. Then a motion was moved in committee to insert in the Bill a provision whereby the franchise was extended to women on the same terms as to men, but the Labour party on that occasion deliberately chose rather to muzzle the press and put in some of the fantastic clauses that went into the Bill than extend its scope so as to include women&#x2019;s franchise. In 1925 the hon. member for Roodepoort (the Rev. Mr. Mullineux) introduced a motion for the general enfranchisement of women, and on voices Mr. Speaker gave it that the &#x201C;noes&#x201D; had it. The hon. member for Roodepoort, not deliberately, but through sheer inadvertence or lack of interest, failed to call for a division.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>In the twelve years I have been in this House I have never lost an opportunity of helping on the cause of women&#x2019;s suffrage. These eighteen or nineteen gentlemen, having made an inglorious spectacle of themselves in 1925, had to face the music at the Port Elizabeth Labour party congress in December, 1925, and there they had to listen to some very plain speaking, which was repeated in Cape Town and elsewhere by the women of their own party. These eighteen or nineteen hon. members came to the House in 1926 quite determined to remove the blot from their escutcheon. But the mountain was in Labour and brought forth a mouse, and a very little one, too. They moved a motion that a select committee should be appointed to enquire into how you could enfranchise women, and get over or ignore the colour question. If you compare the one side of the picture with the other and their burning zeal before 1924 with their apathy, and almost their hostility, since 1924, it is symptomatic of the dry rot which has crept over the party since the Pact was formed. You cannot touch pitch and not be defiled. You cannot enter into an alliance with a conservative party and give out that you are a democratic party. So long as the Labour party continues its present political alliance, so long is their support for women&#x2019;s suffrage merely lip service, and not worth the snap of a finger. You have only to listen to the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) and the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) and see the doleful picture they paint, and one can almost feel that they say: &#x201C;I am so glad that these difficulties will occur in committee, because they will allow us to postpone the inevitable clash that will come one day with our friends opposite.&#x201D; The women of South Africa know that as long as the Pact continues, so long they can write off the Labour party as genuine supporters of women&#x2019;s franchise. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) has said that the Labour party will never allow the colour bar question to clog this women&#x2019;s franchise question, and will not allow any colour bar to be introduced. Well, memories seem to be short, and the hon. member seems to be blessed with a particularly short memory&#x2014;certainly by his vote and by that of his colleagues on the colour bar Bill.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear the hon. member&#x2019;s explanation, because I know he was against the colour bar Bill, but he was speaking for the Labour party.

<p>I withdraw that, and say the regrettable Bill passed two years ago. When the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) speaks of the colour bar he cannot but help agreeing with me that the attitude his colleagues took was a deplorable one, and one which he dare not defend on a public platform. I tell the hon. member for Three Rivers (Mr. D. M.

<p>No, the greater includes the less. I was referring to the Labour party attitude, and I repeat that the Labour party is protending to be in favour of women&#x2019;s votes, and that every year we have this elaborate pretence; but when it comes to the push of getting women&#x2019;s franchise and votes a real fact, we always find that nothing happens, and some sort of way is found to dodge the straight issue. But when it comes to the flag issue the Labour party is solid. I hope the women will take note of the difference of the attitude of the Labour party with regard to women&#x2019;s suffrage and the flag. The Prime Minister told us he was not going to have this question brought to a point until the native question is solved. To me that seems a very thin excuse. Is there a man who thinks that the Prime Minister has a solution of that problem? During the elections we were told that the Prime Minister had a solution in his pocket, and would lay his solution before us during the first session. We used to comment on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s frequent absence from the House then, and we were told&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Hush, the Prime Minister is putting the final touches to his Native Act.</block>

<p>The second session nothing happened, and we were told that the Prime Minister was making some wonderful improvements. In the third and fourth sessions there was not a word about it. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s solution reminds me of the story of the siege of Paris, when the commander said he had a wonderful solution in the safe, and after the whole thing had been botched and Paris taken, they opened the safe, and found a blank paper.</p>

<speech by="#reitz">

<from>&#x2020;Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>The point is the Prime Minister has never solved the native problem, and that being the case, it is a very thin excuse to say, wait until he solves it. I hope the women of this country will take note that this native problem is being used to delay and to defeat women&#x2019;s suffrage. Why cannot more particularly the European women have the vote, and why should they have to wait until the native problems have been solved? As far as I understand this wonderful native legislation I don&#x2019;t think anyone believes in it. But if it should come to anything it will restrict the native vote. So why should this burning question of women&#x2019;s franchise wait until the native question has been solved? This is simply an excuse for waiving the subject.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARWICK</person>:</from>

<p>This debate should not be allowed to conclude without the responsibility for shelving the question being placed on the right shoulders. There is no doubt whatever that those who voted yesterday for the curtailment of private members&#x2019; privileges deliberately did so knowing that their action would result in preventing the women&#x2019;s suffrage Bill from going any further this session. The, hon. member for Three Rivers (Mr. D. M. Brown) is applying for leave to introduce a Bill. If that leave be granted, owing to the motion that was passed yesterday, no open date will be available for a second reading debate on the measure. The Labour party deliberately assumed the responsibility yesterday for a motion which will bar a full discussion of the women&#x2019;s franchise question. We have had the definite declaration of the Prime Minister that no facilities will be granted for the further stages of the measure until the native question has been settled. There, again, the Labour party are participants.</p>

<p>The hon. member, then, is responsible for assisting to pass a motion the known effect of which would be to completely stop the further consideration of women&#x2019;s enfranchisement this session. After the fifty-first sitting day, even assuming that the flag and other contentious Bills are passed, Government business has precedence on Fridays, and, therefore, there will be no opportunity for any private member to move for the consideration of this Bill. That completely bars the way to the Bill proceeding beyond the first reading stage this session, and the Labour members in this House must shoulder the entire responsibility.</p>

<p>I should not like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) to continue deceiving himself, because he is apparently under the impression that he has rendered a service to women&#x2019;s franchise by his speech. I also know the strong feeling in the country about women&#x2019;s franchise, and I know that those who are in favour of it are more than sick to-day at the sort of speech which is made by the hon. member. He has not Raid a word about the merits of the matter, or on the means of getting rid of present difficulties. The arguments used were nothing but recriminations of the Labour party. The women&#x2019;s franchise is turned into a football of party politics by the Opposition, and nothing else, and I think that the women of the country are tired of it. The hon. members for Bezuidenhout and for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) will render good service to women&#x2019;s franchise if they do not make speeches on the matter.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister agrees with me. If the Opposition are prepared once for all to keep the native franchise outside of party politics and to deal with it on a broad basis as a whole, and if they are willing to sacrifice the twelve to fifteen thousand native votes, then it will not take a year before we have women&#x2019;s franchise. If we vote against it, it is not because we are opposed to it in principle. I cannot find any reasonable ground for opposing it in principle, but I find that there are practical objections. But the practical objections can be easily removed if hon. members opposite will adopt a sensible attitude. The Labour party is being reproached as the cause of women not getting the vote, but I think it sounds hollow in the ears of those who know the position. No, the thing is in the hands of the Opposition, and depends on their co-operation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#brown">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. BROWN</person>:</from>

<p>With reference to the statement made by the Prime Minister, the difficulty can be got over by inserting in this Bill a clause stating that it shall not come into force until a date to be fixed by the Governor-General. Then, it could become law after the Native Bills had been passed. My greatest opponent in this House will not say that I have used the Women&#x2019;s Enfranchisement Bill for party purposes. I have been advocating votes for women for 20 years since I have been in Parliament and for 20 years before that, so it is not a party matter with me. Hon. members on all sides of the House are in favour of this measure, although they may not support the details. I am sorry the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) is not in his place for he made a remark which was really unworthy of him when be stated that the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) would by the arguments he used drive some members to vote against the Bill. Surely, there is no member of the Labour or any other party so weak-kneed that because somebody in favour of the Bill uses arguments they do not like, they will, therefore, vote against the measure. The hon. member for Brakpan also stated that the Bill has been used for the purpose of making party capital. I deny that entirely. There are members on this side of the House, and also on the other side, who are conscientiously opposed to votes for women, but should women&#x2019;s enfranchisement take place, they will very humbly ask women electors for their support.</p>

<p>One other point. The hon. member for Roodepoort (the Rev. Mr. Mullineux) has explained that last session he was so taken aback at his motion being defeated that he quite forgot to call for a division. Why should we not accept that explanation? He did not realize the position, but I shall not be caught in that way. Then the argument has been raised that, even if we pass this measure, it will be defeated in another place. But we have no concern with what the other place will do. If it is thrown out in the other place, we should elect members of the other branch of the legislature who will support the franchise being extended to women. I appeal to hon. members, no matter what their opinions may be, to support me to-day. As to the position of the hon. member for Rondebosch (Mr. Close) I have acted in the same way on other measures in order to give an opportunity for a Bill to be discussed. At the same time, I cannot understand an intelligent man like the hon. member for Rondebosch being against the extension of the franchise to women. However, we do get these oddities, and, at any rate, the hon. member has always been in favour of a full and free discussion of the subject. I appeal to the House not to throw the Bill out to-day. This is not the stage for doing that. This is the stage for enquiry, but after the second reading, you vote on the main question Some hon. members want the vote for European women only&#x2014;in that case they should bring in an amendment to that effect. With reference to coloured women, it must not be forgotten that the coloured races are our property, and we have no right to despise them. I make a final appeal to hon. members&#x2014;do not make this a party question, but give an opportunity for a full second reading debate. There are members, I know, who are honestly against me on this question. To-day I hope hon. members will act fairly and justly and allow this measure to get a second reading, so that we can hear what has to be said on both sides. I hope and feel confident we shall get a full Labour vote and a large majority on this side of the House.</p>
