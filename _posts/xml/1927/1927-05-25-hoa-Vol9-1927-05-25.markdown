<heading>Arcos House Raid.</heading>

<question by="#gilson" to="#prime_minister">

<from>Mr. GILSON</from>

<p>with leave, asked the Prime Minister:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention had been directed to the statement by Mr. Baldwin, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, to the effect that amongst the papers seized by the authorities in London during the raid on the Soviet (Arcos) House was a list of the heads of the Communist parties in various countries, including South Africa;</li>

<li>(2) whether the Government is in possession of the name of the South African head of the Communist party;</li>

<li>(3) if so, what is the name of that person, and who are his associates; and</li>

<li>(4) if not, will the Government obtain the information from the Imperial Government and state the name or names to this House?</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#prime_minister" to="#gilson">

<from>The PRIME MINISTER:</from>

<p>My attention has been drawn to that, yes. We do not and I do not possess any information about any name, and I am afraid that if I did possess it, I would not think it advisable to tell it to this House.</p>

<p>First Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for second reading, South African Nationality and Flag Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate, adjourned on 23rd May, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>Before resuming my speech I wish to say that I for one appreciate the courage and the tone of the speech made by the hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay). The speech he made the other day required a great deal of courage, and I feel, and many feel, that he was speaking for a very large section of the men who are the ordinary members of the Labour party outside this House. I also wish to protest most strongly against the behaviour which is meted out to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz) whenever he gets up to speak, but especially on Monday.</p>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>He does not ask for it. One cannot help coining to the conclusion that it is done because he, being a Dutchman, has the courage to stand up and give expression to his opinions and feelings without any reservation. I say that he stands for a very big section of the Dutch in this country, and in offering this affront to him they are affronting their brothers in this country who think with him.</p>

<p>What do you know about the Dutch?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to resume my speech as near as I can where I stopped the other evening. I endeavoured to show how this country for the last 25 years has gone through periods of peace and quietude which have been disturbed from time to time by the actions of this man or that any especially now by the revival of this question of the flag. I wish to repeat that when the Prime Minister returned from the Imperial Conference and made his speech in Cape Town, which he repeated in Pretoria, a sigh of relief went up in the country, especially from those of British birth and descent, whether English or Dutch-speaking, that now at last we had got on to a stable basis which would not be again disturbed. We thought there would be a wider and more statesmanlike outlook, and that there would be a true appreciation of South Africa&#x2019;s position within the empire and a wiser handling of our destiny. He then had the opportunity of finally silencing that agitation. Whatever the influences were that were brought to bear we cannot tell, but he appeared to waver and then eventually to succumb to the rabid fanaticism, as I cannot help calling it, of Dr. Malan. I am not speaking of the Dr. Malan the Minister, but the Dr. Malan as the speaker in the countryside.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member cannot dissociate Dr. Malan from the hon. member for Calvinia.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>Then I presume he surrendered to the pressure brought upon him by the Minister of the Interior who is so obstinately wedded to this Bill and nothing but this Bill. I cannot consider that in any way the flag provisions of the Bill are national. They are sectional in the true sense of the word in that they represent the views of the extremist section whether in the Labour party or in the Nationalist ranks or outside those ranks. Until there is a much greater unanimity of feeling on this point, we cannot call it a national design or a national flag or a national settlement of the question at all.</p>

<p>Can you suggest a better one?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>I could find many better ones. I want to point out that we cannot, in view of what has occurred in the last few months, pretend that there is a true fusion of the people in this Union. There is not. But that fusion is coming. It is coming more rapidly than some people like to see. We are forced to the conclusion that there are still people who do not wish to see that better feeling which we all pray for. But it is bound to come. Nothing will stop it. Until we get agreement amongst the people as to what emblems they wish to have incorporated in the national flag I think it would be disastrous to try and impose any particular emblem or design on those people. Let them first come to an agreement as to what form the emblems should take, which shall symbolize each of the two main constituent elements of the European populations, in the national flag. It would then truly represent the people of both sides. The elements of the Europeans in this country&#x2014;I want now to deal more particularly with one area of the Cape Province&#x2014;are mainly of British and of Dutch descent, with an intermixture of Huguenot French blood and blood from Flanders. That being the broad principle, that we in the Union are British and Dutch, I would like to say that, to go back a little over a century&#x2014;</p>

<p>What about German descent?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that in a few minutes, and I am going to deal with it in a way which I hope the hon. member will take to heart. Well, a little over a century ago a considerable body of people who form one of those elements came to this country. The British settlers of 1820 were thrust, untrained and inexperienced, into the wilds of the Eastern Province. They were put there as a buffer between the savage hordes of negroes and the Dutch settlers of the Midlands and the rest of the colony. Do not let us forget that for a moment.</p>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>It is a pity we did not ask for and get a few more thousands of those men. Those early British and early Dutch settlers&#x2014;they did not raise these questions. They lived in peace and friendship with each other. They were partners in every enterprise. They were comrades and brothers in every war against the kaffirs in the east.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROOD</person>:</from>

<p>Is that why the great trek followed?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>One of the reasons why they trekked was that in those days, amongst a certain section of the Dutch there was an antipathy to anything like law and order and good government control. The descendants of <span class="col_4105-4106" refersTo="page_0713"/>those 3,000 British settlers number no fewer than from 160,000 to 170,000 to-day, and are some of the best citizens we have in this Union. Are these men and their traditions to be ignored? They have no flag but the Union Jack. They have come from England or are of English descent and they have their old English flag of St. George in the Union Jack; but what does it mean to them now, apart from its inclusion in the Union Jack? They are from Scottish descent and have a still older flag of St. Andrew dating from 980 a.d.; and they are from Irish descent with the cross of St. Patrick, which goes back to 411 a.d.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>My immediate ancestral flag is the Union Jack; more remotely it was the Holland-Dutch flag. I am speaking as a South African of British and Dutch descent, with a name which has not been changed and of blood of which I am proud. Are you going into the ethnology of every man, and because he has stuck to his name to say that he belongs to a race that he does not belong to? These inmost feelings and sacred traditions of these people are not to be uprooted by any section in the country. Another element of the European population of the Union are the Germans of the Eastern Province who came here and adopted South Africa as their home; they fought under the Union Jack and enlisted under it; their children were born under it, and they know no other flag but the Union Jack</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>No, there was no compulsion. They came out as free men, and have proved that all through their history. They have proved staunch to their oath and allegiance and they have been in the forefront of the people who defended this country. They have been loyal to the Union Jack, and no other section has been more so. Compare their action in the last war. I saw the memorial at King-williamstown, and amongst the names on that memorial 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. at least were German names. Are they Germans? No, they are South Africans&#x2014;British South Africans by adoption and by birth, but proud of their German descent. The St. George&#x2019;s Cross means nothing to them, but the Union Jack means much.</p>

It is not for me to waste the time of the House with my ethnological descent, but I shall be glad to show any hon. member who is curious the point how every drop of blood in my veins is English and Dutch and before that German blood. I am proud of being South African, but I am more proud still that I am British as well.</p>

<p>Well then, we want people to come who know they can make their homes here and feel they are welcome here, and not be subject to disturbances. I want to tell you in all seriousness, that when I was over in England in 1925 man after man&#x2014;not the ordinary &#x201C;men in the street,&#x201D; but members of the House of Commons&#x2014;approached me and said that they were of opinion that the Englishman was not wanted in South Africa. That was the impression they had gained.</p>

<p>Did you believe it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>I did the best I could to contradict it. I did not believe it, because there is a large section which welcomes the Englishman in this country and the Prime Minister himself stated that he would welcome men from the British Isles, but the interjections I have been subjected to and what has been said all go to prove that there was ground for people&#x2019;s fear and for their suspicions. The effect of the introduction of the Flag Bill has been, without question, to create a feeling that every country is better for British settlers to go to than South Africa, and also in view of the open indications that men of English descent are not wanted here. It is our hope and wish, and is it not our real destiny, that at some future time Rhodesia should form with the Union a greater South African State?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What has that to do with the flag?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>It has much to do with the flag. Rhodesia cannot and will not come in until they know that the flag is there for all time. There has of late been a bigger inflow of settlers to the northern parts of South Africa&#x2014;Rhodesia and the eastern states &#x2014;than into this country. It is a small enough stream in all conscience, and we are not doing enough to increase it, but we are doing enough to stem that flow. The Lord knows that a greatly increased white population is the big question before us. No other question compares with that big outstanding question&#x2014;are we going to form a large enough nation, in numbers, to hold our own with the black people of the Continent of Africa? Another effect of this Bill has been emigration from South Africa, which is the most sinister fact of all. People who have spent their lives, or from twenty to forty years in this country, are leaving it. You cannot deny it. The Minister of the Interior knows that better than most of us, having access to all the emigration figures. There is emigration of people we ought to welcome here and ought to keep here. I know <span class="col_4107-4108" refersTo="page_0714"/>personally men who have said to me they are not going to stay in a country where the Union Jack is in danger of being pulled down. Even amongst English-born South Africans, born in this country&#x2014;born of English parents&#x2014; amongst these South Africans there is a feeling that even South African-born English are not wanted here.</p>

<p>My point is&#x2014;let us restore that faith and confidence that it is not so, and make for the political stability we want in this country. I want to emphasize that the men I represent&#x2014;the men of the Eastern Province&#x2014;are not racial. Racialism is unknown in that part of the country. [Interjections.] No one who knows me and knows my past work amongst the farmers of this country can accuse me of having one iota of racialism.</p>

<p>Except in the Boer war.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#struben">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>No, not even then. I hope what I say will not be taken as any attempt to stir up feeling, but simply to bring home the truth. These men are not emotional nor racial, but they feel deeply, though silently, and are determined and dogged, and are not having demonstrations simply for the sake of making demonstrations. They are of both English descent and of Dutch descent. [Interruptions.] It is unfortunate that some people think that one cannot be a good Englishman, a good Scotsman, or a good South African, and still be a good Briton, but we all are &#x201C;British&#x201D; in the widest sense, being but British people of different racial descent. The feelings of the people in the Eastern Province are a far better index to the feelings of the English-speaking people in South Africa than are those of the people with whom, no doubt, the Minister of the Interior conferred when he drew up this Bill. I maintain that men who are prepared to stand by their traditions and by their history are far more able to judge of the feelings of the English-speaking section than are the Minister of Defence and others of his party who have told the Minister to go on with this flag proposal and that the English-speaking people would accept it. Unfortunately, the Minister went to the wrong men for information, and he has been misled.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and I expect making money out of it, under the protection of the flag under which I fought, and which you were wearing in your button-hole yesterday. I flew the flag of the Union of South Africa over the squadron which I commanded during the great war, and I respected our Union coat-of-arms but that does not make me want to see the other symbol on that flag&#x2014;the Union Jack&#x2014; eliminated. Britons and many thousands of Dutch are most willing to meet those who desire to embody other emblems than the Union Jack in a national flag, but they refuse to accept any compromise which would call upon them to do violence to their deepest sentiments and most sacred traditions, and to forswear their honour and birthright. We do not demand the inclusion of the Union Jack as the &#x201C;emblem of the conqueror,&#x201D; as stated by certain irreconcilables, but because it symbolizes the history and traditions and allegiance of many centuries, and because love and veneration for that flag are rooted deep in the inmost heart of each and every true Briton, and of very many thousands of Dutchmen and men of German descent, and of all the natives and coloured people of South Africa. All British South Africans are proud of their South Africanism, but equally proud of their racial descent and traditions, and of their equality with the other dominions and states in their membership of the British Commonwealth, and of their unswerving allegiance to the British Crown for which the Union Jack stands in the eyes of the world, as in their own. We are proud of our South African nationality, but we are equally proud of our racial descent and tradition. The Union Jack is the symbol which implies that we are an important unit of a greater commonwealth, and we do not wish to see the tie which binds us to that commonwealth weakened. I wish to deal with the method adopted by the other dominions in selecting their flags. Happily for them, they did not encounter the same trouble in making their selection as we are. In all the dominion flags the red ensign is the main theme, but, whereas the colonies were assigned their badge to be placed in the &#x201C;fly&#x201D; of the flag, the dominions were asked to fill in the &#x201C;fly&#x201D; with their own desired emblems. Australia and new Zealand each adopted the red ensign. New Zealand placed in the &#x201C;fly&#x201D; a cross made up of four stars, and Australia placed on it the Southern Cross of stars with a point for every state in the Commonwealth. In 1910 we followed the example of Canada, which placed on her flag her coat-of-arms. An attempt has been made to provide a distinctly individualistic flag for Canada, in deference to the wishes of a certain section of the French Canadians, but after much discussion, and in view of the conflict of opinions and inability to come to any reasonable compromise or agreement, between a section of the inhabitants of the Province of Quebec and the people of the other provinces of Canada, the attempt was very wisely dropped. Surely that is an example of good sense and good feeling which we in the Union might well follow to the enduring benefit of our country and people? For the conditions in Canada and in this Union are very similar politically, and ethnologically there is a parallel. When we formed the Union and a design for a flag was sought, we followed the example of Canada, and we elected to place in <span class="col_4109-4110" refersTo="page_0715"/>the &#x201C;fly&#x201D; of the red ensign our own Union coat-of-arms, which fittingly consists of the emblems of the two old colonies of the Cape and Natal, and of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, which are the four provinces of a fraternal Union, entered into at the National Convention freely and without any reservations as to future nationality, or any question of new flags or their substitution.

<p>I should not like this debate to pass without saying a few words on the grave subject before us. I think it will be difficult, indeed it will be impossible, to exaggerate the importance of that subject. In the ordinary rough and tumble of Parliament, with arguments bandied about between the parties, we tend to lose our sense of proportion and to lose sight of the main issues behind our discussion. We tend in the course of debate to deal with great matters from a party point of view. But, sir, we are dealing with a subject which is far above the ordinary subjects we discuss in Parliament. I feel that a debate like this is not an ordinary debate between parties. We are not debating here in the ordinary sense. With an issue such as we have before us we are in a large sense a conference &#x2014;a high conference of the nation. We are trying to find out what is the proper course to pursue, feeling that whatever decision we come to will have very far-reaching effects on the future of our nation. It is not a question of ordinary party politics or the sort of thing that generally engages our attention but a grave issue which affects the future of this nation. Most unfortunately the parties are divided on this matter. It is one of the misfortunes of South Africa that in our youth as a nation we are not yet united on fundamentals. Things which, in any other country, are accepted as the basis of national life we, still in our youth and unformed state, question here. Let us do so with all good temper and all good spirit, knowing that the words we utter here will carry far beyond these walls. Even though we talk with restraint in the House let us remember that passions are boiling over in the country beyond these walls. We are a high conference of the nation and the responsibility is laid on us to do our best to find a way out of the struggle. When I join in this debate to-day I assure hon. members on all sides that it is not in the ordinary party sense. I want to recall to the House the greater bearings of this question and emphasize what appears to me to be the great issue at stake, and in that way to bring us to realize that we have to proceed warily and cautiously on the ground we are now treading. There are various points of view in a matter like this. Some members think of the matter from a party point of view, and others naturally, and we should not resent it, look at it from the abstract point of view, as an ideal&#x2014;the ideal of our higher status. Others prefer to look at it in relation to a future republic and ask themselves whether the form of our flag will suit some future republican evolution in this country. Others look upon it as purely a Union question. We should not look at it from the abstract and ideal point of view and not merely from the purely Union point of view. We are dealing with a matter fraught with far-reaching effects and we are bound to consider them and, in a matter like this, I suggest we keep before us the larger African point of view. The hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay) in a speech that does him more honour than his victory in Pretoria, has suggested that we ought to keep before us the African point of view and that we should not decide from the Union point of view merely an issue which is going to affect in a large measure our relations with other communities on this continent. I ask this House to take such a decision in this matter that we may be enabled to keep up a united front with the rest of the civilized communities of this continent. We are trying to establish and render impregnable the European civilization of this country. These communities look upon us as their elder brother. Historically, and in other respects, we have taken the lead and I hope the decision we take on this grave matter will be of such a character that they will continue to co-operate with us and that no feeling of alienation will arise, but that from Cape Town to Kenya these communities shall feel we have acted in a spirit of give and take, a spirit of comradeship, making it possible to preserve a united front in years to come. We have to bear in mind the history upon which the debate arises. To-day, twenty-five years ago, the representatives of the Boer people in the Transvaal and the Free State were debating the question of peace at Vereeniging. I do not agree with the hon. member for Pretoria West when he said the other night that the Boers were the victors in that fight. I would not go as far as that. I would say this. The soul of a nation is not conquered by arms. The soul of a people remains unconquerable, you cannot beat them by force of arms and you cannot beat them by the ballot-box and you will not beat them in the referendum. The Boer people emerged from the struggle, in a sense, a beaten people, but they preserved their faith and kept their honour. They have built up in the war one of the great traditions of South Africa which is almost great enough to compensate for all the loss and suffering of the war. We have to bear that in mind that great tradition; the honour of South Africa and the older population was firmly established from that great struggle in which they had been engaged. It had been preceded by long years of conflict and misunderstanding. I have been twitted here and on the platform with &#x201C;The Century of Wrong&#x201D;; I have used bitter words. Bitter things have been done, and I can forgive my fellow South Africans when bitter words are used. At the age of some of those young men I used the same language and that is enough to recall to me a sense of tolerance. All that injustice, all that wrong, all that sense of suffering and injury had been wiped out in the great struggle, and in the tradition which our <span class="col_4111-4112" refersTo="page_0716"/>Boer people had built up for themselves. After Vereeniging we started under the Union Jack by compulsion; we had to submit, and a new chapter was opened there, a chapter which remains a great chapter in the history of South Africa for both English and Dutch-speaking South Africans. We have heard a great deal of the Union Jack in this debate and no doubt in the coming days we will hear a great deal more about it. It should be said, and I think the Prime Minister when he speaks in the debate will agree with me, every promise the British authority made under that flag at Vereeniging they have done their best to keep and to carry out. So far as it was possible the British authorities who imposed on us that flag, under that flag did their best in the years that followed to carry out a great act of reparation. They extended a helping hand to us. According to their promise in the treaty of Vereeniging they gave us self-government at the earliest opportunity, an opportunity which to many outsiders seemed crazily premature. We worked together in those days, although there may have been the relation of conqueror and conquered. But they had respect for the work we had done, for the attitude we had taken up and for the tough manhood we had shown. They became our friends instead of continuing as enemies and in the years that followed the Union Jack, and the authority that Jack represented, I may say with perfect truthfulness, became the friend of the Dutch people in South Africa. Let us not be ungrateful. You hear language to-day used in this country which seems to savour of ingratitude. You hear harsh language used about the Union Jack, no doubt coming from a prior history in South Africa. I do say this, that my people would indeed be ungrateful if they did not recognize and openly declare that ever since the treaty of Vereeniging the English authority in this country, so long as it continued the authority in this country, was our friend and did its best in every way to further our liberties, to extend our rights and make friends with us. The Union Jack to-day, whatever its position in the future might be, is our friend and let us show no ingratitude by the language we use in this House or outside it. I think as one of the spokesmen for the Dutch-speaking people of South Africa it is right and proper that I should say this and I am sure the Prime Minister, as the spokesman of another section of the people, will agree with what I have said. Our rights were extended, every opportunity was given us to govern ourselves, freedom was given us in the old republics, and finally the opportunity was given us to unite freely, without any intervention or interference by the British authority, into the Union of South Africa. I have said that there was no interference with us during all that time. When Gen. Botha was Prime Minister and he wanted to end the Chinese question the British authority at once agreed with him and later on when he wanted to end the entrance of Indians into Natal the British authority again agreed with him. In every case they have done their best to agree with us and to further our rights. I remember a memorable occasion when the Prime Minister was in Paris, Mr. Lloyd George, who was then the Prime Minister of England, asked the Prime Minister on what occasion in recent years the British Government had interfered with South Africa or in the exercise by the people and the representatives of the people of their rights, and our Prime Minister on that occasion replied that he had no complaint whatever to make against the British Government, that his complaint was against those of his own race and people with whom he was at issue. These are matters of record and I quote them to show that on a most solemn occasion in the history of this country our present Prime Minister admitted to the British Prime Minister that we had no grievance what ever with the way the British Government had carried out their authority in this country. All that the Union Jack stands for in this country &#x2014;after the Boer war no longer a flag of injustice, a flag of the conqueror, a flag of the superior over the subject race, but always the helping hand, always the friend, anxious to help, anxious to extend liberty, anxious in every way to further our rights. When in 1914 the great war broke out and the Dutch people of South Africa were tested to the uttermost, many doubted us. Even Mr. Merriman, the great Mr. Merriman, in after years admitted to me that he had doubted Gen. Botha and myself. He thought that in the real trial, in the hour of trial and testing, we would not stand firm in the policy which we represented in those years before the great war. The testing came and with the exception of a small minority of our people, who had my sympathy, whom I could understand, whose ideals and objects I could appreciate to the full, with the exception of a small minority of my own people, the vast bulk of the Dutch-speaking people of South Africa stood firm, stood loyal and kept the faith and kept their plighted word. Under that Union Jack our boys went forward in their tens of thousands and there they lie to-day buried on the battle fields of the world. Our own Prime Minister, in one of the proudest moments of his life surely had the privilege of doing honour to their great memory at Delville Wood. That great pact between the races, that great union was sealed with the blood and lives of our young men, and when to-day we discuss great things which are going to have deep and far-reaching bearings on our future it is right and proper that we should turn to the past and see that what we are doing for the future is in harmony and in proper setting with that great past. We occupy to-day a high place. As a result of those sacrifices, of those lives lost in the carrying out of that great racial compact as a result of the work of statesmen, some dead, some still living, we have to-day the declaration, the formal declaration, of the Imperial Conference of our equal nationhood in the empire and in the world. That is a great thing for us, but I say greater still, far greater, in my opinion, <span class="col_4113-4114" refersTo="page_0717"/>is the tradition which English-speaking and Dutch-speaking South Africa built up in those years, the tradition of honour and loyalty and co-operation. The tradition which was built up from the Boer war onwards is a thing for the future of this country as important as and perhaps still more important than the higher status which we occupy to-day. It was all built up on that policy of agreement, and a tradition of agreement, of settling great questions and great national issues affecting the races by consent was built up in this country which I hope we shall never depart from and which certainly we shall never depart from without very grave damage and loss to ourselves. Now we come to the question of our flag, and the Government say that, having attained this higher status, having attained this status of an independent nation, and equal standing in the world, we should have a flag to represent it. I agree, but I say the flag does not only represent our independent nationhood. The flag represents also these great traditions which I have referred to, the tradition which Dutch-speaking South Africa built up in its past, in its glorious past, the tradition of the helping hand which the Union Jack has represented to us in the years when we were down and when it helped us to get on our feet and get our full liberties in the world. I look at this flag to-day, the design which has been proposed to us, and I feel at once&#x2014;speaking, I hope, in no party sense, but knowing that we are dealing with a matter which concerns the years to come&#x2014;I look at this flag and I feel at once that it ignores the Boer tradition in South Africa. We Boers have no lot or part in it. The Minister of Justice said the other night that it is perhaps possible&#x2014;he said so almost jocularly&#x2014;to look upon the blobs of green as representing the Dutch-speaking elements in South Africa. That proposed flag, that compromise flag, arrived at in the way which the Minister of the Interior explained to us the other day, is not a flag in which Dutch-speaking South Africa has part or lot. I feel that deeply.</p>

[Laughter.] I don&#x2019;t think that laugh becomes my hon. friend. I have felt in all those years that if we are to have peace in South Africa, peace which should endure in this country, it should be an equal agreement, which would create conditions in South Africa in which there would no longer be a question of &#x201C;under dog&#x201D; and &#x201C;top dog,&#x201D; but absolute equality. We have fought for that. The Dutch people have every right to consider that in the symbols which represent the honour of our race and our nation for the future they should be represented. And I ask, where do we come in in this flag? It is possible to argue that the English-speaking section are represented in this flag, but I ask you, where does Dutch-speaking South Africa come in, that glorious tradition which we have built up? The Minister of the Interior said the other night that Dutch-speaking South Africa had everywhere taken the lead in the past. What is there in this flag to recognize that? Let us be true to ourselves. I say that this flag, arrived at in this way, does not represent Dutch-speaking South Africa.</p>

<p>It is said that the Vierkleur is a dead flag. The flags of the two old republics shall live as long as the soul of the <span class="col_4115-4116" refersTo="page_0718"/>Dutch people lives in this country. These things do not die. The Prime Minister, the other day, when he entered Pretoria in triumph after his return from London, was preceded by the old Vierkleur of the Transvaal. He did not feel insulted; he did not look upon it as a dead corpse which was being paraded before him. People&#x2019;s deepest affections and homage and veneration are attached to that flag. Do not let us talk of dead things. In a certain sense, of course, you can say those flags are dead, but in a far deeper sense these things can never die; they will live as long as the soul of our people lives. And let me say this; do not let us by mere subterfuges inflict any injustice on the people of this country. I am sure it is not intended, but that is the effect. By devious ways and compromises a certain flag was arrived at, and that flag does not do justice to us, and when I think of my old fellow comrades of the Boer war, when I think of all we passed through, and I think this is what it has come to now in the day when we have a chance to create a flag for South Africa, in a day when the British people in South Africa say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are prepared to take your old republican flag with us; we are prepared to be equalized with you; we ask no superior position for the Union Jack; the conqueror will no longer be the conqueror; the victor no longer the victor, but we shall be equals, we shall enfold our hands together, we shall entwine the symbols of honour and glory which we bring from the past, and that will be our symbol for the future.</block>

If calmly and deliberately we were to consider this question in all its bearings, we would come to see that the proposals before us do not do justice so far as the older section of the people are concerned.

<p>Well, we will hear from the Prime Minister what his attitude now is. Anyway, that is his attitude as announced in this House, as formally published in Government Gazettes, and as notified to the country far and wide, and if there is a change of front it will be welcomed by me. Let us consider this great national issue not in the light of abstract ideas, and of prejudices, but let us look at it on its merits, and see whether it is not possible for us to arrive at a flag which will truly represent the united honour and traditions of our people. Let me now come to the English objection to this flag. I do not pose to speak in a special sense for our English friends, but I do say this, that if they are to be represented on the flag surely it is only fair and proper that they should say how they should be represented. The Government says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No, we shall tell you how you ought to be represented: we shall select a symbol to represent you. You may not like it; you may dislike it; you may violently resist it.

<p>I ask the Prime Minister not to be deflected by side issues, when he is considering a grave national question. He knows that what I am saying is absolutely true and correct. When the English claim1 in South Africa to have the Union Jack on our flag, it is not because they want to lord it over us or express their national superiority over us, or to express our inferior status. They have agreed, and agreed most handsomely, that this is a case of equals. They accept most wholeheartedly the work of the Imperial Conference.</p>

<p>A11 the people who sit behind me. The Prime Minister knows that South Africa, apart from all party considerations, accepts the status as it has been laid down in the Imperial Conference. In these matters I speak for my whole party, and therefore let me say that we have nothing to do with the question of superiority. We have only to do with not hurting people&#x2019;s feelings, with keeping up the traditions of the races which compose our people. Our national flag in South Africa for the future, under which we shall live for centuries to come, should embody the traditions of both races. Let it do so. There is no objection to it, and I think if we do not reckon with the feelings of both sections of our people, English and Dutch-speaking, we are going to have a flag which you may pass by law but it will not be the flag of this country. It will not be loved, it will not hold people&#x2019;s affections, it will not stir their deepest devotion, they will not die for it. They will say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not a symbol that carries our faith and our loyalty.</block>

<p>Do not let us make compromises. I do not think it is necessary. Both sections have their rights. I think we can have a flag which gives its due to both sections. Let us do so. Let us make an honest and unbiassed and unprejudiced attempt to do so, and I think we shall succeed. If once we start on the way of compromise there is danger that the rights of people are whittled away. We get to that state which the Minister of the Interior aptly described as mutilation. You mutilate flags, you lacerate people&#x2019;s feelings, and in the end you alienate all sympathy from the flag which you establish in that way. I think we shall be able to agree. I do not despair. It is a late hour, things have gone very far, but I cannot forget that in other crises in this country&#x2019;s history the people of South Africa somehow have risen to the occasion, and I believe there is too much wisdom and magnanimity among us not to see that we have to reach a non-party solution of this great question, and we have to adopt a flag which will truly carry the sympathy and represent the glorious traditions of both races in this country. I think it is possible for us, by a united effort, even at this late hour, to come to some agreement. But I go further. I say if we cannot, after having shouldered our responsibility and done our best, come to an agreement, then I would say let us pause. I would then recognize that the time is not ripe.</p>

<p>Parliament has every power. It can declare a man a woman, and it can do anything; but Parliament must follow the constitutional way, and, I submit, this is not constitutional. If the referendum applied in this case, is it not going to be applied to other grave national issues? Is it not to be a precedent for the future, a precedent by which a majority of the people will use its brute force against the minority in other matters of grave national difference? There is a great deal to be said against this procedure, and if we can avoid it in any way I would not go in for a referendum, and not adopt this course.</p>

<p>I am afraid this referendum will let loose the dogs of racialism in this country. I do sincerely believe that whatever efforts we may make to keep people&#x2019;s feelings, and the expression of their feelings, within limits, however much we may try to be moderate and restrained, a storm will be set raging over this referendum which will have very far-reaching effects in this country. If the thing is at all possible, let us avoid it. The responsibility is on us; the responsibility is on the Government, in the first instance; and do not let us shirk our responsibility and throw it on the people of this country&#x2014;the poor people who can vote only according to their deepest passions. I think we ought to pause and reflect very deeply and gravely before we embark on the method of procedure which the Government have now started. After all, we have time for further consideration, and one year or more does not matter much in the life of a nation or a young country. The matter is not of such tremendous urgency. It was not urgent enough to be mentioned at the last general election. The Government received a mandate on the economic issue&#x2014;on certain economic questions&#x2014;and they received a big majority of these questions. Do not let them use it to settle entirely new issues on which they would not have received a mandate from the people if the people had been properly informed. Let us pause and explore further. I fear, if this thing is forced through, this country will never forget it. There are people who say to-day&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us finish the business; it will soon be forgotten;</block>

<p>but that is making a grave mistake. There is no doubt that some people have short memories, but there are things which will never be forgotten nor forgiven. In a matter of grave national importance which affects our future, and which springs from the deepest roots of the past, if we are going to force the pace and use the majority given for other purposes in order to achieve an end like this, the deed will never be forgotten and never be forgiven. The Minister of Labour the other night, during the speech of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Col. D. Reitz), interjected and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we withdraw or delay, we will be met with jeers.</block>

<p>I have seen it stated that if the Government were to pause now and not push this Bill through in the way they propose, they would be sneered and jeered at, and insults and taunts would be flung at them for the course they had adopted. I will clear that away at once. They will not have such sneers and taunts and jeers from me. I say that they will be doing a statesmanlike thing, a patriotic thing&#x2014; something which is wise and fair and proper <span class="col_4121-4122" refersTo="page_0721"/>in the interests of this country&#x2014;and they need not fear that there will be any sneers or jeers from me on this matter. I appeal to them not to be influenced by party considerations. These sneers and jeers may be party weapons, but we are not dealing in this grave matter in that spirit. Let us think of our nation first and foremost; let us think of the honour of our nation, and of the unity of the nation which we want to bind together by means of a national flag, and not to tear asunder. I do not wish to go any further, but I wish to move an amendment which I hope will give the Government a chance to reconsider the whole position and to see how far it is possible to explore a better way, if they are so minded, and not force this thing through, but take time for consideration. When they take this step and pause and reconsider the whole position it will be the duty of all of us, and it will be my duty, to give them such assistance as in our power in this very difficult matter. I move, as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>I second the amendment. After hearing such a speech as we have just listened to from the right hon. member, and realizing as we all do the interest he has taken in this great country, and in building it up and helping it through all its troubles, no hon. member who listened to that appeal and who has not been stirred to the depths of his being must be made of wood. The Prime Minister, in interposing, made a remark: &#x201C;Where there is a will there is a way,&#x201D; and I believe there is a will at the bottom of the heart of every man in this House to find a way. That way has not been found yet. I believe the will lies in our hearts to try to come to that agreement, and to meet everybody on that side, and to try to create that flag of which we and our children will be proud. That is what we aim at. The Minister who introduced the Bill spoke in a calm, cold, logical manner. When I listened to his speech, it almost brought me back to the lectures we used to hear in our school room. It was the speech of a man who had never known a flag, never fought for a flag, and never loved a flag. I ask the House, can a man who has not known this passion and who comes in his cold logical way and holds out a flag saying&#x2014;</p>

<p>No flag created in that way will earn the respect or the love of any true South African. The Minister sits there, the father of a young son; in 10 or 15 years&#x2019; time I ask him, when he tries to teach that child the traditions of the country and to show he is descended from the great Dutch blood that forms part of our nation, when he holds that flag up, he may say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is my flag, the flag of my creation, but he will never say&#x2014;</block>

<block name="quote">It is the flag of our people.</block>

<p>He will never be able to show anything in that flag but a flag of a miserable compromise which does not in any way betoken the feelings and traditions of the past. I was born in the Eastern Province. Hon. members opposite say the Union Jack is our flag because it is the flag of the empire. Do they realize that we who were born in the Eastern Province fought under that flag and gained territories under that flag which became not only the emblem of the empire, but of all the British who helped to found this great Union as part of that great empire. Thus it is also our local flag. My father lost everything during one of those native wars, he had his shop burned over his head, and he had to flee. Cannot hon. members opposite realize the strong affection we have for that flag, and that we in the Cape Province demand that it shall form part of our national flag. At the last general election the Prime Minister announced his intention to attempt to solve the native problem, and we on this side of the House have pledged ourselves to assist him. Unfortunately, he has already made one great mistake in passing the colour bar Act, and we protested at the way in which that measure was forced through.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the hon. member should adversely criticize that measure.</p>

<speech by="#payn">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAYN</person>:</from>

<p>Last year the Prime Minister telegraphed to the Transkeian Native Council, in reply to a resolution, that there was no present intention of extending the regulation under the Mines and Regulations Act beyond the point at which they existed prior to the judgment of the court. Should, however, any such extension be thought necessary opportunities would be given to all parties interested in the Union to make representations on the question. That means that that measure has had no effect whatever and cannot be carried out. Seeing that this Bill may take the same course, I ask the Prime Minister to pause and consider whether it is wise in the interests of the mass of the people that it should be forced on the country. I speak as a representative of the natives, and I realize the dangers we have to face and know that feeling is being stirred up amongst the black races which we may not be able to control if this legislation goes through. The natives have the greatest faith in British rule. The Union Jack means almost as much to them as it does to the British section of the nation. In a book printed in 1834, dealing with native affairs, an old chief <span class="col_4123-4124" refersTo="page_0722"/>who had fought against us said to Col. Sir Harry Smith, when they were about to enter into a treaty&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have been kind to us. We asked for mercy and you have given it us. We wish to be British subjects and to live under British laws. I am an old man of few words, and it is good will I desire. There should be one great man above us all&#x2014;the English King.</block>

<p>The pledge was given that they would be treated with justice, fairness and equity, and they have grown to love the Union Jack and to recognize it as a symbol of justice and fairness. Is it right that the great mass of native feeling on this question should be ignored? If the Union Jack is not included in our national flag the natives will feel that the King of England has thrown them over, and that will be a dangerous feeling to create at this stage. We, as a young nation, have received a higher status and we are proud of it, but the Prime Minister should realize that that has not been brought about by himself alone. We who have lost relatives on the other side during the great war realize that they went to fight not for the Union Jack, but for the honour of South Africa. It is because of that that we have risen to higher status. We are proud that the Prime Minister has enabled us to secure that position. Realizing the dangers that lie before us, it is not fair to this young country of ours to risk the trouble that may follow the taking of a referendum. We know the bitterness caused by a general election and that politics is the curse of this country, but a referendum will do more lasting harm than any political fight. That is my conviction, and I wish the Prime Minister would leave the referendum alone. Unfortunately, many of the people will be incapable of coming to a fair solution, and a heavy burden will be placed on ignorant people who will allow their passion and not their reason to influence their votes. We are on the verge of establishing a great nation. Let us do it in a proper way and we shall spoil it if we create a flag which is not a real South African emblem. The Eastern Province is willing to have a flag in which there shall be emblems of the people of this country. It has surprised me above everything to see men who took part in the Boer war, and who held the British army at bay so ready to cast down the flag under which they fought. The Vierkleur is not dead, and I respect it as forming part of the traditions of the young race we are going to build up. I shall never lose my respect for the Vierkleur and I hope no other Englishmen will do so. How can the Prime Minister expect the people of the backveld to control themselves on such a great issue when it was obvious this afternoon that he himself was unable to do so?</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to congratulate the leader of the Opposition in maintaining this debate at a high level, even although we may disagree with some of the things he said. No one could take exception to what he said except on the point of view of honest disagreement with the arguments put forward. In this regard the leader of the Opposition followed the example set by the Minister of the Interior, who made an eloquent and magnificent speech, although people may disagree with the conclusions he arrived at and the reasons for those conclusions. No one in the country could take exception to one single thing said by the Minister of the Interior as being calculated to offend in the slightest degree the susceptibilities or sentiments of any single person in South Africa. My only regret is that it is not possible for all the people in South Africa who are interested in this question to be present and to listen to the whole of this debate. The right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts), in an eloquent speech, rightly said that the British Government has never interfered in South African affairs since responsible Government was granted, and that the Imperial Government has been the friend of this country. There is tangible evidence that there has been, and is to-day, full recognition and appreciation of the attitude of the British Government towards South Africa. The mere fact to-day that we have by common consent, and with the full approval of the united nation, accepted the fact, and will live up to it in the spirit and letter, that South Africa&#x2014;in consequence of the development and consummation at the Imperial Conference&#x2014;will not only become, but will remain, a portion of the British commonwealth of nations, not with the consent of the English, or the English plus half the Dutch, but with the consent of the united Dutch and united English of South Africa, who have accepted the position that this country is part of the British commonwealth of nations, and is prepared to play its part as such. That is the answer to the statement that the British Government has done so much for South Africa. It is in that way this country has shown its appreciation and recognition. The hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) will agree with me when I say that British statesmanship has on many occasions risen far higher than the statesmanship of English politicians in South Africa. British statesmanship has done things which have had far-reaching effect, and in many cases has done them in the face of opposition on the part of Englishmen in this country. I only mention two things because the hon. member for Standerton has mentioned them. Did the British Government interfere on the Chinese question when Gen. Botha went to them and said: &#x201C;We want to get rid of the Chinese from South Africa?&#x201D; Who said: &#x201C;Yes, by all means do what you think right for your country?&#x201D; It was a British statesman overseas, and a section of the British in South Africa opposed it. I will take another question only because the right hon. member himself has raised it, namely, the Indians in Natal. Who was it said to the British Government that we wanted to stop further importation of Indians into Natal? It was not the English section who were ruling Natal, and who brought the Indians here, it was the first Government of which Gen. <span class="col_4125-4126" refersTo="page_0723"/>Botha was Prime Minister and the right hon. member for Standerton was his right-hand man. It was they who got the willing consent of the British Government to stop further importation of Indians into Natal, and it was against the protests of large numbers of English in Natal.</p>

<p>I did not interrupt the hon. member when he spoke; will he let me finish? I only mention that as an indication that as far as those members themselves were concerned they tried to reach an agreement, and had practically reached a provisional agreement, but it was turned down by the people outside whom they represented. Might I refer to the point made by the hon. member for Standerton when he made a final appeal to the Prime Minister to drop this measure, and he referred to the interjection I made in that connection? I was prompted by the fact that the Empire Group last year took up this very point and wrote to the right hon. member for Standerton and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we, the Empire Group, can persuade the Government to drop this Bill, will you, as leader of the Opposition, guarantee not to make political party capital out of it?</block>

<p>I waited with interest and anxiety for the reply of the right hon. member for Standerton and the reply was that he would make no such guarantee, and it was put in such a way that suggested to me he was saying to the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have put yourself into a hole and you cannot expect me to help to pull you out.</block>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The question at issue is not whether we should have a flag or not, but as to the design, and here we have two schools of thought. One school says that the design of the national flag should be one in which the flag of the United Kingdom, in its entirety, shall be included in order to reflect the past history of South Africa and in order that there might be some association in the flag with our British connection. The other school of thought says there shall be a national flag, but it shall contain no reference to the past; it shall signalize our new nationhood and will show that we are out in this country to make a new start. Why we do not accept the principles laid down by the other Dominions is that we lay down the principle of British connection and association in a different way, because in South Africa the history has been very different from that of any other dominion. We say we are quite prepared to fly the flag of the United Kingdom in order to show respect, but because this country is singular and different from the other dominions we ask that we should have a specific flag which contains no reference to the past and which will enable us to make a fresh start, in a united and a contented nation. Three main arguments are brought against that, and I want to deal with them. They have been put forward again this afternoon. The first is that a flag of that kind means, so it is alleged, the pulling down of the Union Jack; the second is that the Government is trying to force this flag on the people against their will; and the third is that it will divide the people on racial lines. I am going to show that not one of those statements is true; I am going to show that not one of those arguments is sound or correct. Let me take the first one, which is that we are pulling down the Union Jack. If we were pulling down the Union Jack, why is it that in the Bill itself the Union Jack is officially recognized as our empire flag?</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The principle is there. It does not matter whether it is flown one flay or 365 days a year. I say this emphatically, that if this Government, or anybody, had intended pulling down the Union Jack there would have been no reference to it in the legislation now before the country. The mere fact that it is provided for, the mere fact that it is compulsory that it shall be flown, that it is recognized officially as the flag to denote our association with the British community of nations shows, at any rate as far as the principle is concerned, that the Union Jack will fly and will fly as one of the official flags of South Africa. Why are there only four days, it is asked? The four days represent all the public holidays except those that are religious holidays, on which flags are usually not flown. That is the first point. [Interruption.] I will promise any member on the other side that I will not interrupt him. The four days on which the Union Jack will be flown are four public holidays which are not religious holidays, but further than that I do not think it is recognized by the people in the country &#x2014;it certainly has not been emphasized on the opposite side of the House&#x2014;that this Bill makes the Union Jack an official flag for 365 days in the year if the Government like to fly it for that length of time. The Bill says that it must be flown on those particular days, and &#x201C;may be flown on any other day that the Governor-General may decide.&#x201D; The Governor-General, of course, is the Government in power.</p>

<p>The right hon. gentleman makes much better speeches standing up than sitting down. I now want to come to the second point, that the Government is forcing this flag on the people against their will, and that it has no right to take advantage of what has been termed a snatch Parliamentary majority to force this flag on the people, and especially as the flag question was not an issue which was before the country at the general election. That is a fair statement of the position. I accept that argument. I say it is unfair on an important question like this, that this Government should take advantage of its majority to force something on the people which the people do not want, especially something which was not put before the people when they elected their representatives to this House. For that very reason I have been one of the strongest supporters of leaving this matter to be decided, not by this House, but by the people outside. May I emphasize this point, this Bill is an enabling Bill. The man in the street, the people outside, are given to understand that we, by a mere parliamentary majority, are going to take advantage of our position as members of Parliament to drive through this House a measure which is going to become law automatically, whether the people like it or whether they don&#x2019;t.</p>

<p>No, it is a question that has got to be decided, but it is a question which is going to be decided by the people outside and not by members in this House. One vote by any man in the country, whether he is in Durban, Johannesburg, or anywhere else, one single vote of theirs at the referendum is a bigger deciding factor and has more power than every vote of every member in this House. One vote of an elector at the referendum has got more power to decide this issue than every one of our votes in this Parliament. I say that by this Bill we are merely putting the Government&#x2019;s policy and the Government&#x2019;s proposal before the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am going to deal with that. This Government has a certain policy. That policy is that we shall have a new flag which shall contain no reference to the past, and, in order that our association with the British empire might be emphasized, we have the Union Jack provided for officially, and the two things are now put in the one clause. This has been found necessary because when they were in separate clauses previously, hardly a single word was said about the provision made for the Union Jack, but everything was concentrated on the national flag, which did not contain the Union Jack. There were thousands of people in South Africa who did not even know that provision was made for the Union Jack being an official flag of South Africa, so now we are putting this in the one clause in this way.</p>

<p>This is the only Bill since Union that does not become law when it is passed by Parliament, but has to go to the country for the people themselves either to ratify or reject. I want to emphasize that point, because some of our constituents who voted for us would not have voted for us on this particular question. I want to emphasize that this Parliament is not doing something against their wish, but that they themselves have more power by their votes than we have got in this House on this particular question. We can only put the proposals before them. We put those recommendations before them because we agree with them in principle, and because we think that in the long run it will not only be in the best interests of South Africa as a whole, but in the best interests of our British connection, and of Britishers in South Africa. I will come to the third point, and that is that we are dividing the people on racial lines. There is no need to contradict that statement when the mere fact of both sides of the House, represented as they are, gives the answer. That side is represented by whom? By the old Unionist party, all English, and the South African party all Dutch, amalgamated. On this side we are represented by English on the cross benches, and the Nationalists, Dutch. I do not think there is any issue, including this flag issue, that is big enough and strong enough to divide the people to-day in South Africa on racial lines. I say that the determination of the people of this country, English and Dutch, to amalgamate, to co-operate in a spirit of goodwill, and to work together in the best interests of South Africa, I say that it is too strong to allow them to be divided on the flag issue or any other issue. I will go further and I will point out that if there has been any attempt made to divide people on racial lines on the flag issue, then it has not been made by members of this side of the House. I will tell you why. Together with many other members here I have been in Union politics 17 years, and have fought six general elections, and in every one, without exception&#x2014;</p>

I cannot remember any election in which an attempt has not been made to divide the people on racial lines, by means of this very flag question. At every one of my opponents&#x2019; meetings, spread all over the hall was the Union Jack. On motor-cars and all over the place was the Union Jack.

<p>I want to deal with this issue as far as I can dispassionately and by argument. The argument I am dealing with is that we are using the flag question to divide people on racial lines. I say the flag question has been used for the last 17 years not by us, but by members opposite to try and divide people on racial lines, but we have risen above it.

[Time limit extended.] They have diverted that meeting, as it were, not so much to protest against the Government&#x2019;s flag policy although that is contained, but they have very cleverly switched in a resolution to ask the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Reyburn) and myself to resign.

<p>Cheap jibes do not [rest of sentence lost in interruptions]. I called a public meeting in July, and it was crowded. I thought that the best thing I could do, as feeling was running high, was to deal with the flag question, and for the first half hour of my speech I did so&#x2014;and I then got a unanimous vote of confidence. Then the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Reyburn) went into his constituency and got five votes of confidence and one vote of no-confidence after holding six meetings. We did not go to the Berea and other parts where we would have got votes of no-confidence because we do not represent Berea and other places. Let me take the recent provincial council election, where the Labour party lost all the seats&#x2014;perhaps that will please hon. members on the other side. I want to deal with it to show that this question has not divided the country on racial lines, but that we can fight these issues and not fight them on racial lines. Labour polled over 40 per cent. of the votes, that is, the same proportion in that election as represented by hon. members in this House. Durban is represented in this House by six members&#x2014;four S.A. party and two Labour, or 60 per cent. S.A.P. and 40 per cent. Labour. It is very easy for anybody to go to Durban which is a S.A. party stronghold&#x2014;thirteen of these seventeen hon. members from Natal are S.A. party and there are four Pact members&#x2014;three Labour members and one Nationalist&#x2014;it is quite easy in Durban to work up a meeting, get a vote of confidence and carry it against the Labour party.</p>

<p>I fought six elections, and on every occasion I was supposed to be going to lose the seat. It is a good thing for the public life of the country that all of us have to go before the bar of public opinion and abide by its decision. That I regard as a wholesome thing; that is a tradition handed down by the British Parliament for many years, and is for the safety and security of the public. As far as I am concerned, I do not hesitate, I will not shirk it, and if they say they disagree with what I have done, they have their remedy, and if they say they agree I shall carry on. There is no reason to do that on this issue, because we have by means of the referendum given the people the opportunity of voting on this one particular issue without complicating it with all sorts of other political questions. We are doing it because there are thousands of people in South Africa who agree with the Government&#x2019;s general policy&#x2014;the development of the country, the native question; the questions that go to make up our political life; and they think the Government have done well, but they might disagree on the flag question. They will have the opportunity of voting on the flag question as a specific case without its being complicated with <span class="col_4133-4134" refersTo="page_0727"/>the other issues.

<p>What I did do at Stellenbosch was to point out the dangerous fruit which might be borne by the irreconcilable and unreasonably uncompromising attitude of the organized opposition to the proposed national flag. I said that if this olive branch be rejected, this Flag Bill, which not only officially recognizes the Union Jack but also accepts the most distinguishing feature of the Union Jack as the most distinguishing feature of our South African flag, it was only natural to fear that moderate Dutch South Africans would be driven into the extremist camp and refuse to have anything to do with the Union Jack or any part thereof. So far was I from saying that I would fight every symbol representing the British race I even went out of my way to say that even if South Africa had been a republic it would be right and equitable to have the British represented on the South African flag by some such symbol as the St. George&#x2019;s Cross.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAM MACINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened for about an hour to the Minister of Labour and nothing he has said has made me reconciled to the Bill; in fact, I am inclined to think worse of it since hearing his explanation. He referred to some outside things such as Chinese and Natal Indians, and he seemed to bring a charge against my hon. leader that he had not been prepared to give an undertaking with regard to any political use that might be made of a withdrawal of the Bill. There are people who have not the right to ask questions of that sort. Here was the place for that question to be asked and my leader has given a full, free and frank answer to it to-day. The Minister also talked about making a new start. What is the new start? I constantly hear speeches from members on the Government benches inferring that all South African patriotism belongs to them, and one could almost imagine that there had been no South African patriots, and no opportunity of showing true South African patriotism, before the advent of the Pact Ministers to power. As a South African that is an attitude I strongly resent, for there is no warrant for it. The Minister at last got to the Bill. He first of all objected to references from this side that the Bill provides for pulling down the Union Jack. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) interjected once or twice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Who is pulling down your flag.</block>

<p>The terms of the Bill are that this flag, No. 2, from the date this Bill becomes law, to be for all purposes the official flag of the Union. If that means anything it means that on the night before the day this Bill comes into effect, from every public building the Union Jack will be hauled down and will not go up again. Surely, that is pulling down the Union Jack? The reason given for saying there will be no hauling down is that for four days in the year the Union Jack is to be &#x201C;officially flown&#x201D; for certain purposes. Let us get to the strict legal <span class="col_4135-4136" refersTo="page_0728"/>way in which that can be carried out. Hon. members opposite and the hon. Minister must not be surprised if after the gyrations he has gone through and the different way they have been squeezed over this matter, suspicions attach as to the way this Bill will be carried out.</p>

Then the hon. Minister gets up and denies that there is any question of pulling down the Union Jack in the country. I hope he will be able to satisfy his constituents. He has not satisfied me. He has talked about the force of the steamroller, but this is the first step, and the other follows. He seems to think he was answering the whole question by saying that after the steps taken here there would be a referendum. Does the Minister expect us and his constituents to forget that when there was no referendum in the Bill he was still prepared, and it was his intention, to vote for the Bill? What becomes of his argument now? He went on to speak about the division of the people, and he claims to speak for the English people. Is he able to face his constituents and claim that be speaks for the English section? The only test so far is the provincial council elections, and in my constituency not one Labour voter in ten will be prepared to back the Minister in the position he has taken up.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">WILLIAM MACINTOSH</person>:</from>

<p>The object of this Bill is to provide for a national flag for all purposes, and we have had some opportunity of hearing what the Minister said a national flag should be. Last year the Minister said that nothing was so powerful to unify all the component parts of a nation as a national flag. Then a flag to be national must be unifying, and must draw the people together, and that is the only basis upon which to secure a national flag, and that is going to be secured by a referendum. The only thing the referendum will show is that there is a division of the people on the question, and the mere fact of having a referendum shows that the flag cannot fulfil the only basis on which such a flag should be selected. I would like to say we cannot any longer, in this world, live to ourselves alone, and the effect of this Bill is not going to be merely local. If one can judge from the effect in other parts of the world, then the only part of the world that takes a brotherly or sisterly interest in us stands aghast at the absolute folly of bringing this issue before the country at the present time. What is the immediate urge for going on with the Bill? It is clearly not the question of our status, because that was settled in 1919. It is not a question having anything to do with the conference of last year, because a similar Bill was introduced before the conference was held. It is not a question of the English versus the Dutch, because we have English and Dutch on this side, but the difference is that we have Dutch who are prepared to respect the feelings of their English fellow-countrymen. It is not a question of republicanism versus non-republicanism, because we have men on this side who did more for republicanism than any man on that side. That is not the urge. I put it down to want of courage on the part of the Prime Minister and his colleagues. They entered into it not knowing what the effect would be. The Prime Minister is not a man who would willingly enter upon a course that would deliberately wound the feelings of his fellow-countrymen. He did it not knowing the extent of the feeling that would be aroused, and my diagnosis is now that he has not the courage to withdraw and take the strong position in this matter. We have heard the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Justice. Is he in love with this flag? I cannot see what the urge is as against the evils that are to be brought about by the introduction of this Bill. The Minister, in introducing it, talked to us about the extremists of his party. If he talks about extremists, then the hon. gentleman looks upon himself as a moderate man. I have never come across any man yet who did not claim to be moderate.</p>

<p>For the benefit of my Caledonian friend over there, the member for Pietermaritzburg (North) (Mr. Strachan) I would quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Oh wad some pow&#x2019;r the giftie gi&#x2019;e us</block>

<block name="quote">To see ourselves as others see us.</block>

<p>From the earliest times there have been fanatics, entirely sincere that they were doing <span class="col_4137-4138" refersTo="page_0729"/>the divine work, but in reality doing the work of the devil. We go back to quite early times, when Saul before he softened into Paul was persecuting; we go to the Spanish Inquisition which had the belief that they were doing the right thing. We had the same with the Scottish Covenanters and the English martyrs, and I have no doubt whatever that the Minister is absolutely certain that he is doing the right thing, but in my judgment he is doing the same sort of devil&#x2019;s work in this Bill that these men did in the full belief that they were doing the right thing. I have tried to get at the other man&#x2019;s point of view, but I do not think it is much use trying to consider the point of view of fanatics. Fortunately for my purpose, at any rate, we have before us the reasoned statement of a man whom I look upon as a real moderate man, a man for whose opinion I have great respect, a Nationalist member of this House, but whose views are not likely to be expressed during this debate, and I would like to read the view of a moderate man and try to put the opposite view of another moderate man. I am claiming the moderation this time. I will not read the whole, but I will read part. If, in doing so, I do injustice to the hon. gentleman, I would like him to understand that it is unintentional. This man analyzed the mental attitude of the two races towards each other, and the feelings of the Dutch section after the Boer war. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whatever may be in the best interests of South Africa, any national development, or self-expression of its people, must be influenced by both English-speaking and Dutch-speaking South Africans, and it is idle to think that one section may dominate over the other.</block>

<p>He quotes what the feeling was after the Boer war, and remarks that there was a saying by Lord Milner&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The back of the Afrikander must be broken.</block>

<p>He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This was felt to be the opinion of most English-speaking South Africans. I think that the resentment shown by other races under the British flag is due to the attitude of the Britisher himself. He is a born ruler, and he has a belief that there is nothing in the world to compare with British institutions.</block>

<p>That is a thing that is apparently not confined only to the Britisher, because I understood the Minister of Justice the other evening to say that there is no institution to compare with the British institutions, and we have carried that out by modelling our parliamentary life and public work on British institutions. The hon. gentleman whom I was quoting continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Union Jack has never been the object of enthusiasm to the Dutch-speaking South African; to many it has been the object of aversion. If the new flag contains the Union Jack, and the Vierkleurs, it will be a continual reminder of conqueror and conquered. I consider the action of my English-speaking friends in regard to the flag is ungenerous and short-sighted. After all, is it such a heinous thing to desire a new flag for South Africa? It will be an inducement to us to consolidate into one nation. Let us have a flag which will be an inspiration to our young people and a common object of respect and love.</block>

<p>There is the reasoned point of view, as I say, of a moderate man. I would like to put the point of view also of a moderate man who takes a somewhat different view. My objection, my only objection to the statement I have quoted, is that it is harking back to the times before 1910. In 1910 we agreed to do away with all those feelings. We might have held them up to 1910, but this is a harking back to the feelings and a going back to what we said we would bury, and we said we would make a new start.</p>

<p>I do not know what you are talking about. Then the position seems to be this. On the one side they have been asked to give up nothing. We are prepared to take any symbol they put forward, and put it on the flag. We ask them to abandon nothing. On our side we are asked to give up something, and I do not know whether they can realize what it means to us. We are asked to say, in the speeches that are made and opinions published, that the Union Jack, which means so much to us, is not worthy to be on a South African flag, and that it should be obliterated. We ask them on that side to give up nothing, while they ask us to give expression to an opinion of that sort about our flag. I would like to put forward what the Union Jack means in the constituency that I come from.</p>

<p>I think I was correct in saying that in my constituency the Union Jack was the sole question. Some mention is made as to feeling being worked up. If the Minister is under the impression that in the part of the country I come from there has been any working up <span class="col_4139-4140" refersTo="page_0730"/>or need of working up, he is absolutely ignorant of the conditions. It was there already, and it found immediate expression, and is still doing so. If he wants to hear about working up let him consult his own colleagues, for instance, the Minister of Railways.</p>

<p>It was there and they could only give expression to what already existed. I would like to refer to the reference made by one hon. member to &#x201C;another milestone.&#x201D; What is meant by another milestone? Do hon. members opposite really think that South African patriotism has only begun since they took office? I claim to be just as sound a patriot as the Minister there. I claim to be just as good a South African patriot, and I believe it to be not a merit but a privilege to be a member of the British empire, and that I am none the worse a South African for that. I would like to put it to the Minister what this Union Jack means to one man I know of in this House. He was brought to this country at the tender age of two. His grandfather fought in the battle of Trafalgar under the Union Jack. On his mother&#x2019;s side his forebears fought at Corunna and at Waterloo. When the Great War broke out his sons fought for South Africa in East and West Africa, in Egypt, Palestine and France, upholding the honour of South Africa under the Union Jack. Is there anything ignoble in the wish of that man that his son&#x2019;s sons, if the time comes that they have to fight for the honour of South Africa, should fight under a flag bearing a tradition like that? I say you have no right to ask people to deprive themselves and their successors of traditions like that, and South Africa would be richer and not poorer for having traditions of that kind. Which has the higher claim to recognition, the position as put forward by the Nationalist member to hark back to the old grievances or that of us who say that we wish to honour our flag, and it has a right to its position, the flag which you gentlemen here want to treat as Bolshevist, something unworthy and to be swept away? If we had to fight again&#x2014;which God forbid&#x2014;which flag would we fight under? I think the Prime Minister ignores the strength of the feeling which exists. It is clear from the very fact of the referendum that the flag cannot unite; it must divide. The referendum cannot unite; it cannot fulfil what was laid down in the speech by the hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. Jansen) when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A flag which shall be an inspiration to young people, a common object of respect and love, a symbol of the true union born out of the troubles of the past.</block>

<p>Under the conditions in which this flag is brought forward and the stage we have come to, it is absolutely impossible that the Government can fulfil the requirements laid down by one of its own members whom we all respect. The Bill can be forced through, but what is the use of a national flag under those conditions? What is the good of a flag of that sort to you? I support very strongly my leader in asking the Government to let it stand over until such time as we can deal with it in the right spirit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I rise as the only representative on this side of the House from Natal who comes from the Dutch race there, and in expressing my sentiments I believe I am expressing the sentiments of a very large number of Dutch-speaking people in Natal. There are people in Natal of my own race, who belong to the Opposition party, who are opposed to this flag being forced through. There are Nationalists in the town where I live who have signed a petition opposing the forcing through of this Flag Bill. I wish to take up the view from the time that we entered into Union. When the question of Union was mooted there was a very strong feeling in Natal against it. I was one of those who favoured Union. I was one of those who assured the English-speaking population in Natal that they could trust us, the Dutch-speaking Africanders in South Africa, that we had proved ourselves to be a race of honour, a race who could be trusted. There was a fear at that time that there would be dominance by Dutch-speaking South Africans. Singularly enough, Dutch-speaking South Africans since the Union took place have had the ruling of this country in their hands. There is no doubt there was a fear amongst English-speaking colonists in Natal that their traditions and sentiments would not be respected. We assured them that we would honour and respect their sentiments, their feelings and their flag. A referendum was taken, and upon that assurance, by a large majority the referendum was in favour of entering into Union. Natal placed her destiny and her traditions in our hands, and expects us to-day to fulfil the promise made at the time of Union. I, for one, will not retract the promise and assurances I gave. I feel if I broke that promise I would be doing a wrong thing, and it would be a dishonour to my own race. While I am on this subject I wish to refer to what Dutch-speaking members in the Natal Parliament said&#x2014;the hon. members for Vryheid, Utrecht and one from my own town who bore my own name. I refer to the speech made by the hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. Fergg), who was an old republican servant. There was a very deep seated fear on the part of the Natal people at the time Union was taking place, and the hon. member said on the debate of the Draft South Africa Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A good deal of criticism has been uttered by the hon. member, who expressed distrust of the Dutch. I do not think there should exist at the present moment any distinction between English and Dutch. We are all British, and the Union Jack is flying over us, the flag we can all trust. As Mr. Nel <span class="col_4141-4142" refersTo="page_0731"/>says, the future will show that the Dutch will not betray the trust reposed in them.</block>

<p>I refer to another speech made in the Natal Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Dutch section feels very grateful indeed that we have been honoured by being trusted by His Majesty the King and the whole of the British nation. I know the Dutch, and can assure this honourable House that the Dutch have always shown they are worthy of the trust placed in them.</block>

<p>The hon. member made reference to a statement that the Dutch might want to get rid of the Union Jack, and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I know the Dutch and I can assure this hon. House that the Dutch will always show that they are worthy of the trust placed in them &#x2026;. I think it was a Dutchman who told the hon. member for Durban County that the Dutch had decided, cost what it may, to get rid of the Union Jack. If it were not unparliamentary language I would call that man a liar. I do not know who he is, and I declare most emphatically that I have not heard from one Dutchman that he wants to get rid of the Union Jack. They know perfectly well that, having lost their independence, there is nothing better that can protect them from outsiders than the Union Jack &#x2026; They will stick to their principles and stick to this protecting flag for ever.</block>

<p>I also refer to the speech made by the hon. member for Utrecht (Dr. Niemeyer), who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As one of the few Dutch Afrikanders of this House, I can assure you as one who has accepted British citizenship&#x2014;the hon. member for Melmoth has raked up the question of racialism&#x2014;there is not going to be any question of Dutch domination. We are all Britishers alike now. We have all accepted the British flag, and the majority&#x2014;we have a few extremists, too, but the majority of us wish to form one nation with you, to the glory of the British empire.</block>

<p>It was upon these assurances given by members of my race that the Natal people went into Union. We gave them the assurance that we would always respect their sentiment, traditions and flag, and on that assurance by a large majority in the referendum they went into Union. At the time of Union the slogan for the great question put before the Union and Natal, the golden threads on which Union was to be founded were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hope, trust and confidence.</block>

<p>When these assurances were given in Natal English-speaking members of Parliament reciprocated, and said they would trust and honour our traditions and sentiments. It was in that spirit of goodwill that we entered upon Union. We felt that divided we would be weak, but united we could build up a strong South African nation, which would be respected in the whole world, and that we could confidently meet the great problems which this great country would have to face. It is manifest that right throughout the country, particularly in Natal, those people to whom we gave this promise at the time we entered into Union feel we are breaking that promise, and for that reason I feel in honour bound, in respect of that pledge and assurance, to say that we are doing an injustice and a wrong not only to ourselves, but to South Africa. It is evident, if this Bill goes on, that instead of having a united people we are going to create disunion and to open up all those sores. It is going to create racialism as we have never had it before. I have spoken to many English-speaking people on this subject, and they tell me that racial feelings are to-day stronger than in the 1914 trouble.</p>

<p>One cannot say the Sons of England are entirely responsible, and they are only carrying out what we promised them when we came into Union. They have been forced and provoked into the position they are in. If this Bill is continued we shall cause more feeling and heart-burning than anything that has happened since the time of Union; since the time, shall I say, of the last Boer war. I am not opposed to a national flag representing our status and our independence within the British commonwealth of nations; but I certainly do oppose the forcing of a flag on the country when the people are not united upon it. What is the good of such a flag? What would be the use of a referendum, because whichever way it goes, the people will be torn asunder?</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>It is no use trying to force a flag on the people, for if we do we shall undo all the good work done since Union. As to Natal, there is a tremendous movement among the English-speaking people to be united with us. 95 per cent. of the scholars attending Government schools are voluntarily learning Afrikaans. Does that not show an improved spirit? At all events let us have a flag which is a symbol of the traditions and sentiments of the people; a flag we can all respect and honour and, if necessary, a flag we will all be prepared to lay down our lives for. What is the use of a flag which we cannot respect and honour? The Pact has lost a great opportunity of bringing forward a flag which will show that we are a united people, and which would connote the feeling, history and traditions of the people. That would have been a magnificent way in which to cement the true union of the people. I thought the time had come when South Africans could bury the hatchet, and could live happily together respecting and honouring one another. The English-speaking South African has realized that the Dutch-speaking South African is as good as he is. Young Dutch South Africans returning from the world&#x2019;s universities are taking their place in the cultured classes of the country. The reason the Government gives for refusing a flag which would connote the history, traditions and sentiments of the two peoples, is that it would represent <span class="col_4143-4144" refersTo="page_0732"/>the flags of the conqueror and the conquered. I thought the question of conqueror and conquered was a question of the past. There was no such question at the time of Union. Then hon. members opposite assert that the Vierkleur is dead. Well, I recently visited the Utrecht district and I saw the Vierkleur drawn across the dining rooms of two houses I visited. In my own town the Nationalists, four years ago, dedicated the Vierkleur and handed it over to the Dutch Reformed Church minister for safe keeping, and for resurrection when the time came. Does that show that the Vierkleur is dead? If it were possible to join the Vierkleur and the Union Jack together it would help us in the work of building up a great South African nation. I am young enough and optimistic enough to believe that the time will come when our boundaries will extend far beyond where they do to-day, and when we shall have in the southern part of this vast continent a great confederation of States. Will that be possible under a flag such as the Government is trying to force upon us? Alas, this Bill deliberately prevents any opportunity of extension in the direction I have indicated. If the combined flag is not acceptable, let us postpone the Bill to a time when the younger generation will be able to come to an agreement. The young people in the schools are learning to know and to understand each other, and to appreciate one another&#x2019;s sentiments, feelings and ideals. They will be far better able to solve this question than we are; for one thing, we of the present generation are too near to the great events of recent history. Many men still alive have fought under either the Vierkleur or the Union Jack. I would now like to say a few words to the hon. members on the Labour benches. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) (Mr. Strachan) has been asked a question by a newspaper on which he worked for many years. I will ask him the same question. It is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is the price that was paid for your support of the flag?</block>

<p>When last year&#x2019;s Bill was introduced he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to assure the Government that not a single Labour member will be returned from Natal at the next election if the Flag Bill is persisted in.</block>

<p>He knows what the feelings of the majority of his constituents are, he knows they are against it, yet notwithstanding that he is today supporting the Bill. I want to know what price he has paid for supporting this Bill. He will have an opportunity of answering this question in this House and I do not know whether he would give the same answer which he gave according to Mr. Archie Jamieson who, until a few months ago, was the national secretary of the Labour party. Mr. Jamieson has published a letter stating exactly what the position is, and he says of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) (Mr. Strachan)&#x2014;</p>

<p>I would also like to ask the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) whether he still agrees with the admission he made last year that not a single Pact member would be returned for Natal if this Bill were proceeded with. I would like to ask him another question whether the statement of the national secretary of the Labour party is correct when it imputes to him that he said the Labour party had been sold for two plates of Cabinet pudding. I would also like to refer to a statement made by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (North) last year, reported on the 20th May. 1926, when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would rather have no Union flag at all than a symbol of our nationhood likely to arouse bitter controversy.</block>

<p>I ask him if he adheres to that statement, and whether he considers the Flag Bill now proceeded with will not arouse bitter controversy, and if so, whether he still supports the Bill? The Minister of Labour also made a statement <span class="col_4145-4146" refersTo="page_0733"/>last year, and in an interview, with a pressman, which was published, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am sure it is not the intention of the Government to force on the country a South African flag that does not command mutual respect and goodwill of both the British and Dutch sections of the community.</block>

<p>The Minister says we have made it impossible.

The only time I have spoken was when I was forced to do so at a political meeting on one of the coal mines in my constituency. I was forced to speak upon it, because I was told I would not get a hearing unless I told the meeting what I proposed to do with their flag. To me, it has been a distasteful subject, feeling as I do that it is going to cause racialism, disunion, and will break down the whole of the good work done since Union. This Bill is going to tear this country in half. If ever there was a country asking for peace, it is this country, peace to build up the nation, peace to build up our industries and our agriculture, peace that we may gradually weld ourselves into a united race. Without peace, we can never become a strong and united country. Can we make a country of this unless we have the united friendship and efforts of our English-speaking Afrikanders? I say we can never build up a strong and united people unless we have the necessary goodwill and assistance from the English-speaking South Africans. I see the hon. the Minister of the Interior smiles at me. I do not know whether he agrees with this statement. This Bill will certainly break all that hope, trust and confidence upon which the Union was founded.</p>

<block name="quote">The Labour party, too, was in a great difficulty, that between respect for the ideals of their leader and the known and intense respect of their rank and file for the British connection. Due to the vivid imagination of Mr. Arthur Barlow, that body of keen intellectuals, the National Council of the Labour party, found a better way. The agreement which they ultimately hammered out is something more than a solution of the flag difficulty. They have seized an opportunity to re-state exactly where they are with regard to Great Britain. They have expressed on behalf of their supporters throughout South Africa that &#x201C;they believe the Union of South Africa can best work out its destiny as a member of the British commonwealth of nations.&#x201D; This expression is definite enough for anybody, and they have so convinced the reasonable leaders of the National party that this important proviso will now be acceptable to them.</block>

<p>Will he tell the House what that price was that he mentioned last year? Will he tell this House and the country what the price was that the Labour party were prepared to pay? I think that that price which the hon. member referred to was partially paid at the last provincial council elections in Natal, and the balance paid at the next general elections. I wish to join in the appeal to my fellow Afrikanders on the other side. I would like to say this&#x2014;that when we entered into Union the English people promised us that they would honour and respect our traditions, our sentiments. That promise was made in the Natal Parliament at the time when Union was considered. You can read the speeches in the Natal Hansard where they have made that promise. To-day they are prepared to fulfil that promise. They are prepared to do honour to the Vierkleur by allowing that flag to be placed on an equal footing, on an equal basis with the flag to which they are attached. I also appeal to my fellow Afrikanders opposite that, if they feel they cannot accept that proposal, they should allow this matter to stand over. I honestly believe that the time is not far off when both Dutch and English South Africans will be able to come to a mutual agreement, when we can have a flag which will signalize the union of both sections of the people. If only we have patience, the time will come with this better understanding which is daily growing, which is daily becoming a part of the life of the people of this country; when that understanding is complete, I do honestly believe that a flag could de devised in this country which would be acceptable to all, which would be a symbol of our unity and which would be respected and honoured by all of us. I am sorry I do not see the Minister of Labour here, but I have no hesitation in saying that the flag which he supports is the red flag. On the 13th November, 1918, he wrote a letter to the &#x201C;Natal Mercury&#x201D; on that most momentous day, the day of peace. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The healthiest sign in the whole situation is the hoisting of the red flag in Austria, in Bulgaria, on the German warships, in Hamburg and in other places. It is the symbol of socialism and democracy. Only under its principles can &#x201C;the world be made safe for democracy.&#x201D; In the transition stages excesses may have been committed under its folds, but they are as specks of dust compared to the excesses which have been committed away from its folds. Through it all it stands, if it can only get the chance, for &#x201C;Peace on earth and goodwill towards men.&#x201D; [Time limit.]</block>

<from>&#x2020;The Rev. Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RIDER</person>:</from>

<p>The first words I speak are meant to be a plea for moderation in discussing this most important matter. The moderation I plead for I desire to show in my bearing and the expression of my thoughts. This is one of the crises in the history of this country, and I want to bear that in mind for myself, and I appeal to the House to bear it in mind as we proceed with this debate. There is need of moderation in speech however intense thought may be. What appeals to me as a contradictory state of things is this, that a matter like this should be going on while the troubled state of the rural population in such districts as Aberdeen, Willowmore, parts of Oudtshoorn and Jansenville cries aloud for the sympathy of Parliament and the active help of the Government.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The Rev. Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RIDER</person>:</from>

<p>I am almost ashamed to quote it, but there is an ancient saying about Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. What will the country, when it comes to analyse and summarize the debates of this House, have to say about us if we devote undue time to this matter, which can be safely relegated to the future, while we neglect our starving people at our own doors? I regard the whole controversy as unnecessary, and I ask who began it. We have lately heard of oppression in this land under the Union Jack. A certain phrase that by this time ought to be regarded as useless has been quoted again and again, the phrase &#x201C;a century of wrong.&#x201D; The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) has met that and dealt with it, and those on this side of the House who fought against Britain in defence of what they believed to be their duty have borne their willing testimony to the magnanimity of the old country. I am proud to claim it as my mother country, which after a splendid struggle won in the field did its splendid duty to those who had fought so gallantly. Oppression&#x2014;that belongs not to the Union Jack! That flag is the guarantee of free institutions wherever it floats. Let us have done with cant and cease to talk about a century of wrong and the oppression that has gone on in this country under the Union Jack, for the statement is not truth but exaggeration. Better far to forget these contentious things and things allied with them, or if they must be remembered let them be remembered in silence. Yes, I commend it to those on the other side who have talked so freely about the wrongs they have suffered, the grief they have endured and their terrible oppression <span class="col_4149-4150" refersTo="page_0735"/>under the Union Jack. Where would these men be to-day had Great Britain not done the generous thing? We know the old sinister maxim about if you want to make a man your enemy show kindness to him, and I am afraid there is some truth in it. I desire to correct a mistake that to my mind is very prevalent in this country and in this House, that British people of set habit like to hoist flags every day. I could take my friends opposite to some of the chief centres of population where there are buildings with five or six flagstaffs, but it is only on one or two days that they are used. It may come as news to hon. members over there, but we consider it bad form to talk a great deal about flags. We do not talk about the flag, but we come to definite action when the flag is attacked. I can stand a great deal of clamour and you will tire before I will. If you have difficulty in hearing I will pull out another stop or two. You have to listen. Now we are told that by the gracious permission of the Government and the Minister of the Interior the Union Jack may fly for four definite days of the year. We will never fly that flag by permission. We shall never appeal to the Minister of the Interior for his sanction. That flag that has braved many breezes can endure any storms that beat upon it from the mouth of the Minister. That flag stands for something and we stand by the flag. It is history, and we shall never tolerate that such a flag should be slighted. We do say this, that in this country under the somewhat strange conditions of life in this country we are prepared for the adoption and the use of a national flag that shall show the colours of the British side and the Dutch side of thought and speech and conduct. We have not deviated from that. I have known the Minister of the Interior for a good many years. I am sure he will take from me this fact, which I certify to be a fact, that we have for at least a year past agreed in our party that the true national flag of South Africa should enshrine the Union Jack and the colours of the two late republics, too. Yet I have heard the Minister say on Monday that we have no national flag such as the other dominions have and that it is time we had one, and he expressed the utmost surprise when he was assured that we had had a flag for seventeen years past. There is no ignorance like intentional ignorance. We have a flag, and if that flag is not enough we are prepared on this side to adopt and honour and keep flying a flag that should embody the Union Jack and the Colours of the two republics, too. Concerning the attempt that is being made&#x2014;and if I am to be guided by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s interjection that will still be made&#x2014;to enforce the will of the Government, I want to say on behalf of certain associations of men and women in this country, respectable citizens, law-abiding citizens, people who do not go to gaol and therefore do not require the clemency of the Minister of Justice, people who know the law and keep the law and live honourably with all men and who are banded together in certain patriotic associations, I say on behalf of societies like these&#x2014;the Caledonian Society, the Cambrian Society, the B.E.S.L. and the much-maligned Sons of England&#x2014;I have not been near a Sons of England meeting for 20 years, but I honour their principles; they stand for the right as they see it, and their judgment cannot be swept aside as a sort of froth bubble &#x2014;these law-abiding people are firm in their allegiance to the flag they love so well. I want to read certain resolutions which were passed at a great meeting, and I would like to say I know as little of the organization of that meeting as any member opposite. I was so determined to keep apart from that meeting that although member for the city where it was held I did not even send a telegram on the eve of the meeting. I want to say that on Saturday came a telegram from the Mayor of East London, known in ordinary life as Mr. James Stewart. He is not unknown in this House. He telegraphs me in these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At a very large and representative meeting of citizens of East London held in the city hall last evening the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:</block>

<ol>

<li>1. That this public meeting of citizens of East London considers the proceedings of the recent flag conference at Cape Town and resolves that the proposed new Union flag known as Design No. 2 is unacceptable and will not satisfy South African sentiment and is not emblematic of the division of the races and is not characteristic of anything suggesting a common bond between such races for the future, nor does it identify the Union of South Africa with the British commonwealth of nations.</li>

<li>2. That the Prime Minister and his Government be earnestly and respectfully urged to abandon any proposal for any new Union flag, the design of which does not include the Union Jack as an integral part of it.</li>

<li>3. That any attempt to pass the Flag Bill without general consent be strenuously resisted by every constitutional means.</li>

<li>4. That the three resolutions previously carried be sent to the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior, the Leader of the Opposition and the local member of Parliament.</li>

</ol>

<p>I thought it my duty to quote what Mr. James Stewart has to say in connection with the meeting at which he spoke enthusiastically for the retention of our flag. Then I have a short letter I wish to communicate written on Monday, 16th May, by the secretary of the Women&#x2019;s South African Party at East London. You cannot mock at women, you are using them in advocacy and furtherance of the Government&#x2019;s flag proposals&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On Monday, the 16th, my branch held its annual general meeting, and the following resolution was carried with great acclamation: That this branch of the Women&#x2019;s South African party will accept no flag for South Africa which does not contain the Union Jack.</block>

<p><span class="col_4151-4152" refersTo="page_0736"/>I pass that on for the information, and possibly some influence on the feeling of, this House. These resolutions I have read are merely symptomatic of the way passionate feeling has been urging and surging over the people of this country. It may possibly be disastrous to proceed in the face of difficulty like this.</p>

<p>In ways that will commend themselves to the hon. member&#x2019;s intelligence if he will think them over. A national flag has not, as yet, been generally demanded, and what is going on now clearly indicates that the way of peace and of safety must not depend on this determination of forcing on an unwelcome people what they do not want. I want to say that after a long life in this country, donning now for a few moments the mantle of a prophet, if these proposals become law, and if by the force of the majority they are forced on us, this thing will be true&#x2014;that there are scores of thousands of people, for whom I dare to speak, who will say that we will not buy and fly that flag; we will not reverence it; on the contrary, we will hold it in no respect, and on the first possible occasion we will reject it.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) this afternoon stressed the necessity that we should endeavour to find a way out of our difficulties by a spirit of give and take. Well, on a previous occasion the right hon. gentleman referred to the excitement in the country about the proposals of the Government contained in the Bill before the House. Let me tell him that if we are unable to find a way out of our troubles he shall also not escape his responsibility, and he will have to share that responsibility with the Government. A lot has been said in this debate, which has really nothing to do with the real point at issue, but I think one thing is clear: when all these&#x2019; discussions are stripped of their overburdens and all the padding has been removed, one thing will stand out clear, and that is the uncompromising attitude the Opposition have adopted from the very start, when the Government earnestly endeavoured to produce something, and to produce proposals which we hoped would be acceptable to the country; and the demand from the other side of unconditional surrender. Let us go back and find what the position was in this country when, two years ago, the Government first brought forward the proposal that it was in the interests of the country and of the future co-operation of both white races, that we should have a national flag for this country. The right hon. gentleman, I take it, speaking for his party, agreed with us that the time had come when we should endeavour to secure such a flag for this country. He agreed with us that we should try to find a non-party solution. Well, a conference was called, the matter was discussed, but unfortunately we were unable to agree. The Government, as in duty bound, having undertaken the work, selected one of the designs that were brought forward, and what was the attitude which the Opposition then adopted&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, this is a disguised Vierkleur, and it is just going to make the same appeal which the republican flags made to the people of the former republics, and it means secession.</block>

During this debate certain hon. members, in spite of what the right hon. the leader of the Opposition has said&#x2014;that we are all agreed on the necessity for a national flag&#x2014;some of his own members have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where does this new-found enthusiasm come from for a flag; we never heard anything about it in the election, and this should stand over.</block>

<p>Let me remind hon. members that this question has been raised in past years not only by our side and our party, but by the party opposite, and by no Jess a person than the right hon. the leader of the Opposition. He also, on a previous occasion, stressed the necessity for a national flag for South Africa, and what is more, a flag which did not contain the Union Jack. To-day we hear that no settlement is possible unless Dutch-speaking South Africa is prepared to accept a flag which shall contain the Union Jack in toto; and yet there was a time when the right hon. gentleman knew, as well as we do, that it would be equally impossible to get Dutch-speaking South Africa, with the history they have behind them, to accept such a design. We are told about the intense feeling of the Opposition in regard to this question of the inclusion of the Union Jack, but do not hon. members opposite realize the equally intense feeling on our side that no settlement is possible if you insist that there should be a Union Jack in our national flag? There was a time when the right hon. gentleman better interpreted the feelings of Dutch-speaking South Africa than he does to-day.</p>

In 1919 the right hon. gentleman appreciated the feelings of Dutch-speaking South Africans in regard to this matter. In 1920 he repeated practically the same thing, and in reply to a direct question at Paulpietersburg he said that he was working for a South African flag, and when asked if he meant a flag with the Union Jack, he replied&#x2014;</p>

<p>The right hon. gentleman admitted that he used these words at Ventersdorp. We have to wo with hard facts in this country, and we know that this is the position as far as the majority of the Dutch-speaking people in the old republics <span class="col_4155-4156" refersTo="page_0738"/>are concerned. They will never accept that solution which the Opposition is asking us to accept. The question was put forward that in the Bill the design which the Government has chosen wounded the sentiment of English-speaking people in this country. I say there is absolutely no justification for that statement, when we have selected as one of the emblems the cross of St. George, which was the original flag of England. We have thus given full and adequate expression to British sentiment in this country. But the right hon. gentleman was correct this afternoon when he said that we differed on fundamentals. Yes, we do. The real reason for this uncompromising demand is because to hon. gentlemen opposite the Union Jack always has had, and to-day has, a political and constitutional significance in this country. The right hon. gentleman may tell us that he and some people accept the constitutional position as fixed at the Imperial Conference, but we cannot get away from the fact that that is not the case with the majority of his followers in this country. The hon. the member for Zululand (Mr. Nicholls) told us that the whole demand was unconstitutional, and we are told that by flag committees. What right, they say, have we to exclude the Union Jack? We have heard to-night that English-speaking people would never ask permission to fly that flag.</p>

We have heard the hon. member for Dundee (Sir Thomas Watt) tell us that they demanded the inclusion of the Union Jack as a right. What would he say if we made that demand that we should also include our own emblem? And if that emblem were not acceptable to the English-speaking people, what would they say?</p>

<p>I can only tell him that it has been suggested that if that is to be a solution, if we are to have the Union Jack included because our British fellow-citizens want it, and if we had to choose our own emblem, why should we not choose something which is very dear to us? For instance, the national monument at Bloemfontein, which symbolises the heroism and self-sacrifice of our women, which was applauded by the late Gen. Botha when that monument was unveiled? We, however, would not make that suggestion, because it would arouse bitter controversy and hurt our British fellow-subjects. We shall not demand the inclusion of that. Unfortunately, you cannot settle this matter on the principle of inclusion. I have no bitter feelings against the British, but what I do resent is what I see has been happening here lately, this absolute refusal to appreciate our feelings in this matter, and the demand to include something which is going to hurt us. The reason for this opposition is not because we, in selecting our design, are not recognizing British traditions and sentiments, but because hon. members opposite will insist on the inclusion of the Union Jack, because they think that if that symbol does not appear they will no longer occupy a dominant position in the country. It is for that reason that if we should now withdraw this Bill it would be treason to South Africa. It is clear to me that from the opposition which we have seen in the country, there are thousands who are not accepting this constitutional position that we are equal parties and have the right to select our own flag. Listening to the arguments one would think that the Union Jack was going to disappear from South Africa. So far, very little has been said on the other side as to the provision in the Bill that the Union Jack shall be flown on certain specified occasions to symbolize what it actually stands for in this country. We have heard very little about that. Hon. members don&#x2019;t realize that, for the very first time in the history of the country, you are getting the Dutch-speaking people to accept the Union Jack. The Union Jack has flown here all these years by right of conquest, and here for the first time we make a free choice and for the first time by solemn Act of Parliament we say we shall accept it and shall fly it to symbolize a certain political purpose.</p>

<p>Do you want to suggest that in 1910 we had a free choice in regard to the flag? No, I don&#x2019;t think so. This is the first time an attempt has been made to find a solution of this question. All we ask our English-speaking fellow South Africans is that we should have something which does not contain anything which would hurt any one section in this country. The Union Jack is not disappearing from this country It is not our flag, but it is the flag of Great Britain, and we accept it as the emblem of our British connection. I am supporting these proposals because I am convinced there is nothing unfair to our English-speaking fellow-subjects in these proposals. It is stated that the right hon. gentleman has the support of a certain section of the Dutch-speaking people. We claim we are supported by a large proportion of English-speaking Labour and English-speaking South Africans who ordinarily support the right hon. gentleman in politics. This need not be a question of race. South Africans of both races are wanting a flag that will not remind us of the unhappy past in this country. The position of Ireland has been quoted. When I met those delegates representing that Dominion at the Imperial Conference there was a spirit of goodwill and co-operation increasing every day and that would not have been the case if the Irish desire for an Irish national flag had been thwarted. In any case, the Dutch-speaking South Africans cannot decide this question. At the referendum the proposals will be rejected unless there is a sufficiently large number of English-speaking South Africans whose sentiments are sufficiently deeply rooted in this country as to appreciate our desire for a national flag in this country. It has been said that the Bill will be forced through. The people will decide, and I am so convinced of the justice of these proposals that I look forward confidently to the appeal that will be made to the people of the country.</p>

There were many of us who looked on the Minister of Finance as a man of decided views, but a man who would not go out of his way to say things derogatory to those sitting on this side of the House and to one section of the people. It is impossible to deny that the speech contains much evidence of provocation and bitterness and reluctance to allow the English-speaking people of this country and the Dutch-speaking members who support this side of the House the right to make their voices heard and take their share in the decision as to what shall be the flag of this country. The Minister has told us he is a British subject merely by compulsion, and that he would cheerfully welcome anything that had no sign of the English upon it.</p>

<p>I defy anybody to say that it is not the effect of what he said, although I do not quote his exact words. Is it logical of the Minister to say it is our uncompromising attitude that has made the solution of this question difficult? There are strong opinions, but I deny that there has been an uncompromising attitude on this side of the House. When there are opinions which any body of men and part of any section of the community considered to be an essential, opinions which they cannot draw back from, surely it is straining the meaning of words when they say the thing is essential, they are, therefore, uncompromising and provocative. I speak for those who are born Englishmen, who have made their homes in this country, and I might add that if we had been uncompromising, as the Minister suggested, we should have declined the inclusion of anything in the flag of the Union but the Union Jack, or the flag, which my hon. friend behind me, showed yesterday. We have suggested in good faith that the future flag of the Union should combine the Union Jack and the old flag of the republics. We have suggested that, and hon. members opposite have turned down the suggestion. Why did they turn that down? We know perfectly well those flags are not dead. In any sort of gathering in the northern province of the Union, especially when prominent members of the Government are there, those flags are flown. If they were dead that would note be the position. We are drawn irresistibly to the conclusion that the reason a great many members opposite refuse to have the old flag of the republics is that they do not wish to give us an excuse to say that they want a flag of the past to represent them. We know that is the real reason. It ill becomes the Minister when he puts forward an argument such as that&#x2014;that we are the people who are uncompromising and provocative. I regret that members look at the matter from that point of view. We have welcomed the suggestion all along that there should be a flag, and we have made it a sine qua non that the Union Jack should be part of that flag, but if the Dutch-speaking members can agree on any other device for the rest of the flag that would be a worthy substitute, then I think no one on this side of the House would take exception to such a design, and I can think of none better than the old republican flags. If we had been inclined to be provocative and suspicious, then we have had no small measure of provocation since tile hon. members came into office. For the first two years after the hon. members came into office we had speeches by the Minister of Justice, amongst others, the plain English of which was, if we English do not behave ourselves, we shall find ourselves driven into the sea.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DRUMMOND CHAPLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I can only say &#x201C;other things being equal&#x201D; have not been looked after in that respect. It is idle to deny this time last year, before the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance went to London, we were very uneasy as to what he meant on the constitutional question. We pressed him here to say what he did mean, and found it difficult to get an answer. They came back and made what were admitted to be perfectly satisfactory speeches, and we thought this question was at an end. The flag question was hung up last year and surely the Prime Minister is not going to allow the peaceful atmosphere created when he went to London and the speeches when he came back to be vitiated by a question that is convulsing the whole of the Union. We may be accused of being thin-skinned, but to the English people this proposal of the Government which they are trying to force through is nothing less than provocation and a deliberate affront. I do not wish to dwell upon the hindrance that it is going to cause to the fusion of the two races, but it is going to breed an atmosphere of suspicion that is going to last for years to come, and I am bound to say such misgivings as I have, have not been diminished by what has fallen from the Minister of the Interior with regard to the nationality clauses of the Bill. I am willing to admit, from the constitutional point of view, to take these clauses as they stand, there is not much objection, but there is this objection, as the Minister admitted, it is going to be made more difficult for people coming from England to be citizens of this country. The Minister of Finance says he is satisfied to be a South African subject, and does not want to be a British subject. When you get a statement like that, coupled with the admission of the Minister of the Interior, can it be wondered at that we are nervous of what they will do in the future, if they get the power, to alter the nationality clauses. Apart from that, look at the material damage that is going to be done. I can understand the attitude of members opposite if they were satisfied to be a small, self-contained, unventurous and unprogressive community. Are we that? Why should we desire to cut ourselves adrift from all the rest of British South Africa? In the ordinary course the Union will look forward to the hegemony of all these great territories, possibly future nations under the British flag right up to Kenya. Who is going to pay attention to us in future if we adopt this flag? They are going to look upon us as a foreign community which they are going to keep at arm&#x2019;s length as far as they possibly can. I do not believe that that is the wish of the Dutch people who compose the Nationalist party. If that were the attitude the next thing, I suppose, we will hear is that the mandated territory of South-West Africa is to be handed back to the Germans or anybody else who likes to take it. I do not think that they can realize what their action will mean. There is a further point. The Minister of Finance said he is quite satisfied to be a South African subject, and that that gives him all he wants. After all, who is going to defend the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s house and home, who is going to look after him if a foreign nation chooses to descend upon these shores? The Minister of the Interior, I think, saw that the whole thing was absurd, because he admitted that the Union Jack stood for the constitutional evolution of defence. I do not know what exactly he means by the constitutional evolution of defence, but what I do know is the only defence that this country has got to-day consists of the British navy and the strength of the British empire. The Minister of Finance said that he does not care for that&#x2014;he is content to be a South African and not be a British subject. He says he can look after himself. I only hope the day will not come when he will need to defend himself. I think there is another point which has hardly been sufficiently dwelt upon, and that is that this action of the Government is after all, a breach of faith with South Africa. The right hon. gentleman (Gen. Smuts) this afternoon alluded in very eloquent terms to what took place some 25 years ago at Vereeniging. Does anybody think that 25 years ago when those discussions were taking place at Vereeniging, the agreement that was then made, the agreement which has been loyally observed, would ever have been entered into if the right hon. gentleman and his friends had got up and had said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As soon as we get a little stronger, as soon as we feel we can do it, we are going to pull down the Union Jack and make it, in effect, an offence to fly it.</block>

<p>It is quite certain that the treaty that was then made would not have been made on that basis. There is another breach of faith involved. I consider, and that is what took place in 1910 at Union. Does any reasonable person think that Union would ever have been effected if the people who represented the Dutch-speaking section on that occasion had said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As soon as we get the Union constituted, we are going to pull down the Union Jack.</block>

<p>After all, that is what it amounts to. Does any reasonable person think that union could have come about? I am not talking only of <span class="col_4161-4162" refersTo="page_0741"/>Natal. It is perfectly obvious that if that had been suspected or thought, the referendum in Natal would have had a different result. The whole thing, however, would have broken down long before that. It would have broken down from the first sitting of the Convention. So I say that in forcing this Bill upon us in this way, hon. gentlemen opposite are committing what, in effect, is a breach of the understanding upon which the Union was based I do not wish to go into what I may call the more detailed reasons. The Minister of Finance says that in this Bill, for the first time in the history of South Africa, the Dutch-speaking people have consented by law to the flying of the Union Jack. I do not wish to question his law, but it seems to me, on the face of it, it is very doubtful if he is correct. It may be said, of course, that the treaty of Vereeniging and the Act of Union did not make special mention of the Union Jack, but, of course, the Act of Union mentioned British nationality. The question of the Union Jack was never mentioned, because it never entered the mind of anybody that there could have been any interference with the Union Jack. If you are going to say to half the people of the country that you are going to pull down something which we consider of absolutely essential importance, two things are going to happen. First of all, you are going to have discord in the country, and, secondly, you are going to impair the progress, the advancement, the enterprise of the whole of the Union, and you are going to make it more difficult for the British empire to give us that assistance in defence, in finance and in various other ways which we enjoy today and which we have always enjoyed. If anybody had put forward that suggestion at that time, people would have thought he was a lunatic. It passes my comprehension that hon. members opposite can fail to see the danger which besets us if we adopt the course which they are now inviting us to follow. They have invited us to get into a track which tends to get us further and further from Great Britain, which tends to get us obviously and correspondingly further and further from the other dominions, and then what is going to come? The Minister of Finance says that he is quite satisfied. I think if that happens he would not be so satisfied as he says he is to-day.</p>

They are of different race to us English people. They, many of them, have been through the Boer war, and it is quite natural that they should look upon these things from a somewhat different angle. In passing I would like to remark that the question of the attitude of the Dutch-speaking people of the country on this matter has been throughout this debate very largely confined to the attitude of the Dutch-speaking people in the Transvaal and the Free State. It is for those people that I can make the allowance that I suggest. The same thing does not apply to the Minister of the Interior. What other flag has he ever known? The Minister of Finance says he became a British subject by conquest. How did the Minister of the Interior become a British subject? He was born and bred under the British flag and under it he has attained whatever he has attained to-day. I do not find fault with them for that, but I wish they would think sometimes that it was lucky for them it fell out as it did. It does seem to me that it is not for them to lead this crusade.</p>

<p>I will tell the Prime Minister why&#x2014;because he has not suffered. The Dutch-speaking people of the northern provinces have suffered, but he and his friends have prospered under the flag under which he was born. There is another point. It is to me a great disappointment and also a source of anxiety that there are so many, apparently, judging by the interjections, among the younger members of this House who are taking these extreme views. Some of them, as I understand, were very young when the events of 25 years ago happened, and some of them belong to the provinces where no other flag but the Union Jack has ever been known. There are other parties to this trouble. They are the hon. members who sit on the cross benches. I find it difficult to moderate my language to accord with the rules of this House when I deal with them. The members who compose the Labour party are directly responsible for this discussion which is going on to-day. If they had done their duty, if they had kept their word to the people who put them in their seats, this discussion would not be going on and this Bill would never have been introduced. I defy members on the cross benches to say that is not correct. We have <span class="col_4163-4164" refersTo="page_0742"/>had that admitted by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) and by prominent members of the Labour party, not personally known to me, in Durban, Johannesburg and East London, and I am reminded that one of these was the late secretary of the Labour party who, surely, having been instrumental in getting members into their seats, should know something about the reasons which prompted him to help them. I am quite aware that this is not the first time hey have pursued a similar policy. We had the same policy pursued by some of them in the Transvaal in 1906. At that time I was in the party which was in opposition to my right hon. friend, and my recollection of what took place is that my right hon. friend very astutely and quite legitimately took advantage of these gentlemen&#x2019;s activities, and he created the then Labour party in the Transvaal Parliament and used that party to split our vote. That was quite legitimate. The people who were to blame were the people who now occupy the cross benches. They did it in 1906 and they are doing it again to-day. It is for that reason that I will not admit that there is any similarity between the position of the old Unionist party and the members of the South African party on the one side, and the position of the Nationalist party and the parliamentary Labour party, on the other side. On this side we have a genuine fusion based upon mutual regard, and based upon the recognition that the right hon. gentleman and his friends have always kept their word, have always played the game, and when the country was in danger they saved it from destruction. Is there any resemblance between the manner of the fusion which took place between the members who compose this party and the relations which exist between the members on the cross benches and the members over there? Members of the cross benches were so greedy of power, or so anxious to hit the South African party, that they were willing to sacrifice their own constituents and to sacrifice their principles and they were willing to make themselves a party to a shameful bond. It is quite possible that with the aid of these gentlemen this Bill will go through this House. That is quite possible, but I do not envy the gentlemen on the cross benches their fate at the hands of the people whom they stoop to stab in the back. I think it is certain that time will bring them their retribution. When these people have done their work, when the period for which their reward shall be operative has gone, then will come, I feel sure, the withering blast. For these reasons I would support the amendment which has been moved by my right hon. friend. It is possible that in the heat of controversy timings are said which make it more difficult to bring about agreement, but if I have spoken somewhat warmly I think I had ample provocation in the speech made by the Minister of Finance. Not so much, perhaps, for the exact words, but for the obvious impression which one got from listening to that speech. I would in all earnestness ask hon. members opposite to pause before they carry this any further, because&#x2014;make no mistake&#x2014; if this campaign is persevered in, it may become a very serious quarrel, and it is a quarrel which unfortunately is forced upon us by circumstances under which an active campaign is going to last for a very considerable time, and no one can say what passions will be aroused by that campaign, and what may come out of it.</p>

<p>To me this matter is a very serious thing, and I am pleased that in this debate thus far there has been a fair sense of moderation. The consequences of any heated discussion may lead to such deplorable results as any hon. member may be ashamed of, in the near future, and any remarks from me are from one who is not only responsible to his constituents but to the country as a whole. I have reason to speak with all sincerity, having been born and lived all my life among people of Dutch extraction—people for whom I have the deepest respect and admiration. I have shared with them in their joys and tribulations. I can speak as a representative of the majority of one of the oldest districts in the Union. When I read the speech delivered by the Prime Minister at Cape Town, and afterwards confirmed in Pretoria, I felt that at last a new era had dawned on South Africa: the consummation of a united South Africa whereby the two white races would live and labour side by side in peace and goodwill had arrived. But I am gravely disappointed at the turn of events, due to the determination of the Minister of the Interior to force through a flag which will not embody the symbols of the two white races of South Africa. We are all agreed on our status, but unfortunately it appears there is no possibility of coming to an agreement on the flag question, and I would appeal to the Prime Minister to leave this burning question alone, or to leave it until such time as an agreement will be arrived at. On the other hand, if the Minister of the Interior insists on his policy of resuscitating discord in this country, no other design could be better than this proposed flag. It is said that the Vierkleur is dead, but an expression like this is an insult to those who have fought so gloriously for white civilization in the past. No it is not dead, and it should live in the heart of every Afrikander. For upwards of <span class="col_4165-4166" refersTo="page_0743"/>100 years or more, the symbol of the Cape Colony, and for part of that period the symbol of Natal, under which both English and Dutch enjoyed protection, has been the symbol of the Union Jack. To the coloured people and the natives the Union Jack has also been a symbol to which they have been attached in loyalty and devotion. It is proposed that we should have a referendum on this question and that a majority of even one should have the effect of forcing on the minority a flag which is not going to reconcile the races. I cannot possibly conceive how blind the Government has been to their responsibility. We are going to have a referendum which is going to open up old sores of both sections of the community, which I hoped had gone for ever. Personally, I would fight 20 general elections, rather than have a referendum of this kind.</p>

<p>It is going to be bitter. There are many of my Dutch-speaking friends for whom I have every admiration who are probably going to work against their fellow Dutchmen, and in this respect it is going to be bitter. We are accused of making this a party question, and the Minister of Labour said that the Mayor of Durban was giving out instructions to his subordinates, and insinuated as much that it was work for the South African party. That is only the beginning of insinuations, and I say with deliberation that nothing of the kind emanated from us as a party. A few days or a week ago a meeting was held in the Cape Town city hall. I went there through inquisitiveness, and I saw the great enthusiasm displayed by these people. Are we to ignore their feelings? They came in their thousands, and the people who spoke spoke with responsibility, and knowing what it would mean to these people&#x2019;s feelings. As to the attitude of members of the Labour party on this great question, I would refer this House to a signed letter from one of them recently, whose views sum up to a nicety the views of hon. members on the crossbenches. It is a letter from Mr. Archie Jamieson which I saw in one of the papers. I have the deepest sympathy for those who fought gloriously for their country, but I have no respect for the feelings of hon. members on the Labour side; perhaps it would be unparliamentary to say that I have contempt for them. There is another point in regard to this turmoil and that is its effect on business generally, for if the Bill is passed we shall have an upheaval which will adversely affect trade. Even at a general election business is absolutely at a standstill. As one born in South Africa I yield place to no one in this House for my love of the traditions of both races. I implore the Government to postpone the flag question till some distant date when an amicable agreement may be arrived at for a flag embodying the Vierkleur and the Union Jack.</p>

<p>The language and tone of members of the Government make it very difficult to discuss this matter clamly, but the gravity of the question demands that it should be debated in a serious way. However, I believe it is not yet too late to arrive at a solution. It is no use raking up the bitter past and I was aggrieved to hear the speech of the Minister of Finance because the over-shadowing features of it were domination and intolerance. We cannot go on in that way, but we must look to the future. The Minister of the Interior also referred to the bitter memories of the past. Surely, he has the least reason of all to do that, for he took no part in the war between Great Britain and the republics. He was born in one of the provinces under the Union Jack and was shielded by that. I don&#x2019;t suppose he has ever had a rifle in his hand. I would like to remind him that Natal is part of the British Empire and the bitter and derogatory way in which he spoke about Natal raised my ire. As a Natal man I know very little about the party in Natal which the Minister said refuse to allow themselves to be called South Africans. As a Natal man I know very little about that section, and it is very unfair that Natal should be judged by a small and extremist party. Natal has always maintained the spirit of the National Convention. How very unfair it would be of me to cast reflections on the Cape because it has a league of fanatics, mostly women, who are anti-British and who are responsible for imposing their will on the Minister of the Interior and the Government. It would be wrong to condemn the Cape because of that clique. That is not the way to achieve unity. The Minister was wrong when he said that the Government side alone represent Dutch opinion. In my constituency half the electors are Dutch and half English. The late General Botha was born in my constituency and his relatives live there to this day. The constituencies of Weenen, Klip River and Dundee are similarly circumstanced. The electors in those constituencies are people of moderate opinion, and people with moderate views constitute the majority of the inhabitants of South Africa. I was born in Natal and I represent the moderate opinion of both races, and they realize that if we are to build up a nation we must have agreement and unity. They agree that we require a national flag, one that will symbolize the builders up of South Africa&#x2014;the English and the Dutch, but No. 2 design is meaningless. We want to have a flag which both sections of the population will love, that will unify the sentiment of English and Dutch. The turmoil over this question is far deeper than the Government realize. The reason for that is the violation of sentiment of the people. History gives us a solution of the Flag Bill. The history of South Africa did not begin with the landing of Van Riebeck or the great trek, but goes back to the sixteenth century when the English and the Dutch defeated the attempt of Spain to stamp them both out, and in that case and if they had been untrue to each other it is doubtful whether those two great countries would be as they are to-day <span class="col_4167-4168" refersTo="page_0744"/>and there would have been no Dutch settlement in the Cape which would in all probability have been a Portuguese republic or a vassal State under the Spanish Crown. The comradeship in arms between the English and Dutch 350 years ago, is responsible for the position of the Union of South Africa to-day. If there had not been that ancient bond of comradeship in arms neither English or Dutch would be here to-day. From 1914 to 1918 Dutch-speaking and English-speaking South African voluntarily took up arms and fought under the Union Jack. Would the Minister of the Interior suggest those Dutch-speaking South Africans, who formed part of the brigade at Delville Wood, fought less gallantly because they fought under the Union Jack, this recent comradeship in arms seals the ancient bond? The Government has made a great point of the referendum. Whichever way it goes it is going to create dissatisfaction, whether it is in favour of the Government or against it. In it there is the essence of disunion. I ask the Government if the referendum goes against them are they going to continue in office? Besides the terms on which the people are going to vote make it as the hon. member for Pretoria has said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The dice are loaded,</block>

<p>and an ambiguous meaning can be put to the result of that vote which should be put right when the Bill goes into Committee. I am one of those who say it is wrong to say the Vierkleur is dead. In the Free State and Transvaal the Vierkleur is still flown. The noble deeds performed under that flag will never die, and there are hon. members sitting on both sides of the House who fought nobly or the old Vierkleur, and their veneration for that flag will never die. The late republics were overpowered, but they were not defeated. If five armed men attack one man fully armed and bear him to the ground and take his arms from him it is not defeat; it is not a fair fight. They have overpowered him. So it was with the republics&#x2014;they were outnumbered. The great act of magnanimity which was performed by Great Britain in giving back the country and the language is proof that the republics were never defeated.</p>

<p>For those on the opposite side to say the Union Jack is an emblem of oppression is all moonshine. During the Great War the farmers in South Africa regarded the Union Jack as an emblem that would guarantee the delivery of their wool and produce to the markets of Europe. The hatred of the Union Jack, if there is such hatred, is a matter of recent growth. If there had been any talk of hatred of the Union Jack at the time of the National Convention can any member tell me there would have been a Union of South Africa? No, there was no such talk, and anyone saying there was hatred then of the Union Jack is saying what is not true. When we consummated Onion on June 1st, 1910, it was a time when the chapter of the past was closed. It was the birthday of a new nation in South Africa. At that time the late Gen. Botha planted a tree of unity and nurtured with toleration and co-operation, and that tree has borne fruit. It was his life&#x2019;s work, and we see the evidence of the success in the volume of public opinion in South Africa to-day. We see it on this side of the House, where English and Dutch-speaking members sit side by side, working for the good of South Africa.</p>

<p>On that side of the House you have two parties whose principles are as far apart as the Poles. One party is socialistic and the other is conservative. At the time of the National Convention Gen. Botha realized the great fact that to maintain a white supremacy in South Africa unity is essential. There is a deliberate attempt to undo Botha&#x2019;s great work. We have two Doctors of Divinity on the other side of the House, men whose religious training pledges them to preach peace and goodwill to all mankind, and what are they doing"? They are doing their best to separate the people and re kindle the fires of racialism. Yet these ambassadors of God have imposed their will upon the Government in regard to this flag, which is creating an ominous commotion to-day in the country, and what its end will be no man can foretell. When the motion came before the House for leave to introduce this Bill, the hon. member for Barberton (Mr. Rood) shouted out across the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That&#x2019;s the stuff to give &#x2019;em.</block>

<p>Why should such an offensive remark be made? That shows a bad spirit which, I am thankful to say, does not exist on this side of the House. Then the hon. member for Winburg (Dr. van der Merwe) went out of his way last session, during the debate on this question, to insult the people of Natal. To quote his words as reported in Hansard, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I know that in Natal they refer to that republican rag (in reference to the Vierkleur).</block>

<p>I say that is a gross insult to Natal and absolutely devoid of any truth. I have lived my life in Natal, and I call upon all the Natal members representing Natal to bear me out in this, that opprobrious term, that insult, has never been used by Natal people. Then, again, this high priest of racialism on another occasion, in referring to Natal, as if it were a foreign country, spoke of it as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A kaflir and coolie location.</block>

<p>Is that the spirit which we should have to create a nation, or to create Union, a bitter, uncalled for remark like that? No, but the most diabolical act that any member of Parliament could be guilty of was committed by the hon. member for Winburg when&#x2014;</p>

<p>What a grave thing it is to go to a university like that and attempt to poison the minds of the young fellows who are on the threshold of life. That is entirely wrong. In regard to this flag, No. 2 design, excluding the Union Jack, there is to-day a suspicion in the minds of the people of the country in regard to it. They feel that it is a first step to a republic, and can they be blamed for thinking so. Take last Friday at the Koffiehuis. When the Minister of Justice was addressing a meeting there he used these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and in securing for South Africa a more independent place in the world than it had now.</block>

<p>What does that mean? If it means anything, it means republicanism. Let us take the right hon. the Leader of the Opposition in his address the other day in the House when he was discussing the position of South Africa&#x2019;s status. The Minister of Finance was interjecting, and not agreeing that our status is equal to that of any other of the British dominions. What is the meaning of that? Is he not satisfied with our status? Does he also want a republic? South Africa has had enough trouble in the past and we have every opportunity now of going on in a peaceful manner if the Government will only be reasonable and fair in recognizing the feeling of the people. Put the Vierkleur in its proper place on the national flag, alongside the Union Jack. That is all that is wanted; the solution is simple, and you will satisfy all sections of the community. I cannot understand the attitude of the hon. gentlemen on the cross-benches. I ask them who they represent? They represent themselves, but they are not representing their constituents. I ask them, where is their pride when I read to them what the Prime Minister said about them in 1921, This appears in the &#x201C;Farmers&#x2019; Monthly&#x201D; for March, 1921&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While claiming that the true victory rests with the Nationalists, he proceeded to say that the Labour party had been shattered on a rock of Afrikanderism, and until now it has sailed under false colours and has no reason for existence.</block>

<p>In Die Burger in 1921 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Afrikanders who are brought into touch with them are always used to suppress all and everything which otherwise would be dear to them as Afrikanders, so long as it remains imbued with its jingoistic imperialism.</block>

<p>Now they eat out of his hand like tame cats. What is being said among the public is, they want to know what price has been paid for the support of the Labour party? The public want to know whether the £200 a year extra is the price.</p>

<block name="quote">I have repeatedly given a pledge that I will on all occasions not only maintain but strengthen our association with the motherland.</block>

<p>We have all to come to our deathbeds; and I would be sorry to be in the place of the hon. member when he is on his. He made a solemn pledge to his constituents to always safeguard the Union Jack and he was returned by them on his pledge of loyalty to the flag. I hope the hon. member has the moral courage to do what the hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay) has done, vote against the Bill. It is not too late yet. When my leader was speaking this afternoon and saying the Vierkleur was not dead, the hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) interjected and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Will you give us a Republic with the Vierkleur too.</block>

<p>What a contrast to his words at Melbourne. They were so beautiful that I wrote them down. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Australia is an object-lesson to South Africa. It is an insult to South Africa to doubt her loyalty to the Empire. We should do anything to emulate Australia, and I hope Australia will not be jealous of our efforts.</block>

<p>Now he wants a republic, and hon. members opposite want to know why there should be suspicion in the minds of people when expressions like these are made. I appeal to the Prime Minister. It has been said that for less cause than this blood has been shed. You are touching the sentiment of the people, and sentiment is akin to religious fervour. I warn the Prime Minister not to have the blood of the people on the head, and if the Union Jack cannot be incorporated with the Vierkleur in the flag of South Africa he should withdraw the Bill. Wait till the atmosphere is calmer; till there is agreement with the people on this grave question.</p>

<p>You were not in the House when it was made. While he poured scorn on the offer made to him at the same time he said no settlement was possible if the Union Jack was on the flag. It has been made perfectly clear that whatever device is agreed upon the Union Jack shall be included, and also the Vierkleur. A large majority of the people would be only too ready to accept that as a solution. The Minister of Finance said the inclusion of the Red Cross was adequate recognition of the British section. Surely if the Union Jack is a cause of offence to any person the Red Cross must likewise be an offence if it were explained that it was the flag of England. Would that not also be regarded as an insult by our Dutch fellow citizens?</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NATHAN</person>:</from>

<p>You can hurt people by omission as well as by commission. The omission of the Union Jack may lead to trouble. I represent a very important constituency which has laid it down that no flag will be acceptable unless it embraces the Union Jack. I am the representative of that constituency, and I have a greater right to speak on this question than has the Government. Where is the Government&#x2019;s mandate on this point? When the general election took place in 1924 the flag question was not discussed. If the Government wanted to bring in this Bill it was their bounden duty to have brought it up during the election in no uncertain fashion, and it should have been made an issue of the contest. If the Government had then been returned on that issue it would have had a perfect right to bring in the Hill. But if they had made that question the issue they would never have occupied the Treasury benches. The Prime Minister interjected the other day that he had been waiting 17 years for a new national flag. Evidently he forgets the correspondence which he had on this question with his Majesty&#x2019;s representative in 1910. In a letter signed by the Prime Minister dated the 6th September, 1910, which emanates from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s office, evidently in consultation with the Cabinet, it remarks that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With reference to the Minister&#x2019;s minute No. 108 of 25th June, 1910, Ministers have the honour to inform His Excellency the Governor-General that they have decided to adopt as the badge of the Union, to be displayed on the Union flag, the shield of the selected coat of arms of the Union of South Africa.</block>

<p>and it proceeds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ministers will be glad to hear that the suggested device meets with the approval of the right hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as citizens are anxious in view of the approaching visit of his Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, to provide themselves with the flag of United South Africa.</block>

<p>The Prime Minister laughs, but it is no laughing matter. He seems to treat this matter in a jocular way, as a joke, but it is one of the most serious things this House has ever been called upon to discuss. I heard you say, sir, a moment ago, that we must not use the word <span class="col_4173-4174" refersTo="page_0747"/>&#x201C;diabolical,&#x201D; but if I were allowed to use it it would be an appropriate description of this Bill, but as I am not allowed to use it then I must say this Bill has been conceived more in anger than in anything else. I do hope this Bill will not go through as far as the committee stage. If it does there are sections which will not be acceptable to this House. Hon. members have suggested that the Bill provides for referendum. Anybody who has studied the referendum must describe it in simple language, as being ridiculous. It goes so far as to say that the Government may say which clauses of the Electoral Act shall not apply. The Government may say that there shall be no secret ballot. They might say that somebody shall stand at the ballot box and see where a man puts his mark. What is the result? A man will be afraid who has at present got an office under this Government to put his X against this thing. He must put his X in favour of it. It goes further that the Government may provide penalties, and that the Government will have the right to create new offences. If that is a fair referendum, and you ask me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are you going to get the fair opinion of the public?</block>

<p>I would say that it is nothing else than a farce, and the Bill with its referendum is ridiculous. But let us proceed. Let us see what outside people say of it, people who are looking on with a calm mind. I am quoting one or two of the London papers. The &#x201C;Westminster Gazette&#x201D; speaks of&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The great political crisis involving the reawakening of the Anglo-Dutch racial enmities so long buried.</block>

<p>I am not a racialist; I am born in this country. My people came to this country nearly a hundred years ago. It is my country, the country of my people who love it; people who wish to stay here and make it a success. If we get these seeds of discord sown and broadcast as they are at the present time, I pity the country. The &#x201C;Morning Post&#x201D; says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The parlimentary debates will be most injurious to the unity of South Africa. Whether they would do more injury to the British race or the Nationalist Government may remain to be seen, for the British working man in South Africa, as a whole, is usually a much better patriot than his political representatives.</block>

<p>I think on this occasion it would be well to dive a little into the past and perhaps the Prime Minister won&#x2019;t mind if I quote him rather freely in the course of this debate. In August, 1910, he made a speech at Smithfield to the following effect&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Great and noble statesmen (referring to Englishmen) have given us full and free self-government with a grant of a status.</block>

<p>He said he had a status in 1910. Nevertheless, he came back in 1926 from England and told us he has got a status, and yet he said we had a status in 1910.</p>

<p>We know that unity is strength, but is this going to bring about the union we desire? All noble sentiments, but not acted up to, unfortunately. Again in Johannesburg, and at that time he was still a member of the Botha Cabinet, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no empire on earth for which I feel more respect than this very British empire. British statesmen know that when the British empire needs us it will find us at our posts.</block>

<p>These are very weighty words, and they should sink again into the mind of the Prune Minister. I do not like to insult him, but his is a most extraordinary composition.

<p>I will come to the Bill in due course, sir, but this is really history that has been made in South Africa. He (the Prime Minister) said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That party (the Labour party) has shown itself not less jingoistic than the Unionist party. I have always been of the opinion, and am more than ever of that opinion to-day, that South Africa has no greater enemy than the jingo spirit. The Labour party is far from being cleansed, and he who ventures with it incurs the danger of compromising himself for good in the eyes of his country.</block>

<p>That word &#x201C;compromising&#x201D; is a most powerful one, and fits the situation at the moment. The Prime Minister also said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Labour party has been shattered on the national rock of Afrikanderdom, and to the great profit of Afrikanderdom.</block>

<p>I will leave the Prime Minister now and have a few moments with the Minister in charge of the Bill. At Caledon on the 2nd of November, 1922, the Minister of the Interior described coalition as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Demoralizing; a constant traffic in principles; an outrage of the conscience; duplicity on the part of leaders.</block>

<p>The Minister seems to have forgotten those words&#x2014;that is, the worst of it. Where is that duplicity now?</p>

<p>Some hon. members have very convenient and short memories, and do not like to be reminded of what they said. I warn hon. members opposite that this Bill will give cause for both wings of the Pact to think furiously hereafter. One asks in all seriousness which of the two parties forming the Pact is going to win&#x2014;either the Nationalists or the Labourites. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) has predicted that within the next five years the Labour Party will have eight seats in the Free State. He said so, and he always knows. What is going to become of those who hold the other seats? That should cause member&#x2019;s of the Government to think furiously. Where are they going to be then? Now we come to a message sent by the Prime Minister when he assumed office; he thought fit to cable it to the then Colonial Secretary in London, Mr. J. H. Thomas&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The aim and desire of my Government is to develop prosperity and contentment amongst all sections of the community, which will make South Africa worthy of the position she holds in the British commonwealth.</block>

<p>How does he now propose to achieve this? I was born in this country and also desire peace and prosperity, but it will not be obtained by this Bill. In the lifetime of the late Gen. Botha he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As long as we are divided and try to reach our goal by division we shall fail to create a great people in the country.</block>

<p>The hon. Minister has a glorious opportunity such as has not been given to any other man in South Africa. I was recently reading a book entitled &#x201C;If I were a Labour Leader,&#x201D; written by Ernest Benn, and on page 146 of that the Prime Minister will find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should like to be known as a peace man, a man who really did something to root out the vice of hate.</block>

<p>If he will hold out the hand of peace all the members on this side of the House will be glad to help him along, but to achieve that end lie must have courage, and to become the saviour of South Africa he must cast off those who induced him to bring this measure forward. What are the duties of a Government? They must keep the country in a calm mood. They must make it possible for people to develop their resources and to get on with the work of the country. We are most anxious to avoid a collision and a division between the people. Do not divide the people more than they are divided already. If agreement is impossible to-day let the matter rest&#x2014;time will play its healing part. Is it not possible to have a reasonable compromise? I think it is. Possibly later on a reasonable compromise might be arrived at. I have worked for 17 years in this country to help to make good laws, to help bring the people together and to help forward peace and prosperity. This is my message, &#x201C;Let us put our shoulders to the wheel and with might and main work in that direction.&#x201D; Better nothing at all than a flag which is going to be forced down the throats of one of the contesting parties.</p>
