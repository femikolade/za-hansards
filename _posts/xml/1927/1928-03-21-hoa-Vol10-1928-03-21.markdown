<p>What is the use of bringing forward arguments when the Minister is not in his place? If the Minister is not in his place, I think the debate should be further adjourned. We have had this matter before us since October or November of last year. It is now two months since the session was resumed, and I have been expecting every day that this matter, which is an extremely important one in some respects, would be brought forward, and now when it is brought forward the Minister is not in his place. What is the use of advancing arguments which are intended to influence the Minister, when the Minister is absent?</p>

<p>May I, with leave of the House, say a few words? The hon. member is quite right in saying that this has been on the paper for a long time, but as it happens, the Minister of Mines and Industries is engaged in another place over another matter which has also been delayed for a long time, but I am very familiar with this matter, and the Minister has asked me, in order to facilitate progress, to look after it. I shall make ample notes and any points raised by hon. members I shall be in a position, I think, to deal with. Under these circumstances I would ask the hon. member to continue the debate and carry on as we desire so as to get this piece of business disposed of. We could not consent to adjourn the debate, and I hope the hon. member will not press it or risk his right of speaking, because one wants to hear his views and I have no doubt other hon. members also have views to express. The debate can be perfectly well continued under the existing circumstances.</p>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I second. The last occasion on which the matter came before this House was last October, and it was under circumstances which gave the House to understand that there was a serious doubt whether this matter would ever come before the House again. Since then the House has been sitting for two months and the matter has always been low down on the Order Paper. To-day for the first time in six months it is placed first on the Order Paper, and apparently this is the one day in the session when the Minister primarily responsible for the agreement and to whom we wish to address our criticisms, because it is a very technical and difficult matter, is not able to be present. I cannot imagine anything more extraordinary. I know the Minister of Defence has told us that he knows something about the agreement and he is prepared to make notes and to deputize as much as he can for the Minister of Mines and Industries, but he will admit himself that this is a most unsatisfactory way of doing it. This is not an ordinary debate in which there is just one broad principle involved. This is a debate on an extremely technical and involved agreement and I should be surprised indeed if the Minister of Defence were able to tell me that he could appreciate the true inwardness of every point in this agreement, and of the two diamond cutting Acts involved. Therefore it does seem to me the House has really been trifled with in this matter. Why cannot the Minister go on with the next order and leave this over until the Minister of Mines and Industries comes back from another place? Surely that is the only satisfactory way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#munnik">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to point out that what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) has just stated, that this question has suddenly appeared on the Order Paper, is not correct. On yesterday&#x2019;s Order Paper this question was already high up, and had it not been for an accident it would have been reached. I want to point out that the tactics which are being employed here are probably only what we can expect from the Opposition in regard to this debate. When this question was before us in October, certain steps were taken to get the matter delayed, and we shall probably find that the process which is going to be evolved to delay this matter is exactly identical with what has happened with the Iron and Steel Bill. We can expect it from the Opposition. The Minister of Defence is probably the man most conversant with this particular subject that we have in this House, and he is probably more capable of dealing with the measure than the Minister in charge. He is a technical man, fully qualified in mining and, therefore, in a proper position to judge with regard to all mining matters arising out of this measure. He is peculiarly fitted to deal with it. I regret the Minister is in another place, but the Minister in charge is quite capable and competent to deal with it, and I hope the House will not accept any further delay.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. member will not press his motion for the adjournment, because it only delays matters. Without accepting the allegation that I know more about it than the Minister in charge, I may say, with all modesty, that I am perfectly able to appreciate all arguments that may be brought forward, but, further, I submit that when hon. members speak in this House, they are addressing themselves to you, sir, and to the hon. members of this House, and the actual presence of the Minister in charge is not essential at all, certainly not in this case. This is a Government measure. I know the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) has somewhat of an erroneous and heterodox idea as to the duties of Ministers to listen to his remarks, but those of us who have more experience of Parliament know that we are addressing ourselves to the House and not to any individual Minister, and I hope the House will not accept the motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thomas_smartt">

<from><span class="col_2363-2364" refersTo="page_1248"/>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS SMARTT</person>:</from>

<p>Surely the Minister knows that when an important subject of this matter is brought before the House, it is to be supposed that the Minister in charge of the subject knows more about it than anybody else. I can thoroughly understand the duties of the Minister in another place, hut those duties were known yesterday, and the least the Minister could have done was, when making arrangements for another place, to make suitable arrangements in this place also. I think that it is only an act of courtesy to the House that the House expects. Had it happened that the Minister had been unexpectedly called away, it would have been an entirely different question, but the Order Paper and the Order Paper in the Senate were arranged yesterday by the Government, and I have no doubt that the Order Paper in the Senate was arranged at the request and with the desire of the Minister of Mines and Industries, and, under these circumstances, I think the least the House might have expected was that this order should have been put down for a day when it was convenient for the Minister to be present. We have a great admiration for the ability and versatility of the Minister of Defence, but we do not think in this particular matter he is as competent to deal with it as the Minister who introduced it, because, had the Government considered that my hon. friend was more competent to deal with a matter of this kind, it would have been submitted to his keeping. But it was submitted by the Cabinet to the Minister of Mines and Industries. Under the circumstances I think the precedent is not at all unjustified in asking the Government to agree to the adjournment of the debate, or at least to wait until the Minister is present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the right hon. member is quite correct when he says the Order Paper in another place was arranged by the Government. The particular measure to which he alludes was put down by the House. I wish to support my hon. friend there, and I want to appeal to the House not to accept what the right hon. member (Sir Thomas Smartt) seeks to lay down&#x2014;that it is for the Opposition to say which Minister shall be here to conduct affairs as far as the work of the Government is concerned. No, I hope the House will not accept that dictum of the right hon. member, that it is for him and his friends to dictate which of the Ministers shall be here. This is a Government measure; and it so happens it suits the convenience of the Government that the Minister of Defence shall represent the Government on this occasion. A similar question was raised on a previous occasion, when I protested.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>I need hardly say we are making no such claim as to say which Minister shall be present or absent on any particular occasion. We sometimes find it difficult to get any Ministers present at all; but what we do claim, and what the House as a whole should claim is, on whichever side hon. members sit, that when a Bill or a motion is introduced by a Minister he should be in the House when that Bill or motion is discussed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister of Defence is in charge now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister of Defence told us this was a Government measure. We know the remarkable unanimity of the Government on the subject, with which experience has, made us familiar; notwithstanding that, we think it the right principle, not only as a constitutional right, but as a matter of courtesy to this House, that the Minister in charge of a Bill or of a motion should make arrangements to be present when that Bill or motion is discussed, and if he cannot be present, the order ought to be postponed until such time as he can be here. The Order Paper in another place was fixed yesterday, and the Minister should know whether he would be in the one place or another. It was the duty of the Minister or the Government&#x2014;I do not care which&#x2014;to make arrangements for the Minister in charge to be in the House, or to have the order postponed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#close">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CLOSE</person>:</from>

<p>I think the Minister of Finance has not been fair in the remarks he made just now. He knows perfectly well that the question raised by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), who takes a great interest in the matter, is thoroughly justified. The Minister of Mines and Industries has a large personal knowledge of the condition of affairs, and we should have from the Minister direct, and not second-hand, what the position is. It is a matter of constitutional practice and of courtesy to the House that the Minister in charge should go right through to the end.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NATHAN</person>:</from>

<p>I will ask the Minister of Defence, is he quite sure that the Minister of Mines and Industries is engaged elsewhere? I will tell you why. I am afraid an accident has befallen the Minister. I happened to be coming in from Sea Point a few moments ago and saw the Minister of Mines and Industries in conversation with the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Mr. Giovanetti), who I do not see present. I am afraid an accident has overtaken him.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I find that the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) did speak on the main question on the last occasion when the agreement was before the House, but as there has been a misunderstanding, I do not think he should forfeit his right to continue his speech because of the intervention of the hon. member for Harbour (Maj. G. B. van Zyl).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, sir. The hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) asserts that we are out to delay the agreement. Nothing of the kind; as a matter of fact, I have asked the Minister in charge of the agreement to bring it forward. The delay which has occurred has had the advantage of allowing the public to understand the agreement better. The Minister is very much to blame in one respect, for there is no question that the agreement should be referred to a select committee, as it involves the interests of private individuals, the State to some extent, and the diamond trade to a large extent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>We are quite prepared to send the agreement to the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased indeed to hear that. Since the publication of the agreement we have learned that quite a number of people are interested in diamond cutting in South Africa, and there are diamond cutting factories at Pretoria and Johannesburg. These factories, however, have never asked for a subsidy, but have carried on the principle of private enterprise, and they received none of the important privileges which will be given under the agreement to the new entrant into the field. The head of one of the Transvaal diamond cutting factories, in a newspaper interview, states that the industry can progress quite well without a subsidy. He had imported men from Holland and intended to bring out 50 more, which is considerably in excess of the number the subsidized firm will import. The industry, he adds, does not require to be bolstered up with Government money. What right has the Government to interfere with a man of that kind?</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>It has the very opposite effect, because they have to fight the Government. You are interfering with established trade, which is already running in South Africa and is carried out by private enterprise, which is better than State enterprise and no subsidy is required. It is proposed to give subsidies in addition to very important concessions. Let me quote Act No. 38 of 1919, which states what the rights of the present diamond cutters are as far as the State is concerned. It is Clause 4. [Clause read.] He is not allowed to export diamonds, but he may export remnants.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>: Was I? Just you answer for your own things. These concessions are very important concessions, as I will show. In the first place, take Clause 11. [Clause read.] In other words, these people are allowed to export diamonds under one carat in weight <span class="col_2367-2368" refersTo="page_1250"/>which have been subjected to one or more operations, at a reduced rate. No diamond cutter can do that to-day.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>You made the same proposal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Will my hon. friend not interfere. I would rather talk to the Minister of Industries, because he is in charge of the Bill. There is another point, Clause 10. [Clause read.] In other words, whereas they are forbidden under the old law to export these glasses of diamonds except under the usual terms of paying the duty, they are now allowed to export partially cut diamonds under one tarat in weight, and hon. members will see the enormous advantage thus given to the new concern, and some people in the trade think it is a very dangerous advantage. They can be exported at the rate lower than those of any other diamond cutter, and lower than the dealers can do. It is a very great concession. In addition to those privileges they propose to give &#x00A3;30,000 subsidy spread over three years. In the quotation I have read this gentleman states they do not require this subsidy. The men brought out from Holland are having their passages paid and their railway fare up-country, I presume to Kimberley? That is not required by other people who do not ask the Government to pay fares, and why is it done now? It is an extraordinary thing that it requires all this to bring them out. To my mind it is an extremely one-sided agreement, and in addition you interfere with the business of the existing cutters, not very large, I agree, but these people have put their own money in it, and now the Government steps in and does not give them the same privileges, which to my mind is a very grave thing indeed. They have not given them any bonus, nor have they assisted them to get all the men out. I will not press the point to refer it to a select committee, as I understand my hon. friend is willing to do that. It is only right, fair and just, in asking the House to approve of an agreement of this kind that it should go before a select committee. Will you move to refer it to the Public Accounts Committee?</p>

<p>I second the amendment. I am glad to learn from the Minister that he is prepared to allow the subject matter of this agreement to be investigated by a committee of this House which shall have power to call evidence. I would like to add a few words to what the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has said, and submit to the House for its consideration, some points of view, some for and some against this agreement, in the hope that they may be of some assistance to the committee as a result of the discussion which will probably follow on the remarks made by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central). The only way in which one can deal with a matter of this kind is to follow somewhat the same course of taking the agreement clause by clause and drawing attention to various matters that strike the eye as one goes through it. Let me say, first of all, that I welcome the opportunity for investigation in committee, because I do feel that the House and the country are entitled to some information as to the capacity and the qualifications of these gentlemen to undertake this large enterprise. I have tried to ascertain something of their previous experience. I listened very carefully to the speech of the Minister of Mines when he laid this agreement before the House, and it struck me there must be some reason, perhaps because he had no information on the point, why the House was given no detailed particulars on these very important questions of qualifications, and of previous experience, or how these gentlemen have fared in the diamond cutting operations which I gather they carry on at the present time at Amsterdam. I rather gathered that they have been engaged in an enterprise, if not exactly similar, in some country abroad. I would like to ask the Minister what information has been placed before him as to the business capacity, the previous experience and the qualifications of these gentlemen who come from Amsterdam. I think the country is entitled to know how it was that this particular firm were able to obtain access to the Government and negotiate an agreement which, from their point of view, can be regarded as one of the most satisfactory agreements ever negotiated with the Government of this country. I refer to Clause 2, which should also be taken into consideration with Clauses 15 and 16. Under Clause 2 it appears that the Government give permission, although it is not exactly worded in that way, to these concessionaires, these lucky concessionaires, to import from Europe not less than 50 specified persons. What strikes one in regard to that is that there is no provision in the agreement as to the wages, the terms of service, or any of the conditions upon which these men are to be employed, and if 50 men <span class="col_2369-2370" refersTo="page_1251"/>are brought in during the first year, whether it will be competent to bring in another 50 in the next year. I would like to ask the Minister whether he has laid down any conditions which will secure compliance by these men with the immigration laws, or is he compelled to admit, on the demand of the contractors, such persons as they desire to bring in; further, when they are here, what arrangements are being made to enforce a minimum wage?</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am following up the very excellent policy of this party under the Industrial Conciliation Act, which, I was glad to learn from the Minister of Labour the other day, met with the full approval of the Government. Having dealt with Clause 2, upon which I invite the Minister to give us some information, I must say I am not at all clear as to the precise effect of Clause 4, which relates to the employment of apprentices. This clause commits the contractors at the request of the Government to employ a large number of South Africans, young South Africans, no doubt, in this industry. If it is a failure, what responsibility will lie upon the Government in connection with it? If some of these young men for a period of two or three years work for wages which are not strikingly large and the enterprise then closes down, is there any responsibility upon the Government? I would suggest that there might be a great deal of responsibility upon the Government. Therefore, it makes it all the more necessary that in scrutinizing this clause, the committee should go carefully into the whole of the obligations, whether express or implied. We are told that this concession, this practical monopoly, is to extend for a period of five years, and yet in the fourth year of the contract it is still compulsory upon the cutters to continue to take on apprentices who must then, according to the contract, be employed for a further period of five years, and in effect the country is thus committed to a nine years&#x2019; contract under this agreement. I would like to ask the Minister whether that is not very likely to happen. Supposing for one moment that the contract proves to be lucrative, will it not be said that it imposes obligations upon the contractors for a period which may extend altogether for nine years? I would like to say one or two things in reference to Clauses 8 and 9, before I come to the very important point which arises under Clause 11, and which has been referred to by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). Under Clause 8 the Government binds itself to take such necessary steps as will ensure an adequate supply of diamonds to the cutters. The Minister may remember that we had a considerable discussion in this House when the Diamond Control Bill came before it in 1925. There the Government constituted itself what we described as a statutory agent, giving it the right to take away from the producer his product and sell it at prices which the Government thought appropriate. Under this Clause 8 I would like to ask the Government whether it is their intention to compel producers to supply these diamonds on credit. We are left in the dark on that point. We are told the Government may, in its discretion, take such necessary steps to secure an adequate supply of diamonds. Not a word is said about the question of terms! Are the cutters to pay cash or are they to get terms? If they get terms who is to guarantee the payment of the price? I hope the select committee, if it be appointed, will investigate that point, because if credit is to be given it may be capable of abuse. Then, in regard to Clause 9, there is one point not at all clear and that is the definition of aggregate output. The Minister does not say whether that is output on the basis of money or on the basis of the weight of carats. In dealing with this clause I would point out it involves the valuation of all partly cut diamonds. I am not quite clear who is to be responsible for that. While these points are of importance, this Clause 11 is to my mind an exceedingly remarkable one. I would invite hon. members to follow me when I put this point for their consideration, because I am not at all clear as to how far it is competent to include this particular clause in the agreement. Let me start with the point put so clearly by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). I won&#x2019;t for a moment deal with the very unfair differentiation created in favour of this concern by the Government. In dealing with the right which is given to these contractors to export any diamonds under one carat in weight and with (to give an illustration) one facet polished, I would like to ask the Minister whether that is within the law and the spirit of the existing enactments passed by this House. Section 4 of the Diamond Cutting Act of 1919 lays it down that it shall not be lawful for any licensed diamond cutter to export or sell partly manufactured diamonds. The next question is this, is there any power on the part of the Government to give this particular right to these lucky concessionaires? We passed the Act of 1927 and I find the only alteration in the law in this respect was that the Governor-General might allow the export of diamonds not exceeding one carat in weight in a partly manufactured state if they are remnants of diamonds completely cut or polished. That qualification I do not find in this clause. It does seem to me that a diamond with one facet cut in that way is a partly manufactured stone. I cannot understand how Parliament could have passed one law under which the Minister may say to Mr. A of Pretoria, &#x201C;You cannot export a diamond which has one facet cut because you infringe section 4, but my lucky concessionaires can.&#x201D; I hope the Minister will tell us which is the correct view. It may be a matter for the lawyers to advise upon, but I think the Minister will agree it is a matter that demands consideration. I would like to say a little more about the broad general principle involved, which was put by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger). I read the other day an interesting article about what was called the &#x201C;murder Bill.&#x201D; I <span class="col_2371-2372" refersTo="page_1252"/>do not know whether the Minister of Mines and Industries recognised the description, but it is generally regarded as a correct and popular description of the Iron and Steel Bill.</p>

<speech by="#coulter">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COULTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am just explaining the analogy. I am pointing out there is another Bill which can very rightly be described, as it has been, as the &#x201C;murder Bill,&#x201D; and I was explaining how that term came to be used, and I am following it up by pointing out that by this special concession we are giving to these lucky concessionaires we are going to murder those other firms which have borne the heat and burden of the day and have been struggling along. How is it to be done? It is to be done by a process of differentiation. The Minister is going to differentiate in favour of these overseas contractors. What an extraordinary change of front! We listened the other night to section 111 of the Liquor Bill and we were solemnly assured by the Minister of Justice that he would not allow any differentiation by foreign sellers of whisky in this country. The moment we had disposed of that clause we find it is proposed to introduce this principle of differentiation in favour of these gentlemen from overseas. I do not press the point just put to me that it is against our own people. I must say this doctrine of South Africa first to the exclusion of the best brains we can procure from elsewhere does not appeal to me when I find that thereby it is intended to deprive the country of the best available talent for its development. Put all that on one side. If you are going to seek for consistency in the principles of this Government you undertake a vain and useless task. But what about these other concerns? I wish I knew more about them, but one knows in the case of every industrial enterprize in South Africa the great difficulties there are in starting them, of placing them on their feet, and of progressing thereafter. They have been encouraged, it seems to me, in their enterprize by the declared policy of Parliament. They have been told they would have certain rights, and it was made perfectly clear to them that so far as this particular class of competition is concerned they need have no fear, because there is a law which can be applied in all its rigour to all persons in the trade. Yet these lucky fellows for some reason are to be put on a different footing. No wonder they are careful to put in a clause to enable them to float a company. It seems to me these gentlemen are highly fortunate. Why, perhaps even some of these &#x201C;gamblers and speculators&#x201D; the Minister has told us about in his Precious Stones Bill will derive some profit. I wonder why the Minister has undergone this sudden conversion. I remember when he stood and raved in this House about gamblers and speculators who were so wicked as to form companies. He said in the legislation that he caused to pass in that other industry that there would be no vendor shares, but seemingly that does not apply when we come to a diamond agreement made by the Minister himself. These gentlemen may have reason to congratulate themselves on the sudden conversion of the Minister in this respect. I hope that this, one of the most important matters in the Bill, will be thoroughly investigated by the committee. Without keeping the House much longer, I would like to draw attention to another point. Anyone looking at this agreement, and at what lay behind it, would ask why it was that these gentlemen wanted a subsidy. It seems to be intended for losses sustained in the cutting operations, and material damaged in establishing the industry. But while these gentlemen are getting this &#x00A3;30,000 from the Government here, they have very few restrictions imposed on them. It seems to me that from the business point of view, this should be very closely investigated. I would like the committee to look at that and Clause 14, where these gentlemen undertake to provide &#x00A3;10,000, which seems to be a ridiculously small sum. The faith that lies in them does not go beyond &#x00A3;10,000. They may not want further capital, because of the profit they can make under Clause 11. They can demand half the first year&#x2019;s subsidy if they happen to cut only a few large stones. There is no reference to weight and number. If they go to the Minister&#x2019;s El Dorado and get a &#x00A3;15,000 diamond, they become entitled to &#x00A3;7,500, in the first week of the agreement. Passing on to the clause with reference to the formation of the company, I do ask the Minister why, if he has found it necessary in dealing with the Precious Stones Bill and Mines, to reserve to himself the right of the prevention or restriction of the creation of vendor shares, he has in this particular case made no such restriction at all? If at a later stage we find this is foisted on the public and vendor shares are created, I do hope the House will make it quite clear that responsibility must be assigned to the proper quarter. It will be possible to deal with this matter in more detail owing to the fact that it has to be examined by the committee and it is not necessary therefore to refer to any other clauses, except Clause 19. I will not say more about the details of this agreement; the Minister has done the right thing in accepting the amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) that this shall go before the Public Accounts Committee, where I hope it will receive thorough investigation, and that the committee will have sufficient evidence to show that these men are competent and experienced, and that their past record will justify the proceedings of the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has been postulating some illuminating objections. It is rather a somersault coming from that side. As far as this proposed agreement is concerned, what he objects to is that the minimum wage is not contained in it. I hope there will be no objection to the factory itself and the diamond producer being under proper control as to the minimum wage and hours, and that the hon. <span class="col_2373-2374" refersTo="page_1253"/>member agrees that this principle should also be extended to the mines producing the diamonds. In traversing some of the remarks made by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), he said that Government had been in too much of a hurry with regard to this agreement, but I do not know whether he is aware that this agreement has been on the tapis since the time when the hon. member sat on these benches and formed one of the members of the Government which actually had that agreement before them, and when that agreement had the close attention of the Minister of Mines and Industries (Mr. F. S. Malan), who drafted it on the 22nd of September, 1923.</p>

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. member. It is a long time since September, 1923, and the dissolution of 1924 intervened. It is exactly as we have contended all the time&#x2014;when we talk about diamond cutting in this country and cutting agreements, it has been done with one object&#x2014;to prevent diamond-cutting eventuating in this country. The public have clamoured for it; every Government, when it came into power, has had to meet that, but they have led the public round the bush. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) takes great exception to Clause 4 of the present Act, which was Clause 2 of the original agreement, and which the hon. member&#x2019;s own Government was prepared to accept, provided that Government would permit diamonds, under one carat in weight, to be exported up to and not exceeding 50 per cent. of the output of the factory. I am sorry to say that there is nothing sincere in the criticism which has been levelled at the agreement. The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Coulter) made some very sneering remarks about these gentlemen&#x2014;I think he was going to say that they were foreign adventurers&#x2014;and the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) told us that Government was going to interfere with the small cutter. What, however, is going to be the difference in price of a diamond cut by the small cutter and a diamond cut by the Government-assisted cutter? Both the private cutter and the Government-assisted cutter come from Antwerp, and the public will buy the cut diamond if it is well cut without asking who was the cutter. If you object to the one as being a foreigner, then you must just as well object to the other one being a foreigner.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens was quite right when be said that somebody was going to be &#x201C;murdered&#x201D; under this agreement. The man who runs the Diamond Syndicate is going to be &#x201C;murdered&#x201D; under this agreement, for every diamond cut under the agreement will be one less diamond for the syndicate to export, If the whole of the output were cut in South Africa the Diamond Syndicate would cease to function, and the hon. member who usually sits on the front opposition bench will have no work to do as far as the Diamond Syndicate is concerned, unless rumour, which is often a lying jade, is correct when it states that if a reputable firm makes a success of diamond-cutting in South Africa the Diamond Syndicate is quite prepared to embark on cutting here on a very large scale. The firm with which the Government has entered into the agreement is the second largest diamond-cutting firm in Antwerp and has also been operating in British Guiana. Owing to their actions in wishing to set up a factory in South Africa a thousand of their employees have been thrown out of work, as their factory has been closed down by the Association of Diamond Workers of Amsterdam, who take their instructions from the people who sell them diamonds&#x2014;the Diamond Syndicate. The ban is still maintained on these people and their thousand workmen are still out of employment. I have here a copy of the official organ of the Amsterdam Diamond Workers&#x2019; Association dated February 25th.</p>

<p>I had it from Mr. Rosenstrauch himself, and if he had the opportunity of being here, he could tell the hon. member something about diamond-cutting which the hon. member could never learn. For two generations the firm of Rosenstrauch Bros, have grown up in Antwerp, and they are au fait with the whole of the diamond-cutting trade. The agreement will not make a tittle of difference to the present diamond cutters in the Transvaal, for Rosenstrauch Bros, have sold their diamonds to wholesale dealers in America, while the Transvaal cutters cut only for the South African jewellery trade. American tourists who recently visited the Union bought &#x00A3;16,000 worth of diamonds because they were cut in South Africa. It would never do for Rosenstrauch &amp; Korbf to sell their output to the South African jewellers&#x2014;the market is too limited. A brochure has been sent to the Minister by Mr. Rosenstrauch in which the latter said: &#x201C;There is no doubt that the diamond-cutting industry in South Africa can be developed to great dimensions, employing several thousand men and women. There are 22,000 diamond cutters in Amsterdam and Antwerp, and Mr. Rosenstrauch is prepared to bring out a thousand cutters to train the 500 apprentices. Further development would take place by the establishment of many business firms dealing with polished diamonds such as buyers, sellers and brokers, and the State would benefit by being able to levy taxes on the diamond buyers; it would also encourage large banking business, and considerable sums of money would be turned over and remain in South Africa. These buyers, etc., are at present established in Holland, Belgium, London and America. People who are hostile to the establishment of diamond-cutting industries in South Africa either possess little knowledge of the business, or have personal interests to prevent its development in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosenstrauch said this in his brochure to the Minister of Mines and Industries on the subject. He continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">There is no better place in the world where diamond-cutting can be more suitably established than in South Africa, and this for many reasons, one of which is light, another being that diamonds are produced in the country where they are cut, and the stability and suitability of climatic conditions.</block>

<p>A statement has been made that the light is too strong in South Africa, and that is the sort of tosh we hear being used to prevent the establishment of this trade. The statement goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Most of the diamond dealers, buyers and brokers of cut and polished stones and buyers of rough diamonds would eventually have to come to South Africa. There are 4,000 buyers and brokers in Antwerp alone, and 4,000 in Amsterdam. Ninety per cent. of these men are drawn to Antwerp and Amsterdam from other countries attracted there to buy where the diamonds are cut. These men come from South Africa, India. Japan, China, Australia, America; in fact, all over the world. These buyers congregate in these centres to buy their goods direct at first hand from the polishers. Wherever the diamond-cutting factories are, these buyers must follow. Belgium charges 2 per cent. on all diamonds entering Belgium; South Africa does not levy this tax. It is an attraction for the trade to come to South Africa to escape the tax. If, in South Africa, the diamond cutter can obtain his goods direct from Government at Government prices, and the buyer buys direct from the cutter and polisher, then this would be more lucrative and attractive to the cutter and polisher and buyer, as it excludes the broker or middle man of which there are at least three sets, each engaged in the business in Holland and Belgium.</block>

<p>They have to live on the profits of the industry. Then he goes on to refer to what Germany has done to establish a cutting industry in Germany, and the gist of what he says is that there was no cutting industry in Germany a couple of years before the war, and until the war started the German Government insisted that 30 per cent. of the best quality stones found in their colonies should be imported and remain in Germany for the purpose of encouraging the diamond-cutting industry in Germany. He goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">These stones were available for the German cutters at a price 30 per cent. lower than such stones could be secured by foreign syndicates. The result of this policy was that in less than two years Germany had a diamond-cutting industry employing more than 2,000 cutters, and, if it had not been for the war, Germany to-day would be the diamond-cutting centre of the world. Although Germany today possesses no diamond-producing colonies of her own, nevertheless, they have retained the cutting industry to such an extent that 3,000 cutters are employed to-day and a large number in the German canton of Switzerland. South Africa, which has 80 per cent. of the world&#x2019;s output of finest and largest stones, not only has no diamond factories, but has systematically funked at attempting to establish factories on account of systematic misrepresentation of the facts governing the establishment of cutting in South Africa.</block>

<p>This is Mr. Rosenstrauch&#x2019;s report on diamond cutting, and the feasibility of starting the industry in South Africa. This is the man who we are asking to put up guarantees and who is putting up a large amount of his own money to teach 500 South Africans the trade. The Government has quite sufficient information concerning him. Their factory in Amsterdam which has borne the brunt of many years&#x2019; hard work, has grown as a result of the endeavours of these people, and I would rather take their word than that of the hon. member for Cape Town (Gardens) (Mr. Coulter).</p>

I only want to quote from one other document, and I hope the Minister of Mines will not take exception to my quoting it. I came in touch with this document and I want to say it is unconnected with the department, and I think the House is entitled to have it. In 1924 when the diamond trade was first approached on the question of giving their opinion on the feasibility of diamond cutting in South Africa, speaking as experts, it is interesting to know what De Beers&#x2019; reply was to the Government at that time. This letter was addressed to the Secretary for Mines and Industries at Pretoria, and is dated the 12th November, 1924.</p>

<p>[reading]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">In principle the company is not opposed to a diamond cutting industry in the Union if adequate protection is afforded the producers against illicit diamond buying, as a cutting factory affords the greatest opportunities and facilities for dishonest and irregular practices. Every safeguard, therefore, should be instituted and maintained, to prevent irregular dealings in diamonds. For the reason that such dealings could much more easily be carried on in a producing <span class="col_2377-2378" refersTo="page_1255"/>centre than elsewhere, the company is emphatically opposed to a cutting business being started in Kimberley by any strangers, and if the Government decide to enter into the proposed agreement with Mr. Korbf, the company suggests that the factory be established elsewhere in the colony.</block>

<p>So De Beers Company, which has sucked Kimberley dry like an orange, specifies at this stage that Kimberley must not be brought in the purview of a diamond cutting industry. They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The company would, however, prefer making diamond cutting in the Union a State monopoly, and not license private individuals or corporations to cut, and it is suggested that if the Government definitely decided to establish a cutting factory, they consider the question of embarking on such a venture under State auspices, at any rate, to the extent of the subsidies it is proposed to give to Mr. Korbf.</block>

<p>The company did not favour a contract being entered into by the Government for training apprentices, but the company preferred the whole thing being made a State monopoly. The hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) will have an opportunity of replying whether he would rather see this a State monopoly than that the Government enter into this agreement. The De Beers Company go on to say that, without going into details, the agreement seems to be a scheme for the training of apprentices more than anything else, and that there is no guarantee that, if they become expert cutters, they will secure permanent employment. They state also that after a certain period the probability is that these cutters will be without employment and, therefore, swell the ranks of the poor white. The company also make some comment on Clause 8, which deals with the prices at which the cutter is to be supplied with diamonds for cutting, and Clause 9, which deals with the export of partly cut diamonds. They state that the great objection to the export of partly cut diamonds was that it would encourage theft and facilitate the disposal of illicit diamonds, and that continual supervision over the factory should be exercised by the detective department. I would like to say that these conditions the Minister has observed in this agreement that he has entered into, and, if there is any question of detective supervision being necessary, there is no objection to the Government subsidizing, or the company itself paying the expenses of a detective to be permanently employed on the property. A similar communication was addressed to the Premier Company, and that company said they entirely endorsed what the De Beers Company had already stated, as they are only the left wing of the De Beers Company. They don&#x2019;t put it that way, but that is what it amounts to. A similar communication was also addressed to the Jagersfontein Company, and that company practically endorsed the view put forward by the parent company. It is pretty evident that these questions have been gone into very thoroughly before this agreement was entered into by the Government, and it is also pretty evident from these documents which I have just read that there is no substantial objection to the cutting industry as far as the De Beers Company are concerned. The only objections they have are that the factory should not be established in Kimberley, and, if a cutting industry is established, it should be a State monopoly. Why this Government did not make it a State monopoly, I don&#x2019;t know. They probably have their reasons for the course they adopted. I do not want to go into the question of the partly cut stuff, but expert evidence will be laid before the committee to show that the sawing department, the cleaving department and the polishing department in every factory produces a large amount of small stuff, and that in the training of apprentices&#x2014;and the De Beers Company say that the whole object of this agreement is to train apprentices&#x2014;there is going to be a lot of small stuff unnecessarily cut. It is with the object of meeting that clause in the agreement that the Government came to the assistance of these people by making the conditions a little more easy for them. Coming back once more to the question of the small cutter, I can assure the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) that, as far as the small cutter is concerned, he is not going to be affected one jot or tittle or one iota by this large cutting that is to take place under this agreement. In Belgium and Holland there are a very large number of big diamond cutters to-day, and it is found in actual practice that these big cutters are the people who employ these small cutters in that work. Why should the conditions be different in South Africa?</p>

If that is the only objection of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. Duncan), let me state that this agreement automatically ceases with the first training of 500 apprentices who would at the end of that period be experienced cutters, and the price we are asked to pay is &#x00A3;30,000 for the training of these apprentices, who will be sufficiently equipped at the end of the contract to take over the cutting industry.</p>

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MUNNIK</person>:</from>

<p>The period is five years. The agreement stipulates that at the end of five years the last payment is made. These apprentices have their wages laid down, from the very first year they start working, by the Minister of Labour, on a scale very much larger than is found in any wage determination <span class="col_2379-2380" refersTo="page_1256"/>that we have at the present time. They will receive in the last period of their apprenticeship &#x00A3;5 a week as wages. I submit that that is a very good wage to pay, and that, if at the end of five years, they can produce 500 competent South African boys equipped with a knowledge of diamond cutting in all its branches, which they say they can, the State has got a very good asset for the money we are spending in getting these people out here. But the danger is not in reference to these South African boys. As I said before, the danger is that it is likely that we are going to shift the whole of the venue of the diamond market. If we succeed in bringing the cutting to South Africa, the Minister of Finance will have to cast around for fresh means of revenue and the 10 per cent. tax here, put on to let the diamond cutting come to South Africa, will have functioned. If the agreement goes on, it will also bring with it the jewellers&#x2019; trade that accompanies the cutting industry. The attitude of the trade, as taken up in Antwerp, is, that if this contract is granted, there is not the slightest doubt that the diamond cutting industry will shift from Antwerp to South Africa, and that is one of the reasons why they have imposed the ban on Rosenstrauch&#x2019;s factory in Antwerp. In fact, I have the assurance of Mr. Rosenstrauch that the president of the Diamond Workers&#x2019; Union told him that if they would sign a document not to start in South Africa, the ban would be taken off. The ban is still on that factory. I hope, as the Minister has given us the wink that he is prepared to let this go to the Public Accounts Committee, that the House will not delay the matter unduly. I also hope it will be stated that a report has to be brought up within a definite period. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) is a business man, and I do not think that undue delay would be fair to these people. They have been out for nearly a year, waiting for this agreement to be entered into, or to be turned down. At the present time, they have 1,000 employees out of work as a result of their wanting to come to South Africa, and in fairness to these people, the House should take that into consideration and have this report one way or another as soon as possible. Let us be honest. If we want a diamond cutting industry, and the contract is a good one, let us enter into it and finish with it. If it is not a good one, let it be turned down, but don&#x2019;t keep these people in the expectation that they are to get a contract if they are not going to get it, at serious pecuniary loss to themselves.</p>

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>If there is anyone who might be expected to welcome a proposition instituting diamond cutting on a very large scale in South Africa, I think it is myself. I have been associated with those who, in good report and in bad report, have endeavoured all we could to get diamond cutting established in this country, and it has not been entirely fruitless. I want to give credit here to the hon. Senator Munnik for his great effort in regard to what we have accomplished. I would recall to members the fact that in 1913 Mr. Munnik succeeded in getting a select committee of the Senate, and that committee brought in a recommendation to impose an export duty of 10 per cent. on uncut stones, so that diamond cutting could be established here. We put up a very good fight then, but we failed; we were up against the big people, those who have no sympathy with South Africa whatever. Their interest has been always to bring everything to London, and all we had to do was to produce the rough stuff for them at lowest possible cost here. The subsequent result of our efforts was attained by hard work and sacrifice of time and even money, and it was from a spirit of the utmost loyalty to South Africa that service was undertaken, with no assistance whatever from the great producers of diamonds! Since 1919 the 10 per cent. export duty has been placed on diamonds, and in nine years the amount of diamonds exported has been &#x00A3;76,000,000, and the revenue has benefited by seven and a half million pounds. That is something done in the face of the opposition of those who have so much control, and enjoy such an extraordinary influence with governments. If we had received the support we might reasonably have expected from loyal South Africans, and support from those who cry &#x201C;South Africa first,&#x201D; and if we had obtained the 15 per cent. we wanted, the Minister of Finance of the past Government and the Minister of this Government would have had &#x00A3;4,000,000 more. That respectable sum might have been available for general purposes, and hurt nobody, as it would have been paid to the extent of at least 90 per cent. by rich Americans. When even the smaller export tax was proposed, the hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris), and his friends, wept tears which ran out of their ears even. Talk about &#x201C;sob stuff&#x201D;! The great industry was going to be ruined and all our great millionaires were inevitably to become beggars. Of course, all that rubbish is &#x201C;professional,&#x201D; and I hope this country and the Minister of Mines and Industries have now learned it is merely professional. No thanks a tall then to these men that we have had this 7½ million pounds, but entirely through our own poor, feeble efforts. I think the hon. member for Beaconsfield tried to get Mr. Burton to agree that it should be deemed only a temporary war tax, and would be removed later. It came to stop, I am glad to say, but no assistance from these mining gentlemen. Those who worked and strove and partially succeeded, earned the name of cranks. Well, they were profitable cranks, profitable to the State and profitable indeed to the people of this country. We have had three separate Acts, or amending Acts, to regulate and ostensibly encourage diamond cutting, but in no single instance have local cutters been consulted. I am going to refer to them presently, because they have been referred to in a somewhat contemptuous way by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston). I do not want to recur particularly to what I have mentioned before in the House, namely, Government turning <span class="col_2381-2382" refersTo="page_1257"/>for advice to interested sources. That goes on in the strangest way, although statesmen of the world, including President Woodrow Wilson, have warned governments against it. Ministers have depended for advice on one gentleman brought up and trained in the sanctity of De Beers. He certainly must he an Irish Afrikander, for he has been publicly challenging me to come outside and repeat what I never said inside! I have not answered his challenge in that particular way, because he is usually very well backed by lawyers, and I realize that parliament is the one place democracy has provided for people to tell the truth: to stand up and say what is right without any fear of lawyers. Members can fearlessly state here in courteous language the absolute truth, and it is well that it is so. It is a safeguard democracy should cherish as a precious heritage of freedom. What has astonished me in life is ignorance in high places, and this is well illustrated by a statement made by the Minister of Defence, who I am glad to see in his place looking so well. In September last, at Denver, where he is very well known and greatly respected, dealing with this diamond matter, he said that the 10 per cent. export tax was imposed in order to encourage diamond-cutting, and that it had had no effect. I am convinced that, although he once carried the portfolio of Labour, neither he nor any one of the eleven Ministers have been at the small trouble to go to see what local diamond cutters are doing. They have been invited, but I have never heard of their being interested in, or present at, one of these factories. The whole Government reminds me of a locomotive driver who was up for examination for some accident that had taken place, and his plea was he had been too busy to oil his engine! Ministers are so fully occupied that they have not time to look round and see what is being done. As a matter of fact, not only have they had no consultations with cutters, and have not asked them for advice, but when these men themselves offered advice, and came as a deputation to interview the Minister of Mines and Industries to offer strong objection to the signing of a contract with any particular firm, they received but scant consideration. They stated they had already built up a stable industry on which the restrictions placed upon them had to remain, but an outside firm was now to have privileged treatment in having such restrictions removed. The deputation reported that the Minister was not sympathetic. I am sorry these struggling men did not even get cheap sympathy. In nine years they have established eight factories, and one of those establishments, scorned as small by the hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik), has turned over &#x00A3;100,000 a year in cut stones. Some people who are now rolling in wealth started for Kimberley with a carpet-bag. Wealth and institutions grow. One little factory has over 30 employees, and will shortly have 50. Have these people not their rights? They are South Africans. An hon. member says they have been South Africans for only a comparatively short time, but anyway they risked starting here. Why do not these contract-seekers come over with their advertised 1,000 cutters? After enterprising cutters establish themselves, and the American demand for their cut gems becomes better than it was at first, the word is passed from Antwerp, and perhaps Amsterdam, to get busy and try to pick up this wonderful chance for a contract. The Minister says that others had the opportunity. Was there ever any intimation to that effect from government? Never. Ministers dropped into the political soothing system, which kept them quiet for nearly four years, and if they do not look out smartly they may again be kept dangling in the air for some time, say another couple of years. Always there has been influence at work to prevent diamond cutting in the Union. The reason why the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer), and those overseas whom he represents, do not wish to see cutting here is perfectly plain. [Interruption.] Well, if they wanted to see it established here, they could have had it themselves years ago. Every stone cut in South Africa escapes the big combine, and the combine wants to secure all our diamonds at the very lowest possible price. Cutters can afford to pay more for suitable stones than the combine. This monopoly contract (for which we have been kept waiting nearly four years), is the result of a promise of the Minister of Defence, and his colleague, the Minister of Labour, at Kimberley, and after all these years they are beginning to worry whether, at a general election, awkward questions may be asked. So Antwerp is encouraged to put in this precious contract. There is really nothing to prevent Messrs. Rosenstrauch coming along and taking their ordinary chance with anybody else, but they do not. They are proclaimed to be the &#x201C;second biggest cutting firm in the world, with a thousand persons working for them,&#x201D; and South African cutters did not trouble them at all. Now they want to snatch this big and valuable concession. They are to put up a guarantee of at least &#x00A3;10,000. Amsterdam and Antwerp, employing between them 20,000 to 25,000 cutters, and earning at least five millions a year, may deem it would pay them to carry on the bluff&#x2014;again take in these innocent Ministers and say, &#x201C;We are now sending more substantial men to deal with you.&#x201D; Amsterdam and Antwerp would willingly pay &#x00A3;10,000 penalty not to put up a factory in South Africa at all. The trusting innocence of our Ministers is indeed most touching. We don&#x2019;t offer to put anybody else on the same footing as we do Rosenstrauch and Korbf in this contract. I admit that what Mr. Rosenstrauch says is quite correct&#x2014;that if diamond cutting were established here on a large scale, the big men in the trade would come out to South Africa. That might have the very considerable effect of bringing out the aristocrats of the trade to reside here, instead of controlling the diamond industry from London. It was the hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris), who recently said that posterity would suffer punishment for our present-day democracy; but, at any rate, we can evidently now call in the aristocracy of the north <span class="col_2383-2384" refersTo="page_1258"/>to redress the balance of democracy in the south. We might have Lord Bessborough, even perhaps a duke or two, and other aristocrats living here! When we analyze the agreement we find that it is drawn in such a loose way that it does not ensure the carrying out of the end we desire to achieve. It states one thing very clearly&#x2014;that Government is desirous of encouraging the establishment of &#x201C;a&#x201D; diamond-cutting industry in the Union. Is that one favoured industry meant to destrop existing diamond-cutting factories? If not, why does the Government not say, &#x201C;Here are our terms, available to all, and we will give a bonus to every firm that trains apprentices.&#x201D; If I may venture to give unasked-for advice, for which I also, like another and greater advisor, make no charge, I would recommend the Government to simply fix a 15 per cent. export duty on rough diamonds and have no more bother about it. Let this be done, taking off the extra-extraordinary restrictions on the cutting of diamonds in South Africa, and a thousand cutters would soon be at work in South Africa, without any difficulty and without any financial responsibility on the Government. That is the way other and wiser countries encourage the establishment of industry. They fix the amount of protection they are prepared to grant, and let all comers enjoy it. Here, however, we invent most unnecessary and restrictive complications. The agreement should be submitted to a commission, but when I asked for that to deal with all diamond matters, the Government refused, and the Opposition walked out of the House.</p>

<speech by="#hay">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>It was so, only one of your party remained to take part in the division. I can understand the Minister of Mines, who has got the diamond business into a terrible mess, not desiring a commission. He is now going to allow a differential duty, and I would dearly like to know how this &#x201C;nigger in the wood pile&#x201D; got in? It was obviously introduced by some exceedingly clever person to be able to give the Government an excuse for not dealing honourably by cutters, and to enable Ministers to say, &#x201C;We have given cutters this special advantage,&#x201D; one which has never been asked for by any of them. Strange discrimination indeed. The diamond cutters already at work in South Africa merely ask to be allowed to carry on their business in a businesslike way; they wish to be allowed to buy and to cut and to ship as they choose; and be it borne in mind that cutters come under exactly the same strict supervision as buyers or producers. I wonder who put in that &#x201C;nigger in the wood pile&#x201D;! The differential export rate will cause tremendous trouble. Was this inserted then to keep going that family party of expert trappers of Kimberley so that they can hold diamond cutters under their fingers and thumbs all the time? I could tell the Minister some things about that wonderful and expensive department which might even amaze him. They want everybody connected with the diamond trade to be in the position of the toad under the harrow. The diamond cutters of South Africa are honest men&#x2014;just as honest as anybody else, even Ministers. They ask for no favours, and appeal to the Government only for opportunity of carrying on their occupation honestly for the benefit of themselves and of the country. They are South Africans, and genuinely for &#x201C;South Africa first.&#x201D; Whoever put these differential rates into the agreement is a very much cleverer man than the Minister of Mines, clever as I know him to be. The differential rates put cutters in the miserable position of having to be treated differently from everybody else, when all they say is, &#x201C;Take away the red tape you have specially wound round us and give us a chance of living properly, like the buyers and everybody else; why select us for stupid restrictions hampering our operations?&#x201D; Plainly the advisor who got this differential x 5 per cent. clause inserted has no good wish to encourage the industry. The existing cutters are content to pay the usual export duty of 10 per cent. if they are only allowed to ship what they buy and don&#x2019;t cut, and unwanted portions of diamonds already cut. They ask for fair-play, and no favours. If we had had a proper inquiry into it all, I am perfectly certain they would have made their case quite good. Why also give these new people the right of bringing out their workers with free second-class steamer accommodation and free railway passage and all sorts of gifts like that? Those who have been building up the industry had no such aid, and if you give them the same chance they could get out cutters quite easily. Because these favoured contractors are substantial gentlemen from Antwerp, all these good things are added to the inducement. I am perfectly certain that if Ministers think seriously of what is allowed them to export in proportion to what they cut, Government will need to double its detective department and have endless trouble. The hon. Minister declines to assist the diggers because he is afraid of putting up money. Why then does he not put the whole thing on a firm economic protective basis? I plead with the Ministers, notwithstanding their assurances to Kimberley, that they should reconsider matters. Surely these &#x201C;sacred promises&#x201D; need not dwell on the consciences of Ministers when they remember that the Minister of Finance has now put them all &#x201C;on side&#x201D; as they say in football. They are only bound by his promises, and he made none. The pledged Ministers are therefore quite all right. We humbler politicians envy him in that he did not need to make any promises for his uncontested seat. I ask the Government seriously not to sacrifice 500 of our bright boys and girls by sending them to Kimberley. There is only one subsidiary industry in that place, and it is always kept going, that is the trapping for I.D.B. De Beers Company, which rules there is not in favour of diamond cutting; it has always consistently opposed it. What then would be the effect of setting up a factory there? It would be subjecting 500 boys and girls to the greatest possible temptation. Some of these young people may be tempted into borrowing money, or incurring debt, and then they are inevitably going <span class="col_2385-2386" refersTo="page_1259"/>to fall easy victims to the persuasive &#x201C;trap&#x201D; for illicit diamond buying. Kimberley, apart from its unsuitable climatic conditions, is a dreadful place to think of sending these young people to. These &#x201C;trapped&#x201D; boys and girls will be sacrificed on the promises of unthinking Ministers. If we must start the industry by this contract, take the young apprentices to Potchefstroom where they will be freer from such temptation. The hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer), and the hon. member for Beaconsfield (Col. Sir David Harris), will, with tears running from their eyes say, &#x201C;What did we tell you? you would cut diamonds here, and now half a dozen apprentices are in prison." It is a mistake of unbusinesslike men to take these unfortunate youngsters and stick them down in the heart of a diamond-productive area.</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t say where, and I am not pleading for Pretoria, a suitable centre; I only plead to strike out Kimberley. I have nothing against Kimberley itself except its miserable surroundings, its spying system and its autocratic methods. Without going into this contract further, I ask the Minister of Defence to ask the Minister of Labour, who is certainly a practical labour man and a trade unionist, what he thinks of bringing out 40 craftsmen to train 500 apprentices in five years. Trade unions, I thought, most carefully limit the proportion of apprentices to the number of artisans employed. Some, I believe, permit only one apprentice to four journeymen. Is this contract not totally opposed to all trade union principles, and I understood that our party really stood for trade union principles, at all events in the past. The Minister of Mines in London, referring to Canada, said that Canadians had confidence in their own country and in their leaders. May I tell him as far as South Africa is concerned, we appear not to have confidence either in our country or in our leaders. The reason is plain.

I had said at Denver, in addressing my constituents, that there had been a 10 per cent. export duty put on, but it had had no effect. I was sitting at the feet of Gamaliel in this matter.

<p>Those were the words&#x2014;character or reputation. I just want to refer a little bit to the history of this matter. This particular enterprize of diamond cutting has had the attention of this House and the country on a very large number of occasions in the last 10 years. On one side of the House, and among many of us, there has been the continual urgency to do something definite, to get along and get some real step forward in establishing something substantial in the way of a diamond cutting industry in this country. The Government, supported by hon. members opposite who preceded us, I remember, had the celebrated contract with Mr. &#x201C;X&#x201D; in 1919 which was referred to a committee. Under that contract it would have been possible to have had a diamond cutting industry on a reasonably large scale at that time. In face of the opinion, and particularly the opinion of hon. members opposite, especially the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), who criticized it very severely, that was turned down. A 10 per cent. export tax was put on, and that was relied on. During the time that 10 per cent. export tax had been in operation, very little progress indeed has been made in the expansion of any diamond cutting industry in this country practically until the fact of this contract became known, and then, for some unexplained reason, a very considerable freshet seemed to take place in diamond cutting establishments.</p>

It is common knowledge that anyone embarking in establishing diamond cutting on anything like a substantial scale in this country must be prepared for very serious opposition both in his front, in his flank and in his rear.

<p>Certainly not. Every fully cut and polished diamond leaving this country pays not a penny of duty, whether it is produced under the terms of this agreement or any other. I am sure you will find that this proposal of ours is really a step forward, and a substantial step forward, towards establishing what, on all hands, at one time or another, has been admitted as a most desirable development in this country, that we shall have a really substantial diamond cutting industry. I do not know that there is any reason why we have to enter into a contract with everyone who comes along. Our object is to establish, on a reasonably large scale, something that will give a real impetus for a limited term of years, to give a move in this diamond cutting industry. The whole thing is temporary, but it is a real step forward in establishing this industry on a reasonably large scale, which some hon. members over there have occasionally talked about as desirable, but which very few have really desired in their hearts. We believe every single industry that can be established in this country which, with temporary assistance, can subsequently become self-supporting, is an advance in the field of occupation and a real movement forward of the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>I beg to second the further amendment. There has been so much elaboration and exaggeration in discussing this contract with Mr. Rosenstrauch and his company, that I am delighted that the measure has been referred to the Select Committee on Public Accounts. Otherwise it might have taken up a considerable amount of my time to refute all the arguments and bogies that are generally brought forward when diamond questions are being discussed in this House. I agree with the latter part of the speech by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) in endeavouring to protect those diamond buyers who first established the industry in this country, and who are not going to be blotted out, but in my opinion damaged, if this contract goes through, because although the Minister of Mines and Industries told the House they would not be injured in the slightest possible way, I do not think he was studying the matter very materially, because under the contract you are practically giving a bounty to those who say they intend to erect a big diamond cutting factory, and the others who have been established for a very long time will have no consideration at all; so you are differentiating between them, and the new man whom you are rewarding and giving a concession. He is undoubtedly going to use it in the markets of Europe, to see how much he can make out of it. In my opinion, it is not fair to these other men.</p>

<p>They will be able to undersell them, because it costs them less. They are getting a bounty. I see it perfectly well. There is a certain part of the speech of the hon. member for Pretoria (West) with which I do not agree. If his speeches were as full of truth as they are of sarcasm, they would be much more reliable. He referred to the sobs and tears of those who are interested in diamonds when the 10 percent. duty was imposed. Of course, that is an exaggeration. The sobs from men of that character are crocodile tears, but when you have the tears of the poor, who are taken in by company-mongers with bogus shares, those are the tears that hurt. The preamble of the speech by the hon. member for Vredefort (Mr. Munnik) was mostly an attack upon the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Coulter). He indulged in an attack of a virulent character because the hon. member, in a practical and able manner, criticized the legal part of this proposed agreement. But the hon. member for Vredefort blossomed out into a counsel for Messrs. Rosenstrauch and Korbf. He seemed to be inspired by them. He asked the hon. member for Gardens what he expected to get out of it, and how he was to be rewarded for the speech he made, but I might, with some justice, ask the hon. member for Vredefort what he expects to get from Messrs. Rosenstrauch and Korbf if this goes through. This agreement which has to be ratified by Parliament, was very low down in the paper until about last Friday. I thought the Government would never bring it forward. I think they had good cause for not bringing it forward. It was suddenly advanced to first place on the paper. It was a very speedy promotion. There must be some reason. The Government must have been very long in doubt as to the desirability of asking Parliament to ratify this agreement, and I think they are still in doubt, and well they might be, but at last they have taken the plunge and have brought this agreement forward for ratification by Parliament. Circumstances have come to their notice since they first negotiated with Messrs. Rosenstrauch and Korbf which must have proved to them&#x2014;I will not mince matters&#x2014;that this firm is not of good repute. I say that advisedly. No doubt long discussions have taken place between Ministers, and they have had diverse opinions with regard to the advisability of having any connection with this firm, but they have been forced by the people of Kimberley, one or some of whom have been promised directorships in this concern, if this thing goes through. I say without hesitation that the Government, when they found out their mistake <span class="col_2391-2392" refersTo="page_1262"/>in making this agreement, should have taken their courage in both hands, come to this House and said, &#x201C;We have made a mistake, and we cannot advise this House to ratify this agreement.&#x201D; Unless they can arrange with some well-known reputable firm to take over this contract for establishing a cutting and polishing industry, the thing will be a failure and do more harm than good for the future of the diamond cutting industry. If you enter into an agreement with a firm which is &#x201C;out on the make&#x201D;&#x2014;I shall put it that way&#x2014;rather than encourage the diamond cutting industry&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not see how Messrs. Rosenstrauch &amp; Korbf can establish a genuine diamond-cutting industry under terms of the agreement. I do not think they intend to do so. They look upon it as a concession and intend to hawk it, for profit, in the markets of Europe. It is nothing but a speculative venture, and the cutting and polishing is a side line. If the Government and the House enter into the contract, the main business of these people will be to export partly manufactured stones, and deprive the treasury of a large amount of revenue, and increasing the difficulties of the mining companies. The mining companies, I may say, have never been opposed to the establishment of a diamond-cutting industry carried on sound, legitimate and business-like lines&#x2014;but they disagree with the present methods. I think I should better inform the House of the position of the diamond companies if I read portion of the speech of the chairman of De Beers at the last annual meeting.</p>

<from>&#x2020; Col. Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DAVID HARRIS</person>:</from>

<p>I was the chairman. I have come from a sick bed and have not had time to make sufficient notes. These remarks were well-considered and made after discussion with some of his colleagues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">The feeling that the big mining companies are opposed to the establishment of a cutting and polishing industry in this country still exists in spite of the offer made by the company, through its chairman, who presided at the annual meeting of shareholders in 1919. As you may have forgotten what I said on that occasion, I will refresh your memories by repeating that &#x201C;portion of my speech: &#x201C;The question of establishing a cutting and polishing industry in this country has been ventilated and discussed for some years, but nothing has been done, even by the loudest and strongest of its advocates. Speaking for the company as producers having to find money for wages, mining supplies, railway rates, etc., we are compelled to sell our diamonds for immediate cash, and, therefore, cannot embark on an undertaking necessitating long-term credits as is customary in the polished trade. Moreover, we are far distant from the recognized markets for brilliants. We sell all our rough diamonds in Kimberley for cash against delivery, and it would be very risky if we ventured upon an industry that would deprive us of a portion of our ready-money sales. It should also be remembered that the management of an up-to-date cutting factory requires a highly qualified and experienced staff to properly and successfully supervize the work, which is very technical, and in the case of expensive and irregular shape stones, is of a most difficult and delicate nature. <i>We</i> are, therefore, not prepared to establish a cutting factory in connection with our mining operations. The producer of wool, whose industry is much older than ours, have not manufactured cloth; in fact, nearly all raw materials and ores grown or won in this country are exported to the best of the world&#x2019;s markets. <i>We</i> claim the same right to realize our product to the greatest advantage. We receive no consideration from the Government; on the contrary, our shareholders are more highly taxed than those interested in any other business or investment. Scarcely a year passes without extra burdens being placed on the diamond mines in the form of additional taxation; yet, we are expected to establish and carry on a venture which may react detrimentally upon this company, although the demand for brilliants in this country does not amount to &#x00A3;100,000 per annum. However, the company has decided to erect in Kimberley a cutting factory, equipped with electric power, containing 100 mills. These will be let to approved persons on very reasonable terms to encourage them to cut and polish diamonds. I may inform you that the diamond syndicate is quite prepared to assist by influencing important manufacturers to transfer a portion of their work to South Africa. The difficulty of establishing polishing here is, however, increased by the reported action of the guilds in Amsterdam and Antwerp, who have prohibited their members from working at their trade in South Africa, as they are anxious, and appear determined, to retain for their own country an industry which has existed there for centuries. Whether these difficulties can be overcome remains to be seen. Be that as it may, the opportunity for making brilliants here will be provided by De Beers. What the outcome will be is for the future to disclose.&#x201D; Eight years have elapsed since that proposal was made, and during the whole of that period we did not receive one application for the hiring of mills. What we do take the strongest objection to is the right given to any licensed diamond cutter to enter our sorting department and legally demand to <span class="col_2393-2394" refersTo="page_1263"/>purchase the pick of our production really at a price below that paid by the trade in Europe. Under the Diamond Cutting Act of 1919, and the amendment to that Act of 1927, any foreign adventurer holding a cutter&#x2019;s licence has free access to our office to handle our best diamonds and select those he desires to purchase. This is manifestly unfair, as it provides a danger which must be palpable to anybody acquainted with our methods of handling and sorting diamonds. De Beers alone is a big industry, established over 40 years, employing over 8,000 human beings extracting blue grounds from 3,600 feet below the surface, requiring skilful and experienced mining, electrical and mechanical engineers, besides underground surveyors and numerous other professional men, and which has taken many years to organize to produce diamonds on highly scientific and up-to-date methods, which would be at the mercy of any continental speculator who obtained a diamond cutter&#x2019;s licence. The four big mining companies, with a combined capital of forty millions sterling, could have their industry unsettled and their diamonds made difficult to sell, by a few enterprising and smart aliens out to make money regardless of, and indifferent to, the effect their manipulations would have on a very important paramount industry. Gentlemen, this is not an overdrawn picture; the facts I have enumerated will be apparent to those who study the Diamond Cutting Acts. Anybody who wishes to carry on a legitimate diamond cutting industry can do so without being nursed and spoon-fed by the Government. They can export finished polished diamonds free of duty, while the producers have to pay 10 per cent. export duty on the rough. There is a big open market for alluvial diamonds where cutters can easily purchase their requirements without selecting the cream of the diamonds produced from the mines. If they cannot profitably establish cutting under these most favourable conditions, if these advantages are not sufficient, then this country would be better without it, for the damage to the paramount industry would be far greater than any benefit that could be derived from a highly-protected and mothered cutting and polishing industry. The Government has concluded an agreement with Messrs. Rosenstrauch &amp; Korbf for the establishment of a cutting and polishing industry in the Union. If this agreement is ratified by Parliament it will become a Government concession, and the signatories will be free to sell it at a profit to a company or syndicate prepared to provide the large capital necessary to carry out its conditions. I have no doubt that this will be the first step that these gentlemen will take. If they do not succeed in forming a company willing to subscribe the large sum necessary to fulfil the provisions of the contract, then I presume that Rosenstrauch and Korbf will carry out the terms themselves. Under the agreement certain partly manufactured stones can be exported for two years on payment of a duty of 2½ per cent. Now a partly manufactured stone need only have one facet, which would cost about 6d. to make. Exporting a one carat stone worth &#x00A3;14 would cost Messrs. Rosenstrauch and Korbf 7s. 6d.&#x2014;6d. for polishing one facet, and 7s. export duty&#x2014;while De Beers and others who have all the work and trouble in producing diamonds pay 28s. on the same sized stone. During the first five years of the agreement, if carried out, it is, in my opinion, quite possible for the concessionaries to make a greater aggregate profit out of the export of partly manufactured stones than from the finished polished article. There are to-day a few cutting concerns in the Union which commenced in a small way, and have gradually increased their operations, being quite satisfied with the advantage they enjoy in exporting completely finished brilliants free from export duty. The Rosenstrauch &amp; Korbf agreement should be based on the same lines. They could easily buy all their rough in the open South African market without being invested with the legal right to select the best and most saleable diamonds from mining companies and probably exporting them in a partly manufactured state to be finished by their continental connections either in Antwerp or Amsterdam. If the Government had entered into a simple agreement on the lines I have indicated, there would not be the slightest opposition, but we cannot support an industry founded on conditions that would act detrimentally on ourselves. The mines are the root of the whole industry; if you injure the root of the tree you damage its branches. If the Government is not careful it may encourage the erection of bastard factories on the graves of old-established, legitimate and paramount industries.</block>

<p>I hope I have convinced the House that the diamond companies are not opposed to the establishment of a legitimate cutting industry in South Africa. We never have been. What would farmers think if every dealer in produce had the legal right to go to their farms and purchase at the market price the pick of their fruit, cattle, horses and mules, and leave the farmers with the balance to dispose of as best they could. However, I suppose that as the Government is going to work the Namaqualand diamond fields, it will be able to supply these gentlemen with all the stones they require. At the some time the Government is placing the diamond industry in jeopardy. The Government cannot inquire into the standing, position and past of every person who applies for a diamond-cutting licence The holder of such a licence will have a free entry into the company&#x2019;s diamond room and be able to finger 1,000,000 worth of diamonds, and we shall not be protected in any way. That is unfair. The diamond cutters and merchants overseas buy the stones in competition with one another, and the producers in this country benefit by that competition. Why should not the South African cutters go into the market and buy their requirements at the market price? If they <span class="col_2395-2396" refersTo="page_1264"/>did the alluvial diggers, who complain that there is not sufficient competition amongst the buyers, will benefit. The small men, for whom this socialistic House has no sympathy, find no difficulty in getting diamonds from the producers. When, however, these adventurers come in they will make as much trouble as they possibly can for the diamond producer. What is the present position? The producers of diamonds do all the work, pay an export duty of 10 per cent., but the person who erects a small cutting factory can export these stones free of duty. The four principal diamond producers in South Africa represent a capital of &#x00A3;40,000,000, and they employ about 17,000 people, but directly and indirectly 100,000 people depend on the industry. Yet we are going to jeopardize the whole of that industry for the benefit of a firm of which we know very little, but later on the select committee will know a great deal about them, for I shall place certain documents before the committee which will surprise them. The Government should have been aware of these documents, and it should have found out the past character of these people in the same way as an engineer sees that he has a good foundation on which to build. Mistakes have been made with regard to foundations in this country before, so I suppose the Government must be excused if it made a mistake in not enquiring into the antecedents of this firm.</p>

<p>I know it is very difficult to talk on this subject, and I am glad that the Minister of Mines has consented to the Bill being referred to a select committee. In that way the people who are cutting diamonds to-day will have an opportunity of giving evidence. It looks as if the Minister of Mines attaches much importance to getting the matter through the House as soon as possible. I think we ought to be careful, because the Minister will remember just as well as I, how, in the past, in the South African republic, we had difficulties with all the concession mongers who went to the Government and said they wanted to push the country ahead, and asked for concessions. The Minister knows what difficulties subsequent Governments had in getting rid of those concession holders. Now the Government asks for certain privileges to be given to a particular group of people. They are the people who will come here to provide 500 young South Africans with work, although there are already people engaged in diamond-cutting in our country. The Minister said in October last that there were not eight small diamond cutters in the country, but I can assure him that there are more than eight today. There are various people in Johannesburg who have taken up the matter. There are cutters in Johannesburg who turn our very beautiful diamonds, and they have been employing young South Africans as well. Why then should we get people from abroad who will cut diamonds under a Government subsidy and train up cutters when we already have people in the country who are doing it without a subsidy. I think that if these local cutters go on in this way, then in five years&#x2019; time they will employ more than 500 young people which this company, according to the contract, is going to train. I think the Minister should not deal with the matter so hurriedly. The hon. member for Beaconsfield (Sir David Harris) pointed out what great difficulties were connected with the establishment of such an industry. I am not in favour of no diamonds being cut here. I do not go so far, e.g., as De Beers, who do not want such an industry to be established here, but I am more in favour of encouraging the people who have already made a start here with this industry. Anyone can see in Johannesburg to-day how they are working there and are employing young people, and the number is increasing every day. I cannot see why at Government cost we should benefit people to the detriment of other people who have already started the industry. The hon. member for Pretoria West (Mr. Hay) said that the local cutters who went to the Minister were not received in quite a friendly way by the Minister. I am sorry to hear it, but now they will be properly received by the select committee of this House. I do not know whether the date, 30th April, which is mentioned in the amendment, is sufficient time to take all the evidence. The Minister must beware of those pocket patriots and the speculators who have caused us so much trouble in the past. I am astonished that the present Minister of Mines is submitting this contract to the House. Was that the reason why possibly the Minister of Defence had to take it over? Let the Minister beware of those speculators who hover over the Government like a lot of vultures. Now we are rid of them, and let us try to encourage the people who started the business on their own initiative. I noticed in Johannesburg that quite a number already have little cutting shops, and quite a number of Johannesburg lads are learning cutting there. I am certain that the number will increase. Let us look well into it, and the select committee, when it hears the people, will certainly make a different proposal seeing the present contract is not in the interests of South Africa. Let us rather take the &#x00A3;30,000 for use in the drought-stricken areas. It is unnecessary to pay the &#x00A3;30,000 when we have people who are establishing diamond cutting without grants.</p>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) will have the effect of removing the power from the hands of the Minister in certain circumstances. He moves the deletion of two clauses in the Public Health Act, 100 and 102, in other words, he wants to curtail the powers of the Minister to that extent, so that in the event of an epidemic or a case of contact, the Minister should have no power to enforce vaccination. Though I feel, personally, that we owe a certain amount of gratitude to the hon. member for bringing to the notice of the House certain events which have occurred in Europe during the last few years, I think his conclusion is entirely overdrawn and, consequently, erroneous. I think there is no body more capable of judging of the effect that vaccination had in Europe and of the results of the disease which has recently appeared in Europe than the Health Committee of the League of Nations, and I think if this House were to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) we should be committing an error which will not only be a blur on this House, but which will have effects so far-reaching that we cannot to-day see the end of them. I know the hon. member is quite consistent. He has no faith in vaccination, and he will endeavour, as far as he is able, to remove that power from the hands of any responsible authority. Before <span class="col_2401-2402" refersTo="page_1267"/>this House can proceed to the extent of the suggestion of the hon. member, I want to read to hon. members the findings of the League of Nations Health Committee, and to show the effects of non-vaccination. I refer the hon. member and the House to page 139 of the last report of the committee, which was in session in November and December of last year. Here is the result&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">In 1921 there were nearly 20,000 cases of small pox in Europe outside Spain, Great Britain and the Union of Soviet Republics. In 1926 there were less than 600 cases.</block>

<p>The increases in small pox in England and Wales are demonstrated by the tables on the next page. In 1927 the incidence of small pox in England and Wales was practically doubled, and we know that of the European countries England and Wales is the country which is characterized by the conscience clause. I think with these facts before us, we cannot, by any means, with any sense of responsibility, accept the amendment of the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander). The second argument is that in regard to post vaccination, a kind of meningitis. Again I must refer the House to the report of the same committee of the League of Nations than which committee there can be no more responsible body for guidance. We find it on page 167. We find that in spite of vaccination having been practised in Europe for practically a century and a half, this disease only appeared in the year 1901 and, after that, in 1924. In England and Wales it appeared for the first time in 1922 and in Holland in 1924. For a century and a half not a single instance occurred. For fully half a century scientists have devoted their attention to this particular disease. That it is not the result of vaccination is sufficiently demonstrated by the leading doctor in Europe. [Extract read.] For the years 1922 to 1927 only some eight cases occurred in Holland, and about the same number in England. In the six years in the whole of Europe only 250 cases of this disease appeared. For these reasons I want to warn the House against the effect of the amendment of the hon. member for Hanover Street. We must draw the inevitable conclusion that we have been delivered from these serious diseases by vaccination during the last half century.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oost">

<from>&#x2020; *Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OOST</person>:</from>

<p>I think that we who are not experts in this matter, but have a sufficiently responsible feeling, ought to be thankful to the hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) for the explanation of the matter, but I wish to have information from the Minister on certain points. The hon. member for Hopetown raised a very important point. He mentioned that in consequence of the small pox vaccination, i.e., what I believe what we call vaccination, 250 cases of encephalitis occurred in Europe. I have a report here from a Dutch expert, Dr. T. van Heelsbergen, of Utrecht, who is apparently a great specialist in such diseases, and he says that quite possibly cases of encephalitis had occurred previously as a result of vaccination, but they did not attract attention. Although he is a supporter of vaccination, he, nevertheless, thinks that a thorough investigation should first be made, and he agrees with the Netherlands Representative Assembly, which decided that provisionally no compulsory vaccination should be continued, although for many years it was obligatory. Therefore, I want information from the Minister. I have a friend who is a specialist in this department and I remember now that that friend treated various cases of deadly encephalitis, especially in children. I never heard him say that it was the result of vaccination against small pox, but, perhaps he did not know it at the time. I want to ask the Minister whether his department has yet instituted an enquiry into the consequences of vaccination. As I have said, I, as a layman, remember that that specialist treated several cases of encephalitis, but though only a layman I still have the duty to ask the Minister whether an investigation was made, seeing that in Europe serious study has been engaged in, and it has been scientifically laid down that some cases of encephalitis are caused by vaccination. If the Department has made an investigation I am satisfied, but if not, then I must say that I am disappointed in his department, as I have often been in the past. Before I make up my mind on the matter, I want more information. It has been said here that vaccination may cause various kinds of diseases. I have a book here on the vaccination question which states that 279 cases of diseases with fatal results were established as a result of vaccination against small pox in England in the years 1886-&#x2019;91; they were various kinds of diseases, syphilis, of which five cases are mentioned here, and various other diseases. Encephalitis is not even mentioned, because, although the book was published in 1926, it was possibly not yet known. The matter is of such importance that we require more information, especially as our native population is 5,000,000, who cannot themselves decide whether vaccination is necessary or not. If the native is given an opportunity of saying that he does not want to be vaccinated, he will not have it done. We therefore have greater responsibility than possibly any other country in the world. I should also like to know from the Minister: suppose that we laid down that encephalitis is caused by vaccination, or the Minister has the power under the law of taking steps to stop vaccination or to suspend it for a time. It seems to me that that is not the case. Then the question is whether it is advisable to give the power. It is, however, of great importance because encephalitis, as far as I know, nearly always is fatal.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hope-town says that half the cases are fatal. That is a frightful mortality. If the disease is really the result of vaccination the Minister must have the power to stop or suspend vaccination until further enquiry is made, e.g., for six months or for so long as may be necessary.</p>

<p>I would like to have an opportunity of explaining my amendments. I am voicing a large number of people who have asked me to put their views before the House. The people of Holland have always been in favour of compulsory vaccination, but when this terrible fact was brought to light, that some of the most horrible diseases were spread as a result of vaccination, they have stopped compulsory vaccination for a time in Holland. My amendment is simply to carry the section to its logical conclusion, so that the exemption shall apply not only to ordinary cases, but under Section 100, which deals with epidemics, and Section 102, dealing with the inmates of an institution as well, because if you are going to allow the ordinary man who applies under the safeguards of the clause to be exempted, why compel a man who is in a Government institution, although he may be a conscientious objector? If a man, applies under Section 10, a certificate should be supplied to him. When the amendment came up last year, there were resolutions and telegrams from the Anti-vaccination League, which is a very strong body, and members of the Christian Science Church objected very strongly to compulsory vaccination in the case of conscientious objectors. Protests against compulsory vaccination were made in 1927 by the Pretoria, East London, Durban and Cape Town Christian Science Churches. There is a very strong body of public opinion, especially in Natal, against compulsory vaccination. According to a message from the Hague to the &#x201C;Christian Science Monitor&#x201D; a Bill was introduced into the Netherlands Assembly providing for the cancellation of the three years&#x2019; compulsory vaccination law for children, because cases of encephalitis, which had proved fatal, had been traced to vaccination. Dr. van Heelsbergen pointed out that during the last four years these cases had increased to such an extent that the connection between vaccination and encephalitis could no longer be denied. Dr. James Macintosh, Professor of Pathology at the University of London, in a presidential address to the section of Pathology of the Royal Society of Medicine on October 19th, 1926, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">There is now only one human disease, i.e., small pox, in which the injection of the living virus is still widely used to procure an immunity. &#x2026; Scientifically, it cannot be disputed that from every point of view the injection of virus, capable of multiplying in the body of the individual, is bad. It has recently been shown that nervous disabilities (meningo-encephalo-myelitis, etc.) may follow vaccination, either as a direct effect or as a sequel to the lowering of the general resistance of the body &#x2026; Who knows for how long an attenuated bacillus can lie dormant and then assume its former virulence?</block>

<p>&#x201C;The Lancet &#x201D; of January 29th, 1927, speaks of the popular distaste of vaccination and remarks&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">If we could be certain that small pox will remain mild in character it would probably be wise to let it run its course unchecked. &#x2026; Vaccination at the age of six months inflicts an infectious disease on a child at a time when its digestive mechanism is being rapidly modified. It is time that alternatives were fully discussed, one of these being to abandon universal vaccination altogether in favour of the effective treatment of contacts in the face of epidemic.</block>

<p>I regret that the last speaker introduced the name of a distinguished physician into this debate, because no medical man in his senses would have written what is attributed to him in regard to the injection of virus into the body. In the early days there was innoculation of the virus from the body of one human being to another, but that has been abandoned for decades. Small pox has been stamped out on the Continent of Europe by means of vaccination. Those best qualified to investigate the results of vaccination have a right to speak on the subject, and if we decline to accept their conclusions there can be no argument, but if we are prepared to advance we will agree that only fools buy their experience. If we can devize a method of procedure by which we can safeguard the human race against the ravages of small pox, let us endeavour to do so. The hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander), or some other hon. member, proposed that our Government should do something similar and appoint a committee of experts to investigate the matter. But why shut our eyes to the inevitable consequences of the laxity which must follow if we accept the amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street). If we have nothing better than that, then I would suggest we accept the best we have. It would be an unpardonable error for the future of South Africa to accept this increasing laxity. Apart from that, it has been said that encephalitis is the unavoidable result of vaccination. I have statistics that show that out of 27,000 cases which were vaccinated, there was not one single case of encephalitis. If 100 per cent. of the members of this House were vaccinated, the only individual who will suffer is the one with virus in his body. We shall be acting unwisely and foolishly if we remove the power which the Government has to-day, if we commit the future destinies of this country to a certain number of people who, in spite of conscientious objection, avoid their responsibilities, and their responsibility is this&#x2014;that they must learn by experience to take the necessary measures to safeguard against it.</p>

<p>The Free State had the same, and we never heard of these inevitable consequences up to the time of Union. For every eminent outstanding medical man who can prove vaccination is efficactious against small pox, some of the world&#x2019;s best medical men can prove that vaccination has not only not proved efficacious, but is positively harmful. Some few years ago proprietors of the Encyclopaedia Britannica selected one of the greatest authorities on vaccination to write a thesis in the ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and that medical gentleman went into the whole history of vaccination. He said that he started from the beginning and worked on it for two or three years and finally came to the conclusion that vaccination had not been proved. He wrote a report which appeared in the ninth edition and which is a condemnation of vaccination, and that was written by one of the greatest experts on vaccination. Naturally the medical fraternity protested against it, and if you look at the tenth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica you will see an orthodox statement of the position. All I ask for is liberty of action. If the hon. member wants to be vaccinated, I do not take steps to stop him, and if I do not want to be vaccinated he must allow me to please myself. If he has faith in vaccination, as far as he is concerned, how can it be harmful to him if I do not think it is necessary for me? If he is immune against disease because he is vaccinated, he should have no fear that harm can come to him from me because I am not vaccinated. Some years ago a royal commission was appointed in Great Britain to inquire into the efficacy of vaccination, and it consisted of about 30 eminent medical men and distinguished professors, and they sat I think for seven years, and they asked 30,000 questions&#x2014;</p>

<p>And what did they report? The Royal Commission on Vaccination in Great Britain, after taking this voluminous evidence did not report in favour or against vaccination, but said vaccination had not been proved. What does the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) want? He accepts the conscientious objection clause, which my hon. friend in front has put in, but I don&#x2019;t think he goes far enough, because the applicant has to satisfy the registrar for vaccination. They had that provision in Great Britain at one time, where they had to satisfy the magistrate. It was found, however, that the magistrates who believed in vaccination refused to be satisfied, and the conscientious objector could not get his certificate of exemption because a magistrate refused to be satisfied, and the position got so bad that it became ludicrous, and a Bill was passed through the House of Commons by Mr. John Burns, who was then, I think, president of the Board of Trade, which did away with an applicant having to satisfy a magistrate before he could get exemption, and to-day exemptions are granted to practically all persons who apply for them. The Bill, as it stands, says that after a lot of trouble and difficulty, we will give you an exemption if you satisfy all the authorities concerned first, that you understand the thing thoroughly, that you have got sound reasons for your belief against vaccination, and once you have satisfied the registrar of vaccination, you may get a certificate of exemption, hut if there is an epidemic we shall come down upon you and vaccinate you. The hon. member for Hanover Street says that the man outside an institution to-day can get an exemption without difficulty, but once inside an institution his conscientious scruples are taken away from him and he is compelled to submit himself to vaccination. I ask the hon. member (Dr. Stals), who has studied this question from one side only, the medical side, to look up and read up the works written by eminent medical men on this subject and the statistics which have been published by the world&#x2019;s international statistical bureau at Berne and, having got the statistics which are published and the statements of some of the world&#x2019;s most distinguished medical men against vaccination, I ask him to allow me to attach as much weight and importance to that evidence as he attaches to the evidence of other medical men who he has quoted.</p>

We are not anxious as to what may happen to the Minister, but we are anxious that the Minister and other people like him, should not be a danger to the public health. That is really not my reason for rising. I have risen because I am rather mystified. I am glad to see the Minister of Finance here. The Minister of Finance told us this afternoon that when Bills are brought forward by the Government they are Government measures, and it does not matter what Minister is in charge at the moment in the House, they are Government measures and as Government measures they are going to be put through. I see the Minister is blushing. When I think of the words of eloquence that fell from him this afternoon and the manner in which he lectured this side of the House for having presumed to dictate to the Government that <span class="col_2407-2408" refersTo="page_1270"/>any particular Minister should be in charge of a Bill, as they were Government Bills and expressed the combined intelligence of the Cabinet, then, really I am mystified.

I hope this will be a warning to the Minister of Finance that for political purposes he must not make rash statements because chickens have a habit of coming home to roost. When he lectured this House this afternoon, few of us thought that the chickens would come home to roost so soon. It would be interesting to see the interviews which have taken place between the Minister of Labour and the Minister of the Interior in charge of this Bill, because there is no doubt that, feeling so strongly as the Minister of Labour does, there must have been very angry discussions between himself and his colleague.</p>

<p>Here we have the Minister of Finance telling us that a measure comes forward as a Government measure on which the Cabinet are agreed, and we have another member of the same Cabinet telling us that as far as this Government measure is concerned, they agreed to differ. One would have thought that in these circumstances the Minister of Labour would have seen that there was a constitutional course open to him&#x2014;we know from experience he is always prepared to sacrifice himself&#x2014;and that would be to tender his resignation and not be a party to allowing the Government to pass a principle through this House against which he holds the strongest conscientious objections. If my hon. friend is a real conscientious objector, if he has a real conscientious objection and he is not able to impress his views upon the Minister, then the only step for the hon. gentleman to take was in the most polite manner to inform the Prime Minister that as his views were not acceptable to the Cabinet and he held on this vital principle the strongest possible view, the only thing he could do would be, though it would be a great loss to the country, to tender his resignation and refuse to sit on the Treasury benches.</p>

<p>I am one of those who attach much importance to conscientious objections, and if anyone has such objections, it must, in my opinion, be very seriously considered. It is possibly pre-Victorian to have conscientious objections. I am not going into the medical side of the matter. We can leave that to the doctors, but we want to ascertain whether we are entitled to compel anyone who has conscientious objections. As for this Bill, I want to point out that, in this country, we have to do with spread-out areas, and some people live very far from the registrar of births and deaths. How is it possible for such a person to establish his objections to vaccination? It is a great objection. I personally have a conscientious objection to vaccination, and will not have myself vaccinated, even if I have to go to gaol because I am opposed to it, let the medical faculty say what it likes. I have personally seen what children have to suffer when they are vaccinated, and for that reason alone I am already opposed to it. I should like to call the attention of the House to what a great authority on compulsory vaccination, Dr. Kuyper, says in his book, Anti-revolutionary Policy. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">Whether the lurking germ of disease can be found and driven out by vaccination is a purely medical question, and it seems the results show that generally practised vaccination reduces the incidence of a disease. True, the entirely different question remains whether vaccination, even if it stops small pox might not have other injurious effects, but this also must be determined by medical science. So also belated recrudescence cannot be an argument against vaccination self. From a medical standpoint we have never interfered in this dispute. Our opposition was solely directed against compulsion, so far as this affected the free citizen in his own body. That each of us in turn must make a sacrifice for the community goes without saying. We must not become a source of infection to our surroundings, but although this imposes the obligation on us to most carefully prevent and ward off what in connection with this disease could cause damage to others, and although the question might here arise whether, on this account, we should not also of our own motion, agree to vaccination for ourselves and our children, still leaves entirely open the very serious question whether the authorities may use force to our person in our own body and to this question we always thought, and still think, we must give a decided answer in the negative.</block>

<p>That is the opinion of an authority. If the Minister cannot accept all the amendments of the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander), then we can possibly accept some of them. I feel especially that it is a great <span class="col_2409-2410" refersTo="page_1271"/>objection that one has personally to submit objections against vaccination. Can it not be done on a form which the Department of Public Health issues so that if a person, e.g., objects to his child being vaccinated he can fill up a form and the child can then be exempted? I am not going into religious objections, but I want every person who has conscientious objection should not have to represent them personally, but by means of filling in a form. As for six months, that can possibly remain, but I know that the Minister feels, and I am sure the whole House feels, that if anyone has conscientious objections, we may not treat them lightly. If anyone has them he feels it in the depths of his soul and then it is a serious matter. I admit that there is the great difficulty in view of the black population and the seriousness of epidemic diseases among them, but if there is anyone that is developed and has conscientious objection then it should not be necessary for him to appear personally, but it should be sufficient if he completes a form.</p>

<p>I hope we will get back to the merits of this question instead of this attempt to draw attention to a thing that has been drawn attention to before. To refer to the Royal Commission, a correspondent from Maritzburg drew my attention to its having heard 50,000 witnesses, and their findings and evidence occupy seven volumes. The final result was that the majority report, signed by eleven commissioners, favoured a conscience clause, and the minority report, signed by four commissioners, was in favour of the total abolition of vaccination. Hon. members must agree there is room for very serious difference of opinion on this matter, and you cannot get over it by calling people cranks. There is serious alarm amongst the public as a result of what has happened in Holland. The right hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) spoke as if the conscientious objector was not recognized by the Bill, but the Bill allows conscientious objection. I merely say that if you recognize the conscientious objector why should you refuse the same man the same priviliges under Sections 100 and 102? My amendment puts all three on the same footing.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_health">

<from>&#x2020; *The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>I think that I ought now to say a few words about the amendments. Before I come to that, I first want to answer the question of the hon. member for Pretoria (North) (Mr. Oost). The hon. member appears to support the Bill as proposed, but on the other hand, he is very much dissatisfied with the Department of Public Health, because he said that it now appears that some people, at any rate, think that there is some connection between encephalitis and vaccination, and he wants to know what information the department can give. He asks whether the department ever investigated the matter. My answer is that the hon. member and, unfortunately, many hon. members and members of the outside public, have an entire misconception of the duties and functions of the Department of Public Health. It is not a university and is not intended for the purpose, it is not an institution for scientific research. The department was not instituted for that purpose. The department is nothing else than what its name indicates, viz., a department to protect the public health against dangers, as much as possible. If the department had to investigate this or the other matter, then a much larger staff would be nesessary, and I should have to come to Parliament <span class="col_2411-2412" refersTo="page_1272"/>every year for much more money. It is no wonder the hon. member is disappointed if he has that idea of the department.</p>

<p>&#x2020; I now come to the amendments moved by the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander). Let me just explain, in the first instance, what the present position is. It is that under the existing law, the Public Health Act of 1919, general vaccination is compulsory, and if this measure is not passed the only legislation we have in the country is one for compulsory vaccination; so what this Bill proposes to do is to give relief to the conscientious objector, and as such. I think it ought to receive support from all members of this hon. House, especially from those who are against compulsory vaccination. For the last six years the provisions in the existing law with regard to compulsory vaccination have not been carried out. As the hon. member for Hanover Street has correctly stated, in the preexisting public health laws in the country, provision was made for the relief of conscientious objectors in the old Free State and the Natal laws, but right from the beginning we had compulsory vaccination provisions as far as the Transvaal and the Cape Province were concerned. In 1919, immediately after the &#x2019;flu epidemic, a consolidating measure was introduced into this House, and the result was the Public Health Act of 1919; there compulsory vaccination was introduced for the whole of the Union. When this Act was put into operation it was found that there were a number of conscientious objectors, especially in Durban, and as a result of their agitation the operation of the Act, as far as this provision was concerned, was suspended&#x2014;after the assurance given by the Prime Minister of the day&#x2014;since 1922; so, for the last six years, the operation of compulsory vaccination was suspended. The result was that the number of vaccinations in the country was, year by year, continually reduced, and the position to-day is that, taking the European and the coloured population, not more than 13 per cent. of the children born every year are being vaccinated. The result is that gradually you are getting, in this country, a condition of affairs which is very unsatisfactory, and is positively dangerous. I told the House last year that unless provision is made this year to give relief to the conscientious objectors and give them an opening, so that their wishes can be met, and, as a result of that, the existing legislation can again be brought into operation, I am not, as Minister of Public Health, going to bear the responsibility any longer of the suspension of the operation of the Act. I cannot do that. It is certainly not in the public interest, and I certainly would not be doing my duty if I did that. Therefore, I am very glad we have reached the stage when there is every prospect of this measure going on to the statute book. What is actually proposed in the Bill is to give opportunity to genuine conscientious objectors to obtain exemption from vaccination. The difficulty, however, is to distinguish between the genuine and the non-genuine objectors, for if you do not do that in the Bill a good many people who are too lazy or too negligent to have their children vaccinated would say they were conscientious objectors when really they are not. The Bill seeks to ensure that nobody shall get exemption as a conscientious objector unless it is quite certain that he has enough intelligence and knowledge to be able to form an opinion on the matter. If you are totally ignorant how can you be a conscientious objector?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_health">

<from>&#x2020; The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>The genuine conscientious objector must be distinguished from the non-genuine by, I will not say placing difficulties in the way of his obtaining exemption, but by putting him to some little trouble. It must be easier to have his child or himself vaccinated than for him to obtain exemption. That in a great many cases will be a very good test. If a person actually has conscientious objection then he ought to be willing to make some small sacrifice for conscience&#x2019; sake. The great objection that has been raised in the House is that the trouble for the conscientious objector is too great. They don&#x2019;t want to make some little sacrifice for conscience&#x2019; sake, but if they do not desire to do that, their objection is not conscientious. For that reason it is laid down that if anyone wishes to get exemption, he has to apply in person. The hon. member for Pretoria (South) (Dr. van Broekhuizen) has contended that it is not right that we should ask such a person to apply personally. You must not forget, however, that in every district there is a registrar of vaccination, and that the person seeking exemption has no less than six months in which to appear personally before the registrar. I do not think that is too great a sacrifice, or is asking too much. The proposals of the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) amount to asking for the deletion of the provision in connection with epidemics of smallpox. He asks for exemption, not only under ordinary circumstances, but also when there is an epidemic. What would local authorities say to that? The responsibility of combating epidemics in their own areas rests on the local authorities, which have to bear a good deal of expense. If the local authorities are frustrated in the carrying out of protective measures they take, in connection with the outbreak of an epidemic because there are so many people who object to being vaccinated, I think we shall have the local authorities up in arms. The hon. member further asks that if anyone applies for exemption he need not state in detail the grounds on which he objects to being vaccinated. That means that anybody can ask for exemption, even although he merely states he is a conscientious objector. If one can merely state that, either personally or by letter, what becomes of the test whether a person seeking exemption has sufficient intelligence or knowledge to be able to form an independent opinion on the matter? The hon. member proposes that the person applying for exemption <span class="col_2413-2414" refersTo="page_1273"/>need not appear personally before the registrar of vaccination. If that is adopted, then everyone desirous of exemption can merely write on a postcard: &#x201C;I am a conscientious objector,&#x201D; then the registrar will grant him a certificate of exemption. If we adopt that proposal the whole law, as far as vaccination is concerned, will be made nugatory. There are several things which the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) and others who have supported him forget&#x2014;that smallpox is loathe some and dangerous, and a very communicable disease, and leaves marks on the body of the patient which he carries through life. The public has a right to be protected against that disease. Further, the hon. member forgets that we have in this country a large native population, to some extent civilized, hut to the largest extent only semi-civilized. The native is very often the chief carrier of infection, and the native population to-day is not in a position that it will carry out the provisions with regard to vaccination unless compelled to do so. One of the magistrates in the Transvaal, in the Ermelo district, gave it as his opinion that if it was made easy for the conscientious objector to get exemption on the ground that he just states that he is a conscientious objector, then in his district no natives will be vaccinated. In the special circumstances in South Africa it is only right and just the people of the country should be adequately protected. With regard to the efficacy of vaccination, I think the whole discussion is beside the mark. Nobody will say that the remedy is absolutely perfect, but as far as we know to-day it is the best remedy we can get under the circumstances. I think we need not go far to see how efficacious vaccination is against the epidemic of smallpox Last year there was a serious outbreak at Durban and many of the leaders of the conscientious objectors became vaccinated. At any rate we have proof that the most serious outbreaks of smallpox we have had in this country for many a day were stopped and eradicated in a few weeks&#x2019; time simply as the result of measures taken by the department. We need not go far to get proof of the efficacy of this particular remedy. Just a word about the position in regard to vaccination in other countries, and especially in Holland. Let me just say that what happened in Holland is not altogether new. Three years ago the opinion was expressed in Great Britain that there was some connection between vaccination and encephalitis. The Minister of Public Health, three years ago, as a result, appointed a commission of experts to go into this matter and find out what the real position was. That commission reported that, as far as they could judge, and as far as the results of their research went, there was no casual connection between the one and the other. The position is, encephalitis was found sporadically in various countries of the world before 1917, before the outbreak of the great &#x2019;flu epidemic. After the &#x2019;flu epidemic the occurrence of that disease was much more frequent. Whether it had anything to do with the &#x2019;flu epidemic or not it is difficult to say, but the occurrence of encephalitis became more frequent. The reason why some connection was sought between vaccination and encephalitis was that it occurred in a small number of cases. There was a good deal of encephalitis in these various countries which, admittedly, had nothing to do with vaccination. It had occurred, however, in some cases within a fortnight after people were vaccinated, and that brought some medical men to the idea that there was some cause of connection between the one and the other. The matter was gone into by Professor Jitta in Holland, and he was definitely of opinion there was a cause of connection, and advised his Government accordingly, and the Government acted as the result of that. Subsequent to the investigation in Great Britain, the matter was taken up as already pointed out by the hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) by the public health organization of the League of Nations, and they are still investigating that matter, but they have definitely expressed the opinion that the opinion of Professor Jitta, and the action of the Dutch Government, was decidedly premature. They do not know the facts to-day in connection with that, and it is not certain there is any cause of connection whatever. That is the considered opinion of the organization of the League of Nations, but say, for instance, there might be something in the argument of the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander)&#x2014;that is the position in Holland&#x2014;and he used that argument against compulsory vaccination. Granted it might be an argument against compulsory vaccination, but it is not an argument against this Bill. It provides an opening for the conscientious objector to get exemption. This is not a Bill to introduce compulsory vaccination, but to give relief to the conscientious objector by enabling them to find an opening for obtaining exemption. I hope, therefore, the hon. member will not insist on his amendment, but will support the Bill.</p>

<p>I should very much like to meet the hon. gentleman, but I am very sorry I cannot meet him here. The hon. gentleman must not forget that the machinery for dealing with epidemics and outbreaks of infectious disease is the public service. He must not forget that the sanitary inspector must play a very important part as far as these outbreaks are concerned in connection with the duties of local authorities, and the hon. gentleman can very well imagine what would happen if your machinery that you use to combat these outbreaks, is itself a carrier of infection, and that is the reason, because you must use the public service to combat outbreaks of infectious disease that you have this requirement in the Act that every applicant for admission to the public service must be vaccinated. For that reason I do not think it would be in the public interest to accept an amendment as moved by the hon. member.</p>

<p>Surely the Minister will be able to limit this to some extent. Take a man employed in the Union Buildings in Pretoria, in say the Native Affairs department, having nothing whatever to do with the administration of public health. Surely the Minister realizes that every public servant who has not the remotest connection with health administration is at present penalized. Is it not illogical to say that anyone who is a conscientious objector will get exemption, but no public servant can be employed unless vaccinated. Under the law of 1919 I could understand it. You allowed no conscientious objectors. But now you have opened the door to conscientious objectors, and why do you penalize a conscientious objector in the public service who has got an exemption certificate? If the Minister said he does not want those who control the position in case of an epidemic to be exempt from vaccination, he should limit the amendment accordingly. The Minister must see that in Sections 10 and 11 he does not say &#x201C;other than public servants.&#x201D; Your public servant will still be able to get exemption as an individual. You include a public servant in this Bill, for the purpose of his making application and getting an exemption certificate, but you do not include him for the purpose of getting exemption under Section 104. In other words, you give him an exemption certificate as a citizen of the country, but as a public servant, it is no use to him. Surely that is illogical. You point out he is liable to be dismissed from the public service if he uses this certificate. If the Minister really feels there will be some danger in connection with persons concerned with the administration of public health, then he ought to limit the amendment to such persons who are not in the Department of Public Health. Surely they ought not to be penalized. I have a case of a man who is a conscientious objector and whose son is also. He wrote to me as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">It is highly necessary that an amendment should be made in Section 104 of the Public Health Act. My own son passed a recent junior certificate examination with 75 per cent. English and 75 per cent. Afrikaans to his credit. He was recently refused employment by the postal department on the ground that he was not vaccinated.</block>

<p>I am very glad the Minister has refused to accept this amendment. The position is quite different from that put by the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander). Here we have a Government which is able to lay down conditions on which it will take people into its employment. The difficulty about allowing every conscientious objector to have exemption is that every man who is not vaccinated is a potential danger to the community. That is particularly the case where you have a large number of people in barracks, like police in barracks. The real danger is if you allow people to come into large bodies where large numbers of people come together, you are in every case increasing the source of potential danger. With great reluctance, I have supported the Minister in the last few clauses, which I think have gone very far indeed. I do not think anyone can have gone through the epidemic of 1882, as I have, but has seen the disastrous effects on the whole population of Cape Town, especially coloured and Malay. It is all very well to get lax between one epidemic and another, and to have a tenderness for people who say they are conscientious objectors, but it is dangerous, and exposes the whole community to terrible danger when an epidemic does come along. Why many of us are so strong on compulsory vaccination is that we want the security of permanent assurance against small pox. If the Minister were to <span class="col_2417-2418" refersTo="page_1275"/>go further back than he did, as far as the records are concerned, he would find that outbreaks of smallpox have been checked by vaccination. The Minister is quite right that the Government should lay down as a fixed rule that entrants to the public service should not come in without being vaccinated.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) said that my position was quite illogical, but let me point out in the first place that we do not do away with compulsory vaccination in all cases. As the Bill stands here, there is still compulsory vaccination&#x2014;in the cases of institutions, for instance. An inmate of an institution would be a greater danger if he contracts smallpox than if he were not an inmate, and in his case vaccination remains compulsory, even although he is a conscientious objector&#x2014;he gets no exemption. The same applies to the actual outbreak of an epidemic, where you may enforce compulsion on the whole community. We do not do away with the element of compulsion altogether. If we retain it in the case of the public servant, the position is not illogical. With regard to what the hon. member said about not compelling public servants in departments other than the Public Health Department to be vaccinated, if we do that I do not think the public service will thank the hon. member, because that will close avenues of transfer and promotion from one department to another. In the public service we have a general principle that public servants are interchangeable between one department and another, and that is very, often the only possible way of promotion. For that reason, too, I do not think we could accept that suggestion.</p>

<p>Then after the unfortunate new Clause 13 I come with a lucky new Clause 13, and move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">That the following be a new clause to follow Clause 12:</block>

<block name="#quote">13. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act the Governor-General may by proclamation declare that during such period as may be fixed in such proclamation the provisions of the principal Act with regard to compulsory vaccination shall not apply to particular races or classes of persons or the entire population.</block>

<p>The object is clear. The Minister has not the power, according to law, which is given in the motion. He only has certain powers, such as under Section 92 of the principal Act, where he can prescribe the form for the vaccination of the child, and Section 95, which makes the vaccination of children compulsory, Section 96, which says that the Governor General can, by proclamation, impose certain obligations, and Section 96, which refers to the compulsory vaccination of persons who come into the Union, and Section 100, which prescribes compulsory vaccination in cases of epidemics, and Section 102, which prescribes vaccination of patients in institutions. No provision like that in this new clause is contained in the Act. I hope that everybody will see the advantage, in case of a disease like encephalitis caused by vaccination, or another disease or another reason which makes vaccination inadvisable, that the Minister can lay down that vaccination shall provisionally be stopped, e.g., for one or two months, or that he can merely stop the vaccination of children, or, e.g., can exempt the Europeans, and not the natives, or vice versa. They are powers which the Minister requires with reference to the scientific investigations that are instituted. That is why I have moved this new clause.</p>

<p>It looks as if the hon. member for Pretoria (North) (Mr. Oost) now wants to repose too much faith in me. I think that the confidence he wants to repose in me ought not to be given to any Minister. He wants to give the Government of the day too great powers; powers which Parliament ought to reserve to itself. If circumstances such as those in 1922 should actually recur, the Government of the day can take the responsibility upon it to suspend the application of the Act, but the Government must thereafter come to Parliament to indemnify its action, which is guaranteed against the abuse of power. A Minister, if he had such powers, would not have to come to Parliament to answer for to it. The hon. member mentioned a case where it will possibly be necessary or desirable to possibly enforce vaccination on one race and not another. Smallpox makes no distinction between one race and another, recognizes no colour bar, and it would be entirely unpractical to apply vaccination to one race and not to another.</p>

<p>When the Public Health Act was drafted the question arose as to the power of local authorities on Government property.

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="#quote">To insert the following new paragraph to precede paragraph (a):</block>

<block name="#quote">(a) by the insertion after the definition of &#x201C;district&#x201D; of the following new definition:</block>

<block name="#quote">&#x201C;duties&#x201D; in reference to sanitary inspectors means duties as defined by regulation.</block>

<p>The duties of sanitary inspectors ought to be defined by regulation. The Minister is authorized to refund part of the salary paid by local authorities for sanitary inspectors if they devote the whole of their time to the duties of their office, but the duties are not defined, and it may become a question whether the Minister is bound to refund a portion of the salary of a man who is not devoting the whole of his time to the duties of his post. It is impossible to suggest the definition of the word &#x201C;duties&#x201D; now, because inquiries will first have to be made from the local authorities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_health">

<from>&#x2020; The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid a provision of this nature will in practice not work well. The definition of the duties of officials connected with the public health are not provided by the Government; take, for instance, the medical officer of health. Nowhere in the Bill are their duties defined, and I do not think an extension should be made in the case of sanitary inspectors. Besides that, the duties of sanitary inspectors have changed considerably from time to time. The conditions in the country vary very much, and it is very difficult as between the small villages and the larger urban areas and municipalities to define in one general definition what their duty shall be. I am afraid the result of such a definition by the Government would be that a good many municipalities will think it is interference on the part of the Government, and it will not encourage them to appoint full-time sanitary inspectors.</p>

<speech by="#gilson">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>I should like an explanation from the Minister on this clause, because there seems to be a big principle involved, that is the change from a 50-hour week to a 48-hour week. The Minister brushes it over very lightly in his introductory remarks, but it is a very big thing. You have your boasted Conciliation Act, which the Minister says works very well, and surely the question of a 48-hour week can be settled by agreement under this Act. We had in this House the other day a statement from one of the members on the Labour benches that a signed document was in existence in which a promise had been given by the Government to apply the eight-hour day to the railways. I take it this Bill represents not only the opinion of the Minister <span class="col_2421-2422" refersTo="page_1277"/>of Labour, but the considered opinion of the Cabinet and in spite of a written pledge, the Government of this country decided they could not in the biggest industrial undertaking in the country, namely the railways, bring in a 48-hour week. Very well. Now why is this Government attempting to foist on to the industrialists, on to the private owners, on to the farmers in many cases, something which it says in its own undertaking is an impossibility. I think this House is entitled, and the country is entitled, to an explanation of this matter from the Minister and an explanation which will carry weight, because when the governing body of this country that controls the biggest undertaking in this country, says that an eight-hour day is an impossibility and that they cannot bring it in, I do not see what justification there is for forcing that same eight-hour day on the private employer of labour. It seems an anomaly and it appears to me to want an explanation that will carry conviction not only in this House, but in the country also. I, personally, speaking as a farmer, object most strongly to any alteration of the 50-hour week. It is quite short enough to get through any of the operations which come under this Act, and we have to undertake on the farms. I would instance the wattle industry, as was mentioned by the hon. member for Umvoti (Mr. Deane), the other day, and I think it is absolutely against the interests of the country to tamper with the original Bill as it stood, that is 50 hours. I think the Minister, before we accept this clause, should, in the light of the arguments I have brought forward, give this House a very valid reason for the necessity of such a vital change in the hours of labour as is adumbrated in this clause.</p>

<speech by="#brown">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BROWN</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson) wants us to penalize the large number of good employers in this country who are working their employees eight hours a day, and to perpetuate the very unfair competition that these manufacturers have to contend with at the present time. The manufacturers who want to work their employees all hours of the day and night are small in number. The hon. member has not brought forward one figure to show that any industry is going to be detrimentally affected by the inclusion in this Act of these hours. All that these employers who have adopted the 48-hour system ask from their employees is that during the 48 hours they should give their employers efficiency, give them of their best. Efficiency can only be got if the health and leisure of the employee are considered. The hon. member wants us to penalize those men, the good employers, who are endeavouring to bring about satisfactory conditions, and to perpetuate the unfair competition that these men have to meet. I hope the committee will not accept the arguments put forward by the hon. member for Griqualand, but will agree to the clause as it appears in the Bill.</p>

<from>&#x2020; The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I think there is only one point that I need deal with in the speech of the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson). He wants to know why on the railways we are not adopting the eight-hour day, and we are going to compel outside employers to do so. As a matter of fact, the eight-hour day is actually in operation in all our railway workshops, and has been for many years, so that it is in conformity with the practice in our railway workshops. It is not in conformity with the practice so far as the running staff and the station staff are concerned. Furthermore, it is in conformity with the eight-hour day convention passed at Washington.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>&#x2020; The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>This is a step in that direction. As the last speaker has said, more than half the factories in the Union are working less than 50 hours, and this is only to bring the 50-hour week into conformity with modern methods and the modern outlook. When hon. members on the other side were in power, they sent their representatives over to Washington and subscribed to the 48-hour week. I hope the hon. member will accept the indication that the Government is carrying out itself in its railway workshops what it is now asking the manufacturers to do throughout the country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gilson">

<from>&#x2020; Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GILSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is all very well for the Minister to use these arguments, and also the hon. member on the cross-benches. He talks about the health of the employees. Do the farmers only work a 48-hour week, and would you say your farming representatives are poor, anemic men in bad health? The farmer working a 12-hour day can hold his own in point of health and physique against any labour man. This Act applies to both town and country. Sub-section (2) most distinctly lays down [subsection read]. You have your mill for grinding. So long as you grind your meal for human consumption, you are exempt, but directly you grind for cattle food, you come under the Factory Act. Will the Minister controvert that? I, as a farmer, am not prepared to accept 48-hours on my farm or any farm factory I am running for instance, in any process for the utilization of my farm products for stock food. Further than that, our co-operative farm factory is included in the exemption. We are working to-day on cooperative lines, and all co-operative factories are to be subject to an eight-hour day. That is absolutely impossible in our industry. I, as a farmer, to whom this Bill applies, am not prepared to accept this clause. If I stand alone I will divide the House and vote against the clause as it stands.</p>

<p>Why should they not be treated the same as anybody else? I am astonished really that in these days an hon. gentleman can stand up against the 48-hour week. There are certain occupations where a rigid 48-hour week is impossible. The hon. member is putting conundrums&#x2014;when is a manufacturer a farmer, or when is a farmer a manufacturer? Efficiency, and not long hours, should be the test, and efficiency and long hours do not go together. If we have long hours we cannot make South Africa a country worth living in. People must have some opportunity of obtaining recreation. If a farmer branches out as a manufacturer, the employees in the factory cannot be considered to be farm labourers. It is not a good sign for hon. members opposite to appeal to the self-interest of a section of members of this House in order to keep back progress.</p>

<p>There is no objection to an 8-hour day for a legitimate factory in a town, but the last speaker evidently does not know what he is talking about. I want farming representatives in the House to realize the situation, but the representatives on the Government benches of farming constituencies do not seem lately to be intent on securing the same amount of protection for their constituents because of the peculiar circumstances in which they now find themselves placed. I do not agree with the Minister when he says that the alteration merely means the substitution of a 48-hour week for a 50-hour week. I will refer the Minister to the 1918 Act, Clause 2, sub-section 2. Hon. members on the cross-benches must not get excited, for we are not on the Women&#x2019;s Enfranchisement Bill now.
