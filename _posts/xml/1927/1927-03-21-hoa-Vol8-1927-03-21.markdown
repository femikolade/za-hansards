<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to take the earliest opportunity available to me to reply to certain remarks made by the Minister of Finance on Thursday evening last in winding up the debate on the second reading of this Bill. Before dealing with the Minister, however, there are one or two other matters which I think I should touch upon in the first place. A remark was made by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North) (Mr. Barlow) in reference to myself and my service on the liquor commission, that in his opinion I ought not to have accepted a seat on a Government commission. Let me say this, that if I were in any doubt as to the propriety of any action I proposed to take, there are 133 members of this House to whom I would go for advice before I would go to the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North), and then I would not go to him. On a memorable occasion recently he referred to a colleague of his in the Labour party as being &#x201C;unstable.&#x201D; From my long and intimate knowledge of the hon. member, I can say this &#x2014;that if there is any hon. member of this House to whom that epithet could be applied, it is that hon. member. Sometimes we hear him as the candid critic of the Government, and on other occasions he seems to be rivalling the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) for the position of chief m&#x2019;bongo to the Government. The Minister of Labour took occasion to reply to certain criticisms of mine in regard to the expenditure of the Labour Department. What was the line of his reply? Surely a most amazing one when one remembers who the Minister is, and what party he comes from. His reply in effect, was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have cut down expenditure from half a million to a quarter of a million.</block>

<p>That is extraordinary coming from the Minister of Labour and from a prominent member of the Labour party. I have been looking up to see what he and his friends did say in those years when we had to spend half a million or more on unemployment. In 1922 Col. Creswell, the leader of the Labour party, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In framing for expenditure, they must see that a man got a civilized wage, a wage on which he could maintain himself and a wife and children upon a civilized scale, if they would ever fill the bill. He knew they would be told that the Government had got £700,000 on the Estimates. What was that? It was a very large sum of money, but distributed over a large number of people, for many months, it was not going very far.</block>

<p>In 1923 I see that some of the members of the Labour party had something to say. Mr. Waterston, for instance&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Last year the unemployment vote was £450,000 and this year, instead of being decreased, it should be increased. It was essential that the Government should undertake schemes of national development.</block>

<p>Mr. Sampson said he wished to protest against the decrease of the vote, and to ask the Minister how it had been brought about. He objected to the reduction in the rates given to men employed under this vote, and urged it was a bad thing for the State to profit through unemployment. Mr. Boydell&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Government had done nothing to tackle the unemployment problem seriously. It has taken advantage of men who are down and out.</block>

<p>And yet in 1927, being a Minister of the Crown, and Minister of Labour, he comes to this House and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Look what I have done, I have brought expenditure on unemployment down from half a million or more.</block>

<p><span class="col_1615-1616" refersTo="page_0878"/>In any case the Minister completely missed the point of my criticism. It was not the amount of capital expenditure on unemployment, but the amount of expenditure on his department in administration. In the last year of the South African party regime, the Labour administration cost £28,900, and in the first estimates presented by the present Minister of Finance in 1924 the Labour Department cost £36,000. This year&#x2019;s estimates, for administering less than half the sum we had to administer, show that the cost of the department has gone up to £85,000. It now has a personnel of 177. That is the point of my criticism that I want the Minister to meet. That is my criticism of the Labour Department, that its expenditure has gone up in four years from £36.000 to £85,000, and it now has a personnel of 177. Yet the Minister comes forward and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The amount we are spending to-day is less than half of what the S.A.P. used to spend.</block>

<p>I want to come to the Minister of Finance. I cannot congratulate him on the methods of controversy or debate he adopted in his reply, because in many instances he was most unfair. He put into my mouth assertions I had never made, and criticisms I had never attempted, and having done that, he attempted to destroy them. I will give the Minister two instances in which either because he did not make proper notes of the speech to which he intended to reply, or because he was careless, or did not care, he deliberately set up arguments I never used. For instance, in regard to the oudstryders, I made it perfectly clear that the merits of the payments I did not attack, but merely the method by which the Minister had attempted to do it. And secondly, when I referred to the number of boards as being 35 and their cost as £55,000, I at once added that I was perfectly prepared to believe that the great majority were carried over from the last Government. And yet, what does the Minister do? With the air of a conjurer producing a rabbit out of a hat, he gets up and tells the delighted audience behind him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What a curious criticism! The hon. member ought to know that the vast majority of these commissions and boards we took over from the last Government.</block>

<p>I made him a present of that, but he seemed to entirely ignore what I said. So I say the Minister&#x2019;s method of reply was not what we are accustomed to from him, and was unfair. He queried my figure of an increase of 3½ millions. I told him at the time how I got that figure, but I will tell him again. I have taken his own estimates for 1924-&#x2019;25, and I have his own memorandum over his own signature. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The estimates, as presented to Parliament in January, totalled £23,974,000.</block>

<p>That is his own figure and those were the last estimates ever presented to this House by Mr. Burton. I have taken his estimates for this year, and deducted the one total from the other, and that gives 3½ millions increase. I went on to say I had no criticism to make of the item £1,000,000 in regard to the provincial councils. I have no criticisms to make on the £600,000 increase of interest and redemption, but I have got very little credit for this. The Minister went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Does the hon. member advocate a reduction in pensions, and repudiating our liability?</block>

<p>My answer to that is perfectly plain&#x2014;if the pensions are granted and are on the statute book, I could not. But having in mind the speeches the Minister and his friends made when in Opposition, I do expect them to deliver the goods in the way of economy. I do expect the Minister to Keep a watchful eye on the growth of expenditure, as he promised to do if ever they took office. The Minister went on to say, and this is the gem&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is no good saying the expenditure is just going up; no; the only way is to say whether there is expenditure which is not justified. .... This is futile criticism . . . Let them take the responsibility of moving a reduction.</block>

<p>I have taken the trouble to look up the speeches made on the eve of this Government&#x2019;s taking office, in the two last years of the regime of the last Government. At that time the Minister was not the leading financial critic of the Opposition; the leading financial critic was the late Mr. Fichardt, whose untimely loss we all deplore. Year by year he led the attack on the South African party. The same hon. members who cheered the Minister on Thursday night were the same hon. members who cheered Mr. Fichardt when he made this criticism in opening the budget debate on April 13, 1923&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was a cry much relished by the Minister&#x2019;s supporters that the Opposition has done nothing to reduce expenditure . . . That was not the business of the Opposition nor had it the power. It could not reduce expenditure by sixpence. And the power lay entirely in the hands of the Government. That was what the Minister was paid for . . . The Minister had said that he could not prevent expenditure from going up . . . Then it was about time that someone else tried to do something . . . It seemed to him that the Government had got into a groove and its main business seemed to be to cover up its hideous faults in the past . . . The House should assert its authority . . . He desired to move the early appointment of a Parliamentary committee representative of all parties to inquire into the best means of securing economy in the administration compatible with efficient service of the country&#x2019;s interests and adequate remuneration and security to those in the service of the country.</block>

<p>In this jeremiad he was followed immediately after by the financial leader of the Labour <span class="col_1617-1618" refersTo="page_0879"/>party, the present Minister of Labour, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">that he thought the House was indebted to Mr. Fichardt for presenting facts and figures which provided ground for substantial criticism of the Government&#x2019;s financial policy. If the Government were not competent or able to conduct the finances of the country in an efficient and proper manner, he (Mr. Boydell) said that the sooner they had a change of Government the better it would be for the country.</block>

<p>That hon. member, I may remark, is now responsible for a department which this year is costing £85,000, and when he took office it cost £40,000&#x2014;less than half. I now read what Mr. Fichardt said on the 13th May, 1922, on the Budget debate&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Finance has confessed in his speech that the Treasury could not control such items as public debt, pensions, unemployment and the like. He (Mr. Fichardt) could only say then that no wonder the position of the country was dangerous and unsatisfactory.</block>

<p>At this there were Nationalist cheers&#x2014;the same Nationalist cheers when the present Minister of Finance said the other evening&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The services of the country are developing, and in future you will have a progressive increase of expenditure. If the country wants the services, the country will have to put up with a progressive increase of expenditure.</block>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I will make this confession&#x2014;I looked up to see whether he took part, but he did not; he confined himself to the railways, and in those days the Minister was not looked forward to as the future Minister of Finance. Mr. Fichardt was. The Minister&#x2019;s speeches in those days did not receive the prominence that they do to-day. Mr. Fichardt on the 13th of May, 1922, went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Minister did not control these items, who did? There was no excuse for the Minister to say that because of certain actions of the House he was unable to exercise control. The finances of the country were in his hands, and it was his business to see that proper control was exercised. The Minister was now endeavouring to make Parliament the scapegoat. He hoped Parliament would refuse to be used in that way, and he hoped the country would not be misled by the Minister&#x2019;s plausible pretext.</block>

<p>I hope that the Minister will remember that when he and his party were in opposition their plea was&#x2014;</p>

<p>To-day the expenditure is £27,500,000, and when he took office it was £24,000,000. All the sophistry the Minister has been able to exercise will not get over that fact. I gave a list of items of increased expenditure the other night, to which the Minister did not answer. He answered a good many things I did not say. I gave a list showing how the expenditure had gone up, and these costly excrescences which the present Government had introduced. I want to deal finally with the Minister&#x2019;s so-called defence of his action in regard to the oudstryders. I make no cavil as to the expenditure itself. There is no doubt that the condition of some of them is such as to call for remedy, but my criticism is that the Minister abused the powers conferred on him.</p>

<p>I must think of some softer term&#x2014;I will say he transgressed the powers conferred by the Audit and Exchequer Act. If there is one fundamental axiom of Parliamentary Government it is that Parliament should control the public purse, and that no expenditure should be incurred in the public interest except when it is voted by Parliament.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Let me quote in abbreviated form what Mr. Hilton Young, former financial secretary of the Treasury in England, says on this subject in his book on the &#x201C;System of National Finance.&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principles are: The executive in financial matters is only the arm of Parliament, which is the head. No money can be got, and none spent, save under authority of Parliament and only for the purposes prescribed by Parliament. Gladstone&#x2019;s theory was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be an advocatus diaboli towards the estimates of spending departments. He watches that no service is included which is not essential, and that everything is done most economically. Not a penny can be raised nor a penny spent but under law. The old fears of the overspending by the Crown are gone. Checks are now required on the extravagance of the House itself and of Ministers themselves. The executive has drifted into becoming the greatest of spendthrifts.</block>

<p>Our own Auditor-General writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our special warrant procedure has its prototype in the civil contingencies fund of Great Britain, a reserve or nest egg for unforeseen emergencies. Before 1913 it was only £120.000 against our £300,000. In that year it was raised to £300,000.</block>

<p><span class="col_1619-1620" refersTo="page_0880"/>The Audit and Exchequer Act lays it down that if at any time it appears to the Governor-General to be necessary in the public interests that an issue should be made from the exchequer account to defray unforeseen expenditure of a special character which is not provided for in an Appropriation Act, and which cannot, without serious injury to the public interest, be postponed until adequate provision can be made therefor by Parliament.</p>

<p>It is an excess of the powers and spirit of this Act to say that twenty days before Parliament assembles persons, whose claims dated 25 years back, were to have a new class of pension created for them without Parliament being consulted. The Minister says that he had a recommendation that their case should be relieved, and to get Parliament to do that he would have had to wait until March. It is insulting the intelligence of the House for the Minister to tell us that consideration of the case of the oudstryders by Parliament could not equally well have taken place in February as in January. If there had been any urgency he could have brought the matter before the House straight away, but instead of doing that he himself laid down the scale of their relief and then tells us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have done it. If you approve well and good; if you don&#x2019;t I will resign.</block>

<p>That is the very negation of parliamentary authority. What he should have done was to introduce a Bill, and given us a chance to discuss it, but instead of doing that he presents us with un fait accompli. It is idle to tell the House that this was a form of relief&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Minister is now going on to chop words. Had this happened in July or August, there might have been some justification for the Minister&#x2019;s action, but there was no justification for his deciding the matter three weeks before Parliament assembled. One result of the Minister&#x2019;s action is that now there is no Act providing that these people should get relief at all, and any Minister of Finance can simply drop the amount off the Estimates.</p>

<p>In the case of the ex-republican officials their pensions must be paid under an Act of Parliament, but the oudstryders depend on the caprice of any individual Minister of Finance, and in times of financial stringency there will be a temptation to drop the payments. The Minister has signally failed to make out any case whatever to justify his action. I repeat, at the conclusion, that I do not criticize the merits of the payment. I have not seen the report.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOSHOFF</person>:</from>

<p>I had not the least intention of taking part in the debate, but the occurrences of the past two days have compelled me to say something to-day in connection with the desire of Ventersdorp to be made the centre for the sale of diamonds. I asked the Minister of Mines and Industries to assist me, and to grant me an interview, but, to my regret, that was refused. I am disappointed about it, because I think that, as representative of my constituency, I can claim to put a request before the Minister and explain it. The Minister has now verbally informed me that he has discussed the matter with the Secretary for Mines, and that it has been decided not to grant the request. The request to approach the Minister in this connection came from the Ventersdorp Chamber of Commerce, and also from the chairman of the Nationalist party there. I have to-day finally received a letter from the Minister in which he gives the reasons why Ventersdorp cannot be selected as a diamond centre. He says that the buyers go to the diggers, and not the diggers to the buyers, and he says, further, that if the diggers had to come to Ventersdorp, they would run the risk of wasting their money there, or of losing it by the way. I regard that argument of the Minister&#x2019;s as a reflection on the diggers. My experience of them is that they do not waste their money, or lose it along the road. In my opinion, there are sufficient reasons to constitute Ventersdorp a diamond centre, and the Minister&#x2019;s arguments are no valid reasons to the contrary. If the Minister had said that it would cost too much money, I should possibly be able to submit, but the reasons of the Minister are not to the point. Many farms around <span class="col_1621-1622" refersTo="page_0881"/>Ventersdorp have already been proclaimed, and on six or seven, diamonds have been found. I shall be glad if the Minister will reconsider the matter, and hope that he will then comply with the general request of the public to constitute Ventersdorp a diamond centre.</p>

<p>The course of the debate, on the second reading of this Bill, made it impossible for me to refer to several topics to which I wished to refer. I was compelled to confine myself to the question of imperial relations. There was one point I was anxious should be dealt with more fully by the House than has hitherto been the case. It was raised by the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson), and it refers to the agreement in the building trade, which the Minister of Labour has applied over a large portion of the country. I was impressed by the speech of my hon. friend. It raised a matter of far-reaching importance to the country. I was astonished the Minister, in his reply, although he referred to a number of points that had been raised, neglected to refer to the strictures, the criticisms, passed by my hon. friend.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>We gave the hon. Minister an extension. I moved myself that we give him more time to continue his interesting remarks. Instead of using that time to enlighten the House on a matter of first-class importance, he launched into a venomous attack on the Opposition, and the policies of this side of the House. I do not want to pursue that, but the matter is one of great importance, and it is the duty of the House to ventilate it more fully, and give more attention to it than it has hitherto received. This agreement is a remarkable one. It is an agreement in the building industry concluded last October by the National Industrial Council for that industry. It was then submitted to the Minister for his approval, and the Minister, in terms of the Conciliation Act, has published this agreement, and, therefore, given it force of law. I find that by the proclamation this agreement is applied over a very large part of South Africa. It is applied in the Transvaal over the magisterial areas of Pretoria, Witbank, Johannesburg, Benoni, Springs, and several other places, including practically the whole of the Western Transvaal. It is also applied to a number of areas in the Free State, to Pietermaritzburg, Durban, Kimberley, Mafeking and the whole area of the northern Karroo, including a large portion of what is commonly known as the Kalahari Desert. It applies to the magisterial districts of Albany, Kingwilliamstown, Cathcart, Molteno, Tarka, the magisterial areas of East London, Port Elizabeth, Uitenhage and to the Cape Peninsula, and some additional areas going on to Bellville. It is also applied, among other places, to Lydenburg in the Transvaal, and Ladybrand in the Free State. The agreement lays down that in those areas which I have mentioned, certain wages shall be paid in the building industry, and a scale of wages is laid down, ranging from 3s. 4d. per hour at Pretoria, on the Witwatersrand, Potchefstroom and the Transvaal generally, down to 2s. 9d. per hour here in Cape Town. These wages of 3s. 4d. an hour have to be paid to all persons engaged in the building trade, except painting, glazing, lead-light work, glass-work, paperhanging and decorating. In these other trades, there is a lower scale laid down of 3s. 2d. per hour, going down to 2s. in Cape Town. It is laid down that all persons engaged in the building industry, whether in the erection or maintenance, alteration or repair of any building, or any portion thereof, or in the preparation of work for any building or portion thereof, shall be paid these wages. Then it goes on to lay down that the persons engaged in this industry in all these areas, shall work only for 44 hours per week, and it makes provision that for overtime, there shall be an increased scale of payment. It lays down that for dangerous work in connection with building, there shall be a still higher scale of pay. It lays down what tools shall be used, that there shall be proper sanitary accommodation separately for whites and coloured persons. It forbids piecework. It deals with notices of discharge, it deals with the question of the tools which shall be supplied by the employer, and with a variety of other questions. It even deals with the question of refreshments. Employers are to provide boys with tea twice daily, and once daily in the Cape Peninsula. I do not know why the Cape Peninsula should be differentiated against. Exemptions may be given by the Industrial Council to aged persons and in other cases. Then there is a clause about annual holidays for artizans.</p>

<block name="quote">The executive committee of the National Council may exempt any person or persons named in this agreement in its discretion.</block>

<p>The agreement goes on to make provision for certain other industries, and in regard to painting, it says that the only work in the painting trade which may be executed by persons other than those paid the legal wages, shall be lime-washing, whitewashing of private dwellings, <span class="col_1623-1624" refersTo="page_0882"/>native habitations, etc. The Minister, in giving the agreement the force of law, says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am satisfied that the applicants are sufficiently representative of the said building industry.</block>

<p>He goes on to say he gives force of law to this agreement, that it shall be in force up to the 12th February, 1928, and he says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything contained herein, persons engaged in the construction on farms of buildings, including dwellings, used exclusively for farm purposes where the current local market value of the material to be used does not exceed £400, shall be excluded from the operation of the said agreement.</block>

<p>Provision is made that in the event of a dispute arising as to the value of such material, the executive committee shall decide. It is quite clear that the Minister purports to act under the Conciliation Act of 1924, but it is equally clear that the Minister, in his action, has contravened the provisions of that Act. The Act of 1924 says this in the first clause&#x2014;</p>

<p>How does the Minister then explain this condition, that farm buildings erected on a farm, even for the exclusive occupation of the people on the farm, even for exclusive use for farming purposes, shall, so long as the materials cost a certain amount, fall under the terms of this provision. Clearly the exclusion under the Conciliation Act was absolute. No buildings erected on farms, for farming purposes, could come under the terms of any agreement, and no wages could be settled in respect of buildings erected on farms for farming purposes. Here the Minister comes and lays down that, so long as the material for a building costs a certain amount and no more, they shall fall within the terms of this agreement. To my mind, the Minister here has clearly, in terms, contravened the terms of the Conciliation Act. I should like to hear the Minister&#x2019;s explanation of this, because there is no doubt that, under the Act, the exclusion is complete and total and absolute.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking of agriculture. There may be a stage where the line becomes difficult to draw, but I am taking a stage where it is perfectly easy, where you are erecting a building on a farm which is necessary for the occupation of the owner, or the workers on that farm. Under this agreement which the Minister has notified and applied all over the country in the districts I have mentioned, a farmer cannot build stables on his farm, provided there is a certain value attached, without falling under the terms of the agreement, and he then has to use this most expensive form of labour in order to equip his farm with the necessary buildings. To my mind it is quite clear that this agreement is in conflict with the terms, certainly with the intention, probably also the letter of the law which we passed in 1924. Now I go further, and I want to say this, that an obligation is put on the Minister under this Act. This Act gives very large powers to the Government of the day, and the Minister has used the power in such a way that it cannot be said that he has exercized a proper discretion under this Act. The Act in Clause 9 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister shall satisfy himself that the applicants are sufficiently representative of the undertaking or industry.</block>

<p>and in this agreement the Minister, in pursuance of that requirement, says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am satisfied that the applicants are sufficiently representative of the said building industry.</block>

<p>I would ask hon. members in this House, can it be said that an industrial council sitting at Johannesburg or Cape Town, composed of persons taken from these great centres of industry, is representative of the building trade or of the employers in the outside districts of South Africa? That is what the Minister has to satisfy himself of. The farmer who puts up a farm building becomes part of the building industry for the purpose of the Act. If I as a farmer living at Prieska or Upington put up a farm building, the materials of which cost beyond £400, I become an employer in terms of this Act, and it is for the Minister to satisfy himself that the industrial council is so constituted that the farms, <span class="col_1625-1626" refersTo="page_0883"/>villages and outside districts are properly represented on that council. He has given such a certificate. I say that this is an improper exercise of his discretion. I would say, without entering into a controversy, that it is an abuse of the Act, which was never intended to be applied like this. The Act specially required that the Minister should discharge his function gravely and judiciously. For a body sitting at Cape Town or Johannesburg representing the building industry in its intensest and most highly organized form to come to an agreement which the Minister proceeds to apply in the far distant villages and the far distant veld, is an abuse of the powers which are entrusted under this Act to him.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to point out that I ruled out the word &#x201C; abuse &#x201D; as applied to the powers exercised by Ministers. I hope the right hon. member will not use the word.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smuts">

<from>&#x2020;Gen. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMUTS</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps the word &#x201C; abuse &#x201D; is not the proper word. You will understand, Mr. Speaker, that no imputation of a personal character is made against the Minister, but I am sure the very grave powers given here have been misused by the Minister, have been applied in a way not in accordance with the intention of this Act. What are the results going to be? I think I have shown the House that in the first place the Minister has gone beyond the meaning and intention of this Act in applying it ruthlessly and indiscriminately to farm buildings. I think I have also succeeded in showing that the Minister has not exercised proper direction in saying that the national industrial council is representative of all the interests concerned. I should like to know what farmers in the outside districts are represented in this council. They become employers in terms of this Act&#x2014;what representation have they got? I think they have never heard of it. Take Lindley in the Free State. Have the farmers in that area any representation whatever on the council, and what right has the Minister to say that the council properly represents them? They know nothing about it. But in a most autocratic manner the fiat has been issued which tightens on them bonds which were forged, not for them at all, but for Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. This Act is a good one. Properly applied, I look upon the Conciliation Act as one of the greatest instruments of reform in this country. But it is very easy, by misapplication of it, to bring the whole Act into suspicion, and to raise a great agitation in the country for its alteration in the future. What are the consequences going to be of this act of the Minister&#x2019;s? hitherto it has been customary, when buildings are put up in our villages all over the country, for the local people to do it. They are not experts, they are not highly-trained artizans, they are not capable of earning a wage of 3s. 4d. per hour. They have never been paid it, and they have never looked for it. They are simply semiskilled people, not entitled to this high wage, and the local contractors have recruited their labour force from the villages. But what is going to happen under this agreement which emanates from Johannesburg and Cape Town, forged by the employers of Cape Town and Johannesburg and the trade unions of highly-skilled men? These semi-skilled people in the villages are going to be eliminated. We know it; we have seen complaints in the press from all over the country that in Potchefstroom and many other places people who were engaged in this industry and who made a decent living are now simply thrown on to the streets to join the army of the unemployed, because the owner who has now to put up the building and pay these rates can only bargain for the highest-paid and highest-skilled men. That is what is happening and will happen more and more under this agreement. We are a young country, and the expert skilled tradesmen in this country are a small number, and they are almost entirely confined to the great centres. If we are going to make them do all the work of the country and eliminate the thousands of men who have hitherto been doing this work in the villages and on the veld, I think we shall be doing a very grave injustice to these people, and we shall give a decided setback to the development of this country. What happens to-day if a farmer wants to build a building on his farm? He gets some trained masons and he gives them a lot of native labour, and the result is a building goes up, a building which stands there for generations. That is the sort of thing which we have been seeing all our life in South Africa. Hon. members do not realize, and the country does not realize, that under this sort of agreement that kind of thing is coming to a stop. If I want to put up a building on my farm, I fall under this agreement. I shall have to pay these wages, and I shall have to rule out the semi-skilled and native. The result is that a farmer, with all the troubles and expense which he already has, will say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If that is so, I cannot put up a building at all.</block>

<p>And if he does put it up, it will cost twice or three times as much. I will ask the Government to consider this position very carefully. We have passed this Conciliation Act in order to provide means for conciliation, to act as a buffer between employees and employed in the great centres and areas of intensive industrial development. There you have the employers organized on the one side, and you have highly-skilled workers organized in their unions on the other, and the Conciliation Act was passed as machinery to bring these two together in order that they might settle their disputes and prevent strikes and other labour dislocations. But it never was intended that this Act should be extended from those big centres for which it was passed to the veld, to the small villages, and all over the country. If it ever actually applies, then it will raise such a commotion in this country as we have not seen hitherto. You can imagine a person in Gordonia, or a person <span class="col_1627-1628" refersTo="page_0884"/>somewhere in Bushmanland, putting up a building and being confronted with this agreement. He has to ask for contracts in Johannesburg or Cape Town, and he has to pay these wages and keep to these hours. I would very strongly urge the Government to beware. I do not think you could show up the evil tendencies of the present combination which forms our Government in this country more clearly than by an incident like this. I do not want to labour the point any further. I hope this matter will be taken into revision. I hope the Government will awaken to the fact that they have been giving a free hand to one section in the Government, and that section has been applying what lies far beyond the legitimate province for which the Conciliation Act was intended. If this continues much longer, there will be a very serious revulsion, and this Act will be in danger not only in the veld, but in the great centres of population. The matter is so important, and is a matter of so very strong criticism in the press and the country generally, that I cannot understand why the Minister in his speech did not take the trouble to refer to this matter. I hope he will do so this afternoon, and make a statement which will reassure the country and show the country that the Government is prepared to reconsider the whole matter.</p>

<p>I am not at all sorry that the right hon. the leader of the Opposition has raised this question, because he has raised a number of quite serious and important points which I will do my best to deal with. Of course, it provides members on the other side with perhaps an opportunity of trying to antagonize against the present Government a certain section of the population, particularly on the farms and in the country, but there is also so much in the arguments that I welcome the opportunity to explain the position. I did not deal with the question the other night, because my time was up, and I did not like to trespass unduly on the indulgence of the House when they granted me an extension, but seeing that the right hon. member has raised it now, I welcome the opportunity of dealing with it. It was not that I wanted to shirk it the other evening. The right hon. the leader of the Opposition says that this Act was passed by the last Government, but the present Government has abused its power in giving effect to and in administering it. I hesitate to think how it would have been administered, and whether any benefits would have been derived from it had its administration been left to the last Government, because he quoted large areas, and he referred to the 3s. 4d. an hour, and said these areas should never have been included. He said that the rates were too high, that the contractors of small places were not used to this legislation, and that we were eliminating large numbers of people who in the past had been employed.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Do you deny this?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Let me give the history of this. For four years before this Act was passed by the last Government, the building industry, in consequence of disputes, upheavals and dislocation of trade, arrived at a voluntary agreement&#x2014;the same as in the printing industry. The printing and building industries, before this legislation was passed, decided that it would be in the best interests of the industries as a whole that they should arrive at some agreement, and they gave effect to that by voluntary action. The Master Builders&#x2019; Association, which contains members in small as well as in larger places, and the trade union organization, which also contains members in small as well as larger places, drew up a voluntary agreement, and it was in operation when the Industrial Conciliation Act was passed. With a few exceptions, that voluntary agreement provided for exactly the same areas as are provided for under the agreement to-day. I will take the point of the right hon. the leader of the Opposition, that in making it applicable to building in the countryside, we are in conflict with the Act&#x2014; something that the Act never intended, or does not allow. The right hon. member quoted the first clause of the Act, which says it shall not apply to any employment in agriculture or the farming industry. The right hon. leader of the Opposition might know more about it than the law advisers; but the law advisers did not regard putting up a building in the country, or anywhere else, as employment in agriculture. Let me give the Opposition a case in point. Take the case of a boarding-house keeper in Johannesburg who was prosecuted because he was putting up a certain building for boardinghouse purposes, and was not complying with the terms of the agreement. The case went into court. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am not a builder, but a boarding-house keeper;</block>

<p>and the court laid down the dictum that while he was actually building the premises he was, for the purposes of the Act, in the position of a builder or contractor. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) will remember the case. I will give the right hon. the leader of the Opposition the whole case, if it can be shown that the building of a house, a mill, or anything else in the countryside is agricultural work, what we have done, therefore, is ultra vires. But the law advisers do not say so.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>What was the intention of the Act? Its intention was to prevent industrial disputes by means of a settlement and an agreement to be arrived at by employers and employees, and if the agricultural employers&#x2014;the farmers&#x2014;want to take <span class="col_1629-1630" refersTo="page_0885"/>advantage of the Act, and they made an agreement with their employees for the purposes of arriving at wage conditions, etc., that would be a contravention of the Act, because it is specifically excluded. Might I say that it is a bit late in the day, also, for hon. members to draw attention to the particular point, because the Act has been in force since it was passed, namely, three years ago&#x2014;since the present Government came into office, and on less favourable terms than it is to-day. I asked the Industrial Council to put in this special exemption clause&#x2014;to put in the clause, not until the value of the building material is up to £400. Until that was put in it applied to every building, and it was put in only last October.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it did have the force of law. That agreement was first gazetted shortly after the Act was passed in 1924. My hon. friend (Col. Creswell) was in office. Under the terms of that agreement, every building in every area scheduled in the agreement came under the provisions of the agreement, which had force by virtue of the Act. The Industrial Council put in a general exemption clause to meet the very case the right hon. the leader of the Opposition referred to, as far as the man in the countryside is concerned. I will read out the exemption clause. The right hon. member for Standerton might have read C, which has a bearing on the important points. He did not refer to the fact that in the small places the local committees laid down local rates. I will just show how the right hon. the leader of the Opposition&#x2014;I do not say intentionally&#x2014; is misleading. He quoted those areas which are to be covered, and said that 3s. 4d. an hour was to be the rate, irrespective of who was to be employed in those areas. I will just read out the agreement, and show where the right hon. member for Standerton has gone so far astray. He quoted Potchefstroom, Heidelberg and other places. But as far as Pietermaritzburg is concerned, the rate is 2s. 11d., and not 3s. 4d.; in Kimberley the rate is 2s. 9d.; in Grahamstown, 2s. 9d.; in King William&#x2019;s Town, 2s. 9d. The right hon. the leader of the Opposition referred particularly to Ladybrand, and said you lay down conditions there such as in Cape Town and Johannesburg; but the rate in Ladybrand is 2s. 6d., laid down by the local committee.</p>

<p>Will the hon. member keep quiet? I want to deal with the right hon. the leader of the Opposition. I cannot deal with everybody at the same time. The Industrial Council has been working on the voluntary agreement for all these years. They now ask their own local committees to lay down local rates, and in addition to that they put in a special clause which enables them to grant an exemption for any reason whatsoever to any person who cannot earn the wage laid down by the local committee or the National Council. These points have been fully met. Take Potchefstroom; there are a large number of special exemptions. The Industrial Council realize that in smaller places conditions are quite different from the towns. That puts an entirely different complexion on it, than the complexion the right hon. the leader of the Opposition has tried to put on it in this House.

Surely they are entitled to some support, sympathy and consideration from this House. Under the agreement they are supposed to enforce its terms in respect to all those who are parties to it, while the Labour Department enforces the agreement in respect of those to whom the terms of the agreement is extended, but who are not actually parties to it themselves.

<p>It is a sign of confidence, security and industrial and peaceful progress. Before the agreement a builder could not make a contract without feeling that he might not be able to fulfil it on account of strikes or the men demanding higher wages. Many a contractor previously lost heavily through having to pay higher wages in the middle of a contract, the demand practically ruining him. This agreement is one of the greatest blessings the country has ever had, because of the freedom we have had from strikes, and even if we have to pay a little bit for it, it is well worth it. There is no country in the world to-day which would not jump at the three years&#x2019; industrial peace which South Africa has enjoyed. Strikes and upheavals and conflicts between capital and labour are the greatest troubles of other countries, all of whom would be prepared to pay heavily for the peace which we have had in South Africa. During the last five years before this Government came into office, there were 175 strikes in the Union&#x2014;these are the official figures.

<p>They are not affected until they start building. I got the council to exclude last October all buildings on farms when the material was valued at £400. It was estimated that the cost of material in a building, the total cost of which would be £1,000, would be £400. Up to then there had been no exclusion whatever. This will show at any rate, that as far as I was able I was solicitous regarding the interests of the farming community. The fundamental principle of the Act, and it is a sound one, is that it gives an industry home rule, and if an industry makes an agreement, we legalize it. There are, however, so many conflicting elements and interests, human as well as financial, that it is a difficult Act to administer. However, we are doing our best to carry it out in a fair and just way to promote and maintain industrial peace, to make an end to strikes, and to give the good contractor and the good workman in town and country a square deal.</p>

<p>The Government take tremendous credit for having had no strikes within the past few years, but the leaders of the Labour party have had something else to do besides fomenting strikes. All their influence has been applied to keeping the men quiet, for the less trouble they have the more credit they claim for the Government. Prior to the present Government taking office, however, these hon. gentlemen used to go round the country stirring the men up, but now it is a very different story. I think it is not far from the truth. My friend says this agreement has worked well. There are various opinions about that. It has had the effect of throwing hundreds of semi-skilled men out of employment. My hon. friend can shake his head as much as he likes, but we have evidence. Take the small builders in the Cape Peninsula. They have employed these semi-skilled men for many years, but they cannot continue to employ them at 2s. 9d. per hour.</p>

Up to now, I have worked under that impression, and I have been doing building work on my farm, but I did not expect this Bill to apply to it.

I always opposed that Act of the Smuts Government in its application to the countryside, but now hon. members there want to put the blame on us for the Act which is their own.

<p>I have carefully read the Act, and I also protest against its being applied <span class="col_1635-1636" refersTo="page_0888"/>on the countryside. On behalf of my constituency and the countryside, I protest against its application there, but the Act against which we are protesting is one made by the former Government. The Minister is administering an Act for which the former Government must bear the blame. I ask the Government, however, to amend the Act so that it is clearly stated that it shall not apply on the countryside, a thing which the other side did not set out clearly. If it is possible and necessary, I ask the Government during the present session to make the amendment in the Act, so that the misunderstanding can be cleared up. We are thankful that the time of strikes, which we had under the former Government, when there were no less than 175 strikes, has gone by. We have not yet had one strike, but if this Act is applied on the countryside, we shall have our first strike among the farmers. As we have these terrible droughts, and have to deal with all kinds of difficulties so that often everything which has taken years of hard work to accumulate becomes ruined in one year, it is an impossible position to apply the Act to us and make us pay those heavy prices. I make another appeal to the Government which stands up for the farmers&#x2019; interests to amend this Act passed by the last Government. There is great misunderstanding among the farmers. When the Wage Act was passed I told them that it would not be applied on the countryside. When a part of my constituency was proclaimed under the Conciliation Act the farmers came to me and said that I had told them the Act would not be applied to agriculture. The Acts are mixed up, and a great deal of the misunderstanding with reference to them is due to hon. members opposite. I am, however, glad that the leader of the Opposition has got up here to-day and expressed his disapproval of his Act being applied in the countryside.</p>

<speech by="#krige">

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KRIGE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must not be impatient, because I am trying to make the matter plain to him. The Act further provides that if there are disputes in a particular industry then the employers and employees meet together with the object of coming to an agreement. If an agreement is come to, it has not the force of law unless the Minister approves of it. The responsibility rests with the Government to ultimately give the force of law to the agreement. That is the first responsibility of the Minister. But in the second place, with reference to the building trade, the areas which are established have also to be confirmed by the Minister. The full responsibility remains with the Minister, because he has the fullest right of referring the agreement back and saying that it must be amended in one respect or another, and that he does not agree to its being applicable on the countryside. The Minister did not do that, but accepted the agreement, confirmed it, and published it in the Government &#x201C; Gazette,&#x201D; and, consequently, it has the force of law to-day. The Minister is the person who bears the responsibility. I am, therefore, not surprised that the Minister said that if this side of the House had remained in power the Act would have remained a dead letter. He thereby admits that the Minister must take the responsibility. It is not only that difficulty which may be caused with reference to the wages under the Industrial Conciliation Act, but under the Wages Act, which was passed by the present Government, many difficulties may also arise. If there is one thing which cramps the industries of South Africa, then it is the impossible wages and regulations which are laid down. If we are to apply the wages on the countryside as drawn up by the Minister, then I say one can say good-bye to agricultural development. If the Minister wanted to assist the farmers he would have had sufficient aid under the Act as it stands. If he had any knowledge of circumstances on the countryside he would know what the intention of the Act was, irrespective of what the legal advisers say. Even if they say that the Act applies to the countryside, then the Minister has the right to refuse to apply the agreement, and he can refer it back to and say what portion he will not apply. Before the Minister approves of the agreement it cannot have the force of law. I hope the Government will consider the matter, because even now the Minister has the right under the Act to refer back the agreement with the approval of the Conciliation Board. He does not, however, want to do that, because he is determined to carry it out.</p>

<speech by="#sampson">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SAMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>When I was listening to the right hon. the leader of the Opposition just now, I was in some doubt as to whether he was attacking the principle of the legislation which his own Government passed or whether he was attempting to enter into some legal quibble with my hon. friend the Minister in respect of this agreement. If this is purely a legal matter, surely it is one for the legal advisers, and if somebody has, by means of an agreement, broken the law, the court is the proper place to fight that question out. My hon. friend has told us that the matter has already arisen, and practically been determined by the court, and I am glad it was determined in the way he stated. One can picture a man starting a manufactory on a farm with a view of evading this Act. Far more serious to my mind is the attack which has been made on the underlying principle of this Act by the other side, and for the greater part the right hon. gentleman&#x2019;s speech was devoted to a ridicule of the principle, not so much to the legal <span class="col_1637-1638" refersTo="page_0889"/>quibble, and followed as it was by the speech of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), it seems to me that some great change of opinion has taken place inside that party, that they no longer belong to the school who support voluntary agreements, round-table conferences, fair conditions of labour, but they want to expunge all these provisions from the legislation of this country. I hope they will make their position clear to this House and the country at large as to what they mean. I want to assure them of this, that there are tens of thousands of people in this country today who are benefiting by the law they passed, and it will come to them as a great surprise to find that there is even a small voice raised in this House against that very successful principle which they started, and for which they are entitled to credit. What is the underlying principle of this Bill? To get at that, we have to go back to where we were before this Bill was passed. Not only in the towns, but in the country we had disputes. The Rand was aflame with industrial disputes. Hardly a day passed when we could not pick up our newspaper and find that some industrial dispute had broken out. Here in Cape Town no building was going on for many weeks when that scale of pay, which was read a little while ago, if I recollect aright, was laid down as the scale of pay for Cape Town, before this Act came into force as the result of a long strike and great inconvenience to the public. It was at that juncture that the late Government came along and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are going to stop industrial disputes by means of prohibiting strikes.</block>

<p>They proposed that a strike should be delayed until the parties to the dispute should have had a conference, and they went on to say that even if the conference should break down a mediator and even an arbitrator might be called in, so that some agreement should be come to. The award of an arbitrator would then have the same effect as an award of court for the period for which the agreement was made. The people concerned were compelled to hold to that agreement under penalty of imprisonment or fine. It is obvious how little chance there is of negotiating an industrial agreement if it concerns only a portion, and not all the persons engaged in the industry. In the first place an agreement cannot be registered at all unless there is a majority of employers and employees engaged in the industry parties to the agreement, and it contemplates forcing the minority outside into line. In the working of these agreements it is quite true that we are finding in South Africa a very sad state of affairs. Inefficiency everywhere, inefficiency grown up through lack of training and proper apprenticeship, and all these things. I venture to say to members of the Opposition that they will have the greatest difficulty in finding any agreement in existence which does not provide a back door by which the person who is inefficient may be left at his work and not expected to get the full conditions laid down in the agreement. Meanwhile, we are trying to improve the worker. The Apprenticeship Act, as I understand it, is working well, leading to greater apprenticeship in the country, and in the future you will have plenty of competent workmen able to fill the places of the other people and entitled to and able to earn the wages laid down in agreements. The last speech I heard before I went overseas was one by the right hon. leader of the Opposition, who was entirely opposed to the principle of the Wages Board Act, viz., the arbitrary fixing of wages. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have got the Industrial Conciliation Act and we are looking to the voluntary agreements framed under that.</block>

<p>What does he mean now&#x2014;that both are no good? I say this, that there is no other alternative if we listen to the right hon. member and abolish these Acts than to go back to the state in which we found the country four or five years ago, ridden hard with industrial disputes, all sorts of passions at work in the country, and hatred being bred between employers and employees. I am sure members of the Opposition do not want to do that. They want it both ways. They want industrial peace and, at the same time, low wages and bad conditions; they want competition between workers, but no competition between themselves. I think the Minister has administered the Act with very great fairness to the trade unions, and very much in the interest of the public. I know that if there is anything in any agreement against the public interest the Minister soon pulls up the bodies concerned. I hope he will follow the policy he has pursued in the past in regard to these agreements, and I am confident it will be to the interest of all concerned in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. VAN HEERDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, consultation. There was no consultation. The first we heard of it was that the Act was proclaimed. What happens is that an industrial board which is established in a large town itself also exercises its function over surrounding villages which are not represented at all. Take the Queenstown Board. It was established there, <span class="col_1639-1640" refersTo="page_0890"/>and the regulations apply at Queenstown, but also to villages like Molteno, Sterkstroom, Tarkastad, etc. That creates an impossible position, because in the small villages there are not many trained men who, e.g., can erect a building from foundations to roof. It is as the Minister himself has said, the competent people in the small villages, who know all the trade are contractors. They have, in many cases, previously made contracts for the building of houses, and suddenly the labour inspectors come and say that they are to pay the high wage. It is impossible for them to go on with the work if they have to pay higher wages. That is impossible in the small villages. The contractors there cannot enter into a contract any longer. The contractors from the large towns freeze them out because they have the skilled workmen and can, therefore, pay the wage. We are not so much opposed to a skilled man being paid the higher wage, but any man that takes up a trowel or a hammer has to get the higher wage under the regulations. All these people come under the Act.</p>

<p>Now the Minister says that if a farmer builds a barn to shear his sheep in it does not fall under agriculture, but under the building trade, and so the Act is applied to the farmers. It is also clearly stated in Section 9 that the responsibility remains in the hands of the Minister. When the Minister spoke this afternoon I asked him a question in connection with the areas in which the agreement was proclaimed, but he did not reply. He said, however, that the regulations were proclaimed in the areas where such an agreement already existed, and he added that if any place was proclaimed in future, he would see that the conditions were not so harsh, and would not be applied to countryside areas. Why, however, have the regulations already been applied in the small villages around and in the neighbourhood of the large towns? The regulations operate harshly in the small villages, and they are not required at all. Hon. members of the Labour party have said that we farmers make our people work as much as possible and pay as little as possible, but let me tell them that the protests are just as great from the employees as from the employers.

<p>There is considerable misunderstanding, and even the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) was under a very great misconception. In 1925 he travelled round my district and said that the high wages in the building trade had come into operation as a result of the Wages Act of 1925. The hon. member for Hopetown (Dr. Stals) was also present, and the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) will remember that, after he had made the statement, we specifically asked him what Act was responsible for the higher wages of which he had complained. He then corrected himself, and said that it was the Industrial Conciliation Act, and then we asked him who had passed the Act. He, therefore, also in the first place said that the Wages Act was the cause of the wages in the building trade. I do not know whether he made a slip of the tongue, but he only admitted after cross examination that it was the result <span class="col_1641-1642" refersTo="page_0891"/>of the Industrial Conciliation Act. The first agreement under the Act was proclaimed at the end of 1924. That agreement continued in force, and now there comes a new agreement which is a continuation of the old one, but what is so strange to me is that hon. members opposite now suddenly wake up and proclaim all the evils of the agreement. The Hon. member for Standerton said that if it is applied to Gordonia, Upington, Bushmanland and Prieska, it would be undesirable. He did not then frighten those farmers, and he possibly thinks that he will now frighten them by mentioning what injurious results the application of the Act will have for them. I may say that not a single complaint from farms in those districts in connection with the administration of the Act has come to my notice. If I had heard it I would have gone to see the Minister about it, because I agree with the hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) and other hon. members who said that it was not the intention of the framers of the Act to apply it to farms. What I object to is that the legal advisers now state that the section means that buildings erected on the countryside fall under the Act. We cannot agree with that. Where the section mentions any farming industry, it also means any operations in connection therewith, including buildings, wagon houses, shearing barns, stables and (I may even say) a dwelling house, which are all things required for agricultural operations, and I think that they are all included under the exemption. Therefore, I hope the Government will take steps to have them included, and will see to the section being amended, because the construction of the legal advisers creates an impossible state of affairs. Hon. members opposite must not try to-day to blame the regulations. That agreement was made under their own Act, and if it is applicable we must be the first to ask for an amendment.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRACHAN</person>:</from>

<p>It may be somewhat brutal to have to say it, but when Mr. F. S. Malan, the then Minister of Mines and Industries, was piloting the Industrial Conciliation Bill through this House in 1923, so little interest was taken in the measure by members of the South African party that many of them were unaware of the fact that they were committing themselves to co-operation and conciliation in future industrial disputes, instead of carrying on their previous policy of shooting first and investigating afterwards. The right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) actually made the mistake in 1925 of attributing to the Wage Bill what was actually due to the Industrial Conciliation Act. This bears out the contention that members of the South African party did not take sufficient interest in what is probably the finest piece of industrial legislation ever enacted in this country. I served on the select committee to which the Industrial Conciliation Bill was referred, and it was quite a pleasure to find such broadminded and progressive master builders of Cape Town as Mr. A. B. Reid and Mr. M. J. Adams, asking Parliament to legislate along lines compelling the unfair employer to pay the same rate of wages as his competitor, who is prepared to maintain a reasonable status for the workers. Mr. Adams, in the course of his evidence, stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The natural result of competition engendered by outside employers giving low wages is that the associated employers are compelled in their own protection to suggest a reduction of wages to their employees, which would probably not be justified except on the plea that the outside employers are obtaining most of the contracts. These reductions are, naturally, resented by the trade unions, and the community is then plunged into a strike.</block>

<p>I know from my own experience that what Mr. Adams stated is exactly in accordance with facts. The fair employer is prepared to pay a reasonable standard of wages. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) adheres to the law of supply and demand in human activity, whereby a man shall be paid in accordance with what he is able to earn, but, of course, the employer is to be the judge as to what a man&#x2019;s capabilities are. Thank heaven we have men like Mr. Adams, who says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fostering of industries in the Union of South Africa is a policy strongly advocated by the South African party, but any industry carried on by fair-minded employers cannot exist against unfair competition of persons whose one idea of lessening the cost of production is to reduce wages to a minimum.</block>

<p>Here we have the point. I am labouring it, but at the same time it is of sufficient importance to put emphasis on the fact. I do not know whether hon. members agree that the only way to lessen the cost of production is to attack the wages of the workmen. The South African party did so in 1921 when they reduced wages in the public services. I regret to see leaders of the South African party getting up in this House and actually condemning the fundamentals of the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>We have heard a good deal of typical soap-box oratory from the Minister of Labour and the Labour members, but it is curious that from the moment this debate started the hon. members from Fordsburg (Mr. J. S. F. Pretorius), Riversdale (Mr. Badenhorst) and other Nationalist constituencies, have, like the Arabs, folded their tents and silently faded away. Last week there was a debate here on the Architects Bill, and these stalwart boys of the old brigade put up a formidable opposition to that Bill. They said they objected to it because it interfered with the rights of the farmer, and they wanted none of these ring fences. They said: Why should they have an architect to help them build a house? They could build it as well as any architect. I am surprised none of them were here this afternoon. They wrecked the Architects Bill on the principle that it interfered with building on farms. The principle involved here this afternoon is exactly the same. The Labour members have made a great song about <span class="col_1643-1644" refersTo="page_0892"/>our wanting to keep up wages, but they have missed the point that the Bill is being applied to the farmers against the spirit of the law. I have not heard a single farmer get up on the other side and protest against the Minister extending this Bill to the farmers. The principle in this Bill is the same as the principles of the Architects Bill. Am I in order, Mr. Speaker, in quoting the speeches of the hon. members on a different topic?</p>

<p>I accept your ruling, sir, but I advise hon. members to look up Hansard and see what members on the Nationalist benches had to say about the infringement of their rights on farms. They got up and said they did not want architects. They could build their own houses. Now the Minister of Labour has laid down that they are not competent to build houses unless it is a hovel under £400. It does not seem to me to be a very high compliment. Farmers on both sides have objected to the extending of the principles of these labour principles to the farms, yet here we have it in full swing. I warned them at the election time that we should have these laws applied to the land, and here it is. The hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) says he is against it, and that the law must be altered. The only mistake he made was he blamed it on the wrong side. It is the Minister of Labour, and not the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) who has misapplied this Bill. The Minister of Labour is going beyond his mandate in applying it to the farms. If the hon. member is sincere, he should get together the whole of those who think alike and force the Minister to put a stop to it. It is characteristic and significant that the defence has come solely from the Labour benches. It is unparliamentary to use the word &#x201C; docile,&#x201D; but our friends are very quiet where such a great principle is at stake.</p>

<p>I should like to intervene in this debate to condole with the Opposition on an opportunity lost. They have made a big attack on the Minister of Labour this afternoon, but why did they not attack me last session? You know the history of this matter. Soon after we came into office, this was one of the first industrial agreements which I as Minister of Labour sanctioned.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>That was a totally different point altogether. The old agreement was not ultra vires at all. The industrial council of the building industry existed long before this Act was passed. Soon after we took office a meeting of the industrial council was held to make up a national building industry agreement. I sanctioned that agreement. It was running the whole of last session and a portion of the session before. They had an admirable opportunity of attacking me over the fearful effect on the countryside and the extraordinary way in which it was impeding the development of the country in those years. I am quite willing to admit that the agreement that I sanctioned was far too wide, that is to say, it covered bigger areas and had not all these exemptions. If they had been as vigilant as they now pretend to be, there was the whole of last session, and I think a portion of the session before, when they were perfectly able to point out the evils of this terrible agreement. The fact of the matter is that these evils exist very largely in their own imagination. In actual working it does not have any of these effects. The position is this, we have the National Master Builders&#x2019; Association and the various trades unions mentioned in this agreement are the corresponding national associations of employees. I do not know what was the opinion of hon. members opposite and of the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) when they passed this Act, but I certainly understand from the Act itself and also the declared intention of those hon. members, that their idea was, in cases where an agreement was arrived at between responsible bodies on the employers&#x2019; side of the industry, and the employees&#x2019; side, to give it the effect of law, so that it should not be made inoperative by people outside these two organized bodies doing as they pleased. We will take the point raised by the right hon. gentleman. Hon. members opposite want to frighten the country. My hon. friend the Minister of Labour has taken the precaution, which very probably I should have taken, of eliminating from the operation of this agreement, any building in the country where the materials required for that building do not cost more than £400. Let us take a £1,000 building. What did the master builders and the employees represent? They represented this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you cut out all these countryside buildings, well, a contract is a contract; we tender and we enter into a contract for building houses, etc., on the countryside, and we normally employ to a large extent the same employees as we employ on our buildings in town, say on public schools, public works of all sorts.</block>

<p>And they very strongly objected. My hon. friend has got them to modify their agreement more than I could, to these excisions, and confining it purely to the town areas and nothing else. If hon. members reflect a minute, they will see that it is extremely difficult to draw the line.</p>

<p>I am certainly not in favour of confining it to the big towns. The right hon. gentleman said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If I want to put up a building at Irene I have to abide by this agreement.</block>

<p>Why not? If he puts up a building, does he not employ a contractor? The contractor would be a member of the Master Builders&#x2019; Association in Pretoria, and he would employ persons belonging to the trade unions, and it is precisely with the object of seeing that these agreements are duly observed in the letter and the spirit that the right hon. gentleman was one of the sponsors of the Act of 1924. I want the working people of this country to thoroughly understand what is the attitude of the South African party on this matter. One can suppose this, that if the South African party were administering this Act, they would see that it was administered in as niggardly a spirit as possible, and they would confine it as far as possible to a few big buildings in the towns, and nothing else. I am surprised at the tone the right hon. gentleman took up. He criticized this agreement, the rates of wages laid down, the provision as to the working week of 44 hours, the provisions as to sanitary accommodation, and the prohibition of piecework. What did we hear from the right hon. gentleman two years ago when the Wage Bill was under discussion? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Don&#x2019;t let us have any bureaucratic interference. Let all these matters be settled between the organized bodies of employers and the organized bodies of employees.</block>

<p>Is not the attitude of the South African party that they do not want the Wage Act? When the Wage Bill was under consideration, they talked about these agreements between the organized bodies of employers and employees as the right way to regulate wages. Now, when the question of the application of the Industrial Conciliation Act is considered, they want to confine it within the narrowest possible limits, so that it will do as little good as possible in regulating the affairs of industry. The right hon. gentleman said, in reply to an interjection by one of my hon. friends who mentioned 3s. 4d. per hour, that the Minister sanctioned that. I want to know what their view is. In speaking on the Wage Act, the right hon. gentleman said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We don&#x2019;t want Government to interfere with wages. Let these matters be settled by agreement between employers and employees.</block>

<p>Yes, and when they have settled it, if the right hon. gentleman had been in power he, no doubt, in consultation with the Minister of Labour in his Government, in spite of the two parties having settled the rate of wages, his Minister of Labour would decline to sanction that unless the particular wages settled by those people were in accordance with the right hon. gentleman&#x2019;s view. If that is not Ministerial interference, I do not know what is. Then we come to the question of exemptions. I would like to know how the right hon. gentleman would administer this Act himself. It is well known in every part of the world where industrial legislation has been put in force, that particularly in the first phases of the application of such legislation, and to some extent it will always be the case, there will be persons getting their livelihood in that industry who are not efficient enough really to be worth the full rate of wages laid down. How on earth can that be met except by this system of exemptions? Properly administered, that is the way to get over from one stage to another&#x2014; to the stage in which you have these really skilled men who have not had the advantage of the working of the Apprenticeship Act, from that of the present condition where you have a large number of persons who are not skilled craftsmen, but are able to do, in some sort of way, a job. Under this general clause there are hundreds of exemptions to-day in the country. Well, what are hon. members over there grumbling about? They talk about thousands of men thrown on to the streets. It is a very curious thing that, in spite of these matters, the unemployment in this country is vastly less than it was when the right hon. gentleman left office.</p>

So long as they are not unemployed we, on this side, are satisfied that we have been largely instrumental in improving the employment position in this country. In this matter of wages and the adjustment of wages, we have to go steadily on, as my hon. friend has done, making exemptions, telling these people they have to make limitations, but, broadly speaking, applying the conditions of the industry in such a way that it does not result in friction and hardship, but works smoothly. I principally rose to emphasize what is perfectly clear from this debate, and I particularly want the working classes of this country to realize what they have to expect if they are foolish enough at any future time to put hon. members opposite into power. What they have to expect in the application and administration of the Industrial Conciliation Act is agreements so long as they accord with the ideas of the S.A. party and no one else, and not their own agreements; in every possible way limiting the progress of the workers and restricting the operation of their own Acts to which they have appealed so often as the height of wisdom. <span class="col_1647-1648" refersTo="page_0894"/>The workers have got to know that if hon. members over there receive their suffrage, what they have to expect is that all these Acts will be administered in a spirit entirely hostile to their welfare and to any real operation of industrial conciliation.</p>

<p>The application of the provisions of the industrial Conciliation Act was the subject of discussion at the last annual congress of the Transvaal Agricultural Union. Delegates were concerned as to whether the provisions of this Act would apply to farmers. It is customary to refer to different Ministers matters which arise during the congress for information. Amongst other matters this question now being discussed was referred to the Minister of Labour. This is his reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is also pointed out that the Industrial Conciliation Act, which was also administered by this department, and by which wages, conditions of labour, etc., can be laid down by means of industrial agreements, as between employers and employees, does not affect agriculture or any farming industry as these are expressly included.</block>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PAPENFUS</person>:</from>

<p>The farmers would take that view. If one is to carry on agricultural operations, it is necessary to erect buildings. Strictly speaking, the erection of a dwelling-house or a shed would not necessarily be a farming industry, but that view is not the one taken by the agricultural industry at large. The hon. member for Albert (Mr. Steytler) and the hon. member for Gordonia (Mr. J. H. Conradie), the only two farmers on the Government side who have spoken, have admitted that this interpretation has come as news to them, and they want the Minister to amend the Act. I repeat that a statement of this sort has lulled the farming industry into a feeling of security. This request has been put to the Minister by two of his followers calling upon him to alter the Act so as to exclude all operations of farming, building operations as well. I would like to know what the Minister&#x2019;s attitude is with regard to that. Does he agree? I think the majority of farmers would take exactly the same view as that adopted by those two members. I say there is no doubt that the farmers throughout this country came to the conclusion that all farming operations, including the erection of buildings, did not fall under the provisions of this Act. I am not discussing the policy of this Act. I believe its provisions should be applied to building operations in large places, but I am against applying them to any operations of farming. I know the hardship of farming and the expense of farming, and the poor game which farming is in this country. I have here another expression of opinion by the Minister of Labour in regard to a further point that was put to him, and that is in regard to the Wages Act, also by the Transvaal Agricultural Union. This is what the Minister says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Regarding the exclusion of all workers on farms from the operations of the Wages Act, special provision has been made therein excluding from its operations persons carrying on or employed in agricultural, horticultural or pastoral pursuits, or in forestry.</block>

<p>The Minister proceeds with his apologia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the result of this, of course, the Wage Board has not dealt in any way with anything that fringes on agriculture; indeed, if it had done so, it would be contrary to the expressed terms of the Act, and would be ultra vires. In these circumstances, and in the light of this explanation, it is thought your union will realize that there is no necessity at this stage to consider the amendment of the Act in the direction urged.</block>

<p>This sort of reply, I again urge, lulls the farmers into security. I pointed out on a previous occasion in this House that forestry, although it does not fall under the provisions of the Wage Act, falls under those of the Factory Act. If you do not catch them in one way, you catch them in another. If a man grows timber, and in the process of cutting it up he uses mechanical appliances, he comes under the Factory Act. Farmers are fools if they do not think they are going to be roped in under these Acts. There are farmers who go in for fruit culture, and they may plant a number of forest trees suitable for the manufacture of boxes intended for packing. You cannot cut these trees up by hand, but you have to use machinery, and when you do you are roped in under the Factory Act. Then you have as a farmer to differentiate in wages for employees&#x2014;certain men on the farm may not work over a certain number of hours, and if you do work them over that number of hours you must pay them extra wages. You must erect conveniences which will never be used; the farmer must keep records and put up with all sorts of annoyances. The House will see what a handicap the farmer labours under. You cannot have two sets of workmen, one set working eight hours a day and the other more. It causes friction if your men who work more than eight hours a day are receiving additional wages, while the other set is not. It makes farming impossible, and it is stupid to think that these Acts will not be applied to the agricultural industry. The Minister has said that anything over £400 comes under the provision of this Act. The next step will be £200.</p>

<p>I think it is a great pity that hon. members will speak as the hon. member for Riversdale (Mr. Badenhorst) has spoken, without understanding the Act. I am quite willing to take up the challenge of the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Defence, regarding the Conciliation Act. We have, on our side, never taken up any attitude against that Act, but what we object to is the way it is being administered. It is the socialist wing of the Pact that has got hold of this Act, and is administering it in a manner that was never intended when it passed this House. I want to make one point perfectly plain, which every hon. member who has spoken on the other side deliberately overlooked. The attitude that has been taken up is that the Minister had no option, and that once the agreement was entered into by the builders, he was unable under this Act to vary it, and proclaimed it exactly as they gave it to him. Clause 9 of the Act states that when any matter referring to any industry, trade or occupation has been under the consideration of the industrial council, the parties may make an application to the Minister for a declaration that any agreement shall be binding on the parties, or shall be extended to any other employers, and then the Minister may, if he deems it expedient and is satisfied that the applicants are sufficiently representative of the industry, trade or occupation concerned, publish the agreement in the &#x201C; Gazette.&#x201D; and then such terms of the agreement as he may specially indicate shall be binding in the areas defined by him. Thus the Minister has the whole matter in his own hands&#x2014;he &#x201C; may &#x201D; if he deems it expedient within the area defined by him and such terms as he &#x201C; may &#x201D; specially indicate. Therefore, let us cut out all this camouflage that the Minister was unable to depart from the determinations of the councils. It is not a new Act that the country wants, but a new Minister. I have dealt with the matter very fully on previous occasions, but I want to make one or two points from the agricultural point of view. Did the Minister consult the farmers in any way before sanctioning these agreements? Not a single member of the agricultural industry is a member of the industrial council, and the agreement was forced on the farmers without their being given an opportunity to utter a single word of protest. The Minister says the local committees may exempt the agriculturists from the operations of the Act. Are we farmers going to have an industrial council dictating what wages we are to pay, and are we to go on our hands and knees to a precious industrial council? Are we, who are the majority of voters in this country, to have no say in this matter? For that is what it amounts to. I wish to point out one or two absolute absurdities in the regulations. Do the farmers realize that if they erect a building of more than £400 in value, that a labourer who digs the foundations will have to be paid 3s. 6d. <span class="col_1651-1652" refersTo="page_0896"/>per hour, and apparently the labourer who treads the dagga will have to be paid the same rate unless the farmers ask for exemptions? Even then no exemption can be given in case of repairs. If you employ a man to whitewash your stable or cowsheds, you will have to pay him 2s. 4d., 2s. 6d., or 3s. an hour, as the case may be.</p>

<p>The only exemptions under the Act are private dwelling-houses, native residences and latrines. It seems to me we have come to the point when there will be a clash between the conservative and labour elements in this country. A matter like this will bring home to every conservative, no matter on which side of the House he sits, the way in which a small handful of labour men are able to dominate the country. The market value of agricultural production per farm in South Africa increased from £930 to £950 in 1923, or two per cent., but the net value of the production of other employees increased by 12 per cent. That is to say, that society paid two per cent. more for farm produce, but 12 per cent. more for the products of labour. In America, while the real wages of a farmer in 1920 were four per cent. less than they were in 1914, the workers in other industries were 22 per cent. better off in 1920 than they were in 1914. On the other hand, during that period farm failures increased by 1,000 per cent. It is only by the conservative elements in both parties getting together and standing against the socialistic trend of legislation, that we shall avoid drastic developments in the very near future.</p>

<p>The whole policy is socialism. I would like to see a reply from a responsible Minister. This proclamation was issued in October, 1926, and it has only been defended by the Labour party. Is this policy of extending this Conciliation Act to the country district the policy of the Ministers of the Crown? Is it the policy of the conservative elements of the Nationalist party? I think the country has a right to ask this. One thing strikes me forcibly&#x2014;the Nationalist party is one which stands for the country districts, and is one which glories in representing the platteland, and came into office on the votes of the conservative elements of the country. Yet it is a significant fact that in two and a half years of the Pact Government, we have had more socialistic legislation passed and more existing legislation applied in a socialistic direction than in the whole of the years in which the South African party held office.</p>

<p>We have listened on two occasions this session to the economics of the hon. member for Griqualand (Mr. Gilson), and we have listened to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) on finance, and I am wondering whether the South African party expect it to be so long before they come back to power that they are leaving it to their younger men to enter the fields of economics. On the question of wages in America, as far as the farmers are concerned, the ordinary farm labourer is being paid day wages ranging from 2.3 to 4.5 dollars. It is no good his giving figures of what the farmer is getting for his produce. We are greater friends of the farmers than the members of the South African party. We are anxious to secure such conditions for them that they will get full value for their produce. Long enough have they been exploited by the middleman without interference from the South African party. In the present case an attempt has been made by the South African party not only to mislead this House, but also the farming population. It is true the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has not followed that line, and I hope his line will get due publicity in the press. He has given the best testimonial the Labour party could have in this House. He has said that we are justified in claiming that we have obtained industrial peace in South Africa. Surely he does not want the country to revert to the losses which resulted from strikes? He should be the first to welcome the activities of the Labour group and the legislation which has been passed for the manner in which they tend to industrial peace. I remember the hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) complaining that the Pact Government, by its Wages Act, had brought terrible things to the people of South Africa. When he complained he did not know that the Wages Act was not in operation, and that everything that was taking place was the result of what they did themselves. Apparently, he is taking up the same attitude in connection with the Industrial Conciliation Act as he did with the Mine Workers Regulation Act. When that legislation was tested in a court of law it was declared ultra vires. The hon. member for Standerton took no notice of that, but he passed a Bill which he made sufficiently vague that the workers thought they were being protected, yet it left the employers an opportunity of going to law and upsetting it. He has done the same in this case. He has made the words so vague that he comes along and says that what you are doing is ultra vires. If he wanted to protect the farmers he could have made it clear that they must be exempted from the operations of the Act. I think he wanted to satisfy the industrialists and the employers, the big contractors who supported the South African party, and bamboozle the workers, and, at the same time, wanted to satisfy the farmers by saying that it was so vague it would never apply to them. If the right hon. member is correct that what the Minister has done is ultra vires and is not enforceable, then where is his complaint, because no farmer need fear it because, if it is applied, and he goes to court, it will be declared ultra vires.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>When the House rose for dinner I was pointing out that if the argument of the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) were correct, that the sanction given by the Minister of Labour to the agreement entered into by the Building Industrial Council is ultra vires, then why should they worry about it. Then there is no harm done whatever to the people on behalf of whom they pretend to speak. On the other hand, if the sanction given by the Minister is intra vires, if it is lawful, if he had the right and power under the Act to give his sanction to that agreement, then there is only one party to blame for that, and that is the right hon. gentleman and his Government. If they were so anxious to protect the farmers, as they pretend to be, why was not care taken to see that the farmers would not be prejudiced, assuming that they are going to be prejudiced by this agreement? I want to put another position to this House&#x2014;supposing the building industry council or the printing industry council or any council established under the Industrial Conciliation Act which was passed by the late Government had provided for scandalously low wages and bad conditions, and the Minister of Labour had taken up the attitude that he would refuse to give sanction to the agreement, because it laid down low wages and bad conditions for the workers, I wonder what the right hon. gentleman and his party would have said. They would have said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is an agreement entered into, and it is the duty of the Minister to give sane tion to it.</block>

<p>But, because the agreement happens to be one that does not coincide altogether with the cheap labour ethics and the cheap labour policy of the right hon. gentleman and his party, they ask the Minister to do something which is ultra vires. They ask him to break the law which they themselves have passed. We know that, as far as they are concerned, the breaking of the law is of no consequence. They have always been in the habit of breaking the law and coming to the House for indemnity. But that is not a practice which should be pursued by the present Government. I would go further and put this question, at any rate, to the back-bench members of the South African party, what would be their position or the position of their party, if they had been in office, had an industrial council been established under the Act for which they are responsible, and that industrial council had entered into an agreement? Would the right hon. gentleman and his Government have taken up the line of saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have passed the law, you have formed the council under that law, you have entered into the agreement under it, and we are going to refuse to sanction that agreement?</block>

<p>I submit they would not have refused to sanction it. But as it happens, the charge against the Minister is bad and unfounded, because, in reality, although the right hon. gentleman and his party made the law so vague, the Minister of Labour has shown very conclusively that he was not unmindful of the difficulties of the farming population. The Minister of Labour did not simply accept the agreement holus-bolus. Though anxious to improve the lot of the people and improve the condition of the people who work, whether it be in the farms or anywhere else, he showed that he was not unmindful of the difficulties of the farming population, and he went out of his way to make special exemptions in their favour. One of the exemptions provided that, notwithstanding the agreement entered into and the Minister&#x2019;s sanction, it should not apply in those particular areas where the material required or utilized for a building comes to less than £400. Anyone who knows anything about contracts and about building will know that where material to the extent of £400 is used for a building, it means at least a £1,000 contract. We know that the average man, if he is a business man at all, is not going to carry out work involving £1,000 himself, not being an expert. He would call for tenders, and contractors would be employed. These contractors are parties to that agreement. But not satisfied with that exemption, the Minister went further and, as is shown in Rule 19 of the agreement, other exemptions were made. Provision is made for the appointment of local committees, and these local committees themselves can give the necessary exemption. I submit that taking into consideration the laxity, to say the least of it, of the South African party Government in passing a Bill which they make very vague on the one hand and comparing that with the meticulous care and the anxiety on the part of the Minister and Government to try and not be unmindful of the difficulties of the farming population and to make exceptions in their favour, I submit that anyone who examines the matter impartially will agree that the Minister of Labour and the present Government have been very much more mindful of the interests of the farming population than the South African party Government. Surely it is right and fair, and I am sure that no member of this House will deny that it is desirable to gradually raise the standard of life in this country, to gradually raise the conditions under which people are living. It is being done under this agreement, and it is being done in a manner to inflict as little hardship as possible. The South African party does not want to raise the standard of the people, and the conditions of the people; the South African party believes to-day, as their predecessors believed 50 years ago, and as their successors will believe 50 years hence, in the exploitation of cheap labour. You must either definitely agree to this gradual development taking place under the present Government, or you must go back and scrap all your legislation and machinery for the regulation of wages in South Africa. That means you are going back to the evil days of strikes, which preceded 1924. Let me say this to the farming population and to hon. members of this House that, if they had been concerned, as I was, with certain enquiries in the Witwatersrand into wages and conditions <span class="col_1655-1656" refersTo="page_0898"/>of labour, they would have found this, that, as a result of the policy of the South African party in 1922, in throwing men on the streets and reducing the wages of those who remained in the mining industry, they would have found that the farming population in South Africa suffered to the extent of over a million pounds, because the produce they were selling to the mining industry, although the amount was the same, was reduced in value by over £1,000,000. The farming population could not do anything. They had to accept this loss of something over £1,000,000. Low wages and bad conditions affect, not only the people in the towns, but also the people in the country. The wages of one citizen creates the market for the other citizen. If the wages level is raised to a reasonable extent there is a greater spending capacity, and the farming population will benefit. If you go in for low wages, you are restricting the purchasing capacity of the people, and lowering the market, and forcing the farmers to be dependent on shipping rings and on the middlemen who fleece them. I believe the majority of our friends on the Nationalist benches will not be frightened by this charge of socialism. After all, the value of that charge can only be gauged when, on the other hand, you see the South African party going to the Labour party and saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have sold every principle of your socialism to the Nationalist party.</block>

<p>You cannot have it both ways. I am sure neither the farming population in the country, nor the workers in the town will be concerned by these arguments and bluffs put up by the South African party. I am sure that the vast majority of our Nationalist friends agree with the Labour party in this principle, that the citizens of South Africa shall be given a better chance than they have had in the past; they agree with us, I am sure, that the standard of life in this country should be raised, and they agree with us that the dictum laid down by the late President MacKinley of the United States, that cheap wages mean cheap men, and cheap men means a cheap country. After all, that principle is reasonable and right. We have been fighting in this country for many years to raise the status of South Africa. We have raised the status, and it is our duty now to do everything we possibly can to raise the citizenship of South Africa, and the policy of the Minister is a step in that direction.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEANE</person>:</from>

<p>It is the administration of this Act that is wrong. It was never meant to apply to the farmers, and the Minister of Labour went out of his way to see whether law officers could rope in the farmers, and the result was that building houses he was informed was not agriculture. When some of the hon. members opposite were on these benches, they accused the farmers of paying starvation wages. There were members then sitting on that side who offered them land, and invited them to come and try farming. The argument of the hon. member for Troyeville (Mr. Kentridge) will not hold good. After all, the South African party passed that Conciliation Act because they wished to raise the standard of living of the working man. We are the working man&#x2019;s true friend. We realize that in a country like this, unless the working man gets a decent wage, how can he bring his family up decently, and become a good citizen? No-one is more desirous of this than this party. And then the hon. member for Troyeville gets up and the tripe he talks raises the bile of any patriotic South African. What hon. members forget is this&#x2014;that, in the hinterland, way back in the desert, where material is very costly, and where the farmer, if he has sheep, wants to build a shearing shed, it is twice the cost of what it would be near the towns. You cannot build a decent shearing shed under £400. You then come under this Act. They had a system whereby the farmer employed a certain class of labour working for 10s. a day and their keep. Compare that with the men in the town, with more temptations to spend their 3s. 4d. per hour&#x2014;who is better off? Under the application of this Act, what is going to become of that? Is the farmer going to pay from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 4d. He cannot do it. You are going to stifle enterprise; the farmer is not going to build sheds. The members of the Labour party are entirely wrong. No-one is more anxious than the South African party to better the lot of the working man.</p>

<from>&#x2020;*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WAAL</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad that the hon. member understands reason and justifies my attitude. The King is the representative of imperialists in the first place. The majority of South Africans are not imperialists. A union of the white races of this country will never be able to take place while the eyes of one race are fixed on England, and of the other in South Africa. That union can only occur when all races are able to serve, respect and love the same head, and such head can only be a president. At any rate, it is not probable that the South African people, when it has to make a choice, will want a king. I, at least, elect for a republic. I, however, thought that the hon. member for Lichtenburg (Mr. Roos) made a mistake at that time when he, so soon after the war, advocated a republic. I thought that it would be better if the development in that direction took place gradually, but the matter has been forced on South African people, especially on the two late republics. President Wilson and Lloyd George both stated that the reinstatement of the rights of small nations, which had been violated, was their slogan. If the representatives of Afrikanderdom had not at that time sent a deputation to England to ask for the restoration of the violated rights, they would certainly have been reproached by posterity. The Nationalist party abode by the answer which their deputation had received, but continued the ideal of obtaining absolute independence. By that they meant, as I understood them, eventual separation from the British Empire. To me, and to many, it also meant the abandonment of the monarchical form of Government, in other words, the establishment of a republic. The policy of separation did not, to my mind, mean a statement that we possessed the right of self-determination or sovereign independence. It did not, to my mind, mean equality with England inside the empire. These rights we had had a long time, although the hon. member for Standerton will not admit it. By separation from the British Empire I understood, I repeat it, separation from the Crown as well. That is how I originally understood the hon. member for Lichtenburg, who set the ball rolling. That also is why we did not want to be more closely bound to the empire, and fought all the attempts of the hon. member for Standerton in the direction of closer union. We never incorporated separation in our programme of action. And to-day we are not making any active propaganda for it. But we want to see that the door is not closed for the realization of the ideal. The advocacy of that ideal has cost the Nationalist party dear, because it kept them out of office for many years. My comfort, however, was that when the party once got into office&#x2014;when once the pendulum swung in their direction&#x2014;then it would take place ideal and all, and then we could, so much more freely, strive for its realization. After all that struggle, the ideal is not now going to be sacrificed. The Nationalist party has concluded an agreement with the Labour party that, so long as the co-Operation lasts, no motion will be introduced into Parliament in favour of a republic. The Nationalist party will keep its word. Still more&#x2014;even if the party did not have the co-operation of the Labour party they would still not force the question on the Opposition. They only want to convince people. Only when we have convinced the majority of the English section of the desirability of breaking the bond with the British Empire&#x2014;of course in a friendly way&#x2014; can the great step be taken.</p>

<p>We shall, of course, never be able to convince a man like the hon. member for East London (City) (the Rev. Mr. Rider). You cannot knock blood out of a stone. All Englishmen, fortunately, are not so unreasonable. I thank the Prime Minister (Gen. Hertzog) that he has obtained a declaration from such an authoritative official body as the Imperial Conference that we have the fullest right of self-determination. After that frank admission the Prime Minister feels, and so do I, more well disposed towards the makers of the declaration and less disposed to oppose them. The fact remains, however, that the ideal in favour of a republic still lives in our hearts. It is a little plant which has for good or ill been put in, and which must be cultivated and watered carefully until it is big. We cannot now allow it to die. I have thought it necessary to make this clear from my point of view in order to remove the impression created by the words of the hon. member for Bloemfontein (North), which I have quoted.

Now I wish to make a few remarks with regard to the application by the Government of the Industrial Conciliation Act. The Government benches seem to have realized the extraordinary mistake the Minister of Labour has made, and to have been attempting to saddle the South African party with the whole of the blame for all that has happened under this Act. The South African party are quite in accord with and stand by the principles of the Conciliation Act.</p></speech>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STRUBEN</person>:</from>

<p>We do not attack it, but the blundering way in which the Minister has put it into force. When the Wage Bill was introduced first, I and then the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) asked that it should be laid down quite clearly that operations on farms in connection with farming should be exempt from the provisions of the measure. The then Minister of Labour said that we need not be afraid that that measure of the Conciliation Act would be applied to farmers. We do not object to the Act, but we do object to its absurd and ridiculous application by the Minister of Labour, in whose hands Section 9 of the Act places full discretion to apply it or not, according to the necessities and desirability of the case. The Act as administered now, and the circular stating that so long as the material does not cost more than £400 building operations on a farm are exempt from the Act, are going to put a stop to the erection of properly equipped shearing sheds, properly equipped stables, and may, to some extent, as an hon. member suggests, also prevent the erection of silos. I feel very strongly that our farms require better equipment in the way of houses and farm buildings, and farm servants better housing, but the effect of having to pay first-class skilled men, instead of employing the useful handyman, will be to put a stop to the carrying out of this useful work. When I took over my farm the workmen&#x2019;s families were herded together, but I built proper cottages for them. Under this Act as now applied, however, I could not have done that.</p>

<p>Are you trying to induce people to put up shoddy buildings ? The men who used to receive 10s. to 15s. a day in building construction will no longer be employed. Can you build a hygienic, up-to-date cattle byre of any size for less than £1,000? Buildings are falling into disrepair because farmers cannot afford to pay the high wages now ruling. The Minister told us this afternoon that there is more activity in the building trade than before they came into office. Of course there is, for during the war people were unable to build, and the shortage has to be made up at almost any cost. These men are to be, and are being, thrown out of employment, and there are such cases in my area, in the Eastern Province, the Midlands and Graaff-Reinet, men who are not first-class masons and carpenters, and are not being employed because of this higher wage that has to be paid.</p>

<p>I know the present application of this Act is going to stop the erection of better farm buildings. Those who live in the country all their lives, and know the conditions, would welcome anything that would allow farmers to provide better houses for their families and their workmen, and make conditions generally on the land better than they are to-day. None of us will hold that the life of the farmer and his family is the most enjoyable thing in the world. They have a lonely life with hard work, and often not an adequate financial return, and anything done to stop the amelioration of their living conditions is to be deprecated. This will perpetuate what is occurring to-day. Owing to the hard times of the farmers, and the small return they get, they are unable to do the things they would like to do. They cannot provide better houses and conditions and keep the farm property in the repair they should be kept. I see many of these splendid farmsteads, at one time kept in proper condition and a credit to their owners, are now going back. Why put another spoke in the wheel of progress ? Why depart from the spirit of the Conciliation Act and the Wage Act and the statements made in this House that those Acts would not apply to farmers ? I do not wish to get the farmer out of paying his proper share of taxation and other charges, but the principles put into operation by the Minister are a great blunder, and I think he knows it. This afternoon he did not make a very convincing defence for himself, and his followers gave the impression that they were making the best of a bad job. If he gets this amended, it will be a just and a good thing for the country.</p>

How many representatives of the industrial constituencies on the Witwatersrand have addressed the House on this question and joined the Opposition in their attack upon the Government? Not one. Gentlemen who occupy seats like that of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), whom you could not shift with a ton of dynamite, we do not find them, members like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell), standing up and attacking this Bill.

<p>I speak from my convictions. They stated that farmers could not farm without a house, and therefore the house becomes an agricultural implement. Of course he must have a house, but that does not make it an agricultural implement, and it does not mean that the men who erect it become agricultural workers. If that argument was carried to its logical conclusion, you could not apply the Wage Board conditions to any firm manufacturing agricultural machinery. The men employed in the boot factory, if it is supplying the farmer with boots, could not have fair wages and conditions because they are being used for agricultural purposes. The clothing a farmer wears&#x2014;if it is being supplied by Jagger &amp; Co. or Stuttaford &amp; Co., I take it they could employ sweated labour, because these goods are supplied to the agricultural community. If we follow the argument to its logical conclusion, you cannot have fair wages in any industry.</p>

<p>The great mass of farmers in this country are struggling farmers, and are not represented by the big financial interests. When the hon. member puts his plea forward on behalf of the farmer, I take it for what it is worth. Many farmers cannot afford to pay 3s. 4d. an hour; they cannot afford to pay 1s. an hour. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) this afternoon made a statement that one can hardly credit.

The Bill was the product of the great brains of the S.A. party, and the complaint is that it is going to mean 100 per cent. increase if applied to farms. The hon. gentleman, on making that statement, knew that there was this equivalent of £1,000 exemption. He knew that.</p>

<p>And he knew that the farmer erecting a house valued at £1,000 to £2,000 is not the poor struggling farmer, but probably one of those with a big business in Adderley Street, with a residence in Cape Town and another in the country, where he can spend his quiet week-ends. Surely the hon. member is not pleading for that kind of farmer, the man with a nice closed-in motorcar to take him home at night and keep the draught off him. From the arguments I heard from that side of the House, it was the poor struggling farmer they pleaded for, and not the man who puts up a £2,000 house. So far as the Bill is concerned, it would not mean an increase of more than 10 per cent. We have heard a lot to-day of legal quibbles, but this Act definitely lays down that it shall apply to every industrial and public utility undertaking, every industry, trade and occupation and every employer engaged therein, but shall not apply to any employment in agriculture. The Minister is not extending this Act to the employees in the agriculture industry. No member of the House can say the Minister has applied the Act to any single agricultural employee. If he did it would be ultra vires. If the Minister had done what some of those hon. gentlemen want to imply, then his action would be ultra vires. The Act distinctly alludes to the occupation, and the occupation of an employee in the agricultural industry is ultra vires this Act, but it does not exclude the building industry. Hon. members opposite passed this Act. Why didn&#x2019;t they lay down that certain areas should be excluded from its operations? You must remember that <span class="col_1663-1664" refersTo="page_0902"/>certain farming operations are carried on in this country by some of the poorest farmers within municipal areas. When this Bill was passed, the intention was perfectly clear that it was to exclude the agricultural industry as such, but not the things that members of the agricultural community may require in order to carry on agricultural enterprize in this country. The logical conclusion of the argument of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) is to exclude everything that the farmer uses.</p>

<p>No, it is no more an extreme than when the hon. member wishes to exclude the dwelling-house on a farm, because the dwelling is something appertaining to the building industry, not the agricultural industry. The farmer does not use that house for agricultural purposes. I want to ask hon. members opposite this question, if the fact of building employees erecting a house on a farm is to make that work something that this Bill does not cover, do not their arguments amount to this, that the moment a man is employed to put up a building on a farm he becomes an agricultural employee? When the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) was speaking, one wondered what became of the great promises made by that leader in the past on the Witwatersrand. The right hon. gentleman has taken us to task in South Africa in the past. We have had a bitter experience. We have not gone through hell in this country, as we, as members of the working class have done, because we liked it. There have not been strikes in South Africa because they enjoyed going on strike, and the right hon. gentleman has said to us in the past, with the full support of members of the S.A. party and the support of many hon. members who are now sitting on this side&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why do you go in for violence ? Why these strikes ? Why not come together, why not sit round a table and talk over your grievances ?</block>

<p>The right hon. gentleman has probably a good deal of justification for making the statement that the best way to deal with industrial disputes in this and other countries is to try and come to an amicable understanding. But when we find the leader of the Opposition coming forward here, as he did to-day, reading from that agreement practically sneering at the wages laid down and the various benefits conferred on both sides, one wondered what the hon. member was out for. Is he a statesmen, or is he merely a politician? If he is a statesman, he will welcome an agreement of this description. If he has any ambitions again to become Prime Minister, then he has got to deal with the great masses of the working people in this country in a different manner from the way that he has dealt with them in the past. The great grievance of the working classes is that we have found the hon. member for Standerton always siding with the big financial interests in this country. You look through the record of every one of the strikes, and you will find that the Chamber of Mines has always insisted on bringing down wages, or increasing the hours or responsibilities of the workers, before any strike took place. The initiative has always been taken by the employer, and the workers have been defending their position. The hon. member for East London (City) (the Rev. Mr. Rider)&#x2014;</p>

<p>Members of the South African party. Every representative practically in the industrial areas and the right hon. member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) himself. The right hon. member has spoken with one voice in the towns and another voice in the country. He goes out into the countryside, and he tells the people there that as far as the labourites are concerned, we are a lot of wild-headed bolshevists; we are socialists out to take the land away from the farmer; he tells them all sorts of fairy tales, and he says the Nationalist party has been dominated by the Labour party. Then he will come straight away from the country areas and he will tell us in the towns that we labourites are being dominated by the Nationalists; we are the tin can tied to the tail of the dog. It makes one wonder whether the right hon. member is a statesman or merely a politician, and one thing I can tell you&#x2014;the present Prime Minister has never earned the title of&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Slim Hertzog.</block>

<p>We are faced, in connection with this debate, with the position that hon. members on that side are doing their utmost for political purposes to try and drive a wedge between our friends from the countryside on this side of the House and we from the industrial areas. They are doing their utmost for political purposes to try and set town against country. They must remember this, that you cannot set Nationalist country dweller against Labour town dweller only; you are going to set the whole of the countryside against the towns by this propaganda, and I take it not one member of this House with the welfare of the country at heart wishes to see a conflict between town and country. Do we not rather want to see the country areas and the industrial areas <span class="col_1665-1666" refersTo="page_0903"/>doing their utmost to push forward the general interests of South Africa? If we get into conflict between town and country, then we are going to hold South Africa back. You cannot set the Nationalist country dweller against the Labour town dweller without setting the S.A.P. country dweller against the S.A.P. town dweller. Farmers in Australia have improved their position and been helped wonderfully. Some of the biggest supporters of the Labour party in Australia are farmers. Either we are going to develop in South Africa by methods laid down in this Act and by the work of the Labour Minister, or we are going to have chaos, upheaval and discontent. For heaven&#x2019;s sake, give the workers in South Africa an opportunity of advancing by constitutional methods. Every time the workers attempt to advance by constitutional methods, we have the members who represent the financial interests in this country erecting barricades in the path of constitutional progress. May I say to the farming members of this House that they have one&#x2019;s sympathy; we want to do everything we can to assist the farming industry, and it is being done by this Government to a very large extent. Farmers are getting all sorts of assistance in this country; millions of pounds are being spent on behalf of the farmers, and when it comes to the question of protecting farmers against dumping, even though we knew it might mean a slight increase in the cost of living, did we complain ? The farmer cannot claim protection unless he is prepared to give protection to other people. Whilst we realize that the man working in the agricultural area is better off than the man working in the town, at the same time I hope that as far as the farming community in South Africa is concerned, they will realize that it is in the interests of the farmers themselves from every point of view, from the point of view of the future welfare of South Africa, the future welfare of our children coming after us, to build up as high a status as you can. It is in their interest to see that South Africa is a high-grade country, and not a low-grade country, and if you are going to have sweated workers in this country, whether in the country districts or in the towns, it is going to be a bad thing for South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I did not intend to speak on this question of the industrial position, but it seems to me that the Minister of Labour takes up this position, that when he wants to penalize the farmer he says the farmer is performing work as a building employer, but when they are discussing the Conciliation Board then he does not call the farmer into the council at all. He thus says that the farmer is not a builder, or when the farmer has to be penalized he is a builder, and when he has the right to have a say he is not a builder at all. That seems to be the argument of the Minister. I do not, in any way, defend the clause in the original Act. I think it bad that the clause exempts the agricultural interests, because the farming interest takes no interest in legislation, and they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You can put any penalty on the towns so long as you include an exemption clause that it does not apply to the agricultural interest. So long as it does not apply you can do as you like.</block>

<p>The result is legislation of a very indifferent and a very harsh kind, which is sometimes put on the towns But having put it into the Conciliation Act, it is quite natural that the farmers of this country feel that they have been done. That is the cause of all this discontent. The farming interest thought they were exempted under this Act, and now found they have been sold. Personally, I must say they are justified, and there was no doubt that when the clause was put into the original Act it was intended that in no way should it apply to the farms, and no farmer should have any trouble with the Act. It is to me supremely ridiculous to differentiate between the man who is putting up a farmhouse for himself or a packing shed to pack his fruit in, and also it is ridiculous to my mind to make these exemptions. If an exemption could be made for a building of £400 and under, the Minister might have made a complete exemption of the farming interest. If he could have gone to the one point he could have gone to the other. I would like to ask what the position is of a farmer who is employing his own labour ? If he is within that area do I understand his staff, while they are putting up buildings, have to be paid the rate of wage laid down in this notice of the Minister ? Because, if so, it would lead to some very grave complications, I am afraid. Special amenities would have to be given to the men engaged on the building&#x2014;a cup of tea twice a day&#x2014;and the farmer would get into trouble if the Minister continues to apply this Act to farmers. But the Minister, I think, dislikes the clause and dislikes the farming interest being exempted from the operations of this Conciliation Act. I have a great deal of sympathy with that point of view, but if that is the Minister&#x2019;s intention lay it down openly. Let us legislate so that that clause is deleted from the Act, or carry out the intention of the House and amend the Act so that the farming interest is really exempted. I want to ask the Minister of Finance whether he can make any statement in the House as regards double death duties. He has had the opportunity since he was overseas at the Imperial Conference of consulting finance ministers, and particularly the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and I think the House and the country would be very interested to know what success he has had in getting the British Government to withdraw its objections to our proposals regarding double death duties. I need not assure him it does make a difference in getting capital in this country in competition with New Zealand and most parts of Australia if death duties are levied twice on investments in South Africa as against only once on moneys invested in New Zealand, Canada and most of Australia. I might suggest to him, as his colleagues are asking him to provide considerable sums of money in the socializing of State industries, it might be an important matter to the Government <span class="col_1667-1668" refersTo="page_0904"/>itself if they can remove any obstructions to getting money for these industries. There is another point on which I would like the Minister to give us some information, and that is&#x2014;what were the reasons which allowed the Government to assent to the Transvaal poll tax, which is giving so much trouble and annoyance right throughout South Africa. The Minister knows that the poll tax originally applied only to residents in the Transvaal, but under the amendment that poll tax was extended to all persons who were residing in the Transvaal and to all persons&#x2014;income tax payers&#x2014;who receive profits arising in the Transvaal, and nobody in South Africa, living outside the Transvaal, knows whether he is liable to the tax or not. Moreover, there is a penalty at the rate of 120 per cent. interest per annum for any tax in arrear, it is quite clear something must be done in order to curb these provincial councils. We did imagine that the Minister of Finance was going to act as a curb to these people. Is the ordinance ultra vires ? If so, the cure will come in the courts. If it is intra vires, is the Minister prepared to bring in legislation making it impossible for these provincial councils to tax people all over the Union ? Will he bring in legislation so that they can tax only their own residents ? I know of instances, even in Cape Town, and in other parts of the country, where people have had very small investments in municipal loans in the Transvaal. The fact of having £100 invested in Johannesburg municipal stock makes a man anywhere in the world theoretically, and in practise in South Africa&#x2014;where he can be got at&#x2014;liable to this tax. It is a tax with a minimum of £1 10s. if you are a married man, and £2 5s. if you are unmarried. This celebrated tax is hanging over 75 per cent. of the people with the smallest investments in the Transvaal, and I should like to hear from the Minister what he proposes to do to put this matter right.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) has asked me whether I would be prepared to make a statement in regard to the very vexed question of double death dues. I do not think it would be wise at this stage to say anything on the matter, except that when I was in England I took up the subject with the British Government and had discussions with the Treasury, and also asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider this question. Unfortunately, the negotiations have not yet reached the stage when I can make a definite statement. There are very great difficulties in the way. This Government was prepared to make considerable sacrifices if the matter could be satisfactorily settled, but, unfortunately, it does not lie in our power to do that. The British Government is not prepared to give up certain revenues from residents in England who have property in this country and are subject to our death duties. I do not know whether the representations we have made will have the desired result. The hon. member has also dealt with the question of the provincial income tax in the Transvaal. The position originally was that the provincial councils could levy an income tax without any restriction. Then, under the Provincial Subsidies Act of 1925 it was laid down that provincial councils would be entitled only to levy a tax on persons and a fixed proportion according to what the persons paid to the Union revenue. We made a further limitation that they could tax only incomes from sources within the province. What happened in the case of the Transvaal was that it decided to levy both taxes, but, unfortunately, they linked them up instead of keeping them separate, with the result that I have no doubt that the tax will probably be declared by the courts to be ultra vires. It would not be good policy for Government to veto the legislation, and it would be much better to leave the provinces to find out their mistake in the courts.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I don&#x2019;t want to go into that now. The question arises whether we should not reconsider the position in regard to these rights which the provincial councils have been given, and come back to the position which existed formerly when the provinces could tax their residents&#x2019; incomes no matter where they were derived. That is a position which the Transvaal provincial authorities would like to be accepted by this House, or we could go further and say that they can only tax their residents from incomes derived from within the province. I do not know whether the House would be agreeable to go so far as that and, if so, whether the provinces would be able to derive the necessary revenue. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. Blackwell) said that when I replied to the second reading debate I rather unfairly dealt with his criticisms in regard to the growth of expenditure of the Government. He admitted that the majority of the boards and commissions were appointed by the previous Government, using this as a peg to hang a rather violent attack on the Government, and I could not see the point of that at all unless the hon. member intended to give this as an instance of the extravagance of the Government. If the present Government did come into power on the claim that it would create economics, we did not see why we should abolish any good things done by the previous Government. We would not be so foolish as to do that. The hon. member read extracts this afternoon from speeches made by the late Mr. Fichardt when he was the chief financial critic of the late Government. I do not think I can be held responsible for every statement made by Mr. Fichardt or any other hon. member. Let me point out this&#x2014;that during these years, when Mr. Fichardt attacked the extravagance of the previous Government&#x2014;as a result of that criticism&#x2014;during the three years prior to the change of Government, very considerable economies were brought about. They reduced expenditure from revenue by £2,000,000, because they recognized the enormous growth of expenditure at that time. We always attacked unproductive expenditure which produced no <span class="col_1669-1670" refersTo="page_0905"/>interest, but we did not object to every possible sort of expenditure to which the hon. member has alluded.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>They are not even in the nature of a pension. He asked why I obtained a special warrant before Parliament met. As a matter of fact, supplies could not be got through the House and were not got through the House until three months after Parliament met. In the meantime had these people to starve ? The previous House had instructed the previous Government to take certain action in connection with these oudstryders, which they did not take. No provision was, therefore, made for this service, and we had to deal with this subsequently during the recess, whilst no provision existed.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and it ought to have been dealt with eighteen months before that. The hon. member said they were pensions they had waited 25 years for, and they could have waited three months longer. The House decided provision had to be made for these people, and for that reason we regarded it as an urgent matter, and we took the responsibility and did not allow them to continue starving. The Audit Act lays down definitely the Government can provide in case of unforeseen expenditure by means of a special warrant to be obtained and the expenditure incurred. If expenditure could not be incurred for such a case, I would like to hear from the hon. member in what case such a special warrant could be obtained.</p>

<p>On no report. The Government acted on its own responsibility, and Parliament agreed. The right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts) welcomed this expenditure, and two years afterwards, the hon. member makes this discovery, and challenges this House.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>But the warrant was laid on the Table, and it is only because the Auditor-General pointed this out that he discovered it at all. The Auditor-General only pointed out that the reasons issued by the Government to the Governor-General were not sufficient reasons, and the secretary of the Treasury pointed out he was not prepared to enter into an argument on that subject, because he did not know what other reasons had been advanced. He knew the warrant had been given, and the circumstances could be challenged and debated in Parliament. The responsibility for the special warrant must remain with the Government, and they must decide the occasions when such a warrant can be applied for, and must abide by the decision of Parliament.</p>

<speech by="#christie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHRISTIE</person>:</from>

<p>I think the committee should consider this very carefully before they pass it. We are here giving away the mineral rights in a district where the possibility is there may be exploitation of the sale of shares and the formation of platinum companies holding out to the public that there are mineral rights in this particular ground. It does appear that there is a syndicate that has been making an offer to various owners of this plot of ground, offering them a certain amount if they can get the mineral rights advanced to them. It is quite correct that there are about two-thirds of the owners at the present time in possession of these mineral rights, but subsequent to the Act they were not able to get these rights. I think that the old Transvaal Government introduced a very sound condition that the mineral wealth of the country belonged to the people of the country. What I fear is that in this particular case these settlers have been working on this land for many years and are getting along quite well, and they now become unsettled as the result of various agents coming amongst them desirous of floating a company on this particular ground. I personally propose to vote against this recommendation.</p>

<p>I think the Minister ought to give us a little more information on this matter before we pass it. I notice, for instance, that all the other grants here are specified. Here all that is given is certain lots or portions of lots. Before we give away anything at all I think it is desirable that these should be defined so that we know what we are giving away. I do not think it ought to be the policy of the House to give away mineral rights unless it is absolutely necessary, which is very seldom. I move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister should have no difficulty in accepting that suggestion. The suggestion of the committee involves what many people on all sides are against&#x2014;alienating the assets of the people to certain interests. We are not told what the extent is, the value of the mineral rights and the consideration the Government is getting in handing over these rights.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>Under the Transvaal republican Government, after the Mapoch war, the whole of the land was given out in twelve morgen lots, and in addition there was a huge commonage of about 38,000 morgen which belonged to all the plot-owners. The land was given out absolutely free, including minerals and everything. Before the Anglo-Boer war, 225 plots were thus disposed of, but there was a condition that the plot-owners could get their share of the mineral <span class="col_1679-1680" refersTo="page_0910"/>rights in the commonage, provided that they divided. Under Lord Milner&#x2019;s Government, the Crown Lands Disposal Ordinance was passed, and this included a reservation of minerals to the Crown, so that when the remainder of the plots&#x2014;about 75 in number&#x2014;were allotted, the minerals were reserved. Some time ago there was a rumour that platinum had been discovered there and the plot-owners asked for the mineral rights. I said that they could divide the commonage, but the 75 plot-owners would not agree, because they would not obtain any of the mineral rights. Last year I brought the matter before the Crown Lands Committee, and it was discovered that Parliament had no legal right to dispose of the reserved minerals, except by an Act of Parliament. Consequently the Reserved Minerals Act was passed, one of the clauses whereof provides for the grant or sale of reserved minerals. If the proposal is rejected, the minerals will be locked up for ever. The State will not gain any advantage, because it will not mine on the 75 plots. However, should there be minerals we should give these people a chance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#heyns">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HEYNS</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Committee will consent to the recommendation, because a few years ago when the platinum boom was on there was a lot of money to be made. Lagers-drift was let for £6,000, and the ground was leased on condition that the consent of Parliament was given to divide up the ground. Inasmuch as some of the lots, however were, granted after the second war of independence by the Milner Government, and the mineral rights were excluded, and the others were granted under the old republican Government, including the mineral rights, the sub-division was practically impossible. If the 71 lots which were granted after the second war of independence did not also include the mineral rights the division could not take place. It was practically, therefore, not Government rights which were being granted to the people. During the platinum boom, the people hoped that they would soon obtain the right of selling, but that was not so, because there was no time to put a Bill through. It think it is no more than right that the House should give its consent to the lots which were granted by the Milner Government having the same right as the lots granted by the old republican Government. The people have always been waiting for this, and I appeal to the House to give its consent so that everybody can be treated in the same way.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I don&#x2019;t think the information of the Minister is altogether satisfactory. I suppose Lord Milner&#x2019;s Government, at the time of making this reservation of 71 plots, must have known of the circumstances. They must have known that 275 plots had been given out with the mineral rights, and must have made the reservation with that knowledge.</p>

<p>But we don&#x2019;t know for sure whether there are minerals there or not. This land might be gold land. South Africa is a country of surprises, and we are trying to protect the people of South Africa against exploiters who buy mineral rights and exploit them to the detriment of the people. If anything is discovered there then the Crown should deal with it. I cannot understand yet from the Minister&#x2019;s explanation why it is that this ground cannot be divided up without giving them the minerals.</p>

<speech by="#mostert">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOSTERT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Waterston) is under a wrong impression. The committee have had all the information they wanted. Even if there are minerals, there are 220 odd people who have the mineral rights. The mineral rights are not on these plots. If there are minerals, they may be on the 38,000 morgen of communal commonage. There are only 71 plot holders who have not got the mineral rights on their titles. Why should we hold up the 220 for the sake of 71, and why should the 71 consent to subdivision, seeing that they have no interest in subdivision ? This matter was closely scrutinized by the committee, and we shall be doing a great injustice to the 71 people if we hold it up. The only thing is to either give the 71 people the mineral rights, or else keep the ground locked up for ever. The hon. member surely does not want this ground to be locked up for ever. The only way to avoid that is to give the 71 the mineral rights.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nicholls">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>I really cannot understand the Labour party trying to ride a principle to death like this. The principle of reserving mineral rights to the State is perhaps a very commendable one, but in this particular case the minerals will lie in the ground, as the Minister has pointed out, for ever without anybody touching them if this recommendation is not <span class="col_1681-1682" refersTo="page_0911"/>agreed to. Here you have a whole commonage which is suspected of containing minerals which, if developed, would assist these poor people who are farmers, and who would naturally have a market for the produce they are growing on their farms. Because 71 lots were given out on a subsequent occasion under a different law without the mineral rights, the whole of this land is locked up. What justification is there for the Labour party riding a principle to death in a case like this ?</p>

<speech by="#reyburn">

<p>I do not think it is a matter of the Labour party riding any principle to death. It is a question of members of the House trying to get a little information about what is put before them. I think they have a perfect right to ask for details on any matter which is put before hon. members. I would like to ask the Minister, why are these lots not specified in this report ? Why do we find simply a vague&#x2014;</p>

<p>Even if I had all the numbers of the plots and could tell the hon. member to whom they belong it would not make him any wiser. This thing does not apply to the lots.

<p>What is there to specify ? I do not know what the hon. member wants. The lots are between 3,000 and 4,000 morgen; the rest is one huge commonage of 30,000 morgen, to which these rights are attached.</p>

<speech by="#reyburn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">REYBURN</person>:</from>

<p>This appears to me a very different case, and I think a good deal of information should be given about this. There is nothing about commonage; it appears to be a clear gift by the Government of mineral rights at 1s. a morgen. Before the House passes this we ought to know more about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>This differs vastly from the previous case. The case is this, that they have bought the land and have planted orchard trees on it and then their custom is that they sell plots to people in Europe. When they wanted the transfer of this land they discovered they were not entitled to the minerals, and those people who bought the land objected. They said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You must give us the land clear.</block>

<p>Last year, or the year before last, we had a similar case in the case of the Union Citrus Fruit Company, where they had the same difficulty. These people also objected to taking the title with this reservation. This House agreed that we should sell them the minerals after we had a report from the Mining Department. I have referred to the Mining Department, and there is not the slightest likelihood of there being minerals here. It is on granite, so the Mining Department took the nominal valuation of 1s. per morgen. It is, of course, for the House to decide. I only state the case as it was brought before me, and as I brought it before the Crown Lands Committee.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HAY</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to ask the Minister whether a number of these stands, even or plots, have been sold to Indians, and what the position will be if they are ever transferred to Indians, and they have the mineral rights. Would Indians have then the right to work the minerals ? I think this is one of those cases where the clearest information should be given to the House. If we part with mineral rights in this way, the Government cannot come in and get a partnership share if the minerals are worked. We look upon mineral rights as part of the assets of the country, a heritage of the State, and the people would have no taxation to pay now if we had stuck to them in the past. The East Rand leases and our 60 per cent. share in the Premier Mine bear witness to that fact.</p>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to hear the opinion of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs on this proposal. If he had sat on these benches the welkin would have rung, but now he is comfortably ensconced on the Treasury benches, and it is quite a different story altogether; but speaking seriously, I think the committee should not agree to this. In the first instance, these people are selling fruit areas, and what right have they to promise minerals, if they did promise them ? The people did not buy up minerals in any shape or form. The fact that it is unlikely that minerals will be found there has nothing to do with the question. We have a very sound principle indeed that minerals belong to the State. I have always supported that&#x2014;there is nothing fresh about that.</p>

<p>No, but it is a very good principle indeed. As a matter of fact all the best laws in regard to mineral rights being reserved to the Crown were introduced by the right hon. the member for Standerton (Gen. Smuts), and under them we get a fair share from the mines on the East Rand and 60 per cent. of the proceeds of the Premier Diamond Mine.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly if we pass this we shall do a dangerous thing. As the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) has asked how shall we, if we grant it in this case, refuse future applications? I do not know whether it is a precedent, but the fact that a piece of ground has been proclaimed for twelve years without minerals being found, does not establish that there are no minerals. They may be found in the future. Then the State will have given them away for nothing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tom_naudé">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. F. TOM NAUDÉ</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister will agree to this special case being referred to the Select Committee. I understand that hany of the lots have been sold, and transfer passed, and the people have always held the ground minus mineral rights. If we now go and grant mineral rights to the company, who can say that the company will grant them to the holders, and at what recompense ? I think that the excuse made to the Minister and the Select Committee is very feeble, to the effect that when the ground was bought they were not aware of the fact that the mineral rights were excluded. I do not know the position in the other provinces, but in the Transvaal the system of registration is as perfect as you can wish, and it is clearly stated on every deed of transfer whether the mineral rights are excluded. When the ground in question was bought the purchasers knew that they were not getting the mineral rights. Consequently they also paid for the ground according to the fact that there was a servitude in connection with the minerals, otherwise a much larger sum than £723 12s. would undoubtedly have been paid for it. If the Minister is prepared to meet the company because of the statement that minerals have not been discovered then he will have to cancel the servitude on all the farms which have been granted without mineral rights, which have been proclaimed for twelve years and which the Department of Mines says do not contain minerals. There are thousands of farms granted by the Lands Department which are supposed not to contain minerals, and it would be a good thing if the servitude on them were also cancelled and the farmers got free title. There are servitudes against the ground. But if the servitude is cancelled for the company then the Minister will receive applications from many farmers who say that there are no minerals on their ground, and they will demand to have free title.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Hay) that I don&#x2019;t think any Indians bought there, because as you know Indians cannot buy in the Transvaal. I don&#x2019;t mind withdrawing this. It is not an essential question. These people came to me with a plausible excuse. They said people overseas had bought the land and they wanted title, and I thought it only just to meet them.</p>

<p>*In reply to the hon. member for Pietersburg (Mr. J. F. Tom Naudé), I just wish to say that he is wrong in quoting this matter of the farmers. The farmers are much better off. The Act relating to reserved mineral rights was passed last year, and many rights were granted to the farmers, the settlers. The people now applying are on a different footing. The farmers, the settlers, obtained great privileges, and under section 11 the settlers even obtained full rights. But that has nothing to do with the matter. In the circumstances, I will myself propose to refer this recommendation back.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I propose to withdraw this, or you can vote it down.</p>
