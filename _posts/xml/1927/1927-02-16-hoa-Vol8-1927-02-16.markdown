<p>First Order read: House to go into Committee on Estimates of Additional Expenditure from Railway and Harbour Revenue and Loan Funds.</p>

<p><i>Expenditure from Revenue Funds.</i></p>

<p>House in Committee:</p>

<p>On Head 3, &#x201C;Maintenance of Rolling Stock,&#x201D; £289,093,</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like an explanation from the Minister of the increase in wages of £17,050. What proportion of that is due to the civilized labour policy? Then there is £69,978 for overtime. I think the Minister should give us information in regard to these items</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to the first question, it is difficult to say. This item has not been specially dealt with on that basis, so I am afraid I cannot give the information as to what the amount actually is. As I have indicated on a previous occasion, the actual cost of employing civilized labour does not really give the exact position, because there is, according to the testimony which I have from officers concerned, increased efficiency, and it is difficult to say what that increased efficiency amounts to in pounds, shillings and pence. So that while this amount undoubtedly includes such cost, it is difficult to say what the set-off should be. In regard to overtime, the position is that we have done more business and more train miles than we expected in the first instance. Consequently it was necessary to work overtime. When business offers we cannot refuse it simply because it means overtime. I can give my hon. friend this assurance, that the position with regard to overtime has been kept under the closest control during the whole of this financial year. To give the hon. member some illustration of that, I may say that a statement giving the actual figures with regard to overtime was submitted monthly by the General Manager.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I quite appreciate that the Minister is unable to tell us what is the increased efficiency. I asked what was the total amount spent by reason of the new policy. In regard to overtime, surely the Minister will be able to give us some idea of why so large a sum was spent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>The extra business.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>It was spent on wages, as stated. But if business offers, surely the hon. member does not suggest that we should refuse that business and ask clients of the Administration to wait? The increase is due to increased business. If we did not act we would have complaints from customers of the railway.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_jager">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>To the extent that you have the improved efficiency which you claim for your scheme you ought to have less overtime. You cannot tell us that you can do the work better and more expeditiously and still have to make the excuse that you are obliged to work overtime. We can quite understand you have more business, but you also have a larger service. Your personnel is bigger and if your efficiency is also bigger that should be less reason for overtime.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid the Minister does not know what he is talking about. It is a very curious thing that you have to spend £69,000 in overtime when the total increased receipts to the end of November were only £40,000. As a matter of fact this overtime is spent in the workshops, not in extra traffic. That is the position. I am going by the receipts. To the end of November the total increase in receipts for eight months was only £30,000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>It seems difficult to get hon. members to appreciate the position. Let me give the facts. For the year ended 30th June, 1924, we handled goods classified under tariff 7 and lower, amounting to 16,700,254 tons. For the year ended 31st March, 1926, the corresponding figures were 18,641,715 tons, an increase of close on 2,000,000 tons. Surely if you handle more of this class of goods, low-rated traffic, farmers&#x2019; produce, it must mean that you must increase your staff and you must be prepared to authorize overtime. If we are not prepared to do that, would it be business, would it be carrying out the principles of the Act of Union? Would it be business if I said to the farmer who offered me 50 tons of maize, &#x201C;No, we can only take it next week&#x201D;? If my hon. friend will only be fair now that I have shown him that there is an increase of 2,000,000 tons, he must appreciate the position. For the year 1923-&#x2019;24, for which he solely was responsible, the actual working cost per train mile was 8s. 4.5d. Taking the estimates for the current year, including the additional estimates, I find that the cost now works out at 8s 6.0d. per train mile, an increase over 1923 of 1½d. per train mile. But does my hon. friend recognize that for depreciation we are making provision to a larger extent that he did, because he was starving the renewals fund, as he knows. The increased provision on that item alone amounted to £238,355, equal to 1.25 pence per train mile. But my hon. friend also forgets that he neglected to make proper provision for superannuation. Let me give him the additional amount I have to provide&#x2014;£261,985, equal to 1.35d. per train mile, or a total of 2.6d. per train mile. I am sure my hon. friend appreciates that we are actually running the <span class="col_349-350" refersTo="page_0244"/>railways at a lower cost per train mile than they were run under his regime.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. B. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister why he always estimates the cost per train mile only. Is it not a fact that costs incurred by the Administration are not always put to income and expenditure? There is an item of £7,000 in regard to insurance.</p>

<speech by="#duncan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DUNCAN</person>:</from>

<p>That destroys the Minister&#x2019;s argument that in his estimate of expenditure per train mile he has taken into account the arrears of his predecessor.</p>

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>What I said was that my hon. friend (Mr. Jagger) failed to make the necessary provision with regard to superannuation. As the result of bringing in the Act of 1925, the pound for pound contributions have materially increased&#x2014;and that is the figure I gave.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to make it clear to the hon. member. Of course, the same system of accounting has been applied in arriving at the figures I have given, but I have pointed out that we were contributing more to depreciation and superannuation, as items of expenditure, than my hon. friend, the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) contributed.

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister if some of these heavy charges for repair work are not caused by buying inferior goods at a low price? In answer to a question I put the other day, he said that of twenty-three <span class="col_351-352" refersTo="page_0245"/>engines recently purchased eighteen were already in the workshops because the bridge castings, which I understand are the frames, had cracked. He was unable to give me the figure what the cost of the repairs to these engines was. I understand it may be anything from £200 to £500 apiece. It seems to me in this respect overtime and the material in your workshops will be very materially increased, and will greatly exceed the saving on the original contracts, when you accepted a bad, instead of a good, engine. I would like the Minister to make a statement as to results of the purchase of these engines and of other rolling stock which has shown such very bad results in such a very short time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#close">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CLOSE</person>:</from>

<p>Will the cost of the repairs of the engines be something like £1,000 apiece, and will they be as good after the repairs as they were supposed to be when new?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_railways_and_harbours">

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>The position in regard to these twenty-three engines is that they were ordered from the American Locomotive Company, which, I understand, is the second, if not the largest, locomotive builder in the United States ranking equal to, or being even greater than, Baldwin&#x2019;s. The American Locomotive Company is a firm of high repute. These engines were built to the designs we supplied as the result of our actual experience with Baldwin engines which we previously ordered from the Baldwin Company. These engines&#x2014;the Mountain and Pacific types &#x2014;gave every satisfaction. Eighteen of these engines have come forward, but they have, unfortunately, developed these cracked bridge castings. We hold 10 per cent. of the contract price against the manufacturers. I cannot, at this stage, give the actual cost of repairs. The engines have been placed in the workshops and the matter has been taken up with the manufacturers. I have not the least doubt that they will make the necessary adjustments, and that we shall have no difficulty in that regard as the result of this very unfortunate experience.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>Did the Minister enquire from his officials as to their experience with American engines? His mechanical engineers should know that we ordered a lot of locomotives during the war from the United States, and that they proved a bad failure&#x2014;in fact, I made up my mind in future to order no more American engines, and I think I would have been able to carry that out. We don&#x2019;t want damages from the makers, but we want engines to carry the traffic. It was a gross mistake to order any more American engines after the experience of those we had in recent years.</p>

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Are they copies of the engines we originally obtained from Baldwin&#x2019;s which have proved satisfactory? Why, under those circumstances, did we not place the order with Baldwin&#x2019;s, which had previously supplied a satisfactory article? What was the difference in price between Baldwin&#x2019;s and the American Locomotive Company? I agree with the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) that we buy these engines in order to carry the traffic, it is quite useless to us to have thirteen engines if they are at the Salt River works, or any other works, with cracked chassis. I very much doubt whether these engines, when they are repaired, can possibly be as sound or satisfactory as British engines are. I also very much doubt whether the 10 per cent. retention money will in any way cover the cost of repairs and loss to the country through our not having engines to haul the traffic. The traffic at the Docks is so heavy that goods cannot be carried away through lack of haulage facilities. If these engines, instead of being at the works; were at the Docks, they might be of some use to the country.</p>

<speech by="#close">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CLOSE</person>:</from>

<p>Did Baldwin&#x2019;s have an opportunity of tendering for the engines of which the Minister has apparently taken a cheap imitation? We are not buying inefficiency or litigation, but engines to do the work.</p>

<p>They were also interested in importing flour, an operation about which we shall hear more later on. Let me again repeat the facts. Mr. Titren, an officer of very high standing and ability, had been considering with the technical officers the question of improving the capacity of the engines, so that they should be able to haul more traffic. As a result of the experience he gained in the United States, and consultation with different companies, a locomotive was ultimately designed which met, so far as we could see, all the requirements of South Africa. These engines were built by Baldwin&#x2019;s&#x2014;which is an American company, by the way&#x2014;the engines arrived, and we gave them a most thorough test on the main line from Cape Town to Beaufort West, and from Beaufort West to Johannesburg. I think that was about the severest test placed upon any engine in South Africa. As they stood the test, and gave excellent service generally, we decided <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0246"/>to order twenty-three more. We then asked for tenders and the Baldwin Company also tendered, but their tender was higher than that of the American Locomotive Company.</p>

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>I have not the figures now, but I will give them to the House later. The Tender Board decided to give the tender to the American Locomotive Company. My hon. friend has asked whether we had forgotten the experience we had had during the war? No, I had not forgotten it, but at that time it had been stated that it was due to the bad material handled during the war period, and explanations were given which we thought were satisfactory. Under the circumstances, I followed the business principle of accepting the lowest tender. They were both American firms, and the ordinary guarantees were given. I cannot give the loss that we are suffering, but we are carrying on quite satisfactorily with the locomotive power we have. Of course, if we had these engines doing the work as well as the other engines, we should be much better off. The design to which these engines were built was the same design, so that there cannot be any question of any inferior design.</p>

<p>The Minister has no doubt made enquiries. The other day I asked him what the experience of the department had been with regard to the Baldwin engine&#x2014;Pacific and mountain engine&#x2014;and the Minister said they had undergone a trial in this country with a run between Beaufort West and De Aar and then to Johannesburg. Was it not a fact these engines were imported into this country with that idea, and they embarked upon their work with a flourish of trumpets and advertisements in the papers? Is it the experience that the Baldwin and mountain engine have continued in traffic and carried trains to Johannesburg in two shifts? Has the experience been, what we were led to expect with a flourish of trumpets and advertisements, that two engines would carry the traffic to Johannesburg in two shifts, or that class 17A engines, built in England, have been doing the work equally well, if not better, than the Paciffic or mountain engines have been doing? The Minister is in a position to give the House the information. Is the Minister&#x2019;s experience of British-built engines on the lines of the Union of South Africa anything like the experience with the American engines? Has there ever been a case where a large number of British engines have been imported and were found afterwards to be in the deplorable condition of these engines? On that position we hope ideas have changed latterly, because there was a period of time when there was a desire to buy engines constructed by foreign firms rather than those constructed in Great Britain. We hope the political situation in that direction has changed, and we hope we can look for the support of the Prime Minister to see that it will be changed in the future. With regard to the delay in traffic, which the Minister does not think serious, I had the pleasure the other day of visiting Caledon, and was discussing the advisability with the farmers of the early fallowing of their lands, but I saw along the line great congestion. The farmers of Caledon and Bredasdorp could not get their fertilizer in time, and a considerable amount of grain was lying in the open. If rain had fallen then the crops would have been damaged, because the Railway Department could not supply the railway facilities to deal with them. If the Minister had ordered these engines in England, and they were like Class 17A, he would have been able to shift this traffic, and we should not have had this deplorable experience.</p>

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>Both the British and the German engines have given excellent service. There have been minor faults, and we have had to make adjustments in the workshops. My hon. friend asks, what are you doing about this? Why are you not purchasing in Great Britain? I am carrying out the policy of my predecessor, the hon. member for Cape Town Central) (Mr. Jagger) Just let me remind him of a reply which he gave on March 24th,1921, when I asked him for a statement whether it was correct that although certain railway orders could be more cheaply executed on the Continent, those orders were for reasons of sentiment given to British firms. This is the reply as reported in the &#x201C;Cape Times&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Jagger&#x2019;s reply was almost inaudible in the press gallery, but he was understood to say that broadly speaking the Administration were out to get supplies as cheaply as possible.</block>

<p>On April 6th Mr. du Toit asked the Minister of Railways and Harbours how many engines and how much other rolling stock had the Rail-way Administration of the Union imported since August, 1919, and to what value, and whether the necessary tenders were advertized in the world&#x2019;s markets. Mr. Jagger replied that 160engines to the value of £2,100,000, 169 coaches to the value of £1,047,000, and 2,714 waggons to the value of £1,899,000 had been imported. He stated that most of this stock was ordered during the war, and tenders were invited as far as possible under war conditions. Contracts were given out to the lowest tenderers subject to quality being satisfactory, and provided the contractor guaranteed delivery within a reason-able period. On a later occasion, July. 9th, 1921,the then Minister of Railways and Harbours gave a similar reply. I might also remind him of a reply which he gave to a question which I put to him on March 23rd, 1922. He then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have not imported a truck since my connection with the railways.</block>

<p>I may remind the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Sir Thomas Smartt) that the action of my predecessor in starving the essential services has been responsible for some of the delays. The then Minister, in his reply on that occasion, further stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is no use making trucks if they are not required. If there was anything in this country that we could make as well and as cheaply as the imported article, we would make it here. What we do import, we import from the cheapest market.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort now comes and appeals to the Prime Minister for a change of policy. Would my hon. friend, in his enthusiasm for a change of policy, introduce a Bill to alter the Act of Union? At the present time, quality and price being favourable, the order is placed in the cheapest market.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>My hon. friend the Minister of Railways and Harbours does not carry that out entirely. He does not take into account past experience. You might have had the lowest price from these other engine works, but it is not a question of design only; it is a question of material and workmanship in these engines. It is perfectly clear to me that you have not thought of the same quality of material and workmanship in the new engines from the Baldwin people. I would have gone very largely on my past experience of the American engines, which was not very satisfactory. Price would not have tempted me in a case of that kind. What we are complaining of in Cape Town at the present time is that we are short of engine power. If these engines have come out from good makers and could have moved the traffic, there would not have been that complaint. In the Cape Town docks recently a steamer arrived with a cargo of fertilizers. The stuff could not be moved from the docks, and it was lying there for some days, I believe at the importer&#x2019;s expense, simply for want of engine power. I think my hon. friend is to blame for not taking the past experience of the railways into account when he ordered these engines.</p>

<p>My hon. friend the Minister has shown a sad falling away from grace. When he came into office, and for a long time afterwards, we on our side really appreciated very much indeed his splendid testimonials to the magnificent work done by the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) his predecessor in office, and owing to the policy and actions of the hon. member, for which many of us have had to pay and gladly pay, because we knew he did the right thing, the Minister has managed to turn up a surplus or two. Now he is departing from these sound lines. I doubt whether we are going to get a surplus this year. The Minister should remember that February 15th is past now. I understand that he has been doing a good deal of overtime work at railway centres like De Aar, etc. I wish the Minister would remember that he is back in the House of Parliament again, and that he has no right to put things into one&#x2019;s mouth which were not said by us at all, and that line of conduct is really not conducive to sound argument in this House. He said that I had complained of inefficient design. I do not know anything about designs of railway engines. What I did criticize was, first of all, his having accepted inefficient engines, not designs, but 100 per cent, inefficient engines as far as I could make out.</p>

I only hope that the breezes which are blowing at the present time will bring the Minister back to a more serious and cautious state of mind. The Minister is extremely clever in avoiding a direct answer. He said that the Baldwin engines were perfect, that is, what they call the &#x201C;Mountain&#x201D; and &#x201C;Pacific&#x201D; engines.

<p>I have not got the papers with me, but I gave the information a few days ago. I believe the position to be this. We ordered 23 engines; 18 have come to hand, and, as far as I can remember, 13 are in the shops at the present time.</p>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The answer is this. Out of 23 engines ordered, 18 have developed a fault, namely, a cracked bridge casting, and a large number of these engines have been stopped for repair, while others are being worked under supervision.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#blackwell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLACKWELL</person>:</from>

<p>So I take it that the whole consignment has turned out to be unsatisfactory? They have all developed the same fault. That is to say the chassis has developed defects which has made it necessary to repair the chassis. Is that not so fundamental a defect as to make it desirable to reject the whole consignment and to ask these people to make delivery of good engines? I am certain of this, that if the Minister were in the motor trade and twenty-three motor cars were delivered to him and every one developed a radical defect in the chassis, all in the same place, the inference would be irresistible that that manufacturer was turning out work not only unsatisfactory but absolutely shoddy. I am not going to criticize the Minister at this stage for ordering these engines, but it is the future one is looking to. Surely the Administration has the right, if work is delivered which is fundamentally unsatisfactory, to reject the whole consignment? That would <span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0249"/>certainly be the case in the business world. Is it not better for the Minister to take into consideration the rejection of the consignment of engines and order other engines to take their place? In other words, if new engines on delivery into this country developed defects of that sort is it not better to face the position straight away and order a fresh supply of engines?</p>

<p>The result of this debate, I think, has shown very clearly that the members of the Railway Board are working under a misapprehension. They have got the idea into their heads that the lowest price is the cheapest. The whole base of the trouble is that the Railway Board have not enough experience. I hope this will make it perfectly clear to the Railway Board that low-priced forms of machinery are generally the dearest. I would like to point out one other serious matter about this question of railway engines. We understand that of the eighteen engines delivered, thirteen are in the railway shops and the others are working under supervision. I would like to point out to the Minister that it is not only a question of goods; it is a question of human life that is concerned if these engines are defective. I would urge that in future when considering any tenders for any vital railway requirements, the question of quality should bear a little more weight and the question of price should not bear the entire weight&#x2014;that the dearest article is probably the lowest priced one.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the Minister whether anything can be done to improve the running over that section of the line which is between Worcester and Mossel Bay. From my experience it is true you have engines that can run, but they can only run down hill. Cannot something be done not to diminish the time of the schedule, but to keep to the time of the schedule?</p>

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that the condition of the line while perfectly safe, does not permit us to put heavier engines on the rails, and, under these circumstances, with the great increase of traffic that has taken place, the officers find it most difficult to keep regular time. As he knows, we are re-ballasting and re-laying the line, and when that is completed we shall be able to deal with the whole matter satisfactorily.</p>

<p>I should like a little more information from the Minister about the discharge of a number of white men at Bloemfontein station about which I recently asked a question. From the 1st December to the meeting of Parliament about 30 labourers were discharged, and, according to the return of the Minister, 22 have already been re-employed. I would, however, like to have a little more information about the circumstances. The Minister stated that the 30 persons had been employed for special work and were discharged when the work was finished.

<from>†*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SWART</person>:</from>

<p>The young fellows, although they were appointed for special work, were suddenly informed that they were no longer required. I think that the Administration might certainly have informed them a little sooner how long the work would last, or at any rate given them notice a couple of days before their discharge. The young men for a moment did not know what to do. They had made arrangements for lodging, etc., until the end of the month, and were suddenly discharged in the middle of the month. Now in connection with the appointment, I just want to point out that Mr. Beavan, acting assistant general manager, stated to the &#x201C;Volksblad&#x201D; that he had made a mistake with reference to a few of these people because they were not appointed for special work, but as permanent white labourers. Whether the men would have been re-employed if I had not taken steps in the matter I do not know, but the mistake was made, and I want to ask the Minister to enquire whether a mistake was not made with the other persons. The people were only re-employed after their meeting of protest and I had brought <span class="col_365-366" refersTo="page_0252"/>the matter to the notice of the Minister. I asked the Minister further in my question how many natives were appointed in the room of the white men discharged. His answer was that at Bloemfontein station no natives were employed in the place of the whites. That is true, I know. That was not my question. A shunter at the station told me that two of his white boys were taken away and two natives brought from another part of the station to do their work. No new natives were appointed, but it does not have a good effect if the work which is to-day being done by white men is to-morrow done by natives. The white boys naturally ask: Why are we discharged and the natives do our work? In the interests of the policy of civilized labour in general, and of young men in particular, I want to ask the Minister to make further enquiry as to the circumstances of the discharge of these 30 people at Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>I should like to know why branch line rates are charged over the railway from Worcester to Fore Bay Junction, which is no more a branch line than the railway from Klipplaat to Oudtshoorn, or from Port Elizabeth to Graaff-Reinet. The consequence of this differentiation is that the Cape Town traders are handicapped as compared with the Port Elizabeth traders. In other words, the Minister charges a higher rate for carrying goods from Cape Town to Oudtshoorn than from Port Elizabeth to Oudtshoorn, which is not fair. How can he expect Cape Town to flourish under conditions of that kind? It is most unjust. I have already called the Minister&#x2019;s attention to it. There is far more traffic on the line from Oudtshoorn to Mossel Bay than on the other line. We don&#x2019;t ask for a privileged rate, but the same rate should be charged on the Worcester-Mossel Bay section as on the line from the east.</p>

<p>No, we were very careful to ensure that the line would be run under the most economic conditions, but the cost has gone up, and the hon. member would be the first to admit that that could not be avoided. I hope the time will come when it will be possible for me to wipe out what, to a certain extent, is an anomaly, and places Cape Town merchants in a worse position than the Port Elizabeth merchants. At present, however, I cannot sacrifice the revenue, so the matter will have to stand over.</p>

<p>†*The hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Swart) has raised the matter of the discharge of certain white labourers at Bloemfontein. I have already said something about the matter in answer to a question by the hon. member. During times of pressure we have, not only in Bloemfontein, but practically at all the big stations, employed people to do temporary work, and in accordance with the policy of the Administration, white men were employed. It is, of course, very unsatisfactory from the point of view of the workmen, because the work is only temporary, but I am assured by the responsible officials that they stated with the greatest precision to the labourers concerned that they were only being employed temporarily, and that as soon as the work was completed they would have to be discharged. That assurance has been given me. It is unfortunate that there was some mistake with five of the labourers, and the responsible official has acknowledged this, and as soon as the hon. member brought the matter to the Administration&#x2019;s notice, the mistake was rectified.</p>

<from>†*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate the point, and will try to see that that is done as far as possible. The hon. member will, however, understand that we do not know how the traffic will actually come, and that it sometimes stops suddenly. We have the same class of work at the docks, where the rush of business may suddenly stop. I shall, however, bear the hint in mind so that the responsible officials can give notice to the persons concerned as far as possible. As regards the employment of natives already in the service in the place of the temporary labourers whose services were no longer required, the hon. member will understand that it is absolutely necessary that that shall be done, unless we are to depart from the policy which is being followed, viz., that not a single native in the service shall be discharged. It is not our policy to dismiss natives. When a native leaves the service for any cause, his place is filled up, but natives in the service are not discharged. The result is that where the services of a native are no longer required in a certain department, he is sent to another part of the station. It is a fixed policy, in Bloemfontein as well, to give employment to white men as openings occur. Rates are still high because they are connected with the maintenance of the line, which is still very costly.</p>

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Can the Minister give us an explanation of the very big percentage increase in item 82, stores and equipment, £64,526, for which an additional sum of £16,568 is asked for? This is an increase of 33⅓ per cent. on the original estimates of last year, and it is out of proportion to either the train mileage returns or traffic returns, and seems to show that there is a certain amount of slackness in the Administration.</p>

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND HARBOURS</person>:</from>

</speech>

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Minister did not quite catch my point. I think it was last June he said £47,000 was enough for this service. We find a few months afterwards he wants £64,000, an increase of 33⅓ per cent. He says it is due to increased traffic, but the ordinary business idea is that when traffic increases expenses do not usually increase at a bigger rate than the trade. Under whatever test you like to put it, you have not had an advance of 33⅓ in any item. Therefore, you are spending more per pound sterling of business done than you were last year. There is no excuse for it.</p>

<p>Is the Minister going to continue putting up these guillotine type of gates which emanate from the north? These gates come down on the top of one&#x2019;s head when crossing the line and they are dangerous. I know one or two cases of actual accidents with them. I ask him to look into the question of the level crossing between Raapenburg and Pinelands station. There is a crossing there on the main road from the southern suburbs to the country, and a short time ago, and I think it is still so, there was not a full-time gateman there. It is left at dangerous times after dark and there have been some very narrow escapes at that crossing. I ask him if he ought not, in the interests of the public, to put a bridge there without waiting for the report he is discussing. At present he can acquire the ground without any building on it. If he delays long he will find the place will be built upon and to get access for a bridge he will have to expropriate not only land but buildings as well.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of these booms, the hon. member must not forget that there is a warning bell, and if the travelling public will not pay sufficient <span class="col_369-370" refersTo="page_0254"/>attention to the warning bells, we cannot help it. Many motorists and other travellers do not seem to realize that a railway crossing is dangerous, and if they will not realize it, and slacken down on crossing the line, accidents will continue to occur. It is impossible, in a country with twelve thousand miles of railway, to construct overhead bridges everywhere. The capital cost would be enormous and the country could not bear the cost. The public must learn to be more careful on crossing a railway line. With regard to Raapenburg, if the local body concerned is prepared to pay half the cost, I am prepared to go into the matter. They must approach us and inform us that they will pay half the cost.</p>

<p>I have sympathy with my friend but this is a dangerous crossing and there is no doubt that if something is not done there will be a pretty bad accident there. I would suggest, I tried to do it myself, he should get the local authorities to contribute something to the maintenance of the watchman there. I saw an accident nearer Somerset West at a perfectly open crossing where a man was killed and his wife was injured. It happened to be raining at the time, a stormy day, and they had put the flaps round the car and did not take the trouble to look out and a train came along. That is how accidents happen. I suggest he should try and do something in this particular case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I would just remark, talking about the guillotine versus a gate for the level crossing. The Minister says you must listen for the bell. It is a very slight bell and, unless the motor was one of the Government&#x2019;s £1,360 cars it is probable the engine of the motor car is making more noise than the bell. If you put a gate there you can see it when it is closed, and there is not the same likelihood of an accident happening. I do not know whether that crossing is in the boundary of any authority. It is the dividing line between two municipalities and I hope the Minister will get into touch with both and do something for the public. I would now like to ask the Minister&#x2019;s view on an entirely different question. I think it comes under item 69. The railways pay certain commissions to overseas tourist agencies for getting traffic and the position is if you are an overseas tourist agency in London, New York, Berlin or Rotterdam you can get your commission, but if you are so unwise as to put a sub-office in Cape Town&#x2014;</p>

<p>Then I should life to ask the Minister whether his attention has ever been directed to the difficulties existing in connection with getting on and alighting from trains at small outside stations on branch lines. There are, of course, some stations on branch lines and they usually have platforms where one can get on or alight from a train. But at most places it is particularly difficult, if not dangerous to do so, especially for aged people. At the halts and small stations there are no platforms, and there are no means at all to assist in alighting from a train.</p>

I do submit that the Minister, in addition to having witnesses called to give local opinion about these crossings, should have either on the commission or as an assessor associated with the commission, somebody who has got real expert knowledge of the conditions here. You have crossings like those at Belmont Road, Rondebosch, at Observatory Road and close to Newlands. I would suggest that it would be advisable, for instance, to let the municipality nominate somebody with special knowledge of the conditions in Cape Town.

In regard to the point raised by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Sir William Macintosh), the expenditure has been occasioned by the water supply failing at some stations, and provision having had to be made at other stations. The cost is spread over the whole system. I was rather surprised to hear the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) advocating the pulling down of the Cape Town railway station. I always understood that the chambers of commerce, of which I understand the hon. member is a very valued member, is very closely interested in the control of capital expenditure, and rightly so.

As regards the new work, i.e., the widening of the bridge, the municipality of Cape Town contributes its share. He also asked what the general policy of the Administration was with regard to overhead bridges. It is said that if there are available funds&#x2014;I emphasize this&#x2014; and the local body concerned is prepared to bear half the cost, then the Railway Administration is prepared to undertake the building of an overhead bridge. If there is not sufficient money, then it cannot be done, and if the public body will not pay half it cannot be done either. The question is whether the time has not arrived to ask the public to contribute a larger share in respect of such works. In the past only half was paid, but the question is whether the public should not pay more and the Administration less, e.g., two-thirds by the public, and one-third by the Administration. If the question of capital expenditure is riot placed under proper control, then I fear that the burdens of the Railway Administration and of those who use the railway will be too great. I will tell the hon. member that if there are particular interests in which he is concerned and they are prepared to make a proposal on the basis of paying half the costs, then the Administration will be prepared to do the work if the necessary funds can be found.</p>

The conditions there are terrible, and how the clerks work there and can possibly stand it passes my understanding.

I could give most interesting figures on that point. I have gone very carefully into the matter and I am convinced that the broadening of the Kalabaskraal line will not only be satisfactory and beneficial to the people concerned, but will also save us money in the long run. That line was run at a loss; I do not say it will now be run at a profit, but the chances of its being operated at a profit have been very much enhanced by the broadening of the gauge. I hope the House will never again authorize the building of a narrow gauge lines.

<p>Does Item No. 33&#x2014;import and erect 23 class 15 &#x201C;C&#x201D; engines refer to the 23 engines from America we had a discussion about this afternoon? How is it that the original estimate of £122,364 has been exceeded by £100,000? and whether any further additional expenditure is likely to be asked for in connection with the cost of these engines, because I find the cost works out roughly at £9,688 per engine. Has the Minister got the <span class="col_379-380" refersTo="page_0259"/>information now about the various amounts of tenders in regard to the Baldwins, British and German, when those tenders were accepted? I would like to know the original contract tender price and how it is these large amounts become additional to those prices, and does it include the cost of repairs at all, and how does the estimated cost become so much below the actual total.</p>

<p>If I explain the additional Estimates, it will clear up the position. It is not additional money we are asking on the original price. We are asking a greater cash provision during this financial year than we expected to require. At the time the estimates were drawn up, we did not expect to require so much money. The engines have come forward at a quicker rate than we expected. That is why we want additional money. The whole amount is £222,000, in which repairs are not included. The hon. member for Cape Town(Central) (Mr. Jagger) has asked me to make a statement on the question of the Germanengines. I have placed a return on the Table of the House giving full information, and if it will suit the convenience of hon. members, I suggest that they reserve their criticism to a later stage when I bring in the covering Bill They can then go through the statement and deal with the matter.

<p>I would like some information about item 36. I would like to know if these wagons will be available for use in the harbour areas. My reason for asking is that it has special interest for Algoa Bay, because we are in a different position to other ports. In other ports goods are off-loaded on to the wharf, and the equivalent of that at Algoa Bay is that they are off-loaded and put on to wagons and are brought to the distributing sheds. At all times the sea work overruns the shore work for want of equipment, so I would like to know if these wagons will be available for that purpose.</p>

<p>These four-wheel drop-sided wagons are for the coal traffic, and will not be suitable for the purpose which the hon. member describes. I agree that the equipment and trucks at Algoa Bay are not as suitable as they might be. We have a large number of old type trucks, and if we had the money, I would scrap many trucks and engines and purchase new ones. It is a question of finding the money. I agree that the position at Algoa Bay is not quite satisfactory. There is a bottleneck at the entrance to the harbour. I can make no promise at this stage, but I hope to be able to deal with the question and solve some of the difficulties at Algoa Bay. The traffic is large</p>

The new wagons are of the same pat-tern, but we have altered them by putting in two doors; so that it means that the handling of general goods will be facilitated. The hon. member for Uitenhage (Mr. Bates) has asked about the 109 coaches. They are for use on the electrified line at Cape Town. They have been imported. He asked when the policy of the Government is going to be carried out with regard to the manufacture in South Africa all that can be manufactured? We are carrying out that policy at the present time. But we are not manufacturing everything we require in South Africa. I assure my hon. friend that if nothing abnormal occurs for the next two years, our workshops can go full steam ahead, and there need not be any short time in the work-shops.

<p>When this Bill was before the House on the second reading, I drew attention to the change made in section 3 (h), which gives power to the Surveyor-General, when required by the Minister, to do the same work as the Director of the Trigonometrical Survey under Clause 5 (a). I have made enquiries into the matter and I understand that the idea is that section 3 (h) will only be used in exceptional circumstances. I think it would clear the air if the Minister could make a statement as to the circumstances under which it is proposed to use the power under section 3 (h) and whether it will be used in such a way that there will not be dual control and overlapping.</p>

<p>The point is that the Director of the Trigonometrical Survey may be ill or he may resign. In the meantime until his successor is appointed or he recovers from his illness, somebody will have to look after his office. The Surveyor-General is the person to do that. The section says distinctly to conduct, when required by the Minister. I want to have power to give instructions to do that work. There will be no overlapping whatsoever. It is only a necessary provision in the case of the illness or absence of the Director of the Trigonometrical Survey.</p>

I am surprised at the hon. member for Colesberg (Mr. G. A. Louw) speaking about mistakes in surveys. If a mistake is made by a surveyor then it is not the fault of the Government, and it cannot be expected that the Government should bear the expense, because the farms do not belong to the State. It would be an impossible position to be held responsible for mistakes. If the mistake is made in the office of the Surveyor-General then it is another matter, but the Surveyor-General cannot be held responsible for surveyors&#x2019; mistakes until the trigonometrical survey of the whole country is completed and the data collected as is provided in this Bill. The only responsibility which we can accept is that the Surveyor-General can instruct the surveyor to do his work over again, even if he had done it a year of two before.

Why then do we have a Surveyor-General and his office? If the position is as stated by the Minister, then I think that the Bill should be so amended to compel the Surveyor-General to make the surveyor perform the re-survey.

<p>I appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s desire to have reliable records in his office, but it seems to me that after the department has issued title to land, and has exacted payment of the fees, it would not be fair to the owner to insist on his having the land resurveyed and to impose a further charge on him. It was not made clear in the discussion on Clause 13 whether an owner would have to make an additional payment for a mistake made by Government in issuing title.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<from>†The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member cannot expect the Government to pay for mistakes not made by its officers. The Surveyor-General can only state that surveys are correct when the trigonometrical survey of the whole of the Union is completed and the Surveyor-General has copies of the field books. Suppose a farm was incorrectly surveyed a hundred years ago, and the owner now wants to sell a portion of it. The clause, as originally drafted, imposed on him the duty of having the whole farm re-surveyed, and then to cut off the piece of land he desires to sell. Hon. members showed that would be a hardship, so I agreed that instead of doing that the owner should take out an amended title for the piece of land he wishes to sell. I am told that in the Cape the purchaser of land pays for the survey, but in the Transvaal the purchaser pays only the transfer duty, while the seller pays the other expenses. The Surveyor-General allows a certain margin of error in surveys, and does not insist on a new survey in every case, but only where a diagram is so incorrect that very serious difficulties arise does he insist of a re-survey. I do not see how the Government could be expected to pay for a re-survey or an amended title, which I think is clearly the duty of the owner of the land</p>

<from>†Col. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. REITZ</person>:</from>

<p>This is a technical Bill, and I approach it with considerable diffidence, but I question the wisdom of this radical alteration in the law. I do not think the House has appreciated the fact that we are altering a Transvaal law which has been in force for over fifty years. Since 1870, for fifty-seven years in the Transvaal an approved diagram has been an unimpeachable document. For over half a century in the Transvaal there has been a dearth of beacon actions. Now the Minister proposes reverting back to the Cape system, which makes the beacon the unimpeachable proof. I have been approached by Transvaal landowners to put this matter before the House. In the well-known Transvaal case, Murray v. Opperman, the judges held there was a good deal to be said for both sides, but the balance was in favour of supporting the diagram, which prevents more disputes, rather than revert back to the beacon system. Now, the Minister proposes to do away with that old Transvaal law, and to go back to the Cape system. The court in the case I quoted stated that cases of hardship would occur in either event, but certainly the Transvaal law served to prevent disputes, and the House should stop to consider whether it is wise to do away with the Transvaal system and come back to the Cape system. May I quote the judgment which practically lays down the law on the question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is better on the whole to rely implicitly upon the accuracy of the surveyors than in the imperfect recollections of persons as to the positions of beacons which may have been pointed out many years before, and at which, at the time of the dispute, no trace may be left. Whatever policy may be adopted by the legislature&#x2014;whether beacons are to prevail over the diagram as at the Cape, or to make the diagram prevail over the beacon as in the Transvaal, cases of hardship will occasionally arise, but it is sounder to take the line which is most likely to prevent disputes.</block>

<p>Experience has proved the inviolability of the diagram as causing fewer disputes, and I put it to the House with diffidence, because my knowledge of the surveying profession is limited, but I question the wisdom of reverting back to the Cape system.</p>

<p>I am aware that the decision in Murray v. Opperman that I was quoting has since been superseded, but that does not affect the point at issue. The point is whether in reverting back to the unimpeachability of beacons in preference to the unimpeachability of diagrams we are not reopening the door to disputes and litigation. I am not a protagonist or champion of beacons or of diagrams in this particular matter. I was asked by the Landowners&#x2019; Association of the Transvaal not to oppose this clause, but merely to put both sides of the question to the House in order that the House should know the exact position. We have to decide whether we are not re-opening the door to unnecessary litigation and to beacon disputes by practically upsetting what was, at any rate for over 50 years, considered to be the law in the Transvaal. I cannot carry the matter any further and I leave it in the hands of the House at that.</p>

<p>Then the Surveyor-General can take steps to recover the cost. In answer to the question as to whether all the beacons must be made according to a fixed pattern, I just want to say that only in the case of new beacons can it be laid down what is to be done. As regards the old beacons, they have merely to be repaired. As to the new beacons which have to be erected as directed, it depends on circumstances how they are to be erected. In the towns they will not be so large as, e.g., on the veld. The beacons will depend upon the available materials. At some spots stones will be put on each other and cemented together, at others iron standards will have to be used.</p>

<p>The provisions of the clause were too wide. The intention is that the Surveyor-General will only have the power in extreme cases to notify the Registrar and to prohibit the further registration of that piece of ground or a portion thereof until a new diagram has been approved. The original clause goes too far. There are, however, cases when such power is required. It has occurred that when a farm was to be surveyed it appeared that there was no ground left. It has also occurred that a piece of ground was stated to be 2,000 morgen, while it actually measured only 300 morgen. It can also lead to abuse where a man, who knows that ground measures 700 morgen while the diagram only shows 300 morgen through some mistake, goes to the owner and purchases it very cheaply. Therefore, the power is now only given in extreme cases.</p>

I think we should go a little further and say that when anyone has to enter a private building, he must have the owner&#x2019;s consent, and must inform the owner in writing why it is necessary to enter such a building or enclosed place.

<p>In his second reading speech, the Minister said he had omitted subsection 2 of old Clause 23, because the case that was intended to be met by that subsection had been met in the meantime by the Medical Council. But the Minister was in error. There are two brothers. The case of the one has been met, but not that of the other. They have been in South Africa a long time, and hold degrees recognized by the London Medical Council. In order to obtain registration, however, it was necessary for them to present themselves personally to the Council in London. One of the brothers went to England in 1922 and was registered, but the other brother could not afford to make the journey, and was not registered. Both of them are British subjects, and both cases are precisely on the same footing. Every safeguard is included in my amendment. There is no reason why these two brothers holding exactly the same degrees should be treated differently, and <span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0266"/>why the one who could not afford to visit England should not have his certificate recognized.

For about twelve years attempts have been made to pass this Bill, but nobody has yet dared to push it through in this form.

<p>I just believe him when I want to, but we get on very well together. The Minister can take it that doctors are just the same as other people. Some are first class, and others are not worth taking notice of. Now I ask whether it is right to compel persons to go to certificated doctors? Private persons in the past have discovered medicines which are excellent, and which the doctors have not yet been able to secure. Would it be right to draw a fence round the doctors, and to limit persons to consulting only them? We are against a monopoly in every form, e.g., a meat monopoly, but how much more ought we not to be against the monopoly of doctors, who have to do with human flesh? I am pleading for the public who believe in the old people who in the past were the refuge in cases of cancer and other diseases. I can mention many cases and establish them. If I fail, then I am prepared to pay £100 to a hospital. Recently there was a lady in Middelburg, a poor woman without a husband, who had been to 19 doctors, and each of the doctors said that it was only a matter of time. The girl was seriously ill and fainted frequently, and one of the so-called quacks took charge of her and gave her a bottle of medicine. The simple consequence was that when I left, the girl was visiting my son on his farm, and could already walk about, and this notwithstanding the wisdom of the 19 doctors around whom a ring fence is now to be drawn. The clause will cause endless loss. Who discovered all the patent medicines which are to-day used in the country? Half of them were discovered by private people, the quacks who are now derided. When one talks about the injurious consequence of this clause in the lobbies they say it is a serious matter, but it does not seem to have much effect in the House. I want to ask the House to grant my request so that a Bill shall not be pushed through which they have not even dared to pass in England.

<p>The Bill prohibits the quack from demanding payment. He may not even receive anything, or the doctor will quickly make trouble. Laughter is going on now about a very serious matter. If it is so simple a matter, why was the Bill not passed before? Why should this Government bear the unpopularity of it? The passage of the Bill will not create a satisfactory condition of things. If the doctors draw such a ring fence around themselves, then the people will hereafter look upon them with more disfavour, and not believe in them. We must not think that they are keen on the Bill out of patriotism. I think it is more to make money than for any other reason. If one notices who go to study medicine, then you can see that it is not for love of the people. It is because it is a paying profession, and the only one which is a monopoly. They can ask what they like, keep alive or kill as they like, and if an enquiry is asked for, then another doctor from within the fence is called in to say whether a mistake has been made. One can expect very little from an enquiry with the so-called etiquette that exists. If one has killed a man, will the three or four doctors who are called give away their colleague? No, they will say that the patient&#x2019;s heart was too weak, and that it stopped beating. As if they could see that after a man was already dead.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Middelburg (Mr. Heyns) has pleaded so strongly that if I were not firmly convinced of the justice of the principle of the Bill I should almost be persuaded by his plea. If we, however, were to pass the amendment of the hon. member we should be accepting something which is directly opposed to the basic principle of the Bill and then we may as well drop it. The hon. member desires that any person whether he has had training or not, if he can prove that in his own way he has treated people and done them good, should have the right to he registered. These persons cannot be tested by an examination because the hon. member admits that they have had no scientific education. The only test whether these people can be let loose on the public to treat any kind of disease by their methods and to diagnose any disease like an ordinary doctor, is that they must be able to prove that the people whom they have treated have received benefit, and that for five years they have made their living in this way. How is such a test to be applied? It would require a regular machinery of State to call up all the persons who have been treated as witnesses about their treatment, and on the other hand also those who have not received benefit from treatment of the so-called quack. The Board of Enquiry would then have to decide whether such a person could be registered. The amendment is quite unpractical and conflicts with the principles of the Bill.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that the Minister will not meet us on the point. Before medical men came to South Africa there were herb practitioners amongst the coloured people. We know there are many beneficial bushes and in South Africa the doctors are now commencing to examine the bushes to find out what diseases they are good for. The old people in the old days knew this and in all countries there are herb practitioners who use definite herbs for definite complaints. These contain no poison but a doctor always prescribes poison. Many complaints are cured by these people, such as cancer, <i>e.g.</i> We know that Mrs. Landsberg has cured more people of cancer than any doctor has in South Africa. The Minister says that a new State machinery is necessary. Is he afraid that the witnesses will malign the doctors? We believe in the healing power of herbs. So long as we have not arrived at the point that the State orders a doctor to visit and treat every sick person, we have no right to give a monopoly to the doctors. Why should I not be allowed to go to someone if I know that I shall receive benefit?</p>

<p>I would like the Minister to accept this amendment. It is an important alteration and it really brings the Bill into line with existing conditions. After all three years is a very short period and although the Bill makes provision for the setting up of schools of pharmacy I understand that the associated societies of South Africa have gone into this matter very carefully and feel that four years will come out much better. The ultimate benefits are very great. It would not make any serious difficulty as far as the boys are concerned.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I am unable to accept this amendment, and I think if it is accepted it will make the door too narrow for apprentices to enter the profession. As the laws exist to-day apprentices must be apprenticed in three of the provinces for a period of four years, but in the O.F.S. it is only three years. When the present Bill was drawn up the four Pharmacy Boards in the Union were consulted, and all four agreed that the period should, not be four, but three years. It is also three years in England. If we make the door too narrow for apprentices to enter, it will certainly restrict competition, and that is certainly not in the public interest.</p>

The Minister is prepared to follow the English precedent in this case, but I have often heard him say that we should decide things for ourselves. As a rule, I am told they can get through their examinations very easily in their seventeenth year. They are articled and have to serve three years, but can be admitted only if they are 21. What harm is done in making them serve four years? Under the circumstances, I think the Minister ought to reconsider his decision and see whether he could not give the profession the benefit of having such properly qualified members as they so earnestly desire.</p>

It is redundant and unnecessary and I look upon it as a preparation of what is to follow from the hon. member for Hanover Street. We must be very careful with regard to any alteration or making more lax these provisions in connection with dentists or dental mechanics. As I pointed out on the second reading of this measure the position of the dentists in the country to-day is in a certain sense a sad one. We have a school of dentistry established in this country and we are paying money out of State funds for the school for dentistry and on the other hand the position in the country is such that South Africans practising dentistry are so little protected that quite a number have left South Africa to practise overseas because they cannot make a living in South Africa. In one of the provinces the position is such that some of the registered dentists are surrendering or are seriously thinking of surrendering their registration certificates, because they think that if they practise as unregistered persons and they are free to advertise they can compete much better with other qualified men than they can to-day. Therefore, there is a premium set to-day under existing circumstances on the unqualified and unregistered man, and I want certainly to improve the position. For that reason I think that we ought to leave the provisions of the Bill in connection with dentists unaltered.</p>

<p>I would like to know what the Minister means by saying that I am the mouthpiece of the dental mechanicians. He said it in rather an offensive way. I am the mouthpiece of every man in this country who has a just grievance to lay at the doors of Parliament. I want to know what the Minister means by that remark, because as a member of Parliament I resent very much the tone in which he spoke. If he cannot support his case with better arguments than he has done, I think it would be better if he did not speak at all when these amendments are being considered. He told the House that I spoke on behalf of certain persons who had repudiated me. That is absolutely incorrect. There are twenty gentlemen in Johannesburg who have been working under dentists and who, under this Bill, are given permission to practise as dentists. That is the society whose letter he read out. Does the Minister know that telegram or letter that he read applies to twenty gentlemen who are being taken over under this Bill, men who have been practising under supervision, although they are not dentists, and who are now given the right to become dentists? I am not speaking on their behalf. They are very pleased with this position. They are the only people in Johannesburg who are doing dental mechanicians&#x2019; work who are pleased with this Bill. If the dental mechanicians, for whom I am pleading, were also made dentists under the Bill they also would be very pleased. I would draw the attention of the House to the petition presented only a few days ago by myself on behalf of certain organized dental mechanicians in Johannesburg. They are not the twenty gentlemen for whom the Minister has been speaking, but they are just as responsible a body of men, and they are entitled to be heard by this House. I have a telegram stating that the letter read by the hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. Christie) from the organized dental mechanics expressed the opinion of twenty men under supervision. Experienced mechanics of nine years had been debarred from this society because of having no supervision. They also stated that mechanics of ten years&#x2019; experience were getting £15 per month. Dental mechanics were obliged to seek their own livelihood by catering for the poor public owing to dentists not paying a living wage. I wired to them to send a deputation down. A deputation came down, and a petition has been presented to this House by the Dental Mechanics&#x2019; Association, for whom I am speaking. I can give the Minister another organized body for whom I am speaking, and that is the Cape Society of Dental Mechanicians. They are by no means pleased with the position under this Bill. I have also received a telegram from Vrededorp expressing opposition to the dental provisions of the Bill. I can assure the Minister that a large number of dentists are still to be obtained in South Africa; there is no dearth of them, and a large number are being trained now. If some are leaving, the public need not be alarmed.</p>

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>The necessity is to do justice to those who are practising at the time you bring in your legislation., It is done in every country in the world. I am not asking these people to be made dentists at all When the Minister objects to the poor mechanical man, who is merely asking permission to make teeth and fit them, then I say he ought to be better prepared with his information than he was. Apart from the few professional gentlemen who are brought in as dentists under this Bill, all the dental mechanicians in the Union are seeking for protection, and I submit they are perfectly entitled to it at the hands of the Minister. There is nothing unreasonable in what they are asking. The man who does the mechanical work should be allowed to get the fruits of his labour. You allow him to do work for a dentist, but you say he must receive whatever the dentist chooses to pay, and he must only work if the dentist chooses to employ him. If no dentist wants him, he cannot practise his calling at all. That is the effect of the Bill, and I say it is not fair at all, and that is why I ask these men should be put on a separate register to be examined. The Council at present is hostile to the idea of dental mechanicians doing work direct for the public. If you leave it for them to register these men if they think fit&#x2014;suppose they do not think fit? Why not say the Council shall establish it? They may decide to have nothing whatever to do with it, and then this section would remain a mere dead letter upon the Statute-book. The only difference is that I make it compulsory. I hope <span class="col_403-404" refersTo="page_0271"/>the Minister will be fair to those who are trying to get justice done for the poorer sections of the people, and are entitled to better treatment from the Minister than the remarks he made upon a perfectly reasonable request.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the Minister that I agree that dentists should be protected, but I think that they are being very well protected in the Bill. I also have a letter from a dental mechanic also asking for protection. If possible I want to ask the Minister to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Hanover Street (Mr. Alexander). I can assure him that if it is not passed a lot of dental mechanics in Pretoria and in South Africa will get into such difficulties that they will hardly be able to make a living. When a man has passed the examination as dental mechanic, in Germany, England or Holland, and is competent at his work, he ought to be entitled to practise, and therefore it is necessary to protect him. The Minister knows how in Holland&#x2014;in Utrecht&#x2014; we used to call a dentist by the name of &#x201C;gold mine.&#x201D; It is dentists who make such tremendous fortunes. Now the dental mechanics know their work and have possibly passed the examination and we want to have them registered to practise. The Minister must understand that we do not wish to open the door for everybody to practise as a dental mechanic, but merely the man who has passed the examination. There are dentists who make thousands of pounds per annum and a fortune in the country. I do not grudge it them and I am not opposed to their being protected, but they are being sufficiently protected in the Bill. The dental mechanic is the support of the poor man who cannot afford to go to a dentist. He goes to a dental mechanic who does the practical work cheaply and just as well as the dentist. We merely want that only persons who have passed an examination approved by the Minister shall have the right to practise as dental mechanics. Surely the dental mechanics are also young Afrikanders who have passed their examinations and whose future is here.</p>

I also have received telegrams from dental mechanics who have for years been doing the work in which they ask to be protected. It has already been said that the Bill gives good and adequate protection to the dentists, and why should that not be given to persons who have already been doing the work for years? When we pass Bills there are always exceptions. We cannot simply put the dental mechanics out of their job and take the bread out of their mouths. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment and meet the dental mechanics. There are individuals with large families among them and, as has already been said, they do much good work to the poor people who cannot afford to go to dentists. The mechanics do their work very cheaply, and in this way assist the poor. We merely ask that the persons who are to-day practising and are competent shall be protected.</p>

<speech by="#alexander">

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I move:</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end of the clause &#x201C;: Provided that nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to apply to the practice of any particular form of drugless healing if the healer proves to the satisfaction of a board prescribed by regulation that he is qualified either by training or experience to practise such particular form of healing. After notice to such board an application may be made to any provincial or local division of the Supreme Court by a person who is aggrieved by the decision of such board and the provisions of section <i>eighteen</i> shall, as far as possible, apply to such application.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Let me tell the Minister that in talking about me being a mouthpiece I have lots of telegrams and letters on this question of drugless healing from all over the Union, some from people he may know. Incidentally, it is most unfair to the practitioner in Cape Town who is in possession of the new machine, the Neurocalometer, because he asked the Minister&#x2019;s permission to show him the machine and the Minister refused to see him, yet he said it was a mystery and that he knew nothing about it. Well that was his own fault, because the man offered to show it to him. Faulty information was given to him because he was mixing it up with a machine known as Abrams Electronic Vibrator. The Neurocalometer is patented in America, England and six European countries. Incidentally what he said himself is wrong, because he said it was a mystery. How could it be a mystery if it was exposed publicly? He must have been mixing it up with the other machine. The next time a man wants to come and describe it to him I hope he will have the fairness to see it and not turn him away. This man, Mr. Blackburn, the president of the South African Chiropractors&#x2019; Association, is willing to demonstrate the machine to any member of the House. There is no mystery about it. It is a valuable instrument, each one costing £500. It certainly is not deserving of the ridicule that the Minister has poured upon it. The Minister if he closes his eyes to the fact that there are thousands of people all over the country, high and low, people who have been given up as incurable by a medical man, and who have been benefited by chiropractors and that there is a deep public feeling that these people should not be deprived of their livelihood, then he is not in touch with the outside public. I have a telegram from a gentleman who is well-known to members of this House, General Kritzinger of Cradock, in which he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Please use all influence to protect chiro-practics under Medical Ball. My family personally benefited by their treatment.</block>

<p>If I were to read to the House the number of messages and letters I have got from members of the public imploring me to see that these people are protected because of the benefits they have obtained from their treatment, it would take up too much of the time of the House. I feel that I am applying for a measure of absolute justice. These people have given evidence before the committee. One of the chiropractors appeared before the committee and illustrated chiropractics by means of a skeleton.</p>

<p>It was not very convincing.</p>

<speech by="#alexander">

<from>†Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ALEXANDER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member was not convinced, but he will admit that it was only by his casting vote that the amendment was lost in that committee. We cannot convince everybody, but we can always convince reasonable men. What am I asking for in the amendment? I submit nothing more reasonable could be put before this committee. In the first place, I make it clear that nothing appertaining to medical practice prohibitions should apply to any particular form of drugless healing. What are the conditions under which I claim that these people should be allowed to practise? First of all, if the healer proves to the satisfaction of a board prescribed by regulation that he is qualified to practise a particular form of healing. Every other branch of science that the doctor studies these people study. They must be approved by a board prescribed by regulation. I say a board, because it would be unfair to submit these people to the ordinary Medical Council. There must be a special and independent board to deal with their cases. Then I have provided that any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the board is entitled to go to the court exactly as other persons can go under section 18. It is a perfectly fair and perfectly reasonable amendment. It does not open the flood-gates. It does not admit a number of unqualified men. It simply says there are a number of people who go in for a different method of healing than medicine. Let them practise that particular form. I do not ask that they should be put on the register as doctors, or allowed to describe themselves as doctors. If a man is an osteopath, he would be allowed to practise as an osteopath; nothing else. There will be no confusion whatever between him and the doctor. I cannot conceive of a more reasonable amendment. It does not encroach upon the doctor; it simply provides protection for people who, in the interests of the public, are making a living to-day. Why? Because the experience of the public has shown that they have cured in many cases that have been given up by the doctors. I hope the Minister is not going to be as hostile to this amendment as he has been to the others I have moved. He will find that throughout the country a large number of people are interested in seeing that justice is done to this class of person.</p>

<speech by="#stals">

<from>†*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STALS</person>:</from>

<p>It is alleged that a great section of the public is in favour of the amendment of the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) (Mr. Alexander) or is is at any rate favourably disposed towards the class of persons he wishes to protect. In this connection I just want to call to mind the two men in the Transvaal of whom the Pretoria Indian was one who also enjoyed public support and esteem for a long time although it later appeared <span class="col_407-408" refersTo="page_0273"/>that they did not deserve it at all. The argument that because some people enjoy the support of the public and that they should therefore be protected is not sound. The amendment differentiates in equality between that class of people and doctors. I already mentioned at the second reading that a person who treats an invalid should in the first place possess the competency and the qualification to make a diagnosis. It takes years of study and in this country at least six years. Can the hon. gentleman say that one of the most enlightened of the group for whom he is pleading has even approximately six years&#x2019; study behind his back? We attach very great importance to the study of bacteriology and how then can we plead that the man who knows nothing of it shall have the same rank as a doctor who has years of study behind him? The Minister has fortunately clearly pointed out in his reply the distinction between the persons supported by the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) and medical men. The argument is used that doctors only use medicine in treatment. That does not apply any longer in our days. Those who treat disease possess scientific methods and various methods are used for various diseases. Naturopathy is also used by doctors and not only by the friends of the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street). Psychology also plays a great part with doctors, although I do not doubt that it is a still greater factor with the friends of the hon. member. Unfortunately his amendment is very wide. He says that he does not wish to put the doctors on the same footing, but the immediate effect of passing this amendment will be such equality, and the result will be the lowering of the standard of the medical practitioner. There will no longer be a motive for the medical man to be better than the other class of practitioners. Then we come to the danger to the public health. I have here an advertisement which appeared in the big daily papers from one of the most enlightened naturopaths. I do not know what training that man has had, but the advertisement asks people to fill in a consultation form and 25 diseases are given, and they are followed by &#x201C;etc.,&#x201D; People are asked to cut out the coupon and to send it in by post after filling it in, and then they will receive a book giving the treatment for the 25 diseases, etc. Included herein, <i>e.g.,</i> are diseases of the eye, and all who have the least knowledge of the human body know that the eye is not a thing with which liberties can be taken. The most enlightened of the naturopaths of whom the hon. member for Cape Town (Hanover Street) has thought comes out with a statement that he will send a book to cure diseases of the eye. Really we cannot understand how hon. members want to convince us that people who have had no proper training whatsoever regarding the human body should be put on the same basis as the trained doctor who has studied for years.</p>
