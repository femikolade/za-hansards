<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NEL</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In sub-section (2) to omit &#x201C;the administration may from time to time require for any purposes&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;represents 50 per cent. of the requirements from time to time of the administration. The remaining 50 per cent. of such requirements shall be purchased by the administration after calling for tenders from the corporation and other manufacturers in the Union of iron or steel articles.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I would like to point out that the amendment which is now put forward is somewhat different in form from the amendment put to the House at the committee stage. The amendment which is now before the House provides in the first place that the new corporation shall have a monopoly of 50 per cent. of all the requirements of the railways. Then with regard to the remaining 50 per cent. this is to be open to public tender by producers in South Africa. The amendment placed before the House in committee provided that the remaining 50 per cent. was to be open to public tender by any producer not only in this country, but overseas as well. During the committee stage the Minister agreed to reduce the period of this monopoly from 15 years to ten years. That was no concession because the effect would possibly be that within ten years sufficient time would have elapsed for the existing industry to be completely broken and obliterated. Time alone will show whether this will be so or not. The clause as it stands at present grants a complete monopoly to the new corporation which is being constituted under the Bill. I submit it is bad enough for the existing industry to have to compete against a Government-aided and controlled concern, but apart from that, if the Government in addition insists upon the whole of the railway requirements being purchased from the corporation it is simply going to eliminate completely the existing industry. The effect of the clause will be to stifle all competition and for this corporation to receive the preference of all Government departments. I would point out that 33-1/3rd per cent. of the iron and steel purchased in this country is purchased by the railways. It is apparent that under this clause the corporation is to be made to pay at all costs no matter what the cost may be to the taxpayer. I would have preferred to see it provided that all requirements of the railways should be purchased under tender of producers of iron and steel in this country and that the best tender should be accepted. During the committee stage the Minister gave no reasons why he refused to accept the amendment which was then discussed. I ask the present Minister to give an explanation why the amendment should not be accepted. He cannot deny that the amendment is perfectly reasonable and fair, and I submit also, just. If the Minister thinks it is not fair or reasonable, I should be glad if he gave his reasons when he replies, but I am certain he will not reply because he can give no reasons. It would be almost impossible to obtain tenders from <span class="col_2683-2684" refersTo="page_0002"/>outside to decide the prices that should be paid for these articles by the railways. Naturally, outside producers are not going to give prices simply to enable the railway administration to fix one prices they are to pay to the new corporation. I would like to know from the Minister on what basis the prices are to be fixed. Are the highest or the lowest prices to be taken from outside countries, or is the standard of any particular country going to determine the price the railway is to pay to the corporation? If the Minister refuses to accept the amendment there can be only two conclusions which the House and the country would be justified in drawing. Notwithstanding the radiant optimism of the Minister in his second reading speech he has found out that this intricate and highly technical industry is very complicated and that there are many snags which he never anticipated. The next point is that the Minister, notwithstanding his gloomy, and I say it advisedly, uncalled-for attack on the existing industries by stating they were economically unsound, apparently since he made that statement and since he has seen the evidence of Major Butler and other witnesses before the select committee has realized that the existing industries may be able to compete successfully with the industry as established under this Bill. There is another conclusion this House and the country will be entitled to draw, and this is, if the Minister refuses to accept the amendment, the House and the country will be fully justified in concluding that the Minister is determined to crush the existing industries. If a total monopoly is to be granted, no greater injustice could be perpetrated on an industry which has had to fight many difficulties, and to which this House and the country should be grateful for the efforts made in establishing that industry. What this Government wants is less government in business, and more business in government. Let this Bill be a warning to this country and to the financial and industrial world of what they may expect; if they establish industries in this country, they may have to face a Bill similar to the one now before the House. To-day it is iron and steel, to-morrow it will be the bakers and butchers.</p>

<p>The Minister says I have a girder on my brain; if I am wandering it is possibly due to that. If this clause goes through it will be a landmark to this country and in the financial and industrial world of what diabolical injustice the Pact Government is capable of doing. I am afraid my voice is like that of John the Baptist&#x2014;crying in the wilderness; but the voice of John the Baptist is one still to-day being heard throughout the world.

<speech by="#thomas_watt">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMAS WATT</person>:</from>

<p>I second the amendment. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment, because it is so entirely reasonable. One could understand the clause as it stands in the Bill giving practically all the railway work to this new corporation if there was no existing industry in the country, but seeing we have an established company capable of producing many of the articles required by the railways, it is not unreasonable to say, if the railway administration entered into a contract with this new company, it should be for half its requirements and let the other half be called for by public tender. I can understand the Minister of Railways and Harbours saying that this amendment is in the interests of the railways, because this does not ask for the railway business, unless in competition with the new corporation, and from other companies producing the articles. Surely it is in the interests of the railways to get, subject to other things being equal, their articles in the cheapest possible market. I think it is only fair, seeing that the Union Steel Corporation and other similar companies are producing these articles, that they should get an opportunity of getting a share of the railway requirements, and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to support the two previous speakers. Is it business, I ask the Minister of Railways and Harbours, for an administration such as the railways to give the whole of their requirements to one producer? Is it business to enter into a ten years&#x2019; contract before the producer has produced a ton of pig-iron or steel, and to say that you take the whole of your requirements from that one institution. No business man would dream of doing it. It is against the South Africa Act, under which the railways are to be worked as a business institution. Under this Bill the corporation can undertake subsidiary industries. I recognise that to-day they could not do that because the capital is not sufficient, but it is quite competent to come back to this House and ask for the capital to be increased in order to undertake these subsidiary industries. The railways will be bound under this clause to deal, in regard to their requirements in these subsidiary industries, as with regard to steel and pig-iron. It would be a most unsatisfactory position if they started subsidiary industries in which private interests are already engaged, and if they can cut out the whole of the railway requirements from the legitimate aim of these private individuals to compete for that product. That would be a most unfair and unsatisfactory position for the railway department to put the corporation in. The clause has been vitally altered in select committee. As originally introduced the clause gave certain very definite rights to the corporation, and the railway department saw that this was going to be very detrimental to them and therefore they suggested the amended clause. I agree that under this clause proposed by the railway administration the whole suggestion may be turned into a bluff. The department saw the very serious nature of this <span class="col_2685-2686" refersTo="page_0003"/>clause which might do them an infinite amount of harm and so the department persuaded the select committee to substitute a clause drawn in very much looser terms. Consequently a clever general manager may be able to &#x201C;wangle&#x201D; the railway from taking anything at all from the corporation. It would, however, be very undesirable to persuade people to take shares in an undertaking and then for the Railway Department, after guaranteeing to buy half-a-million&#x2019;s worth of goods from the undertaking, not to carry out its agreement. That would savour of a third-rate swindle. So we must take it for granted that the department intend to enter into a fair arrangement. The railway administration at the same time must have a definite assurance that the prices charged by the corporation are not more than the price for which the department can obtain the goods from other South African manufacturers. This is of paramount importance to the railways, and it is only fair to the South African manufacturers that they should have the right to tender, as they are taxpayers. It is very important that the clause should be modified now. For if you leave it to be dealt with say three or four years hence the corporation would have real ground for saying that Parliament would be taking away a prescriptive right, and that private people had invested their money in the enterprise on the specific undertaking that the corporation had preferential treatment over every other South African industry. As the clause stands now we may, if we have a weak general manager of railways, come to the position when the railway department will carry this industry on its back by paying it more than they should for their requirements. It will be a great temptation if the corporation is only just holding its head above water, for the Government to say that if the railway department give the corporation a decent contract it will be able to pay its way. It will depend on the price the railway department pay for their goods whether the corporation does, or does not, make a profit. It is very extraordinary that with such a clause in the Bill the Minister of Railways has never said a word about it. He is going to give the corporation a half-million yearly contract for ten years and he really does not take the slightest interest in the matter, and does not even tell the House whether he is satisfied or dissatisfied.</p>

<speech by="#kentridge">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KENTRIDGE</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members who have supported the amendment have overlooked the fact that the whole effect of the amendment would be to vitiate the possibility of the corporation being a success. That opinion was definitely expressed to the select committee by the principal witness. I do not want to comment on the speech made by the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) beyond saying that the comparison he made between himself and one of the greatest figures in history is either absolute foolishness or blasphemy. I want to remind the House of the statement made before the select committee by Maj. Butler. On page 84 he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the scheme goes through and we continue our scheme, we could be in a position to create a business atmosphere in which neither party could make a profit. I do not know the figure at which Pretoria could produce pig iron, but we could produce steel as cheaply as Pretoria, If we continue without bigger scheme it would bring down our price, and we could compete with Pretoria, but it would not pay because there is not room for two industries in South Africa. If the Government went on with their scheme we could not go on with ours. We would go down and eventually cease to exist. If we cannot work on the bigger scale we cannot compete and Pretoria will cut us out.</block>

<p>Then again, on page 89&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From my knowledge I am satisfied that there is only room for one industry in South Africa. The railway administration is the principal customer if one gets all their orders. If the orders were put to tender and divided up, the effect would be to have two competing industries, which could not exist, only one could possibly win.</block>

<p>It must be clear to the House that the acceptance of the amendment of the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) can only tend to destroy the success of the industry. The House having accepted the principle of the establishment of the corporation, it would be contradicting itself if it accepted that amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#giovanetti">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GIOVANETTI</person>:</from>

<p>The point I wish to make is that the quantity of iron and steel taken by the railways, as pointeci out by the hon. member for Newcastle (Mr. Nel) is only a small portion of the production of these works. The hon. member said that the whole of the railway requirements are only equal to 33-l/3rd per cent. and if the Government take 33-l/3rd per cent. how are they going to crush this industry out of existence? Surely there is room for the Union Steel Corporation to carry on their works with the 66-2/3rd per cent. which is not affected by this contract. It is interesting to note this Union Steel Corporation have had an agreement with the railway administration to take the whole of their supplies, and that is to be carried on still for another year, until 1928. In carrying out the agreement it is shown in Question 1061 of the Select Committee on Railways of 1925, that the Union Steel Corporation produced 18,900 tons of steel and only supplied 5,000 tons to the railways. Surely an industry of the size they say this is, is not going to fail if it cannot supply this 5,000 tons of iron? The question has been raised by the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford) that if this contract is entered into they are going to subsidize the industry at the expense of the railways. Surely he has not read the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#giovanetti">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GIOVANETTI</person>:</from>

<p>You cannot have done, because under the contract the goods have to be supplied at the price at which they can <span class="col_2687-2688" refersTo="page_0004"/>be imported and the railway administration is wide enough awake not to pay more than a fair price for the goods. In reply to another question it was shown in 1913 that the requirements of steel in the Union outside the requirements of the railway were 145,000 tons. Surely there is also a market for the Union Steel Corporation. Another point made by the hon. member for Newlands was that we shall find later on that this company will want to establish subsidiary industries. Why not? We are anxious to see other industries established.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stuttaford">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STUTTAFORD</person>:</from>

<p>With Government capital?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#giovanetti">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GIOVANETTI</person>:</from>

<p>We are not talking about Government capital. If they can establish subsidiary industries and supply goods equal to the price of those imported, we ought to support the Government. I hope the Minister will not accept the amendment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>This question has been raised and decided, and I do not intend revising that decision. I shall not accept the amendment. The position of the railways is safeguarded and for that simple reason the hon. Minister of Railways has not taken part in this debate.</p>

<p>It is not safeguarded in this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>In the old and the present clause the railway is absolutely safeguarded, just as it was under the following clause with Vereeniging&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Clause 7 of the contract of 1912 between the railway administration and Mr. S. Marks. The Minister and the Administration shall, during the period of 16 years referred to in the clause, place with the corporation its orders for such iron and steel goods as the corporation shall from time to time produce and the corporation shall produce and supply such goods in accordance with specifications thereof as furnished by the Minister or the administration, subject always to the condition that the corporation&#x2019;s works within the Union of South Africa are capable of producing such goods, and to the condition that the price and time quoted for such goods are satisfactory to the Minister or the Administration, and the quality is according to the specification aforesaid.</block>

<p>There is no essential difference between the nature of this clause and the clause in this Bill. The matter is entirely in the hands of the administration. If the Administration is satisfied, after enquiry, as to price and the quality, there is no earthly reason why the work should be divided and only 50 per cent. given instead of the whole. If it is not satisfied the work will not go to the corporation at all.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>Surely the standard is laid down in the clause, in B of the new clause. That is my answer and I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jagger">

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not agree with the Minister. Under the agreement of the railway department with the Union Steel Corporation there was a safeguard. They could only pay the price at which the stuff could be delivered in South Africa from overseas. In this clause is the proviso&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that if such prices are based upon the cost to the administration of any imported article there shall be included in such cost the amount of any dumping duty, etc.</block>

<p>What is to prevent the Government from putting on a good stiff dumping duty and then you have to reckon that in the cost? That was not in the old agreement. There is nothing to prevent, in the giving of orders for iron and steel on behalf of the railway department, the putting on in the first place of a good stiff dumping duty in computing the price and to this you have also to add the customs duties. It does not rest with the railway department to say what they shall pay. They have to pay this landed cost price plus the customs duties and any dumping duty which may be put on by the Government. The position certainly is not safeguarded as it was in the case of the Union Steel Corporation contract. I agree with what has been said by the hon. member for Newlands (Mr. Stuttaford). I think this is a distinct breach of the Act of Union. The Act of Union lays down that the railways shall be run on business lines. This is not on business lines. You are binding down the railway department which has to buy thousands of pounds&#x2019; worth of this material every year to buy from certain people.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JAGGER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a question of price and quality. You cannot compare the stuff you can get from overseas with the stuff here, because the Government may put on a dumping duty and you will have to pay and the customs duties as well. The dumping duty is, I consider, the weakness of this business. How can you compare the steel procured here with the steel that you can get from Germany, England and elsewhere? It will be said, of course, that they are dumping this stuff here and then there will be a dumping duty put on.</p>

<p>Yes, and very many that do not dump at all. Here we have to think of the national interest. It is in the interests of the railway department to buy its material as <span class="col_2689-2690" refersTo="page_0005"/>cheaply as it can. The people who bring produce and merchandise to the railways and have to pay railway rates will have to bear the cost. This just shows, when you get off the straight line, where you get landed. You have set out to foster this industry and it is going to be dependent on the railways, for the most part, at the cost of the users of the railways. Somebody has got to pay and they are the people who will have to pay. I hope the country will take a note of that.</p>

<speech by="#nicholls">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NICHOLLS</person>:</from>

<p>As a very ardent supporter of the principle of this Bill and as one who spoke very strongly in favour of its acceptance on the second reading, I must confess my inability to understand the attitude of the Government on this matter. I thought the object of this Bill was to produce cheap steel. Without the production of cheap steel it is quite impossible for these subsidiary industries to be established in this country and yet we are told that the acceptance of this amendment will vitiate the success of the industry. How can we reconcile these two arguments? It seems to me that if we are going to provide cheap steel in this institution, then the Government has absolutely surely nothing to fear in regard to competition from this industry. Why the Government won&#x2019;t accept such a reasonable amendment as this I, for the life of me, cannot understand. If the Government won&#x2019;t accept the amendment, then, obviously, to any unbiassed man, the object must be clear. The object then is to bolster up this industry, not to produce cheap steel, but steel probably costing so much that it will prevent the establishment of the secondary industries which we are all looking for. The establishment of this industry itself is nothing, but it is the industries that would be established upon the foundation that you are here building and you are preventing the production of this raw material of industry in as cheap a manner as possible by trying to bolster it up. I think the Government have been very wrongly advised if they&#x2019; won&#x2019;t accept this amendment.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>There has been a considerable delay in presenting this measure to the House, and I quite appreciated the impressions of the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger), and also the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Rockey), but they will realize what an extremely difficult subject this matter is. It is a most complicated Bill. It deals with the most complicated interests you could imagine, and in every way the whole measure is complicated, intricate, and difficult to understand, except by those who are accustomed to dig for diamonds and make a special study of the Acts. But we have gained, on the other hand, by not bringing this measure forward sooner, because there have been such rapid developments that we have been enabled to deal in the Bill with an entirely new situation, and to revise what we previously had decided upon, in the light of these new facts. The main points of the measure are not new, because I find, as far back as 1922, my predecessor attempted to pass legislation dealing with this thorny question. I find that there was a Bill before the House in 1924, and it went so far as a select committee, and last year we laid a Bill before the House&#x2014;A.B. 59&#x2014;&#x2019;26&#x2014;which, unfortunately, owing to the congestion of the order paper, could not be dealt with. The select committees of 1923, 1924 dealt with this matter, and the committee of 1923 simply reported&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your committee &#x2026; having taken evidence &#x2026; begs to report that the time at its disposal was insufficient to deal with the whole of the Bill, and recommends &#x2026; that the proceedings be resumed next session at the stage now reached.</block>

<p>That committee took some evidence. In the following year there was another select committee which also took evidence and reported&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your committee having carefully take» evidence and considered the Bill &#x2026; reports &#x2026; that in the opinion of the committee a situation may even arise which may make it necessary for the Government to come to Parliament to obtain powers &#x2026; to control the output of precious stones and to control the producers of these precious stones.</block>

<p>Now we must bear in mind that the alluvial diggings are the only instance of our marvellous mineral wealth where the small man gets an active chance to take part, to produce and to <span class="col_2695-2696" refersTo="page_0008"/>make something. That opportunity is entirely excluded in all other cases. Take our gold, coal, platinum and tin mines&#x2014;in almost every field there is almost no opportunity for the small man. I find, in the existing Acts of the four provinces, as regards alluvial diggings, the intention of the legislation and of the legislator has always been that the right to dig shall be granted to &#x201C;natural persons.&#x201D; It was never contemplated that syndicates and associations and companies should be formed. Now I may say that the main principle underlying this measure is that alluvial diggings, subject to the interests of the State, and a fair participation of the State where necessary and desirable, should remain the reserve and the preserve of the small man. I am quite at one with the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) that the State&#x2019;s interests should be guarded, and I am certainly taking steps in this Bill to give the State a better share as regards alluvial diamonds. It is simply preposterous, if you take the case of Lichtenburg to-day with these marvellously rich pockets, that the State&#x2019;s interest and benefit should be limited to a paltry 5s. a month from licences and claims, and the 10 per cent. export duty. The principle of this Bill is, therefore, to eliminate&#x2014;and in that respect it will be merely declaratory of the present law and the present statutes in the provinces&#x2014;to eliminate all syndicates and companies, and to limit as far as possible, alluvial diggings to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">natural persons.</block>

<p>That has obtained for the last 60 years or more, and it is only since the 30th June of last year, with these wonderful finds in Lichtenburg, that the position has been abused, and the true spirit and intent of the present legislation has been grossly departed from.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>Our Act of interpretation states that a person includes a juridical person&#x2014;by &#x201C;natural person&#x201D; I mean an ordinary human being&#x2014;not a syndicate or corporation. The principal reasons for this Bill are to put a stop to what has been specially rampant in the Transvaal&#x2014;the exhaustion of alluvial diggings under the guise of prospecting. We have had such problems as this&#x2014;under the law of the Transvaal if diamonds are discovered by an owner or those who are given leave to prospect, within three months from the date of the discovery you must either proclaim or give him a discoverer&#x2019;s certificate. You give him a certificate at once when you are satisfied that diamonds are found or are in payable quantities&#x2014; within three months of this you must either proclaim the ground, or the discoverer is entitled to work his discoverer&#x2019;s claim and work his owner&#x2019;s claims. The owner of a farm in respect of which the State has as yet no control allows prospecting on a large scale. I think instances have occurred where as many as 2,000 people have gathered on a farm, and, under the guise of prospecting, they were all the time winning diamonds and paying ten, fifteen or twenty per cent. to the owner of the farm. It is true that the Mining Commissioner can stop prospecting, but by the time he is able to intervene, hundreds of people have congregated in a jiffy, as it were, and they make an appeal ad misericordiam, and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are you going to stop us prospecting and take the bread out of our mouths?</block>

<p>It is only human nature that the department should be influenced by that state of affairs. The root of the evil lies in that you cannot control prospecting under our present powers. Another of the chief reasons for the introduction of the Bill is the intense sub-division of farms; another principal reason is the better administration of the improvement of social amenities on the diggings and the control of the native population on the diggings. The Bill will also consolidate, as far as possible, the Acts of the four provinces, and will give the State a better participation in the country&#x2019;s alluvial wealth. The control and manner of prospecting are also dealt with. If you have an area here and an area there, it is most undesirable that people should be allowed to congregate on one of the areas, and after scratching the surface only, fly off to another area, because they think it is richer, and to leave an area in which there are diamonds in fairly payable quantities, this area becoming derelict. The Bill aims at giving further control over production and diggings, and to avoid diamond rushes. I think the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) (Mr. Jagger) stigmatized diamond rushes as a scandal. I quite agree that the method has become entirely irregular and most undesirable, if not barbarous. I have, on previous occasions, pointed out that the State is very materially interested in the production of diamonds, or&#x2014;as has now become the case&#x2014;the non-production of diamonds. According to our statistics we derive about 23.31 per cent. from diamond mines. From the South-West we derive an average of 20.74 per cent., and from alluvial diamonds 10.85 per cent. The total percentage from the Union and South-West Africa is 20.46 per cent., which is a very material interest. In other words, the State is interested to the extent of one-fifth of the total diamond production, both as regards pipes or mines and alluvial diggings. We arrive at this figure by taking 60 per cent. of the Premier, 40 per cent. from the Free State, and 50 per cent. of the Cape mines, and 10 per cent. export duty, and so on. These percentages are the result of that basis of calculation. It is obvious that the State being so directly and materially interested cannot view with indifference the possible collapse of the diamond industry or trade. For these reasons, it is extremely urgent that this measure should pass during this session as soon as possible. There are really no new principles involved in this Bill, and there is really nothing highly contentious in it, except the provision regarding retrospectivity. The lottery system is dealt <span class="col_2697-2698" refersTo="page_0009"/>with in Clause 51&#x2014;regulation for distribution of claims. That clause gives the widest possible power to the Governor-General. He may confine the distribution or allotment to persons who have been carrying on bona fide digging operations for a period of not less than six months, and I propose adding to the clause&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and to any class or classes of persons.</block>

<p>There is ample precedent for this lottery system, which was in vogue in President Kruger&#x2019;s time to avoid gold rushes, and was adopted by us last year when we amended our gold law. The clause is purposely made most elastic. The Government is taking very large powers under the Bill, but it does so for the reason that it is impossible to embody in the measure provision for every possible case that may occur. It is possible, for instance, that the Governor-General, in a case like that of Namaqualand&#x2014;I am not indicating the line of policy of Government, but in view of the fact that Namaqualand has suffered for years from drought and otherwise, it would be competent for the Government, under the lottery clause, to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We throw a block open by way of allotment, and we confine the people who may take part in the lottery to those living in Namaqualand,</block>

<p>although I do not say for a moment that this is going to happen; and so on with other areas. Say you have several areas in Lichtenburg district. You may have 10,000 people taking part in a lottery for 5,000 claims. You can then stipulate that those who obtained claims in the first lottery cannot participate in the second lottery. The next principle introduced is the leasing system, which is dealt with in Clause 74&#x2014;alternative method of disposing of alluvial areas. That is only a repetition of the principle contained in Section 30 of the existing gold law. The next point is contained in Clause 75, which enables the Governor-General to declare any land or any alluvial digging to be a State alluvial digging, and he may deal with it in any manner which may be prescribed by regulation. There again you have the principle of Section 30 of the gold law, which says you may declare any precious metals area as a State digging. It does say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">with the previous consent of Parliament,</block>

<p>but I do not propose to put that in this Bill, for to handle alluvial diggings is a bagatelle compared with the handling of a block of two or three thousand claims on the East Rand, which presupposes the sinking of £1,500,000 or £2,000,000 before you can obtain any profits. The machinery required for alluvial diggings is so insignificant that it would be a mere bagatelle, and, in cases where diggings prove to be enormously rich, it would be a neglect of duty on the part of the State to parcel these rich diggings out to the general public. The State should say that these diggings are to be worked for the benefit of the State, to allow the public to get a certain percentage if possible and desirable, but that the bulk of that wealth should go to the State. Clauses 63 and 73 provide for the elimination of companies and syndicates working claims. That is not a new principle, for the whole principle of the existing law is to confine diggers&#x2019; certificates and licences to natural persons. Under the legislation of the Cape and the Transvaal, which are the main provinces interested in alluvial diggings, a person applying for a digger&#x2019;s certificate has to be approved in every way, especially as to his character, which condition cannot be applied to juridical persons.</p>

<p>But only to a natural person. As a matter of fact, until recently the syndicates have been quite insignificant, and few and far between. Then I come to the limitation of output, Clause 115. I shall deal with that separately afterwards. I am dealing now with the main principles which are not new. We have the Diamond Control Act of 1925, so that the limitation of output is not new. Then we have the exclusion of civil servants, Clause 114, and the last schedule of the Bill. If there was ever a desirable provision, it is this. It is wholly unsound that civil servants should be interested in anything speculative. Clauses 13 and 19 deal with prospectors&#x2019;, discoverers&#x2019; and owners&#x2019; rights, and we make provision on the same principle as in the Reserved Minerals Act of last year for people who are mere settlers. We give them a share in alluvial precious stones. Although the Bill deals with precious stones, the only concrete instance up to now is diamonds. In the Reserved Minerals Act we placed the settler in a better position, and the State was debarred from interfering unless they resumed the possession of the land and gave the settler compensation. Generally speaking, we have awarded to the settler one-half of the rights that would accrue to a full owner or a private owner. You find that under Clauses 13 and 19, and especially in the fifth schedule of the Bill. Then we make provision for the control of liquor on the diggings&#x2014;108 (1) (i). You will see it is a regulation for&#x2014;</p>

<p>The present position is you have a democratic system. There are various diggers&#x2019; committees to whom application has to be made for a <span class="col_2699-2700" refersTo="page_0010"/>digger&#x2019;s certificate, and in their discretion they may cancel a digger&#x2019;s certificate. These committees are elected on a democratic basis and the election is carried out on the lines of a parliamentary election, but the diggers are usually so intent upon their pursuits that where you have two thousand or three thousand competent voters, only about 200 appear on the scene, and they elect a diggers&#x2019; committee which is not satisfactory to the rest, who come forward to the department and say they are dissatisfied with the committee. We can only ask them why they didn&#x2019;t take part in the election. There is a difference of opinion on this question of diggers&#x2019; committees, but so far they have answered very well and have done substantial justice. Their discretion has not been fettered in the past. They have been able to cancel certificates in their discretion, and they have by experience been found to do substantial justice, although certain irregularities have occurred, especially since July last, and so we take power to dissolve a diggers&#x2019; committee and to substitute an administrative board. Really that principle is not exactly new, but it is a departure from the present Act, and is a necessary safeguard. Then we come to Clause 76, which deals with what are called restricted alluvial diggings, and the object of that is to carry out the main principles of the Bill, that is, to preserve diggings that can be worked by small people. Subsection (2) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any restricted alluvial digging declared as such under sub-section (1), no claim-holder shall employ more than ten persons at any one time for the working of his claim or claims&#x2026;.</block>

<p>In order to effectively eliminate syndicates and companies, you must have a limitation such as this, so as to make it not worth while for syndicates and companies to surreptitiously, in the guise of natural persons, to exploit those persons and to virtually carry on alluvial digging. In 60 we make provision for certificates of character which applies to European, coloured and natives as well. That is a very necessary thing, and under 115 sub-clause (2) we make provision for the control of prospecting&#x2014;paragraph (d)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Prohibit any prospecting whatsoever, whether on Crown land or on private land, either throughout the Union or any area defined in such Proclamation.</block>

<p>That is when we come to the conclusion that over-production is threatened. That is a necessary power, otherwise you cannot limit the output. It is better to go to the source of the whole thing than to allow a man to prospect and find a rich alluvial digging, and then prevent him from working it. It is better in the first place to prevent him from finding a bucketful of diamonds than not to allow him to dispose of them when found. With regard to the 60 per cent. in the Premier Mine, 40 per cent. in the Free State mines, and 50 per cent. in the Cape mines, as distinguished from the alluvial digging, I am proposing to make it uniform as regards future pipes or mines by making it 50 per cent. throughout. I shall take the sense of the House on that question, and if the feeling is that we leave the percentages as they are to-day, I shall be glad to give effect to that. I leave it an open question. In Clause 2 we deal with State title. In sub-clause (1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding anything in any other law contained, the provisions of this Act shall apply to land in the Province of the Cape of Good Hope held by private persons under title which does not contain a reservation of precious stones in favour of the Crown.</block>

<p>We know the history of the Free State and the dispute in Griqualand West and the £90,000 compensation. These farms fall in that category. In Clause 1 the right of mining for precious stones and disposing of precious stones is vested in the Crown, and that is the practical effect of the legislation in the gold laws for a long period of time, and for that reason I do not see why these few Free State farms, because they were taken from the jurisdiction of the Free State about 1870, should enjoy this immunity any further. If they had remained in the Free State they would have become subject to the legislation of the Free State like every other Free State farm to-day. I find the Volksraad resolution of the Transvaal in 1858 took the right of mining from the hands of the owners of the land, and the principle set out in the first gold law of 1871 is that the right of mining for gold and precious metals shall belong to the State for the protection of persons and goods, and for the benefit of the public. As regards the Cape, for a long period of time, grants were issued with a reservation of mineral rights to the Crown. In Natal legislation was passed a very long time ago vesting all mineral rights in the Crown. In the Free State, I think as far back as 1871, an Act was passed taking control of fields on which precious stones were discovered, giving the State the right to purchase such areas or farms if precious stones were discovered if the owner consented. If the owner did not consent, the State assumed the right of mining, and practically controlled disposal. In the Transvaal in 1883, there was an Act which actually vested the minerals themselves also in the State. At the same time, while vesting the minerals formally in the State, that Act conferred certain rights on the owners, or left certain rights vested in the owners, which practically amounted to the ownership of the minerals being, from a common-sense point of view, vested in the owner. But hon. members must distinguish between the dominium in or the ownership of minerals from the right of mining and disposal. Now the gold laws throughout have always asserted that main principle, that the right of mining and disposal is vested in the State. Ordinance No. 66 of 1903 of the Transvaal dealing with precious stones lays down the same basic principle. On these grounds I think it is invidious to distinguish between these few Free State farms, about 16 or 17 of them, I believe.</p>

I want to point out to the hon. member (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) that I understand the De Beers Company are the people who own these farms, or a good many of them, but whether it be the De Beers Company, or the ordinary natural person, or a big man or a small man, the fact remains that his farm is entirely guaranteed to himself, unless he prospects or allows others to prospect, and if he chooses to prospect or allows others to prospect, and as a consequence of his own action the farm is proclaimed, he must naturally stand the consequences, and then the State must acquire its rights. There is no reason for excluding them in case of proclamation. Up to now these farms have been entirely outside the law, these few farms compared to the hundreds and thousands of farms in the Cape have been a law unto themselves, and I do not see why that state of affairs should continue.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I understand that there are a few of these farms where actually private diggings are being carried on, and I do not propose interfering with them. I am going into the question, and should I find that they are unintentionally affected by Clause 2 of the Bill, I will put in the appropriate wording to exclude them. The two instances that I know of&#x2014;and I know of no others&#x2014;are Sidney-on-Vaal and the Pniel Estates, where private diggings are being carried on, and I must say, to the credit of the people who are carrying them on, they are model diggings. That is my information. There is no intention at all to affect them by this Bill. Another principle that is introduced in this Bill, which will be found in Clause 10, is that diamonds found in the course of prospecting shall be considered the property of the prospector. He must, of course, be a licensed prospector. Under this Bill he must have a certificate; he must be an approved man. If he finds diamonds in the ordinary course of bona fide prospecting, they shall be his property, but the Governor-General is vested with the power of declaring by regulation in respect of any particular area or district, that diamonds found in the course of prospecting shall be shared by the State and the prospector. It is rather singular that the statutes up to now have never said to whom the diamonds found in the course of prospecting belong. There is not a word in any statute on this question, but it has been assumed, and it has been the practice, that the prospector should be awarded the stones. Do hon. gentlemen know what has recently occurred? At the mouth of the Orange River, at Alexander Bay, between £150,000 and £160,000 in value of diamonds were found within seven weeks, with 20 people working in the trenches, in the course of prospecting. Now on what principle, I ask, these finds being on Crown lands, on what principle should the prospectors there pocket the whole lot? I say that it is not fair to the State. No Government will abuse its power. We do not want to interfere with the small man and the poor man prospecting and finding a diamond here and there. He is welcome to any reasonable find, out when we come to an extraordinary position like this, then I say that the State is entitled to its share.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>They were searching there under a licence which gives them prospecting areas. When I viewed these diamonds, I must say that I saw the loveliest stones that have been found in the course of our diamond history. They are simply marvellous. Now in this Bill we take very explicit powers in favour of the Government that enable us to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is enough; you have prospected quite enough.</block>

<p>I went up there personally a few days ago, and I must say that I am quite satisfied that these gentlemen who carried on the prospecting there, Dr. Merensky and his colleague, acted in the most bona fide way, but that area is so marvellously rich that they could not help themselves, they could not help finding these diamonds in the course of ordinary bona fide prospecting. As I say, none of these principles are new, or very contentious. That is in the clause about prohibiting subdivision. You will see in Clause 20 that power is given to the Minister, which, of course, means the Government, that where he is satisfied that in the past a farm has been deliberately cut up in order to multiply the 250 owners&#x2019; and discovers&#x2019; claims by 10, 20, 30, 50 and 60, as has actually been the case, the Government can say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We won&#x2019;t recognize that subdivision as regards owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; claims; we will treat the farm as a unit, as it was before.</block>

<p>It is retrospective and it is a matter that can be fought out here in the House in the committee stage. There is no need for a select committee for these matters. I have endeavoured to convince hon. members that most of these principles are not new principles, and as it is urgently necessary that this Bill should pass and be applied as soon as possible, I do not think it is desirable to refer it to a select committee. It is rather ironical that the same <span class="col_2703-2704" refersTo="page_0012"/>gentlemen, who have been stigmatizing certain other measures before the House as socialistic, should run to the Government to-day and clamour for the control of alluvial diggings. What we propose here in regard to the limitation of output and what is desired, very strongly desired, by hon. members opposite, is a justification, an ample and complete justification of the action of the Government in introducing the Diamond Control Bill of 1925. What would have been the position of hon. members who are to-day clamouring for this control if there had been no Diamond Control Act? Could they with any vestige of justification have come to the Government to-day and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Control the alluvial output,</block>

<p>whilst they themselves in regard to mines were not controlled? Obviously not. They would have had to come to us to-day and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For goodness sake control the whole thing, mines and alluvial.</block>

<p>I want to point out that this measure, the Diamond Control Act, was described by the right hon. the leader of the Opposition at the time as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">this miserable measure.</block>

<p>I hope he is not going to regard this Bill in the same light, and I hope he will recognize that it is in the interests of the State, and in the interests of every mine owner and in the interests of every alluvial digger that some reasonable limitation should be placed upon the output of diamonds, otherwise down will come baby and cradle and all; the whole lot of them, to use a vulgar expression, will be in the soup. It is obvious to me that when we passed the Diamond Control Act in 1925 we excluded alluvial diamonds on the sole ground that their production was so insignificant that we could ignore them. Another motive that actuated me was that the big syndicate&#x2014;I am speaking of the present syndicate as well as the old one; I do not see much difference in principle between the old syndicate and the present one except that we have got better terms for the producers&#x2014;that your syndicate spends its profits in other countries whereas your alluvial digger spends the money in this country. But to-day we have to deal with an entirely new problem. There has been a revolution of alluvial digging and we are bound to take cognizance of it and to protect both the State and the mine producer and the alluvial digger. You will see that the select committee of 1924 already adumbrated the possibility of limitation of the output&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the course of enquiry your committee was impressed with the importance of the question of the control of the output and disposal of precious stones. In the opinion of your committee circumstances may even arise which may make it necessary for the Government to come to Parliament to obtain power to control the output of precious stones of all producers within the Union and South-West Africa.</block>

<p>As regards South-West Africa, there is no need for legislation. The Administration of South-West has an ample grip on the situation now, and what is more, while the State here in the Union has a very material interest in the diamond market and in the success of the diamond industry, South-West is to a very large extent dependent for its revenue on its diamond trade. With regard to this right of mining, and the disposal of precious stones, you will find that in the Transvaal Parliament in 1908, before Union, the position was fully set forth by the Minister of Mines, Mr. Jacob de Villiers, now Judge of Appeal, and is reported in the Hansard for 1908. As I say, we maintain in this Bill the root principle that has always been a characteristic feature of past legislation, that an owner is not forced to throw his ground open to prospectors or to have his ground proclaimed. If a man is a farmer and wishes to remain a farmer he is fully entitled to do so, and I think it would be a sorry day if the State stepped in and compelled a farmer, an owner of land that is beneficially occupied, to have his land thrown open and proclaimed against his will; but if he chooses to allow prospecting and exposes himself to the proclamation of his ground, then he has to deal with and recognize the possibility of a big community arising on the digging and the necessities and amenities in connection with the community, such as water and so on.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>In Sections 13 and 19 his rights are defined. We simply maintain the rights as they are to-day. The select committee suggested that we should have a proportional basis, which would have eliminated the object of these intense subdivisions that have taken place during the last nine months. It was a very laudable object they had in view, but when I analyzed the result of their proposition I found that in the Cape Province, for instance, we should be giving away State assets by granting uniform rights throughout the Union. For instance, in the Cape Province to-day on a farm of 1,000 morgen the owner becomes entitled to claims consisting of 90,000 square feet. In the Transvaal under the very same circumstances the owner becomes entitled to 414,000 square feet. By what right would we have been entitled to give away State assets in the Cape Province by levelling up the 90,000 with the 414,000, bearing in view the fact that this has always been the law in the Cape Province and that every owner who has thought of minerals or precious stones has acquired his property and got transfer knowing what the law was? We did not feel justified in doing that. There was so much dissatisfaction on the part of the owners that we thought it better to leave the law as it stands to-day, and that is why in Schedules 4 and 5 of the Bill we have set forth the rights as they exist to-day. With regard to Clause 20 and this retrospective provision, our statistics show that up to 30th <span class="col_2705-2706" refersTo="page_0013"/>June of last year the average size of a piece of ground proclaimed as alluvial digging in the Transvaal was no less than 1,040 morgen. In the Cape Province the average size proclaimed was something like 1,020 morgen. Suddenly since this intense subdivision the average has fallen to quite an insignificant number of morgen. We have the farm &#x201C;Welverdiend&#x201D; which has been cut up into 50 blocks, and on every block a special company has been floated. That company is the registered owner of that plot of ground, and the result is that each company claims 200 owners&#x2019; and 50 discoverers&#x2019; claims which is roughly equal to five morgen. These acute and astute gentlemen are very far-seeing when it comes to extracting wealth. That farm has changed hands long ago, and the registered owner is a company. What could they do? They could divide it into a thousand pieces of five morgen each, and each five morgen would be equivalent to their owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; claims; and not one inch of ground would be left to the public and the State. No one in his proper senses could ever say that that was the intention of the Legislature of the Transvaal or of any part of the Union. These are owners&#x2019; farms intensely subdivided. [List read.] If you look at the diagram of the farm &#x201C;Doornplaats,&#x201D; it is a sheet like this [the Minister held up a diagram] and full of strips, cut up with a view to artificially increasing the owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; claims. Grasfontein has been divided into 50 portions, Welverdiend into 50, and so on; the African and European Investment Company has eight of these farms and has a capital of £2,000,000; the Treasure Trove Syndicate, £127,000; Lichtenburg, £70,000; Welverdiend West, alluvial, £50,000, and so on. We know what is behind this. It is not a bona fide industry for the production of diamonds. It is making paper and selling it. It is market-rigging. Everybody knows what happened with platinum. Before an ounce of platinum had been extracted out of the soil companies had been formed here and elsewhere and shares were quoted on our markets, which panned out at no less than 13 millions sterling, before an ounce of platinum had been produced; and then they talk about the innocent shareholder! What people were the shareholders? Not the ordinary poor farmer and digger, but the gambler and the speculator. It is commonly conceded and it is common cause that this intense subdivision is a great evil, and should be stopped. They are now coming with tears in their eyes and saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have done it, don&#x2019;t touch us, but stop it for the future.</block>

<p>That is why I propose to make the clause retrospective. We had a similar evil in the Transvaal, and I am sorry to say that that was the spirit that prevailed on the Rand in the early days&#x2014;I am not commenting on the present conditions&#x2014;for many years the gold mining industry, as an industry, was very much neglected, and the main object was to make paper, sell it and rig the market. The main object was to obtain control over companies, not by holding shares, but sending out circulars and proxies to be signed by the ordinary shareholder who allows himself to be led by the nose. When, under the aegis of the leader of the Opposition, or rather Gen. Botha at that time, and the leader of the Opposition was his right-hand man, Mr. de Villiers, the Minister of Mines, introduced the gold law of 1908 he said this in the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The select committee appointed in 1904 had returns from the Alining Department in order to ascertain what owners had got in the past, and the schedules in Appendix A were given to the select committee&#x2026;. On the farm Waterval the owners&#x2019; rights were one-tenth, or whatever the proportion was at that time, and they got 530 morgen, or 13 percent. On the farm Randfontein, 943 morgen, the owner&#x2019;s rights were 342 morgen, or 37 per cent.; on the farm Booysen, 350 morgen, the owner&#x2019;s rights were 253 morgen, or 80 per cent.; on the farm Turffontein, 167 morgen, the owner&#x2019;s rights were 166 morgen. That was obtained by process of legerdemain.</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. W. Hosken: You described it rightly. The Minister of Mines: It was clearly an evasion of the law, and clearly illegal. The way it was done was this&#x2014;the Gold Law said that one-tenth of the farm should be given out in mynpacht, and the vergunning claims were 60, and when they had got the mynpacht, vergunning and owners&#x2019; claims, they transferred the remaining portion of the farm to another company, and it did the same thing as the previous full owner until finally they came to Booysen, which practically consisted of 60 vergunning claims and mynpacht.</block>

<p>This is the evil I am trying to combat in this retrospective clause, and for the future also. There is the case or the Consolidated Main Reef&#x2014;recently its shares have appreciated. Why? I leave it to hon. members. Take the case of the Geduld East. We were reproached for not accepting the terms offered, and that area was systematically decried. Last year we gave this area to the Union Corporation, and what was the result? Before anything worth while mentioning was done to the property, the shares on the market stood at 33s. The only development that was done was a few hundred feet. Take the case of a ` company a few years ago. There a company used one of its officials or directors as a mere dummy, and hon. members should read the opinion of Mr. Justice Kotzé on the methods that were employed. That is the sort of evil I am trying to eradicate.</p>

<from>&#x2020;The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I am very glad I took part in drawing up that law, and I am not ashamed of the part I played. The Minister forwarded me a draft copy of the Bill, and I spent <span class="col_2707-2708" refersTo="page_0014"/>nights over it, and I and others are responsible for the leasing clauses contained in Section 30. The leasing system was suggested by Mr. Warington Smyth (Secretary for Mines and Industries), and the formulas and calculations were made by Sir Robert Kotzé (late Chief Mining Engineer), and the Government of the day&#x2014;to their credit, be it said&#x2014;entirely approved of this new principle of leasing. The mine owners of the Transvaal and the mining industry were, in President Kruger&#x2019;s time, unjustifiably well off, and if it were not for that leasing clause under the Act of 1908, we should not to-day be drawing £1,300,000 per annum from the Government Areas alone. The Government Gold Mining Areas are the finest, the biggest, the richest and, perhaps, one of the best-conducted mines in the world. I want to give the leader of the Opposition every credit for his share in that arrangement. Why has the Government Gold Mining Areas been such a success? Because there were no watering of capital and no vendors&#x2019; shares, and the laws restrict the company to such an extent that there can be no improper dealing with the company or its shares. If that principle had been followed from the very start, the State would have drawn millions of pounds from the Transvaal alone. That is my justification for employing the lease provisions. I would refer hon. members to the Transvaal Hansard of 1908, page 703, where Mr. de Villiers, the then Minister of Mines, dealt with the question of leases. The leaders of the mining industry in the Transvaal opposed that principle. The people working the New State Areas, the Government Gold Mining Areas, and other leased areas, are quite satisfied, and the State is satisfied also. The State has substantial and entirely justifiable interest. Mr. de Villiers, in his speech referring to Clause 30&#x2014;the same principle as I have proposed&#x2014;said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The areas are valuable State assets, and to throw them open to the public is entirely indefensible. They should not be lightly thrown away, as they are State assets&#x2026; There are at present on the Rand farm which are very valuable, and have been closed to pegging because of their great value &#x2026; These farms can be cut up into blocks so as to constitute workable mining propositions and be leased to companies to the best advantage. &#x2026; If this had been done previously, it would have been a tremendous financial interest to the State, &#x2026; and these workable areas on the Rand would have been worth millions and millions of pounds to day.</block>

<p>That is why I say the mining industry was unjustifiably well off in republican days. The proposal has been made to me that instead of giving the owners discoverers&#x2019; rights, as set forth in Clauses 13 and 19, we should cut out all owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; rights, and adopt the percentage basis. The owner and the discoverer is usually one and the same person. The owner of a farm does not allow anyone to prospect without his permission. The owner stipulates that he should have the benefit of any mineral discoveries that may be made, and he allows the discoverer some compensation. The idea under the percentage basis is to cut out the owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; rights, and instead to give the owner 12 per cent. or 15 per cent. of the value of the finds. It is suggested that the buyers should account to the owner for that percentage. It seems, however, to be an entirely impracticable scheme, and not feasible for a moment. The effect would be to lay a direct tax on the diggers, who would be up in arms at once. There are so many administrative difficulties, that I do not think we can entertain the proposition. I have inquired from the mining commissioners and the officials of the mines department, and it has been represented to me that the whole thing is impracticable. What is more, I have never had a general request from the owners suggesting a percentage basis. I should not be justified, on the information I have to-day, in adopting such a basis. For one thing, the opportunities for evasion would be many. I do not think I need dwell further on the main principles of the Bill. As regards the exclusion of officials, there are certain syndicates to-day in which I have reason to believe public servants have been directly and materially interested. I mention the Carrig Syndicate and Waaikraal. It has been represented to me, I do not say it is true, because I have not investigated, that certain officials get hold of certain information, and that information, by way of telegrams, is divulged. I have reason to believe officials are interested in alluvial diggings and in recent discoveries, and I say that the thing is entirely unsound, and I think the House will approve of the principles in President Kruger&#x2019;s law in 1898, repealed afterwards, that officials were to be excluded. According to the schedule, we shall include members of the Electricity Supply Commission, the Miners&#x2019; Phthisis Board, the Miners&#x2019; Phthisis Medical Bureau, the Miners&#x2019; Phthisis Medical Board of Appeal, the Control Board of the Land and Agricultural Bank, the Railway Board, or any other board whose members are appointed by the Governor-General or by a Minister of State, or by the administrator of a province. It is unsound that these persons should be interested where they are giving their whole time to the State. These diggings are pre-eminently speculative.</p>

<p>I have no objection at all. With regard to the rushes which have taken place, members will remember we were forced to withdraw Namaqualand from prospecting. In the first place, the find at Alexander Bay was to unprecedented, and the production, even in the case of one prospector, so without example, that we were bound to take steps. If we had not withdrawn Namaqualand from prospecting, we should have had a rush from all parts of the Union, and many of the people who would <span class="col_2709-2710" refersTo="page_0015"/>have come there would have been hopelessly smashed, and would have been thrown on the shoulders of the Government. Representations have been made to me to embody provisions preventing wives and children from being present at the diggings, and I think other provisions of the Bill are calculated to reduce the enormous aggregation of human beings at the diggings, but I say it would be inhuman to prevent wives and children from being on the diggings. It would lead to a most undesirable state. The sound thing to do is to ascertain as far as possible the capacity of a particular digging, and to see by the administration of this Bill, when it becomes law, that we do not allow there more people than are reasonably proportionate to the capacity of the diggings. To-day you have diggings thrown open where the capacity is 20,000 people, but you have people there in clusters of two or three times that number.</p>

<p>Because we are going to limit the area by applying the lottery system, or the lease basis, or by declaring it a State digging, and controlling it in every way to see that the number of employees is limited. If you have a lottery, all the persons will have to be present on the proposed digging personally, and they must have their licence in their possession. You do not throw the digging open at once. After the lottery has taken place, and the prizes drawn, they can only start work a month hence, and those who have not drawn a prize will return to their homes. Those, for instance, who go to places like Lichtenburg and Rustenburg to take part in a lottery will not take their ox-wagons and their wives and families, as is the case to-day. They come in the most improvident manner. Another thing we are endeavouring to do is to purge the diggings of undesirable characters. You will never succeed entirely, but you can do a lot by controlling the licences; by eliminating the criminal class; by controlling the trade on the diggings; and by preventing traders from being interested in claims, and by confining the digger simply to digging. He may not be interested in anything else. In Clause 59 we make provision for the grounds upon which diggers&#x2019; certificates can be refused. You will see by Clause 59&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A digger&#x2019;s certificate may be refused or cancelled by a diggers&#x2019; committee or other prescribed authority, if it is satisfied that the applicant for or holder of such certificate &#x2014;(a) is or has been engaged in illicit trade in diamonds; (b) has contravened any law relating to the possession or disposal of diamonds; (c) is or has been engaged in illicit liquor trade; (d) associates with undesirable or suspected persons; (e) visited a native labour location or compound&#x2026;.</block>

<p>What happens is really shocking. Whites go to native locations for immoral purposes. A man who does that sort of thing has no right to be on the diggings. Or&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(f) has been convicted of any criminal offence and sentenced to any term of imprisonment without the option of a fine or to a fine exceeding £30.</block>

<p>It has been represented to me we are conferring larger powers on the diggers&#x2019; committees than those which have existed in previous legislation. A diggers&#x2019; committee to-day can refuse a certificate or cancel it, and the remedy is that the digger can appeal. We provide here for the appeal, but we specify the grounds because a diggers&#x2019; committee, not being a court of law, will have a better idea of those grounds. With regard to an appeal from a diggers&#x2019; committee, the appeal court is a3 follows&#x2014;the mining commissioner, the head of the detective department, and the chairman of the diggers&#x2019; committee which has refused or cancelled the licence. It is obvious that the chairman who has taken part on the diggers&#x2019; committee which has decided the matter will be unconsciously biassed in an appeal, so I have made it necessary that the chairman of an entirely different diggings must go. I have made no difference or alteration in the case of the mining commissioner. As regards the head of the detective department, I have had a case before me where somebody in the detective department has written to a diggers&#x2019; committee mentioning that a certain digger&#x2019;s licence should be taken away. The certificate was cancelled, and the digger appealed, and the very person who instigated the taking away of the licence sat as a judge of appeal. That is absurd. Of course, it is too absurd for words. That will be done administratively with an official of a certain standing from the detective department who has had nothing to do with the particular digger, and who shall sit as a judge on appeal with the other two. Then the control board which has hitherto, been an extra-legal body in this sense, that the law has not provided for it, although it was created by my predecessor and has been recognized in administration and in practice, it has been represented to me that we should abolish that. But I am not quite satisfied. I think that under the new Bill there will be a new state of affairs, that the diggers will take far more interest in elections than in the past, and that also the diamond control board will take a far greater interest than in the past, and until they have proved entirely unsatisfactory I think we should not abolish or dissolve them. However, the power is maintained under the Bill to either dissolve or abolish them, and to supersede any diggers&#x2019; committee by an administrative board. Now the question may very well be put to me whether the diggings have been a curse or an unmixed blessing to the digging community. I must say candidly that my impression is that they have been a disadvantage rather than an advantage. I cannot get away from that impression. I know the diggers won&#x2019;t love me for saying it, but at any rate the diggings have in any case afforded an outlet to people <span class="col_2711-2712" refersTo="page_0016"/>who otherwise would have been thrown on the shoulders of the State.</p>

<p>The labourers are being enticed from the farms and the ordinary people whom we as a Government have been trying to help have been in many cases enticed away from the work they are doing to-day. Sir Robert Kotzé, a few years ago after this Government came into office, made a calculation and I think he came to the conclusion that if the diamonds which had been produced from alluvial diggings for a certain period up to the time when he reported had been produced by mines, the State would have been better off to an extent, I think, of over £300,000. But we must bear in mind, on the other hand, that the mines employ comparatively few whites and the alluvial diggings afford a very large outlet to whites. Many more whites are employed on alluvial diggings than on the mines.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to say. I am not in possession of statistics or reliable data to give the exact figure. On the other hand, for instance now in Namaqualand, I have been told that in a certain area where diamonds have been found and where the farms have been mortgaged, the farmers have taken advantage of the opportunity and they have made enough money out of these discoveries, the mere fact that diamonds are on their ground, to pay off their mortgages and pay their ordinary debts and they are free from debt. I have been told that that has been the case in the Lichtenburg district. But I must say probably if you take the debit and credit side of the thing all round, you arrive at a debit balance, and, in my opinion, not a credit balance. In regard to the professional digger, I do believe that he has made a decent living and more than a decent living, but you have a lot of men going on to the diggings who have never been diggers before and who have had no experience and they generally get into a hopeless mess. I hope that conditions will be ameliorated in the future. I propose putting on the order paper, as soon as the second reading is passed, a list of amendments. There are defects in the Bill as now drawn. I propose putting on the order paper these amendments and I hope that when hon. members criticize the provisions of the Bill at this stage they will bear in mind that these amendments will appear.</p>

<p>I listened with the greatest attention to the speech of the Minister of Mines and Industries and I would like to deal at once with one point. He said that it was a very strange spectacle that we who went to him and urged him to do something about the alluvial diggings were the people who objected to the socialistic principle of the Diamond Control Bill and the Iron and Steel Bill. It is quite true that I had an interview with the Minister before Parliament met, and I think I discussed the matter with him twice afterwards, but I did not go like a mendicant to the Minister and ask him to bring in this legislation. Had he not introduced the Diamond Control Bill he need not have introduced this Bill to-day. It is because he tied the hands of the diamond mines, because he ties us down to a certain production and certain prices, in short by preventing us from competing, that he forced us to come to him and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is it fair you should have prevented us from protecting our rights?</block>

<p>Our hands were tied and alluvial production was allowed to increase and increase without <span class="col_2713-2714" refersTo="page_0017"/>anything happening. The Minister will give me credit that I introduced an amendment at the time the Diamond Control Bill was before the House that &#x201C;alluvial&#x201D; should be included, and I based my argument on the fact that we had the experience of South-West Africa, and we had the experience of Angola and the Congo. The Minister would not accept the amendment for the reason which he gives, and it is a reason which guided previous diamond conferences in refusing to limit the output of alluvial, and that is that alluvial production was not very large. The fact remains that we, on this side did propose an amendment, which, if it had been accepted, would have made this Bill unnecessary to-day. Therefore it was hardly fair to suggest that we had come and said: &#x201C;You must protect us at all costs against ourselves.&#x201D; We do not approve of anything which savours of socialism in this Bill. We did not ask for socialistic legislation and we do not approve of socialistic principles even in this Bill, and I want to make it clear that anything which savours of socialism, anything which does not give the digger the same right as we have, anything which does not give the digger the right to which he is entitled, will not be acceptable, to me anyhow.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>The people who find them, I suppose. Now, Mr. Speaker, I agree that this Bill is long overdue and that it is very essential and that it should be passed promptly into law. And I may say this to the Minister, that in this instance I am speaking for the South African party, and we shall give the Minister every assistance to pass the Bill into law in the quickest possible time. (Hear, hear.) The diamond industry is in so precarious a position that unless a real sign is given that the Government is alive to this position, unless something is done, a collapse will follow. I want to say this, I do not stand here defending any particular mining industry, I approach this question from the same angle and in the same spirit which induced the Minister of Mines to send a telegram some time ago to the Mayor of Kimberley, congratulating him on the 60th anniversary of the discovery of diamonds, and on the civilizing influence which the diamond industry has had, I look upon the industry as a whole, both alluvial and mines, as branches of one industry, and the one branch cannot flourish where the other one is decaying. The diamond industry as a whole deserves the support of the Government, of any South African Government, not only because it gives them revenue, but because that industry has played a large part in the development of this country, and if placed on a sound basis it will again play the part of a great civilizing influence in South Africa. The history of the diamond industry in South Africa is an interesting, and one may even say a romantic one. Diamonds were discovered in Kimberley sixty years ago and it was the money made out of the exploitation of diamonds in Kimberley which supplied the means for the development of the gold mining industry of the Witwatersrand and which eventually established the national credit of South Africa. Even to-day the national credit of South Africa is largely dependent upon the mining industry (gold and diamonds) of this country. It was the properly organized diamond mining industry which played a leading part in the opening up of Rhodesia, which played a great part in the establishment of the fruit-growing industry of the Western Province, of the dynamite works at Somerset West, cattle ranching, horse breeding, agriculture and so many other spheres of industry in South Africa, and I am convinced that it is only the uncertainty regarding the position of that industry which has prevented the diamond companies from continuing their many general activities. I see no reason why, given the proper conditions, they should not resume their useful activities; but otherwise it with be a question of seeing how they can keep every penny and get every penny back to pay a small dividend to their shareholders. The difficult sections of the Bill are those dealing with alluvial deposits. The Minister has approached the question from the point of view of the genuine digger, and he has made every effort to preserve the alluvial diggings for him and I am in complete agreement with him on this point. On the other hand, the Minister has not shown the same solicitude for the rights of the owner; not even the discoverer has received that generous treatment to which I think he is entitled. In his very laudable desire to protect the individual digger, the Minister has been unduly hard on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">any corporate body or association of persons</block>

<p>by making certain sections of the Bill retrospective. Even the section dealing with the&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">limitation of the output to the world&#x2019;s demand</block>

<p>can, with advantage, be strengthened so as definitely and unequivocally to prove to the consumers of diamonds the world over that they can rely on our not squandering the riches with which nature has endowed this country. I will now deal with the alluvial position and the sections of the Bill dealing with this problem. Diamond legislation in the Cape and Transvaal never contemplated that stones in alluvial could be found away from rivers; under such geological conditions as, in effect, to be equivalent to a mine, or any such climatic conditions that they could not be advantageously worked by individual diggers. The alluvial deposit was very rarely of any great thickness and therefore mining was easy. In short the kind of deposit known until recently lent itself admirably to exploitation by the individual digger. The Lichtenburg discoveries have already upset the old doctrine that alluvial is never very rich nor very persistent. In Namaqualand diamonds are found under still different conditions. The alluvial diamond deposits in South-West Africa, in Angola and <span class="col_2715-2716" refersTo="page_0018"/>in the Congo differ materially from any deposit so far discovered in the Union; but how do we know that similar deposits may not one day be discovered in the Union? This, then, brings us to the first new problem which the Minister had to tackle. How are these completely different varieties of alluvial deposit to be satisfactorily opened up, always remembering that nothing must be done to dispossess the bona fide digger. It is quite evident that the old division of diamond deposits into mines and alluvial does not hold good any longer and further subdivisions are necessary. The old system does not allow of any differentiation in the treatment of alluvial, and practically compelled the Government to proclaim any farm on which diamonds had been found within three months. This section of the law serves a twofold purpose. The Minister can get the discovery properly examined and see which category the discovery comes under. It also enables the Minister to protect the diamond market. That is if protection is wanted&#x2014;if the production is such as to demand protection. I look upon this very right as being something most valuable. This right that they are not compelled to proclaim in a certain time and that the proclamation is left entirely to the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>In the Transvaal the law is that proclamation must take place within three months. But now the Government has it within its power so to regulate everything as to prevent over-production. The provision is one of the most valuable in the Bill for the protection of the diamond trade as a whole, and if this power is wisely used, it will go a long way towards solving the problem of over-production. But the Minister will admit that this is a distinct interference with the right of the owner.</p>

<speech by="#ernest_oppenheimer">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>The provision in the Bill leaving the date of proclamation of a farm to the Government, as I have said, implies some interference with the rights of the owner, namely, his revenue from claim licences, from the sale of water, from trading rights, is delayed, and, of course, he cannot exploit his owner&#x2019;s claims until after proclamation. I submit that the Government should have been generous, and should have given the owner some compensation for delaying his revenue for what may be a lengthy period. In the interests of a national industry the Government is justified in asking this concession from the owners, but then the Minister ought to remember this when fixing the rights of owners on proclamation, and compensate them by giving them more liberal treatment than heretofore. Having now put himself into the position of being enabled to differentiate between alluvial areas, the Minister creates four kinds of alluvial areas. There is the ordinary alluvial deposit as we have known it up to now, and to which class 99 per cent. of all alluvial discoveries belong. Then there is the special alluvial area created under Section 74. These are the areas which the Minister&#x2014;if he is satisfied that such land cannot be worked to advantage by alluvial diggers in the ordinary way&#x2014;can lease to the discoverer or any other person, or sell. The third class of alluvial area is the State alluvial digging created under Section 75, and, lastly, Section 76 provides for a restricted alluvial area, where no individual digger shall employ more than ten persons at any time. I shall now examine the various kinds of alluvial areas created under the Bill with a little more detail. The Bill concerns itself chiefly with the ordinary alluvial area to which category, as I have said, 99 per cent. of alluvial deposits belong. The Minister pursues the aim of reserving these areas for the genuine digger, an arrangement which everyone in the House will endorse. He says, in fact, to the diggers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I reserve this ground for you, but I put an Obligation upon you, and that is, that you work any claims allotted to you personally under your own supervision and for your own benefit.</block>

<p>The old rush system is, fortunately, done away with, and a more equitable system of distribution or drawing of lots is introduced, and the allotment may be confined to bona fide diggers, namely, people who have been digging for six months prior to the date of disposal. The genuine digger is further protected by making it impossible for certain classes of people to become diggers, namely, civil servants, railway servants, or generally anyone in the employ of the Government. On the other hand, the diggers cannot in future go to the storekeepers or licensed diamond buyers and ask them to support him with the necessary capital to exploit his claim or arrange to work on shares. Section 63 lays it down that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">any person who works a claim in partnership with any other person not being the holder of a digger&#x2019;s certificate</block>

<p>shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of £100, and the licensed diamond buyer or storekeeper shall be equally guilty.</p>

<p>I have now dealt with the ordinary alluvial, that is the alluvial which the Minister reserves, and <span class="col_2717-2718" refersTo="page_0019"/>rightly so, to the individual digger. Then the Minister speaks of special alluvial where the Minister can decide whether the ground shall be given out as a lease or sold. The Minister has explained how well the lease system has worked in the Transvaal. I admit that it has been a very excellent system, and I think it will be a very excellent system in diamonds. I am referring to Section 74, and I submit to the Minister that he might follow the Transvaal example just a little further. He described how the Government gave out this ground. Well they might also establish a Tender Board, so that all applications could go first to the Tender Board which could advise the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>I think it would be an excellent safeguard, especially if the Minister bears in mind such valuable deposits as those that are found in Namaqualand. It would be a good thing if the board could decide whether a particular area belongs to one category or another. It may be the same board, of course. There are four classes of alluvial&#x2014; ordinary alluvial, special alluvial, state alluvial, and restricted alluvial. I think the divisions made are very sound. I have mentioned it already to the Minister in private conversation that certain amendments will have to be made to Sections 75 and 76 to protect the rights of the owner. Take State alluvial, I suggest that State alluvial should only be available on unalienated Crown land. Now I want to examine the sections which deal with ordinary alluvial more directly. I see the Minister reserves the ordinary alluvial entirely for the digger. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This ground shall be reserved for you, and you only, but you must work it personally and for your own benefit, and you must not be supported by anyone else.</block>

<p>I think that is the position. The Minister says the digger must be in personal occupation. He must personally go for his digger&#x2019;s licence and he must get the benefit, because he cannot work in partnership. Therefore, the digger cannot go anymore to the storekeeper and say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall exploit the claim for you on partnership terms.</block>

<p>I hope that the digger will realize that in future there will be an obligation on him to find the cash himself. It is not likely that the bank will give him the money at ordinary overdraft rates. Some other system will have to be found. He can go to the storekeeper and pledge his diamonds, because he cannot pledge his claim, but I doubt if the storekeeper will give him the money if he does not share in the result. The digger must know that in future he has to look after his own resources or his own credit in order to exploit his claim. If he has no money it will be more difficult. At any rate, I don&#x2019;t cavil at the position, but that is one of the results. I do not cavil at the restrictions. I am pleased to see that the rush system has been done away with which, I think, the Minister should be congratulated on, as the old system seems to me to have become a somewhat barbarous one. The Minister introduces the system of drawing for lots, which, I think, is satisfactory. The Minister goes much further in his endeavours to protect the diggers. He removes &#x201C;the corporate body or association of persons&#x201D; root and branch from the ordinary alluvial diggings, and does not hesitate to make the provisions retrospective. He does this because of the Lichtenburg experience, where a number of syndicates, or even limited companies, were formed with the object of acquiring and working ground. These syndicates, whether corporate or only associations of persons, commanding larger funds, made it more difficult for the ordinary digger to acquire ground, and no doubt the Minister has received very numerous complaints. On enquiry it will probably be found that these syndicates either dealt in claims, or if they exploited the ground, employed licensed diggers to do the work on shares. There is, however, a great deal to be said in favour of making provisions against a repetition of the Lichtenburg occurrence, but surely nothing can be said in favour of any retrospective provision wherever it appears in the Bill. It is a most harmful precedent to establish, and bad in principle; it will destroy confidence in our ideas of fair dealing, and will deter people from investing money in this country if they run the risk of having vested rights taken away at some later date. These syndicates, or corporate bodies, after all, did nothing except what the law allowed. The people who participated in these companies are the general public of South Africa, and they will very naturally resent any action by Parliament which takes away rights legally acquired. If the Minister does not see his way to delete Section 73, then he should anyhow amend it most drastically. The present wording of Section 73 makes it even impossible for a limited company to hold owners&#x2019; or discoverers&#x2019; claims on their own farms.</p>

<p>If the Minister tells me so I accept it, but I hope he will look into the matter, and make quite certain of the rights of a corporate body and association of persons. It will also affect the <span class="col_2719-2720" refersTo="page_0020"/>case of two brothers who are the owners of a farm. I think it is only reasonable to amend this section so that, firstly, it does not apply to any owner of land, nor to any corporate body or association of persons which has acquired the owners&#x2019; or the discoverers&#x2019; rights. Secondly, nor should this section apply to any claim acquired or certificate granted before the commencement of the Act. Well, I hope the matter will be cleared up without any doubt. People have their legal rights as owners of claims, and why should such rights be denied a corporation because of the supposed iniquities of certain companies. My experience of companies hardly justifies the adoption of such stringent steps. Take platinum, which is a very speculative business. First they have to prove the deposit, and then to secure extraction, and it is a very good thing for South Africa that when platinum was discovered there were in existence limited companies which were prepared to undertake the risk of mining under such uncertain conditions. How would it be possible to raise £2,000,000 to mine gold 4,000 feet underground, or the necessary capital to work platinum which had yet to be proved, if the stock exchange did not exist? For the development of a country which depends on mining the stock exchange is very essential. So long as mining is a speculative undertaking we must rely on the man who is an optimist; &#x201C;gambler&#x201D; and &#x201C;speculator&#x201D; are too strong terms to apply to this class of man. Now the people who have acquired claims are ordinary members of the public. The Minister would be surprised if he knew the number of people who are shareholders in claims. They acquired the claims genuinely and honestly, and I am sure the public will resent the retrospective clauses of the Bill. Either Clause 73 should be eliminated, or it should be made clear that owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; rights can be held by corporate bodies, and that claims honestly acquired by companies will be protected. If these claims were taken away it would not benefit the Government, but a few people only, and the benefit to the diggers would not be nearly so great as the injury that would be done to the public by passing retrospective legislation of this nature.</p>

<p>We shall be doing a great injustice if we eliminate companies if it is not made clear that they shall retain owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; rights over farms which they own, or have claims on, if they were honestly bought from people whose rights were undoubted. If an amendment of this nature is introduced it will get away from the retrospective nature of the section. The Minister and the Nationalist party should really consider the effect it must have on the general mind of the investing public if we take away rights genuinely and honestly acquired. The harm this will do to South Africa will be enormous, and people will not want to invest money here. However much we may regret that limited companies have obtained a footing on certain farms, that does not justify making any section of the Bill retrospective. I will now pass on to consider how the rights of owners are affected by this measure. I have already mentioned that the owner is entitled to some compensation for the delay which must, in future, occur in the proclamation of his farm. Then, although this is a consolidating measure, the Minister does not see his way to give the owners on alluvial areas equal rights in the four provinces. Take private land, for instance. In the Transvaal the owner receives 200 claims, in the Cape 45, in the Free State 400, in Natal 200. Why this difference? If the rights of the owners were increased to the Free State figures it would not be over generous.</p>

<p>I submit that the owner is entitled to better rights on alluvial anyhow, especially as he must peg his claims under the Bill in one block&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the length whereof shall not exceed twice the breadth.</block>

<p>Under the existing law the owner could peg as he liked. This stipulation reduces the value of his rights considerably. What do his present rights amount to anyhow? One morgen equals 44.07 claims of 45 x 45 feet; and even in the Free State the owner receives only 9 morgen, surely a paltry award compared with the 50 per cent. the owner receives in case of the discovery of a mine. It would be a great deal in a town; for instance, in Cape Town, but it is very little on the veld. A mine is by far a more valuable deposit than alluvial. Why does the Minister find no difficulty in equalizing the award throughout the Union in that case, but finds it difficult in the case of alluvial? The rights accruing to the owner should be identical throughout the Union, and in view of the concessions the owner is called upon to make not less than the rights accruing in the Free State. I submit, further, that the principle of giving a fixed number of claims to the owner is not a good one, and I urge that the principle of giving him a percentage of the ground proclaimed from time to time be adopted, or that he should receive a certain number of claims per morgen of land proclaimed an alluvial digging from time to time. The percentage or number of claims per morgen should be such that it equals the rights now accruing to owners in the Free State. If this system were adopted the Minister could delete sub-section 20, which deals with the sub-division of private land, and contains a retrospective provision. I have shown that the Minister is not over generous to owners in his Bill, but the preliminary chapter of the Bill goes even further, and takes away vested rights without compensation. The preliminary sections of the Bill will, I am sure, meet with the strongest opposition from all fair-minded people. By a stroke of the pen the Minister takes away the form of title known in Griqualand West <span class="col_2721-2722" refersTo="page_0021"/>as &#x201C;Free State title,&#x201D; under which title the minerals belong to the owner. The right or wrong of such a procedure is really not affected by the question whether there are few or many such titles in existence, nor does the history as to why such a title survived in Griqualand West, and not in the Free State, make confiscation at this moment just. I visited Kimberley during the recess and enquired into this matter, and as it has been suggested that the large majority of these farms are owned by De Beers, I looked into this matter and found: Farms in Griqualand West granted with Free State or qualified reservation titles (Free State titles)&#x2014;75 farms of which the approximate area was 502,793 morgen; 23 farms are now held by D.B.C.M., Ltd., of which area is 96,811 morgen; 52 farms belonging to other land owners, of which area is 205,982 morgen. Qualified reservation titles: 95 farms of which the approximate area was 349,583 morgen; 10 farms are now held by D.B.C.M., Ltd., of which area is 36,629 morgen: 85 farms belonging to other land owners of which area is 312,954 morgen. There are altogether 33 farms, representing 133,000 morgen, owned by D.B.C.M., and 137 farms, representing 518,000 morgen, owned by other land owners. The qualified reservation titles are to all intents and purposes Free State titles. After Griqualand West had been established as a separate Government, the authorities approached the farmers with the view of putting the question of title on a recognized basis. The farmers claimed the mineral rights, and, in order to expedite matters, the authorities suggested the qualified title, which provided that the granting of title did not prejudice the rights of Government, &#x201C;if any.&#x201D; Some farmers accepted this title, others refused, and finally the authorities recognized the position and gave the Free State title without the qualification. Why should the Government take this drastic step now of taking people&#x2019;s rights away? It is absolutely wrong. I confidently rely on the fair-mindedness of the Minister not to press this provision. The Minister said he would not make it applicable to the Vaal River Estate. I suppose that that is because the founder of that company, the late Mr. Mendelsohn, presented that collection, of which we are all so proud, to the House of Parliament, and members would be ashamed to go there if they had robbed that company of their legal rights. Surely it is wrong to say to one set of owners who have made use of their rights to the minerals&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">because you have used them you shall keep them,</block>

<p>and to say to others&#x2014;</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>Experience has shown that there are two cardinal principles which are essential for the prosperity of the diamond industry. I name them in the order of their importance&#x2014;limitation of output to the world&#x2019;s demand, and, secondly, sale through one channel. These basic principles in the first place led to the amalgamation of the various Kimberley mines into the De Beers Consolidated Mines, Limited; in the second place, caused the German Government to establish the Diamond Regie in South-West Africa; thirdly, were the governing factors in the preliminary discussions which led to the acquisition of and the amalgamation of the South-West Diamond Properties into one South African company. In the fourth place, it actuated the Smuts Government in calling the chief producers together to arrive at an inter-producers&#x2019; agreement, limiting the amount in value to be put upon the market by each of the producers. And lastly, formed the policy which underlies the Diamond Control Bill, introduced by the Hertzog Government, giving it the right to allot quotas in case the producers do not agree amongst themselves. It must not be thought that these lessons were learned easily, or that these principles have never been challenged during the last 20 years. On the contrary, whenever a big new discovery was made, the controllers thought they knew better than the older people who had established a sound industry, and, in then youthful excitement, put their ideas of unlimited production and independent selling into practice.</p>

<p>The Premier Mine established their own selling agency in London. I remember the time when they produced as much as 200,000 carats per month, in an effort to show the De Beers Company what quantity of diamonds could really be sold and what an independent selling agency could do. What was the result? One of the greatest depressions in the diamond trade, which led to the temporary closing down of the producing mines at Jagersfontein and Kimberley; to untold misery and a financial collapse in the old Cape Province. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) will be able to describe to you the financial position of the Government in those days.</p>

<speech by="#ernest_oppenheimer">

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>The position is not quite as the hon. member for Cape Town (Central) thinks. What really happened is that the Premier Company started a fight with the De Beers Company to show what they could do, or what could be done with their mine. They thought that they would be able to show how the diamond trade really should be handled. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) says it was brought about by the <span class="col_2723-2724" refersTo="page_0022"/>American crisis. That crisis took place in October, 1907, and at that time tile syndicate, to cope with the position, actually bought the Premier diamonds. The real collapse of prices was brought about through the two selling agencies, one selling against the other. After six months of effort to cope with the position, this syndicate had to give up. The price went down to 12s. 6d. or 13s. The hon. member for Cape Town (Central) mixes up the depression in the trade with the collapse in the trade so far as the value of diamonds is concerned. Then again we have the discovery of diamonds in what was then German South-West Africa. By the end of 1913 the production in South-West had reached the total of 100,000 carats a month, and it became evident that the diamond market could not consume this quantity of diamonds. The then Diamond Syndicate attempted again to deal with the position by buying the diamonds from the Regie, but by the middle of the year 1914 the position had become so acute that a conference was arranged, with its venue in London, between the big Union producers and the German producers, at which both the Union and the German Governments were represented. The object of the conference was threefold. Firstly, limitation of production; secondly, fair division of the trade (based on capacity to produce) between the various big producers, the South-West alluvial producers being classed as one producer for that purpose; and thirdly, for the sale of all diamonds through one channel. An agreement was actually arrived at, but the declaration of war put an end to the negotiations. At this particular conference the question of the alluvial production of the Union was not especially raised. Everyone present was familiar with the position, i.e., that there was a production of between £1,000,000 and £1,500,000 of diamonds in the Union, by individual diggers. The reasons for not even attempting to interfere with the alluvial production were, in the first place, because the production was small, and in the second place because everyone knew that certain people had made digging for diamonds their profession, and the limitation of output beyond the figures at which the production then stood would have meant a great hardship to people who had no other profession; and in the third place no one ever anticipated that the production would assume unwieldy proportions. On the outbreak of war, the diamond trade came to a standstill, but, like every other trade, recovered after about a year&#x2019;s time, and as diamonds in South-West could not be produced, the danger of over-production was removed for the period of the war, and the diamond market became very prosperous indeed. In the latter part of the war, after the Union occupation, South-West produced a moderate quantity of diamonds, but everyone realized that as soon as the war would be over the risk of overproduction would be revived. Therefore, after the war, that is, in 1919, by which time the South-West fields had been acquired by a South African company and amalgamated into one concern, a conference was held at the invitation of the then Minister of Mines, which conference aimed at completing the work which had been begun at the London conference prior to the war, namely, to bring about the limitation of output and sales through one channel for the then known big producers, which were De Beers, Premier, Jagersfontein and South-West&#x2014;namely, the newly-formed Consolidated Company. The present Government gave legislative expression to the work of these conferences. Unfortunately, alluvial diamonds were excluded from the operation of the Diamond Control Bill, for the same reasons which prompted the various conferences to ignore Union alluvial. The attitude of these conferences proves that at no time have the mines or the big producers been antagonistic to the diggers, and the policy which has been followed in the past will at all times be followed in the future; so that the interests of the alluvial and the mines are really identical, and not antagonistic. Time will not permit me to deal with the entire Bill in detail, and I will now pass on to Section 115. Section 115 is the Diamond Trade Protection Clause, and therefore the most important clause in the whole Act. Now that the Minister of Mines has introduced this Bill, and in his remarks has made it clear that he realizes the danger which unrestricted production means to this industry, and further, has taken such wide powers to enable him to prevent a recurrence of our present position, I feel that I can speak more freely about the situation of the diamond trade than would otherwise be wise. I have abstained from saying anything either to the press or in this House on diamonds. I was frightened that any remarks coming from me would further unsettle a sorely tried industry. I am, moreover, strengthened in my belief that I am justified in speaking to-day openly about the precarious position of the diamond industry by the remarks which the hon. Minister of Finance made when delivering his budget speech. The statement made by the Minister had a reassuring effect on the diamond trade. It was welcomed by everyone engaged in the trade, and particularly by the consumers of diamonds. An announcement by itself can, of course, not restore the security of the diamond trade. Three things more are necessary. The promised Bill has to be introduced&#x2014;this has now been done&#x2014;and secondly, it must be promptly passed into law; and thirdly, which is the most important part of all, prompt action must be taken under the Bill. Now what is the position of the diamond trade? The year 1926 started with complete control of the diamond production the world over, with a promise of good times for a lengthy period and a steadily expanding demand for diamonds. Only the alluvial in the Union is uncontrolled. Then comes the Lichtenburg discovery. The production of alluvial increases from 19,708¾ at 172s. 6d., £170,020, in January, 1926, to 121.497½ at 60s. 4d., £366,860, in December, 1926, and 177,441 at 56s. 4d., £499,855, in January, 1927, and 185,840½ at 62s., £575,845, <span class="col_2725-2726" refersTo="page_0023"/>in February, 1927. This does not include Port Nolloth diamonds.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>That is an argument which has been put to me several times already. It is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is it not much better that diamonds should be produced on the alluvial diggings, where they are produced, at a small profit and the money is spent in the country&#x2014;is it not much better than that they should be produced by De Beers and the money go out of the country?</block>

<p>If that is really the argument, if that is really what we are aiming at, then no one would invest money in this country again. Let me put it this way, is a man who invests money in this country, is a man who has De Beers shares, not entitled to have interest on his money? Those shares were not stolen. Good money was paid for them. Are we right in saying that that was a bad thing? No, there is no argument in that at all. It is very much better to produce diamonds in the cheapest and most efficient manner, so that the people who invest money in them may make profits which they use again in the development of the country. The syndicate thought that Lichtenburg would not last too long, and bought freely, with the result that by the 31st December, 1926, after a most prosperous diamond year, the syndicate had accumulated £1,000,000 of river diamonds over and above the normal stock of mine goods which must always be held. Instead of any diminution in alluvial production, there was a further expansion this year, as the January and February production which I have just quoted show. These quantities of diamonds could not possibly be absorbed, and had the diamond syndicate not deliberately withheld diamonds from the market in the hope that the Government would take some action, a total collapse would by now have taken place. As it is, this enormous uncontrolled production, which has been well advertised, has shaken the confidence of the public in diamonds, and the sales of diamonds have fallen off considerably, and are to-day negligible.</p>

<from>&#x2020;Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">ERNEST OPPENHEIMER</person>:</from>

<p>I don&#x2019;t know. Perhaps the hon. member is buying them. The fact is that the price of diamonds is falling to an alarming basis. Even with the bolshevik diamonds on the market, they did not have this bad effect which this river production has had, because people knew that the bolshevik diamonds were not a mine and an alluvial field, and that they had to come to an end. But hon. members will say that I exaggerate, because they will argue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The river production is being bought, anyhow.</block>

<p>What is really happening is that the digger sells his diamonds. More than half of the production is bought up by the syndicate, still in an effort to control this flood of diamonds, and not consumed, and the balance is bought by Continental firms and shipped to Antwerp and Amsterdam. But at what prices? In June, when Lichtenburg started to produce on a big scale, the diggers realized an average of 63s. 9d. per carat for their diamonds. By December the same Lichtenburg diggers realized 50s. 9d. for their diamonds; or in other words, the June prices were 26 per cent. higher than the December prices. I have here a table giving the details of the Lichtenburg production for the whole of 1926, and I think I should read it to hon. members, because no remarks of mine as to what is taking place can be as eloquent as these figures&#x2014;</p>

<p>During 1926 the whole of the alluvial production has been £4,000,000 and the quota from the mines, including South-West, has been £8,200,000. All the diamonds of the big producers, and the bulk of the river production have been acquired by the diamond syndicate, and the fact that the syndicate had to retain diamonds to the value of £1,000,000 over and above ordinary stocks in a good year showed that the market could not absorb the diamonds produced. In 1927 the alluvial production will probably reach £7,000,000 instead of the £4,000,000, and even if the market had been just as good, this would mean that instead of the £1,000,000 of over-production, there: would be £4,000,000, which in itself would be an impossible position. But instead of the market being just as good, it has become very difficult to sell diamonds. Sales, as a matter, of fact, have fallen to very small figures, and this will illustrate the very precarious position which the diamond trade is in. The hon. the Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech that over-production of diamonds must inevitably be reflected in a weak market, lower prices for the producers and reduced revenue to the State. This, of course, is the first effect of over-production. He might have enlarged on the second effect, if over-production continues for any period, and that is a &#x201C;complete stoppage of sales of diamonds.&#x201D; The diamond trade passes the rough depressions from time to time, coincident with trade depressions the world over. But these are natural depressions and with the revival of trade the diamond trade recovers its buoyancy. But in this <span class="col_2727-2728" refersTo="page_0024"/>instance, through over-production, a depression in the trade has been brought about during a period of world prosperity, and if that is allowed to continue it will destroy the world&#x2019;s confidence in diamonds generally and the result will be great misery and great suffering for a very large number of people dependent on the industry. I would like to explain that this Bill is not wanted in order to protect the mines against the Lichtenburg fields or the Namaqualand field. This Bill is required to protect a great national industry against the irrational exploitation of any diamond deposit, be it mine or alluvial. If it were simply a question of protecting the industry against the present Lichtenburg field this Bill would not be required. It would be too late anyhow, as the best farms in the district are already proclaimed. The results of the 1927 over-production will have to be lived through or dealt with outside the Bill. A full and frank discussion between the producers of diamonds and the Government to deal with the immediate position is essential but this can only serve a useful purpose if the Bill is passed and action is taken under the Bill so that there cannot be a recurrence of the recent experiences. A new discovery of diamonds, whether mine or alluvial diamonds, is in itself no danger to the trade. On the contrary, a discovery from time to time will secure the continuity of the diamond trade. The real risk in a new discovery is irrational exploitation of such a discovery, and the Government must take steps under the new measure to prevent this taking place at all costs. It is satisfactory to note that the Minister has realized that the diamond producers must be looked upon as one, that their interests are identical, and it is also satisfactory to note that he looks upon the industry from a national point of view. In order to re-establish the diamond trade and to ensure the revenue of the country it is essential to see that the export of diamonds from all sources, whether they be mine or alluvial diamonds, does not in the aggregate exceed the world&#x2019;s demand. This is the important point and no greater service could be rendered to the industry and thereby to the State and nothing would more quickly restore confidence in diamonds than if the Minister made the sub-section dealing with the aggregate quantity to be put on the market under certain circumstances obligatory instead of permissive. I suggest the following procedure. The Diamond Control Act No. 39 of 1925 is a permissive measure. When the Minister, acting under this law, has found it necessary to limit, or to call a conference of producers voluntarily to limit, the quantity of diamonds to be placed upon the market by the conference producers in order to protect the diamond trade, then immediately thereafter the Minister shall call a conference under his chairmanship, or any person appointed by him, at which the following shall be equally represented. Firstly, the alluvial producers and, secondly, the conference producers. The object of this conference is to arrive at a quota or percentage which the alluvial production in the Union is to bear to the mine production in the Union.</p>

<p>Yes, preferably both. As no interference with the individual digger is intended this quota or percentage is only to serve as a guide to the Minister as to when additional alluvial ground is to be made available for exploitation out of the areas which (after the owner and discoverer have had their rights) have become Government property. In other words, the Minister shall not make any Government ground available so long as the alluvial output exceeds this quota or percentage. If the conference cannot agree, let the Minister fix the percentage. The trade is in such a precarious position that we need the assurance that we are going to limit the quantities we sell. Call a conference between the alluvial people and establish an alluvial committee. See whether they cannot voluntarily arrive at a percentage, and if they cannot agree let the Minister fix the percentage.</p>

<p>But the Minister used the permissive section of the Act and did call a conference of producers and did agree as to the quotas, of which the Minister approved as well as the diamond contracts which were entered into subsequently. All these provisions being of a permissive character do not give that security to the diamond trade that at this juncture is so essential. The time at my disposal does not permit of my placing more information on diamonds, than I have already given, before hon. members. But I would like to remind the House that the direct revenue from diamonds exceeded £2,000,000 for the year 1926-&#x2019;27 and that this revenue is endangered if prompt action is not taken. The Minister for Finance was right when he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State is accordingly directly and deeply concerned in the situation which has arisen and is bound to take steps to control the production of alluvial diamonds as well as that of the mine.</block>

<p>In conclusion I want to assure the hon. the Minister that the South African party will give him every assistance in passing this Bill into law. On the other hand I hope that the Minister will seriously consider any amendments brought forward, and I appeal to him to accept such amendments as far as possible. I do hope that we shall not be met with the position which arose on the Iron and Steel Bill, when we were told that the Government had a majority and were going to put the Bill through. If that attitude is adopted the diamond trade will not be safe, but if the Minister is reasonable he has it in his hands to create a new diamond industry, in which <span class="col_2729-2730" refersTo="page_0025"/>there is no uncontrolled output, and like that legendary bird, the phoenix, the diamond trade will arise out of its ashes rejuvenated and strengthened to play the useful part in the opening up of this country to which Nature destined it.</p>

<p>I welcome this Bill, whereas it is long overdue. The hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) has objected to many of its clauses, but notwithstanding that he wants the Bill to go through as soon as possible. The control of the sale of alluvial diamonds has become necessary, but so far as the consolidation of existing laws is concerned the Bill should be sent to a select committee. The hon. member for Kimberley has objected to half-a-dozen clauses. It is all very well for him to say that he hopes the Minister will do this and that, but suppose the Minister does not want to accept amendments, where are we then? The Bill will become law and once a Bill has become an Act of Parliament, it is very hard to repeal any of its provisions or to introduce an amended Act. The alluvial diggers would like to appear before a select committee and to give their views. We have a board of control of the alluvial diamond fields and I understand that they gave their views on the draft Bill of last year, but I do not think the board has submitted amendments to the Bill now before us. I was at Kimberley a few days ago and I went through the Bill with the board of control, and I can assure the Minister that there are ever so many clauses which they think should be amended. If the Minister will give the board of control an opportunity of interviewing him before the committee stage is reached and if he will accept the board&#x2019;s amendments, then a select committee will not be necessary. It is absolutely essential that all those interested should be heard.</p>

<p>It can&#x2019;t be. I was there on Friday when we went into the Bill, and we have any amount of amendments to make. I am speaking on behalf of the board of control and my constituency. I welcome the clause with regard to diamond rushes. It was in 1920 when I first became member for Barkly that I urged upon the then Minister of Mines to do away with the rushing system, and I am glad to see that that is to be done under this Bill. It is also satisfactory to note that greater powers are to be given to the board of control. As to the control of the diamond output a fair percentage for the alluvial diggings would be £300,000 per month. I commend the clause to prevent the cutting up of farms into many portions, but on the other hand I do not see how the Minister is going to make that retrospective. Take the farm called &#x201C;Vaalplaats&#x201D; which has been cut up into 15 lots and sold as such by the owner. I am glad to hear that the Minister is going to make some provision in regard to Sydney-on-the-Vaal and Pnieel estates. There are ever so many farmers who hold tree State titles, and I do not see how the Minister can interfere with vested rights. As to the proposal to limit a digger to engage only ten labourers, that number will not be sufficient in some cases, and the Government&#x2019;s representative should have discretion to authorize a digger to employ more than ten labourers if necessary. Clause 63 is of great importance to the alluvial diggers as it prevents them working in partnership with anyone. If that is insisted on I am sorry for the diggers for thousands of them are assisted by other people. There are very few men who would advance a digger £200 and receive only 15 per cent. interest on the money, for people who make advances of this nature require half the finds for the great risk they run in making the advances. The result of Clause 63 will be that hundreds and hundreds of poor diggers will be cleared off the diggings; they are bona fide diggers and have grown up in this occupation. There are other reasons for sending the Bill to select committee. I have gone into the Bill with some of my friends and we suggest that all proclaimed ground should be de-proclaimed and then re-proclaimed, Government to receive 2½ per cent. of the finds, and the owner 2½ per cent. (owners&#x2019; claims to be abolished). Under this system the owner would be handsomely compensated and the Government would receive more than it is obtaining at present. Then claim licences need not be issued, as diggers certificates only would be necessary. A digger should not be allowed more than six claims, these to be pegged in one block. Then a digger should not be permitted to have more than one block of six claims. The Government should issue monthly a list of diggers which should be circulated to the different diggers boards and this should prevent a man having more than one block of six claims. Each farm not thickly populated should have a board consisting of the owner, two diggers and the two Government nominees. They will control the whole thing in a better way than it is controlled under the present laws, the committee to have power to cancel certificates for infringement of the law and to regulate water, stores, roads, etc. It will regulate the output too in cases where it is found a farm produces too much over its quota. There is one farm I know controlled by a company where the boys are so under control that they cannot roam about the diggings without being accounted for. At one particular diggings the natives have more motor-cars than the Europeans. The owners&#x2019; 200 claims is not the digger&#x2019;s biggest complaint. His greatest complaint is i.d.b. and the great number of crooks. To give control to such a <span class="col_2731-2732" refersTo="page_0026"/>board as I propose would get rid of all crooks and i.d.b.</p>

<p>That is very unfair of the Minister. Does he deny me the right to criticise this Bill, or is this part of the arrogance he metes out to his critics? I have a right to discuss this Bill, and I have a right to discuss it in spite of the deplorable exhibition of bad taste on the part of the Minister. The hon. member for Barkly has pointed out that there are certain private rights affected, and it may not, after all, depend upon the will of this all powerful Minister whether these men will have the right to put these matters before a select committee. The hon. member for Barkly has put it quite clearly in saying that if there is this confiscation of the rights of private owners they may demand to be heard by a select committee. The importance of the remark is enhanced by the fact that the hon. member has just come back from his constituency where he had an opportunity of ascertaining the views of the owners, and when he spoke of this Bill driving hundreds of diggers from the fields of the Union he exposed the hollowness of the Minister&#x2019;s claim that the Bill was intended to safeguard the rights of the diggers. The hon. member has correctly said that if you are to deprive the small digger of the right of working in partnership and of being supported by others who provide the capital which he has not got himself, then the effect of the Bill is not to maintain him on the diggings, but to drive him away from the diggings, which the Minister professes to be anxious to avoid. The member for Kimberley (Sir E. Oppenheimer) probably expresses the feeling of this side of the House in saying that we recognize the question as being of such importance that it ought to be dealt with in a non-party spirit, and whether we are accused of being mouthpieces or not, I propose to approach it in that manner. I hope to convince the House that we are face to face with a crisis that demands very serious attention from all sides of the House. The Minister seemed to suggest that our present attitude was inconsistent with our attitude in 1925. The Minister has forgotten the basis on which the opposition of this side of the House figured in. 1925. We were then opposed to arbitrary Governmental interference with a particular trade, and that is still the attitude we adopt. We pointed out then if he once took the step of interfering with production he would be bound to go to the logical extent of limiting the alluvial output. I see, on referring to &#x201C;Hansard,&#x201D; that it was pointed out clearly in the reports that there was a prospect of a large discovery of alluvial diamonds which might seriously disturb the diamond markets. At that time the recent discoveries in Angola and other parts of South Africa were also mentioned, and that if it was necessary to interfere with the trade the Minister should go to the length of fixing a limit for alluvial production. If he had left the trade to manage these affairs we should not have been face to face to-day with this particular difficulty. The Minister should learn from experience that co-operation with the trade in an endeavour to deal with these problems is an essential factor. When he passed the Control Bill in 1925 it was only as a result of a conference with the producers that a practicable agreement was eventually arrived at. I listened this afternoon to the remarks of the Minister in dealing with what he calls the principles of the Bill, and one of the facts which struck me strongly was when I heard him speak of the position of companies, syndicates and partnerships, and heard him link them up with something occurring on the Rand twenty or more years ago. I began to think it was a crime to be a shareholder in a company or a syndicate. This sudden aversion for shareholders hardly squares with the Minister&#x2019;s love for them in 1925, when he said on the second reading of the Diamond Control Bill that it was introduced because of the machinations of the directors of De Beers, who were robbing the shareholders. Now to be a shareholder in a company is evidently a crime! We have one inestimable advantage in dealing with the Bill In 1926 the Minister did introduce a Bill to deal with the consolidation of the laws with reference to precious stones in the Union, and it is extraordinary to notice the development that has followed. In the 1927 Bill we find a curious contradiction of certain principles he then laid down. What is the cause of that change of front? Broadly speaking, the Minister has made an almost violent attack on the rights of owners, and has developed an extraordinary aversion to syndicates and company shareholders. I think it is possibly due to some connection with the speech of the Minister of Justice, who explained at Lichtenburg, that the poor man would come into his own, and the syndicates would be driven from the field. Let me come to the point of the interference by the Minister with the rights of owners in the Cape Province. He said just now that I did not know what I was talking about. Well, he did not address that remark to his own colleague on that side who made precisely the same observation. The effect of Clause 2, which takes away from owners of land under freehold title one-half the right to precious stones, is nothing more than statutory robbery. <span class="col_2733-2734" refersTo="page_0027"/>I repeat that statement, and I hope to justify it. What are these titles which are affected? It is useful to notice that when the Minister was addressing the House this afternoon he said there were but 16 Free State title farms affected. More of these farms are owned by individuals than by companies. The Minister thought there were 16 farms which might be affected by this. In point of fact, there are 167, but in addition to that there are a large number of farms situated in the older portions of the Cape Province the titles to which are held on freehold. The Minister has made no reference to those at all, and it may well be that the discovery of precious stones on those farms is unlikely, though we know that even so close as Worcester pipes containing blue ground have been found. The Minister, this afternoon, stated that in the three provinces of the Union other than the Cape, the mineral rights were vested in the Crown. There never has been a law passed in the Cape Province which has contained a declaration that the right of mining and disposing of precious stones is vested in the Crown. No such right exists. The law in the Transvaal took a different direction to our law. It is true that in 1870 there was an interference with the right of the freehold owner of the Transvaal. We ask that the Minister should restore to this Bill the provisions that were contained in his 1926 Bill. There, when he was dealing with the position of private owners, freehold owners in the Cape Province, he made it perfectly clear that nothing in the Bill contained should interfere with the rights of that freehold owner. To-day the Bill proposes to take away that protection which has existed all these years. He lays it down first of all that the right of mining and disposing of precious stones is vested in the Crown, and then he takes away by an act of arbitrary confiscation the rights of those private owners and leaves them with 50 per cent. of the rights to precious stones found on their property. What is that but confiscation? When the Minister condemns anyone who describes his long-thought-out legislative production as nonsense, I think the Minister has really forgotten, perhaps, some of the provisions of his own Bill. The strongest argument against him is his Bill of 1926. I wondered, first of all, whether, perhaps this was a development of the unfortunate acquisitive tendency which we have found on the other side as shown by various Bills recently introduced, thus indicating that once you play with pitch you must not be surprised if your hands are contaminated. We are, however, only concerned with the present aspect of the matter. In 1926 it was sound and right and proper that these rights should be reserved and protected, as they have been for generations. But the Minister, this afternoon, gave his reasons for the proposed change. I would like to put them to the House for consideration, so that we may inquire whether those reasons were sound and proper. He said he saw no reason for the &#x201C;invidious&#x201D; distinction between the Cape and the other provinces, that in the Transvaal and the other two provinces the owner was compelled to give a portion of his rights and, therefore, in the Cape a similar position should obtain. That argument reminds me of the age-old argument on the part of the poor man wishful to obtain a portion of wealth of the rich man. The Minister complains that these private owners have been &#x201C;a law unto themselves.&#x201D; If a man is acting within the law, and he is exercising rights which were given to him by the law of this country, to say that the exercise of that right is objectionable because the mere exercise in effect makes him a law unto himself, is, it seems to me, a very feeble argument. But the Minister does not carry his principle to its logical conclusion. If it were right and proper to interfere with the title of freehold farms, why make an exemption in favour of those farms on which alluvial diggings are now being conducted? It would be very hard to find a distinction in principle, but there is a very practical fact to be borne in mind. You cannot have alluvial diggings with a very large number of voters in them without finding sometimes that the strict application of principles is distinctly disagreeable. There is no principle about this at all. There is no justification for taking away these rights merely to secure uniformity and the strongest argument that can be put before this House is that the Minister in 1926 followed what has always been laid down in the laws of the old Cape Colony, namely, that no interference should take place with the rights of the private owner. I think that the Act of 1899 was the last Act of the old Cape Parliament to deal with the rights of private owners in respect of precious stones, and it was said most definitely that nothing in that Act should be taken to apply to private property, the title to which did not contain a reservation to the Crown of rights in minerals. I would like to come to another point upon which I would like to ask the Minister for an explanation. It may seem a somewhat audacious thing on my part to do, but I would like to raise a question in regard to this 1927 version as to the rights of the owner of reserved land. When I speak of reserve land I mean land alienated by the Crown, but in which the reservation of the precious minerals by the Crown has been made. In the 1926 Bill the Minister laid it down clearly that the exclusive right to prospect belonged to the owner. In this Bill he has omitted in Section 5 that word &#x201C;exclusive.&#x201D; He did say this afternoon that he was prepared to recognize the principle that no person could come upon the land owned without the consent of that owner. That is something to the good, but I hope the Minister will be prepared to embody that in an express declaration in this Bill, because if there is one thing that we would fight for, and probably have fought for in the past, it is the light of the surface owner to object to any interference by prospectors or others with his property. The Minister has introduced a new section in which he has said that nothing in that particular part of the Act shall affect the right of the Crown to resume any land for mineral purposes. It occurs in that portion of the Act which deals with reserved land. I <span class="col_2735-2736" refersTo="page_0028"/>want to ask the Minister whether it is intended on his part to assert the right as against the owner of reserved land to resume it for mineral purposes. In other words, does he intend to claim the right in a case where the owner is not prepared to have prospecting on his farm, and where the Minister may think there are minerals, to resume that farm for mining purposes? If his Section 6 is intended in any way to record a right on the part of the Crown to reserve land for mining purposes, then I challenge the existence of that right. The only power of resumption I know of on the part of the Crown is to resume ground for public purposes, and to allow it to revert to the owner when those public purposes have been satisfied. That certainly is the law in the Cape Province. I hope the Minister will make that point particularly clear. The omission of the word &#x201C;exclusive&#x201D; and the introduction of this reference to a power to resume land for mining purposes seems to be capable of an interpretation which should be made quite clear. I would like to say something with reference to the effects of this Bill upon the rights of an owner in the Cape Province. To deprive an owner of reserved land of half of his existing rights, is something for which the Minister has shown no justification at all. At present, he is entitled to 50 per cent. and 50 claims plus 20 claims in block if the discoverer, and under this Bill he will be cut down to 25 per cent. and 23 claims in block. And here, by the way, I would ask the Minister whether it has not been the practice of his own Department to treat claims in the Cape Province as of the size of 30 by 60. I have been told that is so. If that has been the invariable practice of his Department, although the statute speaks of 30 by 30, this factor must be taken into consideration. I would say that interference with the rights of the Cape owner is not justified. The reduction of his rights in the case of a mine being discovered, or alluvial diggings proclaimed, is not justified. The Minister has given no reason beyond saying that he would like to establish some sort of uniformity. He did say he might be prepared, if the House raised any objection, to adhere to the existing scales, and in that case my criticism would fall to the ground. I would like to come to this Section 20, which introduces the prohibition he proposes to make in reference to the subdivision of land. The hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) has referred at length to this matter, and I have had the advantage of having listened to the Minister and considering the grounds on which he considers this extraordinary piece of legislation should disfigure our statute book. He stated there had been an evil at the Lichtenburg diggings; that there had been subdivision of farms in order to increase the owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; claims; that there had been a large number of companies formed; that they had been selling paper and not real rights, and that the persons who held shares in these companies were largely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">gamblers and speculators.</block>

<p>Then he drew a lurid picture of what happened 30 years before on the Rand. It must come as a surprise, to people in the Transvaal particularly, to know that to hold shares is to be described as speculators and gamblers. I think even a gambler and a speculator has rights, but the Minister proposes to rob him of the rights he has got. He proposes to say to him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You have something under the law which you had a right to get, but I have formed the opinion that you were guilty of a great wrong in acquiring it, and I will take away by force what you have acquired by law.</block>

<p>It hardly lies in the mouth of the Minister to speak of evil. We were told by the Minister they, the persons concerned, were warned last September. I wonder what legal value a warning of that kind has, and what right he has to say that anyone carrying on an unlawful business will be dealt with summarily in the next session of Parliament. I do not think we have quite got to that intellectual dictatorship which cannot brook any criticism of a Bill which he introduces to the House. I want to draw attention to one or two of the defects in this section. The Minister says he has come to the conclusion that he should be given the power to say that if he is satisfied at some particular date, quite unspecified, that certain people have divided farms with the object of increasing owner&#x2019;s and discoverer&#x2019;s rights, he can take those rights away. Let us suppose for a moment that such a person did do something wrong&#x2014;who is to be punished for it under this Bill? The man who did the supposed wrong, or the man who bona fide acquired rights by purchase? The Minister proposes that the present owner should be punished, because possibly ten years ago a previous owner subdivided it. Let us take another difficulty. Suppose we get over the injustice of punishing one man for another man&#x2019;s misdeeds, without any appeal, or right of hearing, or notice to the parties concerned. The Minister in his office, acting on ex parte information, possibly supplied by some former owner who may have a grudge against the present owner, decides that the owners affected must receive, say, 20 discoverers&#x2019; claims. How are these 20 to be divided amongst 60 owners, if they number so many? When it comes to the allocation of these claims, there is no indication whether A is to get five, B is to get three, C two. It is all left in a state of glorious uncertainty; the Minister&#x2019;s ipse dixit is, we are left to assume, to prevail. Nothing so absurd, ridiculous and impracticable have I ever seen in any statute in this country. The Minister emits the statement that an hon. member does not know what he is talking about, and if a test of knowledge is to understand the section, then I confess that the Minister is correct. The Minister, in taking to himself these enormous powers, must be protected against himself, because if he wishes to sit in the seat of justice, he is exposed to the criticism of every person who may be disappointed. <span class="col_2737-2738" refersTo="page_0029"/>Imagine the position of any person placed in the delicate position in which the Minister is to be placed under Section 20. He has failed to realize he should pass this function, if it must be exercised, over to someone else. I take the Minister a step further and I come to his famous Section 73, which I think may be described as the &#x201C;Roos-ian&#x201D; section of the Bill, after the speech of the Minister of Justice at Lichtenburg. This is the real plum for the digger who is to be protected by the Bill, and who was informed by the Minister that if the heavens fell, the digger would get justice! It has been pointed out by the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) that this legislative gem contains this little defect. He makes it illegal for any company or any syndicate to have any interest in a claim. A claim is defined under this Bill. What about the owner of a farm which happens to be a company, and happens to make a discovery of precious stones on that farm? It is to get no claims. It is illegal for it to own claims when it owns the farm. The Minister said it is not his intention, but it is clear that is what the Bill means. He certainly must reverse this remarkable provision which prevents a company which owns a property from having any owner&#x2019;s claims. The Minister went further, and said it had always been the rule in the Union of South Africa to regard the right to a claim in alluvial diggings as something confined to a natural person and therefore not capable of being held by a corporate body. If the Minister is right, there might be something to be said for his view, but he has not found himself the time to make himself acquainted with the laws of his own province. Unfortunately, if Parliament passed this law, it would be guilty of a grave inconsistency. The law of the Cape Province makes it obligatory (in the case of a company) on claim-holders in alluvial or pre-1907 mines to have their claims registered in the name of not more than two persons resident where the mine is. [Time limit extended.] The Minister is in danger of having Parliament called into contempt in this matter. The unfortunate company which is obeying the Cape law and keeping its claims registered in the names of two persons is now told by the Minister that whether those claims be held under &#x201C;this Act or any other law,&#x201D; no person shall directly or indirectly hold the claims for the benefit of any company. In view of the existing law, it is impossible to pass a clause of this nature. In sub-section (3), the Minister provides that if these claims were registered before July 1st, 1926, such registration may continue if the Minister has issued a written permission to that effect. Some of us may live by the grace of God, but I would not like to be a company existing by the grace of the Minister! No person should be put in the position of having to depend upon a Minister&#x2019;s goodwill. I hope this foolish section will be struck out. I cannot understand the repugnance the Minister exhibits to the operations of companies in so far as alluvial diamond mining is concerned. We desire to see these fields exploited in the best interests of the country, and whatever may have been the position when we had shallow alluvial deposits, the recently-discovered deposits have taken a different geological form, and when they go down to 30 feet, it is impossible for a small man to exploit them without capital. We have an example of this in Lichtenburg. I should have thought the Minister would have given rights initially to the digger, and not have restricted him from disposing of claims as he thinks fit. The disposal of special alluvial areas should be either by public tender or public auction, and the leasing of these areas should be entrusted to the Mining Leases Board. Under Sections 75 and 76 the Minister proposes to take powers which cannot be justified. Section 75 says the Governor-General may declare any land or any alluvial digging to be a State alluvial digging, and may deal therewith in any manner which may be prescribed by regulation. Under this, private land is not immune. There is a right to take freehold and reserve land, and to declare it to be an alluvial digging, but not one word is said about compensation or the rights of the discoverer. The Minister asks to be given carte blanche to say to the owner of any land that it is an alluvial digging, that it shall be dealt with by him as prescribed by regulation; yet the Minister can give no reason for asking for these powers, which create a most alarming precedent. Why the Minister should desire to have them, I cannot understand. The same criticism very largely applies to Clause 76, which deals with restricted alluvial diggings. Are present prospectors and the owners of discoverers&#x2019; rights not to receive adequate protection? As to the limitation of output, the Minister has laid down several methods, the first of which was borrowed from South-West Africa, but it will not be practicable to apply it to large numbers of diggers to whom it is impossible to assign an individual quota. The first portion of Section 115 will enable the Minister to apply the quota to the big producer who may hold a lease or has large diggings on private lands. That power will have to be exercised with very great care, and I do not see at the moment what safeguard is proposed in order to ensure that the power cannot be used unfairly. But in fixing the quota for all producers in the Union, the Minister should give all the diamond producers an opportunity of settling what the quota of alluvial producers should be that point of joint consultation is conceded in Section 17 of the Diamond Control Act, which empowers the Minister to call a conference of producers. A conference was called and the relative shares of the producers were fixed. An amendment should be introduced which would ensure that an attempt should be made by agreement to fix the share which alluvial diggers should have and which mine producers should have. I would like to return to a point made by the hon. member for Barkly (Mr. W. B. de Villiers). The Minister feels <span class="col_2739-2740" refersTo="page_0030"/>that this Bill is an urgent matter, and that if it is sent to a select committee there is a danger of its not being passed this session. I agree, for I do not see that it can become law this session if sent to a select committee; but if the Minister insists on this invasion of the rights of private owners in the Cape Province, I shall ask for a ruling from the Chair whether this Bill is a hybrid measure. Let me say this, without arguing the point further, and passing over some other matters for the time being, that where a Bill proposes to take away from a small number, small relatively, of owners of land in this country rights to which they are entitled under the law, then, according to the rules of this House, these people are entitled to be heard and are entitled to present a petition and to state their reasons why their land shall not be appropriated in this manner. I may be asked for a precedent for this, and I quote the case of the Orange River Bill last year. That proposed to define the northern boundary of the Orange River, and it was found to interfere with the rights of owners. The Government treated that Bill as a hybrid Bill, and, had the Bill been proceeded with, every private owner injuriously affected would have had an opportunity of coming before the House and of stating his case. If this Bill is proceeded with in its present form, we may have no option but to concede the point that, if a petition is presented, it should be referred to a select committee. The way to avoid that would be for amendments to be introduced which would so help us that we could hammer out in this House a measure that would not interfere with or act unjustly upon the rights of owners, and so produce a statute that would maintain the reputation of this House for dealing justly with all the interests concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOSHOFF</person>:</from>

<p>As the representative of a constituency which will probably in the future become a very large digging area, I feel compelled to say something about the Bill. The Bill encroaches upon the rights and privileges of the State, and especially on the owners&#x2019; rights, and I think it is our duty to be very careful to see that we satisfy the citizens of the country. We must admit that a change is necessary. In the past the diggings were a blessing to the country, but unfortunately they have latterly become changed in character, and are no longer what they should be. Speculators have taken the place of the poor diggers. We must use our common-sense in altering the law. The intention of the Bill is a good one but various changes are necessary in order to satisfy both the owners and the diggers. We know that latterly farms have been subdivided. Farm owners who used to have a right to 250 claims have had their farms cut up, and in that way so many owners&#x2019; and discoverers&#x2019; claims originated that hardly anything remained for the ordinary digger. This must be prevented, but we must at the same time remember that the matter has already developed so much that it will be very difficult. I cannot see how we can end it by this Bill without many individuals or syndicates having a bad time and losing much money. If we use our common-sense, however, it can, I think, be obviated, and the only way which in my opinion will give complete satisfaction is to apply the percentage basis in the future, and so the difficulties will vanish. In the first place that will prevent the cutting up of the farms. It will prevent speculation and the many chicaneries and frauds which take place on the diggings, because it will then not be necessary for the owner to subdivide the farm. On the other hand it does not seem fair that a man who has a small piece of ground should have the same privileges as the owner of a large piece. The new Bill gives to the man with merely 50 morgen of ground the same rights as to the man with 5.000 morgen. The man with 5,000 morgen must be satisfied with the same share as the one with 50 morgen, but if we adopt the percentage basis the large owner will have more revenue in proportion, and I believe all owners will be satisfied if they were to get a percentage of the yield of their farm. Take the farm Welverdind. It is I think cut up into about 30 portions. (No quorum.) I think that to-day there are about eight to ten portions that pay, and which can be worked, and it is certainly one of the richest farms in the Lichtenburg district. I can assure the House that there is practically nothing left to-day on that farm for the ordinary digger to work. I am almost certain that the company which holds the right over Welvediend will be quite satisfied if it gets 7½ or 10 per cent. of the yield of the farm, and they will then throw open the farm to the ordinary digger. The percentage basis will thus satisfy the owner, and also the digger, because the latter, who work the farm on a basis of 10 per cent. will also be satisfied. It is said that there may be an alteration in the size of the farms, and that it is not necessary to proclaim the whole farm at once, but my experience is that it does not occur that a man proclaims a portion of his farm to-day, and another portion in one or two years. If a farm is proclaimed then it is taken out of the owner&#x2019;s hands and is useless for any farming purposes. The digger, the public, have possession of the farm. Accordingly a portion of a farm cannot be proclaimed to-day and another portion in one or two years. We, also, want to prevent the farms being subdivided, but if we allow a portion to be proclaimed to-day and another portion to-morrow, we shall not attain that object. If the owner on proclamation can get a proportionate share he will be satisfied. I thought it was suggested that 250 extra claims should be given for a farm larger than 1,000 morgen. An owner of 3,000 morgen would then have the right to 750 claims. Then the owner would still retain for himself the best ground, and the digger would again run short when the farm was subdivided. Nothing would remain over for the digger. If we, however, apply the percentage basis that will not happen. In connection with the collection of the percentage, a difficulty is now made and the <span class="col_2741-2742" refersTo="page_0031"/>question is asked who will be responsible for it. It is, however, a very easy matter. Clause 7 provides that an owner who wishes his farm to be prospected is limited to five prospectors. That I consider far too few, because experience has taught me that you cannot have a farm prospected by a few people. We must limit the digging, but we must not limit the rights of the public too much. If the number is increased to ten it will be satisfactory. Clause 8 provides than an owner or digger shall not be entitled to work with more than ten labourers. My experience is that if a man wants to work at all he cannot do so with ten men. There are large diggers who employ 100 or 200 natives, but I think a digger will be able to work his machine if the number of natives is increased from ten to twenty. That is sufficient restriction and one will be able to do one&#x2019;s work with that number. Therefore I think it is desirable to make the alteration. As to the point that companies may not be formed I am in favour of companies ceasing to exist, because the companies that have been formed have oppressed the ordinary diggers so that they no longer have a chance. Now one comes to the poor man who also goes digging but is too poor to work his claim. The Bill provides that he may not go into partnership with other diggers. I think that this ought to be amended because there are poor people in my constituency who took part in rushes, pegged off claims and then e.g. eight of them combined to work the ground themselves. Now, however, they are to be prohibited from doing so. I think the Bill should be so amended that poor white persons who have certificates and are not able individually to work their claims will have the right of combining with other people, who hold a similar certificate, to work the ground themselves. That then will not constitute a company which is a mere financial undertaking using capital. The poor man who possibly cannot engage natives will be assisted by such an amendment. The Minister has said that he wants to give the diggings to the small man but in the way that I have suggested the diggings can be made a success for the small man. The provision with regard to the water problem is also an important point which should be amended, because there the owner is being deprived of too much. The water ought to belong to him.</p>

<speech by="#boshoff">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOSHOFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, certain rights are taken away, and I do not think that ought to be allowed. I consider Clause 30 (a) unfair. It provides with reference to the deproclamation of farms that when a farm is deproclaimed the Governor-General can prohibit further working on it. I understood the Minister to say that owners in such event would no longer be entitled to continue working, but I consider that a little unfair because the owners&#x2019; rights are being too much interfered with. The fact is that farms that are deproclaimed are never quite worked out. There remain pieces of ground which the owners can in the future work for their own benefit after the farms are deproclaimed. If we use our common-sense with regard to the Bill we can make a success of it in the future, and the diggings will be a blessing to the country, and an occupation by which thousands of poor people, can be aided in making a living so as not to become a burden on the State. Proper control is necessary and if a percentage basis is introduced and the diggings are worked under regulations the position will improve. Then there will be more order and less chicanery and the illicit diamond traffic on the diggings will also be lessened.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DRUMMOND CHAPLIN</person>:</from>

<p>The House, when they heard what was said by the Minister of Finance in his reply on the Budget debate, must have come without any hesitation to the conclusion that it was high time that steps were taken to deal with the very difficult position which has arisen in the diamond industry. Anyone who listened this afternoon to the very exhaustive speech of the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) must have come to the conclusion that anything that has been said as to the seriousness of the position has been in no way exaggerated. We must all be clear that it is high time that steps were taken to deal with the position, and to see that the whole diamond industry is not deliberately wrecked. The Minister of Mines seemed to think that the fact that this state of affairs has arisen, and that an attempt has been made to do something with regard to alluvial production, affords the most complete justification for his action in bringing in two years ago the Diamond Control Bill. I think that point has been very well met by the hon. member for Kimberley, and if that Bill had not been introduced it would not have been necessary to deal with the matter in the way we are doing to-day. What has taken place since affords the most complete justification for the contention from this side of the House that the Act should have been made applicable to the alluvial diggings. I regret that it is necessary to deal with the matter in the manner in which the Bill proposes to do. It is obviously necessary to do something. All the big diamond producers in the world have agreed that overproduction should be checked, relying, I suppose, on the good faith of South Africa to see that its own diamond production&#x2014;the most important of the lot&#x2014;should not be overdone. The law, as it stands, is powerless to prevent this over-production, and, therefore, we have to deal with this Bill. The measure will, I think, have the desired effect, and the fact that it will have that effect will naturally dispose some of us who would have been inclined to object very strongly to a good many of the provisions to moderate their criticisms to some extent, because of the desirability of getting the Bill through as soon as possible. But there are a great many dubious provisions in the measure, which, under ordinary circumstances I would most strenuously object to. The first of these is that far too much power and discretion are given to the Minister. In <span class="col_2743-2744" refersTo="page_0032"/>some cases the power is deliberately given to the Minister&#x2014;in other cases it is given to the Governor-General, and in practice that conies to very much the same thing. Here we have a continuance of the tendency we have seen in legislation all through this session to put excessive power in the hands of the Government of the day Governments, I suppose, like to get power into their own hands, oblivious sometimes that they will not always be governments, and that other people, who do not agree with them, will come into power. It is a tendency in most of our legislation to-day, we have it in the Steel and Iron Bill, and we have it in the most aggravated form in this Bill now before us, and I suppose it is clue partly to the desire of governments to get power into their hands, and partly, also, to the fact that in these days Minister do not think it necessary to think out all the details and the problems of their Bills. They think that sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. They say, we will put power in the hands of the Minister, in the Bill, and he can deal with the matter when it arises. Prospecting is largely in the hands of the Minister. He can decide under Section 33 what working capital is necessary to work a mine, but in nineteen cases out of twenty, owners of a mine and the people working with them are more capable of deciding that than the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines_and_industries">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES AND INDUSTRIES</person>:</from>

<p>I think that is the present law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#drummond_chaplin">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DRUMMOND CHAPLIN</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite clear under Section 33, where the Minister has to fix the scale on which the mine has to be worked, and the Minister may, in the case of a registered company, take such steps as he may deem necessary to prevent over-capitalisation of such company. In nine cases out of ten the Minister knows nothing about it. In section 35 it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the owner, surface owner, or discoverer has transferred his rights to a company, any distribution amongst the directors of such company by way of directors&#x2019; fees or otherwise shall be subject to the approval of the Minister,</block>

<p>and all kinds of ridiculous provisions of this kind Some of these can be met by alteration in committee, but I am not hopeful of getting amendments in that respect because this Government has shown plainly it is going to take power into its own hands, and also to take discretion on every particular method and manner, and that it will not give it up so long as the people behind them consent to what is demanded. The next thing highly undesirable in this Bill is the attack made on the position of owners, and I must say that nothing is more surprising to me than to see the readiness with which, as a whole, hon. members who support the present Government and who come from the country districts, sit down under these perpetual encroachments on the rights of landowners. The Minister referred to what took place many years ago in the Transvaal in connection with the gold laws, and quoted that as justification for the steps he proposes to take now. The Minister will admit that in the old days of the Transvaal republic, the mining law was not made to suit the interests of large financial houses, because those people in those days did not exist. The law was made as reasonable as possible to suit the landowners, because the Government was composed mostly of landowners, and they made laws as far as possible to suit their own interests, and the result was that in those days, on the proclamation of a farm, great rights accrued to landowners. Again as time went on people besides the individuals, besides what the Minister calls the naturals, began to own farms. They bought farms from the landowner. It was only when a large number of the farms which were known to be gold-bearing and, I suppose diamond-bearing, had been acquired by other people that the then Government began to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now these farms do not belong to our own people but belong to the speculating people. Then we will curb their rights.</block>

<p>So they did. The extraordinary thing is that from that time onwards the landowners, who are supposed to have had a very great share in the legislation of this country, have all the time submitted to the gradual whittling away of their privileges and their rights. I do not say it is right that the landowner should have the power to divide up his farm into many portions with the deliberate object of increasing his rights, but the fact is that this is the survival of an old right. Under this Bill the landowner is attacked in every sort of way. Under the pretence, or, shall I say, with the excuse of consolidation, some landowners in some provinces are to get far less rights than they had before. There is a great deal to be said for uniformity, but we all know that in this country there are things in which you cannot possibly have uniformity. I say it would be far better to leave the owners&#x2019; rights exactly as they are, because once you begin to tinker with those rights you will cause a feeling of unrest, people will become dissatisfied and the credit of the country will to some extent be impaired. My hon. friend the member for Gardens (Mr. Coulter) has dealt very fully with the position which will arise if the Bill is passed in its present form, and the Minister&#x2019;s determination to prevent joint stock companies from having a share in this industry is given effect to. I cannot see how the Minister can possibly justify his proposal to give retrospective effect to this legislation. The only excuse that the Minister has put forward is that a warning was issued some months ago. What warning? Who heeds warnings? I believe the police used to issue warnings hereto people not to leave their motor cars in certain places in Adderley Street, but nobody took any notice and presently it was found that there was no law under which that warning had been given. In regard to the present matter the fact remains, that, whether it was desirable or not, the practice was lawful and whatever was done was within the law as it <span class="col_2745-2746" refersTo="page_0033"/>stood and as it stands to-day. What is going to happen? The Minister may under this clause say that in his opinion some particular farm was divided into various portions some years before this Bill was passed and that the whole transaction becomes in effect null and void. It may be that portions of that farm had passed for valid and serious consideration to all kinds of people, individuals, companies and so on all over the country and even to people who live outside this country. Who is going to suffer? One block of ground has been sold to a company and that company has sold it to another company. That company has merged into another company and then individual shareholders have bought shares in these companies. They had no reason to suppose that their rights would be affected by any retrospective legislation of this kind. The person who did this thing, the original sinner as he may perhaps be called, is not going to be affected. He will have got his consideration, he will have his shares and he may have disposed of them and the people by whom these shares have been bought afterwards will be the sufferers, although they will have bought perfectly bona fide and without any suspicion that their title was not as good as it should be. It does seem to me, in the interests of the country, that it is impossible to go back like that. There might be some excuse for saying that it should be the date on which the Bill was published or introduced into the House, but this seems to me an entirely undesirable form of legislation. The Minister thinks he is going to benefit the small man. I am not sure that the small man is going to be pleased when this Bill is passed, but if the Minister is satisfied on that point I have little to say. Personally I should have thought there were a good many things that the small man would object to, because it seems to me it is going to make it difficult for the individual man to work the individual claim. But if the Minister and they are satisfied we have nothing to say. I should like to add a word in support of what fell from the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer) as to the procedure which the Minister should follow. It seems to that what we have to do is as far as possible to get the alluvial production treated as a unit, as it were, compared with what the large companies produce. You have De Beers and the Premier, and so forth, and you have producers in other countries, and what we have to do is to make the alluvial production fit in the picture and be treated as a separate unit. As the Minister is creating this machinery the Minister will have to take some responsibility. He will have to regard himself as the representative of the alluvial diggers. As he has taken so much responsibility and so much discretion I suppose he will not object to it. He will have, so to speak, to represent the interests of these people, and he will have to hold the balance, so far as he can, fairly between them and the other producers, and the only way to do that is to restore the position to what it was before the 1925 legislation and this Bill, that is, to restore the machinery for voluntary confidence and to see what can be done to limit the production of the whole country. Other countries have limited production and it is up to this country to see that the so-called limitation is not ineffective.</p>

<p>No, there is nothing to prevent a conference being held, but the Minister should see that they are encouraged, and he should lay down in the Bill, where he exercises the powers he has under the Act of 1925 that it is compulsory for him to exercise corresponding powers in the Bill we have now before us, so as to ensure full consultation and co-operation. It is unfortunate that a state of affairs should have arisen which has made it necessary to bring in this Bill, but as the Act of 1925 is in existence, and as it did not provide for the control of the alluvial production, it is necessary to do something.</p>

<p>You would have allowed private enterprise to find a way out of the difficulty; but as the Minister has introduced the system of Government control he must extend it to all forms of production. I think it is unfortunate that we should have to pass this Bill, but still we have to pass it, and pass it soon. I agree with the Minister that once we begin to discuss the Bill in select committee evidence will have to be taken, and it will be an impossibility to get the Bill through this year. The Minister will find, in view of the solemn warning he has had from the hon. member for Kimberley (Sir Ernest Oppenheimer), and the statement made by the Minister of Finance the other day, that he should not run that risk, but get his Bill through the House. It will enormously assist its passage and meet many of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s own friends, such as the hon. member who spoke last, and as I gathered, was concerned about the diminution of diggers&#x2019; rights, if the clauses, which limit the present rights of owners were modified, and also if the Minister&#x2019;s discretionary powers were limited to a considerable extent. I hope the Minister will accept these suggestions, and while I agree that there are a good many other points which would be likely to lead to criticism, I hope that the Bill will be passed through the House.</p>

<p>I do not propose to talk about the mines. I do not know anything about them, or the diamond trade, of which I know less, but as far as this Bill is concerned what I should first impress upon hon. members is the condition which we find to-day at the diggings, and to find what are the grievances and abuses this Bill proposes to remedy as far as the digger is concerned. I am referring to Grasfontein, and I will tell the House again, as I did before, what the actual position is <span class="col_2747-2748" refersTo="page_0034"/>there, and why the digger does insist on the passage of a clause like Clause 20&#x2014;to stop the subdivision of farms. There are so-called farms which do not measure more than 35 morgen. If it were not for the condition of the law, no mining commissioner would allow a certificate to be granted. When a farm is subdivided into a large number of portions, and discoverers&#x2019; rights are granted, the owners of the subdivisions start working or sell the claims to individuals or small syndicates. The next step is for the owner to continue his prospecting, and his owners&#x2019; claims need not be located in one block, but he can peg out all the best claims. These claims he sells to other syndicates, as the diggers are too poor to buy them. Syndicates engage diggers to work their claims, and there are hundreds of syndicates at Grasfontein alone. Hon. members can realize the disappointment under these circumstances of the 25,000 diggers who took part in the rush at Grasfontein, where they drew blanks. It is not fair to these poor people to allow such a state of affairs to continue, it being a gross injustice to them, as they are called upon to expend money and energy in pegging out the poorest claims. The diggers urge upon the Government to stop this system of cutting up farms.</p>
