                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D S MAIMANE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Halt Elder Abuse Line, HEAL, presented a report to the
       Minister of Social Development, the hon Zola Skweyiya, on the abuse
       of the elderly;


  (2) believes that the abuse of the elderly is a violation of human
       rights;


  (3) condemns elder abuse and commends the work done by HEAL; and


  (4) calls on all communities to defend and uphold the rights of the
       elderly.

Mr J T DELPORT: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the ruling in the Transvaal Provincial Division of the High
       Court that the declared control over South African magistrates'
       courts by the Minister of Justice and the Department of Justice is
       unconstitutional;
  (2) welcomes this ruling in so far as it supports and underlines the
       principle of the independence of the judiciary; and


  (3) subject to any possible further ruling by the Constitutional Court,
       calls upon the Minister to take urgent steps to bring the legal
       system in line with this judgment.

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) is concerned about reports that there are occasional mid-air
       malfunctions experienced by SAA aeroplanes, like the Boeing 737-200
       jet failure in mid-flight as witnessed on 24 May 2001 and on 4 May
       2001 when airtight door seals ``popped'', leading to a drop in air
       pressure and the aircraft having to return to Johannesburg airport;


  (2) is dismayed that on 20 April 2001, the hydraulic equipment of a
       Boeing 373 from Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth failed;


  (3) is further concerned that the lives of passengers who expect safe
       flights and landings are put at risk and that these passengers are
       not getting value for the fares they pay; and


  (4) calls upon the SAA authorities to attend to this unbecoming scenario
       and to honour their usual assurances that passengers will have safe
       flights.

Mr M R SIKAKANE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Department of Provincial and Local Government has
       allocated more than R2 billion for the extension of basic
       infrastructure to poor communities;


  (2) further notes that the Minister is also involved in discussions to
       set up projects such as the construction of roads, and the provision
       of electricity and clean water;


  (3) believes that this signals the commitment of the ANC Government to
       improving the lives of all our people; and


  (4) commends the Minister and his department for embarking on this
       transformatory project.

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that economic growth for the first quarter came to a mere 2% of
           GDP;


       (b)  that in real terms this means that economic growth will have to
           accelerate to 4,5% seasonally adjusted and annualised in each
           quarter, to reach the consensus forecast of 3,8% growth for
           2001; and


       (c)  that such low levels of growth could trigger a downward spiral
           in long-term economic growth and further impact negatively on
           the high levels of unemployment and poverty in South Africa; and


  (2) urges the Government, in the interest of the millions of unemployed
       and poor people in South Africa, to use monetary policy to ensure
       that the economy moves in the right direction, since failure will
       lead to more South Africans joining the ranks of those in the
       predicament of being without an income and facing the bleak prospect
       of finding another livelihood.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -
  (1) welcomes the United States draft Bill on global access to affordable
       HIV/Aids prevention and treatment, which would devote $50 million
       specifically to helping poor countries purchase AIDS-related drugs
       and a further $470 million for the prevention and treatment of
       HIV/Aids in Sub-Saharan Africa;


  (2) expresses its concern that the spate of diversionary tactics by the
       Minister of Health would defeat this and other well-intentioned
       foreign aid, and is a reflection of warped prioritisation by the ANC
       Government;


  (3) calls on the Minister of Health to devise and implement appropriate
       measures so as to ensure the transparent administration of foreign
       funding, to ensure that it reaches the intended beneficiaries.

Mr R M MOROPA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that Spoornet and the SA Transport and Allied Workers Union,
       Satawu, reached an agreement on Monday to end the two week strike;


  (2) believes that the amicable solution reached by Spoornet management
       and the union will contribute to restoring confidence and stability
       in the public transport system; and


  (3) commends the union and management for the peaceful and amicable
       resolution of the dispute.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness the sudden death of Prof Eunice Motshabi;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  she was Professor in the Faculty of Education at the University
           of North West;


       (b)  prior to serving at the University of North West, she also
           served at the University of the North;


       (c)  Prof Motshabi was an executive committee member of the PAC;


       (d)  she was deeply committed to serving the poor;


       (e)  she organised many projects among the poor and was a great
           campaigner for women's rights in our country; and


       (f)  her passing is a great loss to education and to the poor African
           masses, and of course to the PAC of Azania;


  (3) notes that the PAC has also lost the Secretary-General of the Pan-
       Africanist Youth Congress, Payco, Mr Selala; and


  (4) further notes that funeral arrangements are being made for these two
       dedicated PAC comrades.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die AEB sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die uitspraak van regter Brian Southwood verwelkom wat bepaal dat die
       beheer wat die Minister vir Justisie en Staatkundige Ontwikkeling oor
       landdroste het, ongrondwetlik is;


  (2) opnuut die kardinale beginsel onderskryf dat die onafhanklikheid van
       die regbank 'n hoeksteen is van die ordelike regstaat;


  (3) versoek dat, onderhewig aan bevestiging deur die Konstitusionele Hof,
       die Wet op Landdroste en die Wet op Landdroshowe met dieselfde ywer
       as die Wet op die spesiale ondersoekeenheid van regter Heath hersien
       sal word ten einde dit in ooreenstemming te bring met die Grondwet;


  (4) glo dat hierdie uitspraak 'n vingerwysing vir die ANC is om groter
       erns te maak met die insette van opposisiepartye, wat telkens in
       hierdie Huis gewaarsku het dat die Minister sy magte oorskry;


  (5) versoek dat minister Maduna voortaan sal fokusseer op sy wesenlike
       taak, naamlik om 'n ordelike infrastruktuur vir regspleging te skep;
       en


  (6) die Minister aanraai om, indien hy steeds 'n brandende begeerte het
       om 'n rol in regspraak self te speel, te bedank, die voorbeeld van
       adv Dikgang Moseneke te volg en by die professionele regsprofessie
       aan te sluit.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the ruling by Mr Justice Brian Southwood, which states that
       the control which the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
       Development has over magistrates is unconstitutional;


  (2) once again endorses the cardinal principle that the independence of
       the judiciary is a cornerstone of an orderly constitutional state;


  (3) requests that, subject to confirmation by the Constitutional Court,
       the Magistrates Act and the Magistrates' Courts Act be reviewed with
       the same vigour as the Act dealing with the special investigating
       unit of Judge Heath, in order to bring them in line with the
       Constitution;


  (4) believes that this ruling points a finger at the ANC to deal more
       seriously with the inputs of opposition parties, which warned in this
       House time and again that the Minister was exceeding his powers;


  (5) requests Minister Maduna in future to focus on his real task, namely
       to create an orderly infrastructure for the administration of
       justice; and


  (6) advises the Minister, if he still has a burning desire to play a role
       in the administration of justice itself, to resign, follow the
       example of Adv Dikgang Moseneke and join the legal professional.]

Mr S J MOHAI: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the heart of a Palestinian, who was killed by Israeli
       settlers, was donated to an Israeli who would have died without it;


  (2) also notes that this was described by the Israelis as ``a noble act
       that touched us'' and by the heart surgeon as ``a ray of light";


  (3) believes that this noble incident is an indication that Jews and
       Palestinians could and should live together in peace, harmony and co-
       operation;


  (4) commends the Palestinian family for their selflessness that inspires
       peace and neighbourliness; and


  (5) calls on all Palestinians and Jews to reach out to each other to
       increase their grass-roots peace efforts and to build stability in
       the region.

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the continued escalation of the arms deal price tag from R29,9
       billion in September 1999 to R43 billion in May 2001;


  (2) further notes that the Government omitted to take any forward cover
       against the depreciation of the Rand against the currencies in which
       the contracts were denominated; and


  (3) therefore calls on the Government -


       (a)  to supply full details of all the contracts it has signed;


       (b)  to honour only those parts of the contracts from which we cannot
           withdraw without serious financial loss to the taxpayer;


       (c)  not to take up the options to purchase a further 12 hawk and 19
           Gripen aircraft; and


       (d)  where possible, to terminate all contracts which show evidence
           of corruption or undue influence.

Ms S C VOS: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the shocking report presented to the Minister of Social
           Development yesterday by the organisation Halt Elder Abuse Line,
           which revealed the tragic numbers of physical attacks and other
           forms of abuse perpetrated against many thousands of elderly
           persons in our communities; and


       (b)  that physical violence, including rape, was the most common type
           of abuse followed by the extortion of pension money, neglect and
           emotional abuse; and


  (2) calls for support for all constructive community action to draw
       attention to these crimes, to stop their proliferation, to assist
       victims and to apprehend perpetrators so as to ensure their
       appropriate punishment and rehabilitation thereafter.

Ms N MAHLAWE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes reports that state-owned Transnet is expected to announce its
       performance results in the next few weeks;


  (2) further notes that it is speculated that strong performances from its
       subsidiaries, like Spoornet and South African Airways, will help the
       holding company to record a profit of R1 billion in the year ended
       March 2001;


  (3) believes that the increase in the performance of these companies is a
       positive result of the state restructuring process; and


  (4) commends the Government for developing policy for restructuring state
       assets and the management of Transnet and workers for ensuring that
       Transnet becomes a viable public utility company.

Mnr F BEUKMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat die Konstitusionele Hof dele van die Wet op
       Vreemdelingebeheer ongrondwetlik verklaar het, wat bevestig dat die
       huidige migrasiewetgewing en die Wet op Vreemdelingebeheer nie die
       behoeftes van die Suid-Afrikaanse arbeidsmark aanspreek nie;


  (2) dit verwelkom dat geen buitelandse eggenoot se aansoek om 'n
       werkpermit geweier of afgekeur mag word op grond dat ander burgers
       die werk kan verrig nie;


  (3) 'n beroep doen op die Kabinet om die beoogde konsep-
       immigrasiewetsontwerp so gou doenlik voor die Portefeuljekomitee oor
       Binnelandse Sake ter tafel te lê;


  (4) bevestig dat die uitspraak van die Konstitusionele Hof onderstreep
       dat 'n nuwe benadering vir die hantering van immigrasievraagstukke
       nodig is; en


  (5) die Kabinet versoek om weer eens te besin oor die meriete van 'n
       onafhanklike immigrasiediens wat die bestuur van migrasie-
       aangeleenthede kan verrig.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day I
shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Constitutional Court has ruled that sections of the
       Aliens Control Act are unconstitutional, which confirms the fact that
       current legislation on migration and the Aliens Control Act do not
       address the needs of the South African labour market;


  (2) welcomes the fact that no foreign marriage partner's application for
       a work permit may be refused or rejected on the grounds that other
       citizens can do that work;


  (3) appeals to Cabinet to submit the envisaged draft immigration Bill to
       the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs as soon as possible;


  (4) confirms that the ruling of the Constitutional Court underlines the
       need for a new approach when dealing with immigration issues; and


  (5) requests Cabinet to reconsider the merits of an independent
       immigration service which can control the management of migration
       matters.]

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern Cosatu's planned protest action against
           privatisation, including strike action against Eskom;


       (b)  that the possibility of job losses, a decline in job creation
           and a lack-demise of local ownership are valid concerns that
           should be addressed in a more constructive manner; and


       (c)  that the restructuring process must continue; and


  (2) calls on -


       (a)  the Minister to urgently attend to the dismally failing National
           Framework Agreement; and


       (b)  Cosatu to address its concerns in a reasonable and constructive
           manner through the appropriate forums.

Mr B MTHEMBU: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the announcement that Russia will be writing off a large
       portion of the debt owed to Russia by Ethiopia and is negotiating to
       further reduce the debt owed by Mozambique; and


  (2) welcomes this action by the Russian government and calls on other
       nations to follow the example of Russia and so reduce the debt burden
       of the poorest nations of the world.

                        TAXI ACCIDENT IN JOHANNESBURG

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G Q M DOIDGE: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its shock at the death of 12 people in Johannesburg
       recently in an accident involving a minibus taxi;


  (2) extends its condolences to the families of those killed in this
       tragedy;


  (3) further expresses its outrage at the fact that the taxi was not
       roadworthy, licensed or registered;


  (4) calls on taxi owners, drivers and all road users to respect traffic
       regulations and be part of the Arrive Alive campaign; and


  (5) further calls on traffic authorities all over South Africa to clamp
       down on vehicles that sow death and destruction on our roads.

Agreed to.

                    RETURN OF BRONZE MEDAL TO SA SWIMMER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy dank en waardering uitspreek teenoor mnre Randell Alexander en
       Randall Eksteen, twee werknemers van die Kaapstadse Metroraad, wat in
       die uitvoering van hul pligte, die bronsmedalje gevind het wat die
       Suid-Afrikaanse swemmer Marianne Kriel in die 100-meter borsslag by
       die Olimpiese Spele in Atlanta in 1996 gewen het;


  (2) kennis neem dat hulle toe geen steen onaangeroer gelaat het om
       Marianne op te spoor en die medalje aan haar terug te besorg nie;


  (3) die onbaatsugtige optrede van mnre Alexander en Eksteen teenoor alle
       Suid-Afrikaners aanprys as 'n uitnemende voorbeeld van eerlikheid en
       integriteit; en


  (4) deel in Marianne se vreugde, aangesien die hele land, in wese, die
       trotse mede-eienaar is van elke Olimpiese medalje wat deur 'n Suid-
       Afrikaner verower is.

Goedgekeur. (Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its thanks and appreciation to Messrs Randell Alexander and
       Randell Eksteen, two employees of the Cape Town Metropolitan Council
       who, in the execution of their duties, found the bronze medal won by
       the South African swimmer Marianne Kriel in 1996 in the 100 metres
       breaststroke at the Olympic Games in Atlanta;
  (2) notes that they left no stone unturned in their efforts to find
       Marianne and to return the medal to her;


  (3) holds up the unselfish actions of Messrs Alexander and Eksteen to all
       South Africans as an outstanding example of honesty and integrity;
       and


  (4) shares in Marianne's joy since, in essence, the whole country is the
       proud co-owner of every Olympic medal won by a South African.

Agreed to.]

             SUPREME COURT DECREE, 1990 (CISKEI) AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, the
Bill before the House is very interesting. It is a temporary measure that
we are seeking to use to address one of the relics of our past as far as
the judicial system is concerned. I was asked by the President of the Bisho
High Court, Justice Pickard, if we could not start utilising the three
court rooms that are available in East London - for which we are paying
rent - because it was envisaged that they would be utilised by the Heath
Unit, as it was popularly known.

The facilities right now are not being used at all, and yet we continue to
pay rent for them. The ideal, we were advised by Justice Pickard, was to
start using them as a seat of his High Court. For some short while I
thought that the matter was very simple until the department brought to my
attention the fact that the Bisho High Court functions under the Ciskei
Supreme Court Decree of 1990, in terms of which the Judge President of that
Court may, if he or she deems it expedient, direct that the Court sit at
any other place in the Republic of Ciskei. In order to be able to deal with
this situation, we have placed this Bill before hon members. I am aware
that this can only be a temporary measure.

Eventually, the whole situation can appropriately be addressed in the
context of a process of rationalisation of our courts, which we want to
believe is beginning in earnest. With those few words, the Bill is before
the House for discussion.
It is not the only relic of apartheid that we have discovered. Earlier this
afternoon the hon Delport informed this House about a judgment on the
constitutionality of certain provisions of a 1993 Act. We are beginning a
process of addressing some of the crudities that one finds in those pieces
of legislation without conceding anything on the question of
constitutionality, because the whole issue is fluid, pending finalisation
by the Constitutional Court as provided for in the Constitution.

I am prepared to say that there is a process we are embarking upon to comb
through the various laws and try to address these crudities. If the
Constitutional Court confirms that the Act or certain provisions thereof
are unconstitutional, we shall act with speed and address that. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Speaker, I reluctantly stand before you today. The
committee has decided that we should not participate in this debate.
However, the programming committee apparently decided that the chairperson
should say something in respect of this Bill. Therefore, the chair is
saying hello to hon members.

The parties in the committee unanimously agreed to this Bill. We did so
reluctantly because, as the hon the Minister has pointed out, the justice
system should be restructured holistically. What is being followed in this
case, is a piecemeal approach, and the Minister has explained practically
why we have to do this. There are three courts standing empty in East
London and by a little amendment such as this, the Bisho court can now go
and sit in East London.

I just want to point out that we have received some submissions that in
this Bill we are dealing with the jurisdiction of the courts. Please, this
has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the courts: it only deals with
where the courts, in the erstwhile Ciskei, are allowed to sit.

Lastly, there was also a request for further amendments. It was suggested
that the word ``Supreme Court'' should not be used and ``High Court'' was
suggested. The word ``Chief Justice'' should also not be used, but rather
``Judge President''. All these matters are already catered for in the
Constitution. We did not want to touch Mr Gqozo's little decree - which he
passed as a dictator - any further than we had to. The committee therefore
unanimously passed the Bill and I speak on behalf of all those members.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                       AIRPORTS COMPANY AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Madam Speaker and hon members, the regulating
committee was established in terms of section 11(1) of the Airports Company
Act of 1993. The purpose of the regulating committee is the economic
regulation of two entities, which are the Airports Company of South Africa
and the Air Traffic and Navigation Service Company Limited.

Acsa may only levy charges if it is in possession of a valid permission to
levy charges. The permission is issued by the regulating committee and is
valid for five years. In the third year of the permission, Acsa must apply
for new permission from the regulating committee to levy airport charges
for the next five years. The regulating committee therefore looks at the
last two years of the existing permission when it reviews the application
for new permission.

Section 12(11)(a) of the Act states that the regulating committee may amend
charges for the last two years of the existing permission only with the
approval of the Minister of Transport and Acsa. In theory, this means that
Acsa can veto a decision by the regulating committee. This has never
happened, but the existence of such a veto right is untenable. It is
contrary to the spirit and the intent of the Act, dealing with the
regulation of a company which is a natural monopoly.

The proposed amendment seeks to remove the requirement that the regulating
committee should obtain the approval of the company. This amendment will
bring section 12(11)(a) of the Act in line with section 11(11) of the Air
Traffic and Navigation Services Company Act, which prescribes that only the
approval of the Minister of Transport is required for amendments of this
nature.

I now want to turn to the question of the IPO of Acsa. Late last year,
Cabinet agreed that I as Minister of Transport, should approach our
strategic equity partner, Aeroporti di Roma, with a view to postponing the
launch of the IPO. Together with officials from the Departments of
Transport and of Public Enterprises, as well as the chairperson of the
Airports Company, Mr Mashudu Ramano, I went to Rome to meet with the ADR.
This was our second meeting and we were able to come to a complete
agreement on the way forward in the next few years. We agreed that no IPO
could be launched this year.

The regional agreement gave Government a right to initiate an IPO by April
2001, failing which ADR will have the right to launch the IPO. We have both
agreed not to exercise this right and have further agreed to extend the
timeframe for launching the IPO by a further three years. This means that
the South African Government will not launch the IPO before 2004.

The reasons for this decisions are as follows. Firstly, not enough has been
done to transform Acsa and its management at all airports to reflect the
demographics of the South African population. Secondly, airports and
business activities around airports provide opportunities for black
economic empowerment in the form of contract procurement, airport-related
activities and retail business opportunities. Up until now, not enough has
been done, though some progress has been recorded. Thirdly, it is necessary
for the overall economic growth and development of South Africa that
airports countrywide be improved. There is a need for airports to create
active synergies between provincial government, business, labour and civil
societies generally to ensure that each provincial airport fully supports
the economic and social development of that province.

We have come to the firm view that the immediate launch of the IPO will
jeopardise Government's chances of achieving these objectives, which
require the use of significant portions of operational profit to enhance
development, black economic empowerment and the training of black men and
women in all airport-related activities. We are concerned that we can go a
long way in achieving the above objectives. We are convinced that we can go
a long way to achieve the objectives over the next three years. We will
thereby be adding immense value to the company and achieving the
Government's social objectives. We also take into account as Government
that airports constitute strategic infrastructural assets over which
Government should always exercise a degree of control.

Acsa is a highly successful company and has once again registered
impressive results. We recognise that the profits derived from Acsa have
already been beneficial to the economy as a whole. We want to ensure that
these benefits accrue to the country as a whole. We will do everything in
our power to promote the objectives we have indicated and in doing so, we
will steadfastly continue to develop our airports to the highest standards.
The benefits for growth in tourism and economic development are self-
evident, but need to be aligned. In so doing, major opportunities will open
up for the private sector generally and for black economic empowerment in
particular.

The Bill before the House is a measure designed to ensure that fair
practices are entrenched.

Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, unlike the Justice committee, we decided that
we would give members a chance just to discuss some of the aspects of this
particular Bill. I must say upfront that we support this Bill.
We believe though that the amendment is of a regulatory nature, and it is
important to establish the role of Acsa. As the hon the Minister has
outlined, it is important to establish the role Acsa is currently playing
in the management and development of our airports and where they are going
to in the future.

Acsa was formed in 1993 to operate South Africa's nine principal airports.
Collectively, these airports handle more than 190 000 aircraft landings and
19 million passengers annually. Its prime task, since its formation, has
been to upgrade infrastructure and service standards at our country's
airports. Its turnover for the five-year period 1995-2000 increased by 112%
and operating profit by 132%, whilst investing nearly R1,6 billion in fixed
assets, returning nearly R2 billion to the state via taxation dividends and
share-sale proceeds. The most current figures available indicate an annual
turnover of R884 million, with a R280 million profit after tax.

In 1999 Acsa won the 1999 African Airport of the Year award for its
sustained effort in modernising Johannesburg International Airport,
together with a number of prestigious awards for listed and nonlisted
companies. With this sort of track record, it was no surprise that it
attracted the interest of the private sector. The sale of 20% of the
company's shares to the Aeroporti di Roma for R819 million was voted
Privatisation International's Africa Private Sale of the Year for 1998.

The current ownership structure of Acsa is structured in such a way that
the state holds 51% whilst the balance allocated to Aeroporti di Roma is
20%; to empowerment investors, 10%; to employees, 9%; and to NEF, 10%. On
the acceptance that these empowerment investors and NEF shares had not been
entirely enacted, it is of concern to the Democratic Alliance that this
should cause the Minister to delay the privatisation process for a further
three years, as he put it, because of the lack of transformation. My
colleague, the hon Rudi Heine, in the debate on Public Enterprises last
week indicated, and I quote:


  Privatisation of state liabilities and assets is recognised as a critical
  element in increasing the efficiency and reducing the costs to
  Government, and it is a worldwide phenomenon.


  A World Bank study of 61 privatisations in 18 countries showed that, on
  average, the efficiency of these companies had risen by 11% and they have
  taken on 6% more employees. In developing countries, increases in net
  employment levels have been more impressive. In developed countries
  privatised utilities are likely to seek profit by cutting labour costs,
  but in poorer countries the pursuit usually creates more jobs.

Within Acsa, employment equity and transformation is well on track, with
50% of senior management and middle management, 65% of supervisors and
specialists and 75% of frontline staff affirmed. The company fully complies
with the Skills Development Act and the Employment Equity Act, and 5% of
the payroll goes towards training and accelerated development programmes.
Acsa, by all accounts, is committed to black economic empowerment at both
board and management levels by virtue of the fact that all executives are
measured on their activities against these empowerment targets.

I am unaware of the real reasons for the Minister's decision to postpone
the privatisation of Acsa, but if he believes the transformation process
has not yet adequately advanced, why then can he not make it conditional
upon the sale of shares? The selling off of state assets has great benefits
which far outweigh the running of these assets by the state. I would
therefore appreciate the rationale behind the Minister's decision to delay
the target by three years. To put the process on ice or prevent Aeroporti
di Roma from purchasing further options of shares in the company is
questionable in today's economic climate. I am surprised that on the basis
of any business plan, no performance agreements in regard to the
restructuring and transformation of Acsa were entered into.

Privatisation is good for business and useful in contributing to Government
coffers, and introducing competition into a sector improves service and
efficiency to the consumer. And that is precisely what we want and what the
Minister asked for. Needless to say, delaying the privatisation of Acsa
will, once again, send the wrong signal to international investors and
another opportunity will be lost.

The amendment, we believe, must in many ways impact on the permissions
allocated by this regulating committee, and we believe that certain of
these sorts of matters will be looked at as part of the future process.
[Applause.]

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, Comrade Minister, hon members, as the
Minister has well explained, in 1993 legislation was passed here in
Parliament which was known as the Airport Companies Act, and it established
Acsa. The legislation at the same time also established a regulating
committee to oversee Acsa. This regulating committee, whose members are
appointed by the Minister, has the special responsibility of regulating
airport levies that are charged by Acsa at the airports that it manages.

Acsa has to submit business plans and other relevant information, and the
regulating committee then issues, when it deems it appropriate, a five-year
permission to charge levies. This permission will set limits on any
particular airport charge. At the time of passing the law in 1993, the
lawmakers wisely recognised that, given the unpredictable and fluctuating
nature of markets, it might be better to establish the possibility of
amending the permission in the final two years of a five-year period. We,
as a portfolio committee and the ANC, continued to support this
possibility.
However, in the old 1993 legislation such amendments are made conditional,
firstly, on the Minister and, secondly, on the company itself approving
such an alteration. This wording, in effect, as the Minister has just said,
gives the company a veto right, not in general but on the specific matter,
over the very authority that is meant to regulate it. That cannot be right.
It is for this reason that a very small amendment has been proposed, and
this is the amendment we have before us today. I think in the portfolio
committee we all undertook to accept the amendment and I thank the various
parties for that.

However, as I have predicted, this debate - which is about amending the
regulation of Acsa - has also been used as a platform to have the whole
discussion about privatisation and the direction of the restructuring of
Acsa. Therefore I was happy that the Minister took the opportunity to
explain why he has postponed the initial public offering on Acsa for at
least three years.

Mr Farrow has given a very interesting input, showing how successful and
efficient Acsa - an 80% publicly owned company - has been and how
profitable it is for Government. He mentioned some R2 billion income over
the last few years from Acsa. And yet he says we should sell it!

We would like to ask the Minister a few questions. As we say, Acsa is an
80% publicly owned company with a 20% equity partner in the shape of
Aeroporti di Roma. In 1998 Aeroporti di Roma paid a once-off R819 million
for its 20% shareholding. In 2000 Acsa made a R292 million profit, which
suggests that every two-and-a-half years Acsa could make as much, but over
and over again, as it got once-off from Aeroporti di Roma. We would like to
ask the Minister: Are there compelling reasons to continue to sell off more
and more of Acsa?

HON MEMBERS: Yes!

Mr J P CRONIN: They say, yes.

In April this year, Acsa announced a restructuring and investment strategy
which will see the enterprise pump R7 billion into airport operations over
the next five years. This is very much in line with President Mbeki's
vision of major infrastructural investment, contributing through improved
transport efficiencies to the overall lowering of input costs throughout
our economy. As Business Map has noted, and I quote:


  A fully privatised company would probably pay out a much higher
  proportion of profit as dividends to shareholders and not be putting this
  kind of money into infrastructural development.

Again, we would like to know from the Minister if there are compelling
reasons to move inexorably towards selling off more and more of Acsa?

Finally, in asking the same question, it is important to note that fully
privatised airports are not in fact the international norm. In the United
States, as far as I know, there is not a single major airport which is
privatised. Airports in the United States - we are not talking about
somewhere else, but the United States - are typically owned by cities, by
municipal governments. They provide an important revenue stream for cities,
and they enhance the capacity of a municipality. I think, as the Minister
implied, that they enhance the potential, in our case, of a provincial
government, for instance, to set strategic agendas and to invest in
infrastructure, rather than paying out dividends to fickle investors.

Some in the opposition will and are, of course, leaning on the Minister to
sell, and to sell, and to sell, and we from the side of the ANC thought
that we should lean on him a little from the other side. But all this has
little to do with the Bill we are amending, the Bill we are seeking to pass
and the airports.

The ANC supports the Airports Company Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, the Airports Company Amendment Bill before
us today proposes an amendment to the Airports Company Act of 1993.

Soos dit tans staan, bepaal die wet dat die reguleringskomitee, ná oorleg
met die maatskappy en ander belanghebbendes, enige vergunningsvoorwaardes
aan die Lughawensmaatskappy om invorderings te hef, kan wysig indien die
Minister en die maatskappy sodanige wysiging goedkeur.

Die voorgestelde wysiging beoog dat daar steeds met die maatskappy oorleg
gepleeg moet word oor voorgenome veranderings, maar dat slegs die
goedkeuring van die Minister verkry hoef te word en dat goedkeuring van die
maatskappy nie meer nodig is nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[As it currently stands, the Act provides that the regulating committee,
after consultation with the company and other interested parties, may amend
any condition of the permission to levy charges issued to the Airports
Company, if the Minister and the company approve such amendment.

The proposed amendment envisages that the company must still be consulted
about intended changes, but that only the approval of the Minister needs to
be obtained and that the approval of the company is no longer necessary.]

It appears that this amendment was only needed because of a possible
oversight in the 1993 legislation, and it is now being corrected.

There was consensus in the portfolio committee and acceptance by all
parties. But, while on Acsa, one could ask oneself why the dragging of feet
with the privatisation of Acsa. Is it perhaps on hold and should it be? One
would like to know why.

Another issue that I would like to raise, while the opportunity and time
are there, is that Acsa must now really come clean, as to their attitude
and intention about the proposed new King Shaka Airport at La Mercy in
KwaZulu-Natal. If I look at the present level of building activity at
Durban Airport, it leaves a question on the development of the proposed
King Shaka Airport. It would be one's express wish that this matter will
now, once and for all, come to finality.

Nevertheless, the IFP supports the Airports Company Amendment Bill.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mevrou die Speaker, vanmiddag het 'n episode in die
geskiedenis van ons parlement hom voor ons afgespeel waarin die Regering
probeer om debat te vermy.

Dit is 'n eenvoudige wetswysiging. In die portefeuljekomitee is aan ons
verduidelik dat dit 'n tegniese wysiging is om die tydperk van vyf jaar te
verander wat die Lughawensmaatskappy het om sy tariefverhogings deur die
minister te laat goedkeur sodat dit kan oorvleuel na drie jaar. Daar is
niks aan nie.

Ons het egter gesê ons voel ons moet die saak debatteer, aangesien die
Minister 'n paar weke gelede aangekondig het dat die privatisering van die
Lughawensmaatskappy met drie jaar uitgestel word totdat die nodige
aanpassings gedoen en daar genoeg swart gesigte in die bestuurskader van
die Lughawensmaatskappy is.

Ek wil nou vir die agb voorsitter vra of hy sien wat ek bedoel het toe ek
gesê het ons sal hieroor moet praat. Hier kom die Minister, anders as wat
die departement aan ons verduidelik het, en hy motiveer presies die rede
waarom hy dié tegniese wysiging aangebring het. Hy wil drie jaar kans hê om
regstellende aksie binne die Lughawensmaatskappy toe te pas.

Ek het vir hom gesê ons gaan daaroor praat. Ons wil nie hê daar moet in die
toekoms gesê word daar is nie debat hieroor nodig nie. Daar is áltyd debat
oor dié sake nodig. Ons moet dit altyd doen.

Ek en die voorsitter kom taamlik goed oor die weg in die
portefeuljekomitee. Ek wil hom vra, noudat die ANC dié privatisering
ondersteun, ondersteun die SAKP dit ook, of staan hy dit teen? Is die SAKP
daarteen gekant? Die voorsitter het dít in die komitee te kenne gegee.

Van DA-kant ondersteun ons die privatisering van die Lughawensmaatskappy,
veral toe dit op 'n punt was waar dit finansieel goed gefunksioneer en
goeie dividende opgelewer het. Ek wil vir die agb mnr Cronin sê
aandeelhouers moet die dividende kry, hulle betaal belasting daarop. Die
belasting gaan na die staat en hy kan dit vir infrastruktuur gebruik. Daar
is geen probleem mee nie.

Dit is net 'n geharde Kommunis soos die agb mnr Cronin wat met dié soort
praatjies by ons sal kom en dink ons sal dit nie kan glo nie. Waarteen ons
gekant is, is die manier waarop die ANC-regering regstellende aksie in Suid-
Afrika toepas. Dit is nie ``black economic empowerment'' nie, dit is
``enrichment of the inner elite circle of the ANC''.

Dít is waarmee die ANC-regering hier besig is. Ek wil die Minister vra om
ons die versekering te gee dat hy nie nou weer sy `cronies' en `buddies' in
die Lughawensmaatskappy gaan aanstel nie om seker te maak dat die gelukkige
minderheid mense in Suid-Afrika verryk word terwyl daar honderde, duisende
en miljoene mense is wat in armoede leef.

Ons is ten gunste van `black economic empowerment', maar dan moet dit vir
alle mense beskikbaar wees, nie net vir 'n klein minderheid binne ANC-
geledere nie. Al die mense moet deur privatisering en `black economic
empowerment' bevoordeel word. Hulle moet kan voel daar is vir hulle werk en
selfrespek, dat hulle vir hulle huise kan laat bou en hul gesinne kan
onderhou. Nie soos dit nou die geval is dat mense bakhand voor die ANC-
regering moet staan en bedel terwyl hy net belang stel in die verryking van
die mense in sy eie binnekring nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, today an episode in the history of our
Parliament played itself out before us, in which the Government attempted
to avoid a debate.

This is a simple statutory amendment. In the portfolio committee it was
explained to us that it is a technical amendment to change the period of
five years which the Airports Company has in which to have its tariff
increases approved by the Minister so that it can overlap to three years.
There is nothing to it.

However, we said that we feel we should debate the matter, as a few weeks
ago the Minister announced that the privatisation of the Airports Company
would be postponed for three years so that the necessary adjustments could
be made and there were enough black faces in the management ranks of the
Airports Company.

I now want to ask the hon chairperson whether he sees what I meant when I
said that we would have to discuss this. The Minister comes along, unlike
what the department explained to us, and he motivates precisely the reason
why he made this technical amendment. He wants three years to implement
affirmative action within the Airports Company.

I told him that we were going to discuss this. We do not want it to be said
in future that a debate on this matter is not necessary. A debate on these
matters is always necessary. We must always do this.

The chairperson and I get on fairly well in the portfolio committee. I want
to ask him, now that the ANC supports this privatisation, does the SACP
support it as well, or does it oppose it? Is the SACP opposed to it? The
chairperson indicated this in the committee.

From the DA's side, we support the privatisation of the Airports Company,
particularly when it was at a stage where it was functioning well
financially and delivering good dividends. I want to tell the hon Mr Cronin
that shareholders must receive the dividends, they pay tax on them. The tax
goes to the state and it can use it for infrastructure. There is no problem
with that.

Only a hardened communist like the hon Mr Cronin would come to us with
these types of stories and think that we would not be able to believe them.
What we are opposed to, is the manner in which the ANC Government is
implementing affirmative action in South Africa. It is not black economic
empowerment, it is enrichment of the inner elite circle of the ANC.
That is what the ANC Government is engaged in here. I want to ask the
Minister to give us the assurance that he is now not once again going to
appoint his cronies and buddies in the Airports Company to ensure that the
fortunate minority of people in South Africa are enriched while there are
hundreds, thousands and millions of people who are living in poverty.

We are in favour of black economic empowerment, but then it must be
available to all people, not only to a small minority within the ranks of
the ANC. All the people must benefit from privatisation and black economic
empowerment. They must be able to feel that there is work for them and self-
respect, that they can have houses built for themselves and can support
their families. Not the situation that we currently have in which people
have to stand before the ANC Government begging, while it is only
interested in the enrichment of the people within its own inner circle.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, previous speakers have explained what this
Bill is about, particularly the hon the Minister and the chairperson of the
portfolio committee. So, I will not bore members with the details of what
this is about, but rather just put it into context.

The Airports Company is listed in the Public Finance Management Act, under
Schedule 2, as a major public entity. As such, a number of controls apply
and conditions are spelled out. One of them is that in terms of the Act, a
regulating committee was established which, unfortunately, had to seek the
approval of both the Minister and the Airports Company before changing the
conditions under which the company could levy charges.

The point I want to make is that we normally have such a fixation on making
grand changes, tackling big projects, that we do not look at the simple
little things that can be done with ease. This is an example of the
streamlining of a procedure, the cutting of red tape, to simplify things
and to make Government and business operate more smoothly. For this reason,
the UDM supports this Bill because of the streamlining action.

When it comes to the matter of privatisation, I would like to make it very
clear that the UDM supports the privatisation of Acsa, as it has been done,
conditionally. Under no circumstances would we like to see privatisation
take place at the expense of jobs.

With the 20% selling of Acsa, there has actually been an increase in the
number of jobs that were made available. That is the route that we would
like to hear being taken by private enterprise in the privatisation of
state assets.

We would encourage the selling of more of this company as soon as possible,
and we are somewhat disappointed that this move has been postponed. But the
company is functioning more than viably. It is profitable, and, as Dr
Odendaal has said, privatisation must not be feared because there is
taxation that follows the profitable functioning of streamlined businesses.

The UDM supports this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the Airports Company Amendment Bill
proposes to amend section 12(11) of the Airports Company Act of 1993. Since
we are constantly travelling by plane, the MF believes that it is vitally
important for necessary changes to be made so as to enhance service
delivery.
The MF is content with the amendment to the Bill since it allows the
regulating committee to make its own decisions and changes without having
to obtain approval from the company. However, it does make provision for
the regulating committee always to consult with the company and always to
obtain the approval of the Minister of Transport.

The MF supports the Airports Company Amendment Bill.

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Mr Chairperson, I want to thank the chairperson
and members of the portfolio committee, as well as all the members who
participated in this debate.

There were just a couple of questions raised which I want to deal with. The
first is the question of King Shaka Airport. I want to indicate that
sometime ago the Airports Company and representatives of the provincial
government of KwaZulu-Natal - with the participation of national Government
- engaged in a feasibility study with regard to King Shaka Airport.

There are a number of complexities, because it would mean transferring the
international status of the airport from Durban International Airport to
the new site. There would be a new ownership and management configuration,
and there is also the question as to whether such an airport would be
economically viable. One of the problems over the last few years has been
that air traffic to Durban International Airport has declined consistently.

So those are all matters that need to be looked into. They are being
considered at the moment. We as Government are favourably disposed towards
developing the new airport, but it must be economically viable. So that is
the area that we are looking into.

In the meanwhile, as members know, Durban International Airport has been
improved. The improvements are nearing completion and Durban International
will be able to cope with the existing traffic for the foreseeable future
over the next few years. But it is a matter that we are looking at and then
we will obviously report on this matter again.

With regard to the issue of privatisation, I think the problem on the part
of those that consider themselves part of the DA is that they have an
ideological approach to this matter. Therefore, no matter what happens one
must privatise. On our side we do not have an ideological approach to
privatisation. The simple question is whether it benefits our country and
whether it benefits our people. If the statements of the Minister of Public
Enterprises are taken into account, then members will know that there are
certain priorities with regard to privatisation and restructuring of state
assets.

In so far as Acsa is concerned, the position is very simple. This is a very
profitable company. Do members know of any business person who simply
disposes of a business when it is highly profitable? In our case we can use
this entity to advance the social objectives of this Government, namely
economic development of all the provinces, economic development of all the
airports, black economic empowerment at many levels - I can give members
examples - training of our people and capacity-building.

If we were to proceed at this stage with privatisation, we would have lost
control over the board. We would no longer have been in a position to
dictate who appoints the CEO and all the objectives which I have
identified. [Interjections.]

Mr R J HEINE: It is not important!
The MINISTER: It is not important to the hon member because he wants to
retain the status quo. The hon member does not know what transformation is
and he does not support it. The hon member likes privilege - he has enjoyed
privilege and he wants privilege to continue. [Interjections.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mr Chairperson, would the hon the Minister be prepared to
take a question on this point?

The MINISTER: Mr Chairperson, I have listened to so much nonsense from the
hon Odendaal that the less I hear his voice during this debate, the better.
So I will not take his question.

As the hon Cronin has pointed out, there are very few examples of airports
simply being privatised. Why? Because airports constitute strategic assets
and therefore government at national, provincial or local level should have
a role to play with regard to airports. And because of the profitability of
our company, there is no reason why we should rush into privatisation.
[Interjections.]

What we are doing, at the moment, is to ensure that every step we take with
regard to our airports benefits our country and provides jobs. For example,
as a result of the steps we have taken, Johannesburg International Airport
has, for the first time in its history, a black manager who is in charge of
that airport. For the first time in our history, Cape Town International
Airport has a black manager and members will notice very shortly that, for
the first time in the history of the company, the CEO of Acsa will be a
black person. That is progress for us. [Applause.]

Debate concluded

Bill read a second time.

                      ROAD ACCIDENT FUND AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the Road
Accident Fund makes a financial contribution of R50 million per year to the
Arrive Alive campaign. The Auditor-General has expressed reservations about
the legality of that contribution to the Arrive Alive campaign.

The new board under the chairmanship of Adv Kessie Naidoo, SC, therefore
took up the matter and sought legal opinion. The issue is whether section 4
of the Road Accident Fund Act of 1996, which sets out the powers and
functions of the fund, authorises the fund to make such contributions. The
legal opinion obtained by the board says it does not. The Chief State Law
Adviser, in a separate opinion, says that the section does indeed give the
fund the power to make contributions. The purpose of this amendment is to
remove all uncertainty and to ensure that the Road Accident Fund does,
indeed, have the authority to make funds available for road safety projects
approved by the Minister, which would include the Arrive Alive campaign.

The Arrive Alive campaign is recognised throughout the country as having
been a success. There is evidence from the available statistics, which
reveal that in 1998 there was a 6,43% reduction in fatalities and a 7,78%
reduction in serious injuries. There was also an estimated saving in that
year of R475 million. The final figures for 1999 and 2000 are not available
because there are still major delays and bottlenecks in the provincial
accident reporting systems - this is a separate matter which is being
urgently addressed. The statistics which are available for the Christmas
and Easter holiday periods for the last two years again indicate a decline
in the number of accidents and the number of fatalities.

Indeed, it has been apparent that there is greater awareness amongst road
users that they need to comply with the rules of the road. There has also
been better law enforcement, coupled with the use of mobile courts. This
means that a combination of factors, tougher law enforcement, better law
compliance generally, better co-ordination, better co-operation between
different levels of government and co-operation with the justice system
have together resulted in the significant reduction in accidents and
fatalities which we have witnessed.

On 28 March, in reply to a question, I provided the available statistics to
this honourable Court. Those statistics are still available. They indicate
that, indeed, fatalities and the number of accidents have declined. The
contribution of the Road Accident Fund has been an important factor in
helping us reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on our roads, and
I want to express my appreciation to the Road Accident Fund Board.

I can indicate that there are different levels of government and different
traffic authorities involved in the performance of various functions
impacting upon road safety. The planning and implementation of the Arrive
Alive project, for example, are undertaken jointly by national, provincial
and local traffic authorities. Law enforcement is undertaken by provincial
and local traffic authorities, not national, while communications are
mainly dealt with by national and provincial road safety communication and
educational personnel. Information collection and analysis is the
responsibility of all role-players involved in the project.

It is, perhaps, coincidental that this amendment comes before the House
barely three days after another horrific accident. We are all aware of the
head-on collision between a minibus taxi and a truck which took place in
Muldersdrif in Gauteng on Monday, 4 June, killing all 12 occupants of the
minibus taxi. The vehicle was unroadworthy and unlicensed. The police found
traffic tickets showing that the driver had previously been booked for
driving without a public permit, jumping a red robot, overloading, not
wearing a seat belt and driving an unlicensed vehicle. This vehicle should
never have been allowed on the road. [Interjections.] What is more shocking
is that the brakes were faulty: A device holding them in place was tied
with wire and not secured with bolts.

Members will recall that over the Easter holiday period, there was another
horrific bus smash in KwaZulu-Natal. While such events continue to happen
on a regular basis, it is little comfort that they do so in the context of
improved road safety performance by our country as a whole. Therefore, what
is very clear to us is that as useful and successful as the Arrive Alive
campaign has been, it is not enough. There is much more that needs to be
done. The Arrive Alive campaign has covered the areas of law enforcement,
communication, education and information. It is because of this recognition
of the need to have in place a more comprehensive road safety strategy,
that a more all-embracing programme of action has been devised.

In terms of the strategy document entitled ``The Road to Safety 2001 to
2005'', there is greater focus on the need to promote vehicle and driver
fitness. Special attention is being given to upgrading vehicle testing
stations. All of them fall under the jurisdiction of the provinces, but we
cannot leave matters to provinces. Hence, an amount of just over R20
million is being made available and, in co-operation with provinces, their
vehicle testing stations are urgently being upgraded. In the process we
hope to eliminate corruption where it exists.

New measures to promote driver fitness are also provided for. There is a
special focus on professional drivers, including drivers of minibus taxis
and buses. According to proposals contained in the strategy document, the
technical and practical criteria for a professional driver's permit will be
made much more stringent and will include mandatory training in advanced
defensive driving skills. Over a phased period it will become compulsory
for all candidate drivers to attend driving school. Driving schools
themselves will be registered, and a fixed curriculum will have to be
devised. There is a great emphasis on training to achieve conscious and
voluntary law compliance.

We are also urgently looking at ways of creating the necessary capacity in
our vehicle testing systems, to move from the current annual roadworthy
test for public passenger vehicles, to twice-yearly tests. Again, the
upgrading of vehicle testing stations and stringent controls on corrupt and
fraudulent practices will help to promote vehicle fitness on our roads.

Therefore, this amendment which will authorise the Road Accident Fund to
continue to make its contribution will help us to reduce fatalities and
accidents on our roads once again. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think when the hon the
Minister said that he had ``revealed the figures to the honourable court,''
he meant the honourable House. That comes from long years at the Bar.
[Laughter.]

Mr A R AINSLIE: Chairperson, Minister and members, I think we have to
listen very carefully when Dr Odendaal speaks about affirmative action. He
is an expert on affirmative action. His party promoted white affirmative
action for 300 years, white affirmative action in neighbourhoods, white
affirmative action in schools, jobs for whites on the railways, jobs for
whites at SAA, jobs for whites at the harbours. [Interjections.] We ought
to go to Dr Odendaal for tips on how we should apply affirmative action.
[Interjections.]

The importance of this amendment, which we are discussing today, is that it
will enable the Road Accident Fund to continue making contributions to the
Arrive Alive campaign. That the Bill was passed unanimously by the
Portfolio Committee on Transport is an indication that there is support
across party-political lines for the Arrive Alive campaign and, indeed, for
road safety generally.

It is true that the Road Accident Fund itself operates under severe
financial constraints, largely as a result of the litigious environment in
which it operates. We have great hopes that the commission of inquiry into
the Road Accident Fund under Judge Cathy Satchwell will deal effectively
with these matters and assist in putting the fund on a firm and sustainable
financial footing. However, contributions by the fund to the Arrive Alive
campaign need to be seen as money well spent, as investments directly
benefiting the fund itself. Clearly, the lower the accident rate on our
roads, the less the fund will have to pay out in compensation for injuries
and deaths occurring as a result of road accident.

The CSIR has developed a model which distinguishes between four major types
of accidents and calculates the monetary value for each type. According to
this model, every single fatality costs the economy over R386 000; each
serious injury over R100 000; minor injuries approximately R28 000; and
damage to vehicles only, in the region of R20 000. The estimated total cost
to the economy of our high accident rate is currently about R14 billion per
annum.

These are the economic costs. What about the emotional costs? What about
the emotional costs of losing a loved one, a friend, a colleague in a road
accident? One cannot put a price tag on these emotional costs. So funding
from the RAF to the Arrive Alive campaign is actually an investment in the
reduction of road accidents.

During the past year, the fund contributed in excess of R54 million to the
Arrive Alive campaign. In the current financial year, the fund has
provisionally approved a sum of R15 million. These investments, as the
Minister has indicated, are beginning to yield very positive results. For
three consecutive years, over the December-January holiday period, the
objective of the Arrive Alive campaign to reduce fatalities by at least 5%
has been met. Over this period there has been a substantial decrease in the
number of fatal road accidents.
While progress is being made, there is definitely no reason for
complacency, however, as we heard earlier when we passed a motion in the
House and when the Minister referred to the horrific accident which took
place at Muldersdrif on Monday. There is certainly no room for complacency.
Our road safety campaign is designed, in fact, to put an end to these kinds
of accidents as quickly as possible. We have a long way to go in this
regard.

What is going to help, though, is the transformation of the Arrive Alive
campaign into a year-round national campaign. This is a major boost to road
safety in our country and forms part of a road safety strategy. The
fundamental principles on which our road safety programmes are based are
sound. We are seeing the positive results, which I have indicated and which
the Minister has indicated, but the frequency with which speedsters,
overloaded vehicles and public transport are still involved in accidents,
which result in mass deaths, is unacceptable. The enforcement leg of the
programme needs to be more vigorously implemented. There needs to be zero
tolerance of all and any road offence.

In addition, legislation underpinning enforcement, in particular the
administrative adjudication of the Road Traffic Offences Act, needs to be
fully implemented as soon as possible. This Act is designed specifically
for drivers who do not pay fines, and for drivers who collect traffic
tickets like some people collect stamps.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S B FARROW: Chair and Minister, I think the hon Mr Ainslie was one of
the beneficiaries of that affirmative action in his past. [Interjections.]
I just want to clarify something. When I talked about empowerment of the
49%, one can still hold the strategic share that the hon the Minister
requires. Really, what we were talking about was empowering people for the
balance.

The cost to the economy of the 512 000 traffic accidents a year, of which
28 000 are fatal or lead to serious injuries, is a massive R14 billion to
the state. Some 9 100 people lost their lives on South African roads in
1998. The amendment to the Road Accident Fund Act seeks to authorise and
legitimise - and I stress ``legitimise'' because up to now they have
effectively been giving it out illegally - the fund to make financial
contributions to road safety projects and programmes approved by the
Minister. In this particular instance, it will allow the fund to continue
contributing to the Arrive Alive campaign.

This is a commendable approach to road safety, provided that there is a
noticeable reduction in the number of road accidents that end up as claims
submitted to the fund. During 1998-99, the RAF paid out R2,05 billion in
claims. Since 1996-97, claims have progressively been increasing from 17%
to 25%, over the previous years to the latest figures in 1998-99. This
could be, I might add, as a result of the backlog in claims not reflected
in the Arrive Alive report, but I will comment on that. However, the impact
of reduced claims on the fund, through the Arrive Alive campaign, has not
yet had full effect, although I am aware, as the Minister said, that there
has been an effective reduction of 67% in fatalities during 2000.

The RAF must be seen as a business and not just a milch cow for third party
claim attorneys, for if it continues in this vein, any investments that it
makes towards the Arrive Alive campaign would be wasted. At present, the
fund contributes some R50 million to the Arrive Alive campaign, annually.
This investment must show dividends, and these must be in the form of
significant reductions in the accident claims against it. I am sure it
might work. The Arrive Alive campaign must focus on the high accident areas
of the country, in an effort to bring down accidents, fatalities and
injuries while, at the same time, contributing to the promotion of road
safety in general. That must be done throughout the year.

The RAF has, for many years, been subjected to various investigations and
commissions in an attempt to rectify its financial crisis, which has been
prevalent since the mid-eighties. As the more recent Satchwell commission
drags its feet in coming to any constructive conclusion, we are no nearer
to finding the solution to reducing its deficit, currently estimated to be
over R10 billion and growing at a rate of R1 billion per year.

Settlement delays are between 34 and 46 months after the accident. After
administration fees and legal fees, the balance available to the victim is
further subjected to party and client fees, estimated at 30%. In essence,
the percentage of total expenditure paid to the victim amounts to 52%,
while the percentage to total expenditure used in administering the claim,
is 48%.

As I have said before in previous debates on this topic, it must be the
most inefficient insurance fund in the world, with liabilities exceeding
its assets. These amounted to some R9 billion as of 30 April 1999, making
this fund technically insolvent. I question, therefore, the need for
another prolonged investigation into the fund, at great expenses, by legal
professionals headed by Judge Satchwell. It is a fund that is designed, in
effect, to pay attorneys.

The situation is totally unacceptable and the Minister needs to look more
carefully to avoid a further depletion of the fund and, in particular, the
excessive and continued exploitation of the fund by unscrupulous lawyers
and agents, to the detriment of the victims. The DA suggests a more
businesslike approach to the fund's dilemma. Certainly, the inclusion in
the commission of insurance-related businesspeople or actuaries would go a
long way in helping the fund turn its operations around.

A starting point would be to investigate ways of decreasing the outflow
from the fund and improving liquidity by, firstly, cutting out the
middlemen and attorneys; secondly, eliminating disputes from the claiming
system; thirdly, catching up with the backlog of claim arrears; and
fourthly, clearly defining a funding policy and strategy for the fund. I
say this particularly in the light of the increase in petrol levies which
is being envisaged by the Minister of Finance, towards the money for the
Road Accident Fund.

This will then avoid payouts of the general damages and the lump sums as an
undertaking. If the latter was instituted alone, this would reflect a
saving in the RAF cashflow of approximately R1,4 billion. This money could
then really be channelled towards increased law enforcement and, in so
doing, dramatically reduce the number of accidents on the road.

Finally, there has been a lot of concern in the media about the possible
conflict of interest of certain office bearers employed by the RAF. I have
brought this to the hon the Minister's attention on a number of occasions,
and I really feel that this aspect needs serious consideration, for as long
as this problem prevails, there will be very little chance of the fund
recovering from its present crisis. The fact that the Heath special
investigating unit was prevented from investigating the tremendous amount
of corruption taking place in and outside the fund by the Constitutional
Court, should not stop the Minister from instituting and continuing to
investigate the evidence handed to the Heath commission.

I would just like to say we support this particular Bill. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I just want to
query one point with Mr Ainslie. I think when he was here, he said
something about a terrific accident. Was it ``terrific'' or did you mean
``horrific?'' [Interjections.] Well, I thought that, in the context in
which it happened, it would be horrific. If it is so, then I think we will
just alert Hansard to record it as ``horrific.''

Mr J H SLABBERT: Mr Chairperson and hon Minister, the Road Accident Fund
Amendment Bill before us today is, to my mind, not a controversial Bill at
all. It really needs very little debate, if any at all.

The Bill was discussed thoroughly in the portfolio committee and all
parties reached a consensus. The Bill is to amend the Road Accident Fund
Act of 1996, to authorise the fund to make financial contributions to road
safety projects and other programmes approved by the Minister, including
the Arrive Alive campaign.

Ek wil dit duidelik stel dat ek genoeg vertroue in die agb Minister het dat
hy nie sy bevoegdhede onverantwoordelik sal gebruik en geld links en regs
sal uitgee nie, maar dit laat by my die vraag ontstaan waar hy die fondse
vandaan gaan kry om aan ander mense te skenk, want die fonds self is onder
finansiële druk en is gedeeltelik of geheel en al bankrot. Ek hoop die agb
Minister gaan vir my sê ek is verkeerd. Dit sal baie goed wees.

Iets waaroor ek nog steeds kla, is wetstoepassing. Alhoewel daar 'n
verbetering in wetstoepassing op ons paaie is, is dit op verre na nog nie
voldoende nie. Die mense doen net die ligte werkies. Ek hoor oor die radio
en ek lees in die koerant die wetstoepassers het nou 'n nuwe naam. Hulle
noem hulle nou die SS'e. Dit staan vir ``skaduweesoekers'' in die somer en
vir ``sonsitters'' in die winter! (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)
[I want to state clearly that I have enough faith in the hon the Minister
to believe that he will not use his powers irresponsibly and spend money
left, right and centre, but this brings me to the question of where he will
acquire the funds to donate to other people, because the fund itself is
under financial pressure and is partially or totally bankrupt. I hope the
hon the Minister is going to tell me that I am wrong. That would be very
good.

Something about which I still want to complain is law enforcement. Although
there is an improvement in law enforcement on our roads, it is still not
nearly sufficient. The people are only doing the light jobs. I hear on the
radio and read in the newspaper that the law enforcement officers now have
a new name. They are now being called the SS's. It stands for ``shade
seekers'' in summer and ``sun sitters'' in winter!]

The Road Accident Fund has been under discussion since 1994 and, after
numerous public hearings, etc, no progress has been made up to today.
Furthermore, after Judge Satchwell had been appointed by the previous
Minister of Transport to compile a report on this controversial Road
Accident Fund, she was granted a six month extension and it was said that
the report would be available at the end of 2000, but it has not yet
materialised.

I am of the opinion that the affairs of the fund are in absolute chaos, and
I trust that something can now be done to overcome the deadlock situation.

The IFP, however, supports the amending Bill.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mr Chairman, the Bill before us seeks to legalise the
contributions of the RAF to the Arrive Alive road safety programme.

We were briefed by the portfolio committee about this year's contribution
of R50 million from the RAF, to put the campaign on a permanent basis and
move away from the previous stop-start nature of the campaign over the
Easter and Christmas holidays.  It has already led to a decrease in the
claims against the Road Accident Fund in the amount of about R350 million
during the first year.

If these figures are correct, we would like to sincerely congratulate
everybody involved in the road safety plan on these wonderful achievements.
Would the Minister please confirm the results, in terms of savings for the
RAF, because I am not sure if my figures are correct. The DA will support
this amending Bill.

Unfortunately, some bad reports about the fund appeared in the Mail &
Guardian over the weekend. I have the articles with me, if the Minister has
not had the opportunity to read them. If these allegations are true, one
wonders how it is possible for the RAF to keep on supporting the Arrive
Alive programme.

The following sound bites are quoted directly from these articles:


  The RAF's version is nothing else but sheer racism. No white advocates,
  attorneys or medical professionals may be used in the legal defence of
  the fund, which boils down to unfair discrimination. Stuff the whites.
  Now it is our turn. The scope of nepotism and favouritism is
  considerable.

The daughter of one of the fund's senior office bearers is one of the
chosen few. Some office bearers of the fund have a conflict of interest
when acting as lawyers. Does the Minister know some of them? They also
represent plaintiffs suing the fund. Members of the board are actively
involved in the management of the fund. If this is true, that is indeed a
bad state of affairs.

The question now is: What action has the Minister taken since the article
appeared in the Mail & Guardian? Did he know about the corruption in the
RAF, or was he not aware of what was going on in this fund?

The Mail & Guardian confirms exactly what the people on the ground are
experiencing in respect of ANC rule on a daily basis. The actions of the
ANC Government have nothing to do with black economic empowerment. It is
all about self-enrichment of the fortunate few, within the elite inner
circle of the ANC. A few blacks are getting richer and richer, while the
masses out there are getting poorer and poorer. The DA will rectify this
wrongdoing.

For the benefit of the hon Ainslie, I agree that apartheid was wrong, that
is why we did away with it. He should ask the hon Manie Schoeman, who is
now a member of the ANC. [Interjections.]

We will see to it that corruption, fraud and bribery get crunched and that
the ordinary people share in the benefits of economic empowerment and
privatisation. We will see to it that affirmative action is democratised
and based on a process of adding value to existing expertise, fast-tracking
the promotion of opportunities for members of previously disadvantaged
communities. We will see to it that appointments and promotions take place
on merit and not on nepotism. We will restore dignity to the ordinary
citizen yearning for the opportunity to provide for his family, without
having to resort to criminality and begging for favours. [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Chairperson, the Road Accident Fund is directly connected
with what happens on our roads and streets, because claims are made against
it. It is therefore the appropriate structure to be involved in the
Government's Arrive Alive campaign, particularly now that the campaign has
been extended into a year-round effort. Where the money will come from, is
another matter.

The Bill authorises the Road Accident Fund to make financial contributions
to road safety programmes and projects which have been approved by the
Minister. I just want to mention that the intention is that provinces must
remain responsible for road safety. The Arrive Alive campaign, via the Road
Accident Fund, is to budget funds for the provinces as a supplement to the
existing budgets for road safety. The Road Accident Fund money is supposed
to be additional to what the provinces budget for road safety. Is there not
a danger that the provinces will be inclined to reduce their own budget
spending on road safety? I just thought I would mention that to the
Minister.

We have no problem with the amending Bill itself. The UDM supports it. I
would like to point out, though, that one of the facts that we must take
cognisance of is that there are 6,73 million licensed and registered
vehicles on our roads today. There are others as well that are not licensed
or registered. They travel over half a million kilometres of roads and
streets in South Africa. They are driven by something like 6 million
registered, licensed drivers and some unlicensed drivers as well. Of these
half a million km of roads and streets, about 268 million kilometres are
covered by the same vehicles and more than half of them are on rural roads.


This traffic leads to about 512 000 traffic accidents in a given year. That
is about 10 accidents in a full week, like the one we had on Monday. While
I am referring to that horrific accident, could I make an appeal to the
Minister that during peak hours in the mornings, priority should be given
to getting commuters to their workplaces. There is no place in peak hour
traffic in the mornings for heavily laden trucks. Business can wait between
the hours of 06:30 and 08:30 in the mornings, to allow the commuters to get
to work on time. We should ban trucks from the roads between those hours in
the mornings.

It is worth noting that between 80% and 90% of all accidents on the roads
can be ascribed to driver failure. Driver failure simply means that drivers
fail to use our roads and streets with the necessary care and attention. We
are given to understand ... [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF welcomes the Road Accident Fund
Amendment Bill, as it aims to facilitate financial contributions to road
safety projects, such as the Arrive Alive campaign.

This is a much-needed Bill as there are far too many accidents on our
roads, especially during the festive period. These accidents are caused by
reckless driving, speeding and drunken driving. By working closely with the
Arrive Alive campaign, we will be able to reduce and prevent the number of
accidents occurring.

The Road Accident Fund's investment in projects can be effectively used
towards developing a business plan with the provinces, as well as investing
in traffic law enforcement, breathalyzers and speed cameras. The MF
supports the Road Accident Fund Amendment Bill.

Mrs T P SHILUBANA: Chairperson, I do not want to waste my time by
responding to what the hon Dr Odendaal has said. The facts were not well
digested. As already mentioned by the Minister, the Bill seeks to amend the
Road Accident Fund Act of 1996, in order to authorise the fund to make
financial contributions to road safety projects and programmes, as approved
by the Minister.

Since the start of the Arrive Alive road safety campaign, which the
Minister announced in October 2000 would be a year-round programme from
November 2000 onwards, statistics have shown that accidents and fatalities
have been reduced. Over the period December 2000 to January 2001, a total
of 1 152 persons were killed in 867 fatal road accidents involving 945
vehicles. This is 140 or 10,8% less persons than during the same two months
of the previous year. The number of fatal accidents decreased by 82, which
is 8,6%, and the number of vehicles involved in these accidents decreased
by 309, which is 24,6%. We therefore believe that the contribution of the
RAF to the Arrive Alive campaign will help reduce road fatalities.

The RAF is facing major financial challenges. While contributing to the
Arrive Alive campaign may seem like an additional burden, it is in fact an
important measure that can lessen the financial drain on the fund. By
spending money on the prevention of road accidents, the fund can actually
save money.

Funding is not the only RAF issue that has been in the news over the last
few years. The police have been investigating the alleged fraudulent abuse
of the fund by certain lawyers. I do not know whether Dr Odendaal has not
heard about that. There is also the Judge Satchwell commission which is
looking into the character of the fund and its sustainability.

In the last weeks an internal memorandum from the RAF's committee for
transformation has surfaced in the media. According to the reports, this
committee has instructed branches of the RAF to deal only with black
attorneys and medical specialists. The ANC obviously strongly supports
affirmative action measures. However, the memorandum from the Road Accident
Fund commission for transformation appears to apply affirmative action in a
narrow and perhaps an unconstitutional way. The ANC welcomes the assurances
of the chairperson of the fund, Percy Naidoo, that the memorandum had not
been authorised by the RAF board and that the whole matter was under
review.

The ANC supports the Road Accident Fund Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson and hon members, I would like to
thank the portfolio committee and its chair for supporting the Bill. I also
want to thank all members who participated in the debate, and the House for
supporting the Bill.
During the course of this discussion, a number of genuine concerns were
raised. Firstly, is the R50 million per annum paid by the board a good
investment? My view is that if this contribution helps to spread awareness,
strengthen law enforcement, improve communications and thereby help reduce
the number of accidents on our roads, then it is certainly a good
investment. I was asked whether I can confirm certain figures and I am
unable to do so. I have not looked at the figures, but I do think that if
there is a significant reduction in accidents, then it would follow that
this amount has been a good investment.

A second concern which has been raised - which I also believe is a genuine
concern by members on all sides of the House - is the financial state of
the Road Accident Fund. It is a matter which also concerns me. We are
having discussions with the hon the Minister of Finance about the matter,
so as to ensure that the unhealthy state of the finances of the fund can be
properly addressed on a sustainable basis.

A third concern which has been raised is whether there are individuals -
lawyers and others - who are profiteering from the fund and whether there
is fraud, which we cannot tolerate. I support the view that action should
be taken against any individual engaged in fraud and corruption. If our
attention is drawn to any such activity, then we will not hesitate to
report the matter to the law-enforcement authorities.

Another concern that was raised was whether there is a conflict of
interest. Again we will not sit idly by if we discover that there is a
conflict of interest. The hon Farrow is quite correct in drawing my
attention to the issue of a conflict of interest, which has been of concern
to him. At the time when we looked at the matter, we did not think that
there was a conflict of interest, even though we thought there was a
potential for a conflict of interest. Obviously, we will look into the
matter continuously and if it appears that there is a conflict of interest,
we will not hesitate to raise the matter and report back to Parliament.

The fourth concern that was raised was the article which appeared in the
Mail & Guardian, which reported that the Road Accident Fund intends
employing only black people in certain positions. Our policy is not to
exclude persons or any group from employment, though we would like to see
affirmative action policies vigorously implemented. There has been a
situation in the RAF where people have benefited from the fund for many
years and continue to benefit. It just so happens, these people appear to
come from the white section. Whether they were lawyers or employed in other
capacities, they did very well out of the fund. I know that it is the
policy of this new board to address that particular problem and ensure that
those inequalities are eradicated.

We support the board in this regard. We are certain that the chair of the
board, who is a man of the highest integrity, will ensure that he
implements programmes that are consistent with our Constitution. At the
same time, we are saying that we are not excluding whites from
appointments. I would say that, on merit, people such as the hon Odendaal
would never qualify for appointment anywhere. So if he were to leave
Parliament, I know that he probably has a lot to fall back on. If he were
to rely on a job in the RAF, he would unfortunately never qualify.
[Interjections.]

The next concern which was raised is the commission being headed by Judge
Satchwell. I just wanted to say that I have every confidence in her and in
her integrity. I am also anxious that she should submit a report as quickly
as possible, but we must rely on her judgment. She has undertaken to
deliver the report as soon as she has completed her investigations.

Lastly, I agree with the hon Slabbert that the issue of law enforcement
must be addressed. I think our law enforcement is inadequate and weak, and
it is an issue that I am taking up with the MECs when we meet in our Mincom
meeting on 18 June.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 18:45.
