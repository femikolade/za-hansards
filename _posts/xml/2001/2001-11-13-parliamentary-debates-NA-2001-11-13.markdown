                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms M C LOBE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting  day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes a report that a 13-year-old girl was raped  by  her  father  in
       Mpumalanga, and that her mother and the  victim  are  afraid  to  lay
       charges  against  the  father  who  has  threatened  to  leave   them
       penniless;


  (2) notes that a three-year-old girl  was  butchered  and  stuffed  in  a
       bucket in Alexandra;


  (3) believes that child abuse, child rape and violence against women  and
       children is barbaric behaviour which must be uprooted in our society;
       and


  (4) calls on all communities to work with the police to fight  this  evil
       and to ensure that perpetrators of these cowardly acts are brought to
       book.

[Applause.]

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the words of former NP leader F W de Klerk, on 3 June 1996, col
       2011  in  Hansard,  on  his  party's  withdrawal  from  the  previous
       Government of National Unity:


         Continued participation would be equivalent to detention on a  kind
         of political death  row.  The  survival  of  multiparty  democracy,
         which  depends  on  the  existence  of  a   strong   and   credible
         opposition, was being threatened by our continued participation  in
         the Government of National Unity.


  (2)  further  notes  that  Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk  now  believes  that
       opposition  to  the  Government  can  only  come  from   within   the
       suffocating embrace of the ANC; and


  (3) calls on Mr Van Schalkwyk to explain why.

[Interjections.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Chairperson ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Can all members who are  standing  now
take their seats!

Mr V B NDLOVU: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the SAPS  in  KwaZulu-Natal  on  their  good  work  and
       excellent success in apprehending 294 criminals within  a  period  of
       three months;


  (2) acknowledges the shocking conditions that members of the police force
       are often faced with, battling against brutality in  crime  in  which
       the police themselves often have to pay with their lives; and


  (3) encourages the police to  participate  in  more  and  more  of  these
       targeted campaigns to root out crime in our communities.

Ms N E NGALEKA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  schoolchildren from Meadowlands delivered food  and  clothes  in
           Ingwavuma, KwaZulu-Natal; and


       (b)  these children made huge sacrifices by saving money  to  deliver
           clothes for Aids orphans;


  (2) believes that this act of solidarity is significant in  reviving  the
       spirit of ubuntu amongst our people;


  (3) commends the schoolchildren from Meadowlands for this heroic act; and


  (4) calls on all people, young and old, to emulate this example.

[Applause.]
Dr R T RHODA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the fast and effective action taken  by  the  New  NP  MEC  for
       Social Services  and  Poverty  Relief  in  the  Western  Cape,  David
       Malatsi, and his department in the light of the following:


       (a)   five  armed  men  robbed  a  pension  paypoint  in  Khayelitsha
           yesterday morning, stealing an estimated R250 000; and


       (b)  despite the robbery, MEC Malatsi's department managed to pay out
           the remaining pensioners two hours later; and


  (2) congratulates MEC Malatsi and his department on their  commitment  to
       serving the senior citizens of the Western Cape,  and  further  urges
       the SAPS to leave no stone unturned in finding the perpetrators.

[Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that there have already been several matric  examination  leaks
       this year;


  (2) further notes that the Director-General of Education is  reported  to
       have said that the  Department  of  Education  is  operating  on  the
       assumption that leaks have occurred in all five national papers;


  (3) expresses its disgust that despite promises to the contrary, security
       measures have failed, and that belated decisions to improve  security
       amount to closing the stable doors after the horses have bolted; and


  (4) strongly disputes the director-general's  assertion  that  the  leaks
       have not had a negative impact on the examination as a whole.

Mr B MTHEMBU: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes  that  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Minerals  and  Energy,  Susan
       Shabangu, announced that 5 932 houses, 15 schools and 5 clinics  were
       connected to electricity in Gapungula, Northern Province;


  (2) believes that this splendid achievement is a further  advancement  in
       the provision of a better life for  all  and  the  uplifting  of  the
       standard of living of our people in the rural areas;


  (3) commends the Ministry and the Department of Minerals and  Energy  for
       making electricity available to the people of Gapungula; and


  (4) welcomes this ground-breaking achievement and sees it as  a  positive
       outcome of the Integrated Rural Development Strategy of  the  ANC-led
       Government.

[Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members,  can  you  please  lower
your voices! I have no problem with the fact that people are  excited  about
something else, but please, let us lower our voices.

Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the Concerned Communities for Education  on  organising
       the peaceful march to Parliament this morning;


  (2) commends all those Christian parents, leaders and  young  people  who
       chose to use their constitutional right to demonstrate, to picket and
       to present petitions;


  (3)  notes  with  great  concern  another  unjustified  attack   by   the
       Minister of Education,  Prof  Kader  Asmal,  on  concerned  Christian
       parents when he called them fundamentalists;


  (4) further  notes  that  the  same  Prof  Asmal  viciously  attacked  an
       interdenominational gathering of Christians who were gathered at  the
       Newlands  Stadium  for  prayer  and  celebration,  calling   them   a
       ``sectarian body'';


  (5) notes that it was only after he was rebuked by Dr Allan Boesak  in  a
       letter from prison, that  he  expressed  regret  for  the  intolerant
       remarks he made about people who chose to celebrate Human Rights  Day
       differently;


  (6) calls on Prof Asmal to stop his unnecessary and  unjustified  attacks
       on Christians who differ with him; and


  (7) advises all Bible-believing Christians not to allow Prof Kader  Asmal
       to intimidate them into silence.

[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Swiss media has revealed that there was  collaboration
       between the Swiss secret  service  chief,  Peter  Regli,  and  Wouter
       Basson on biological and chemical weapons during the apartheid era;


  (2) that Chris Thirion, a former South African  secret  service  general,
       has confirmed the existence of the agreement;


  (3) that the PAC demands a comprehensive investigation with access to all
       relevant Swiss and South African archives, including the archives  of
       financial institutions that propped up apartheid, so that the  extent
       of the support by Swiss institutions can be determined; and


  (4) notes that -


       (a)  in this regard the PAC reiterates its call for the  cancellation
           of the apartheid debt and demands reparations for the victims of
           apartheid in this country from all institutions  which  financed
           apartheid; and


       (b)  the PAC fully supports the Jubilee South Africa Campaign on  the
           apartheid debt and reparations.

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the statement made by the Leader of  the  Opposition,  the  hon
       Tony Leon, that ``more babies will die of  HIV/Aids  in  the  Western
       Cape'' when the ANC becomes part of government in the province;
  (2) believes that the statement by the hon Tony Leon smacks of racism and
       flows from his erroneous understanding of the HIV/Aids pandemic as  a
       black African issue, and that his speech is designed to demonise  the
       ANC in the eyes of his conservative white followers;


  (3) further believes that it is irresponsible for a public representative
       like the hon Tony Leon to  make  statements  that  perpetuate  racial
       stereotypes and that his assertion amounts to hate speech;


  (4) condemns the statement made by the hon Tony Leon; and


  (5)  calls  on  him  to  withdraw  this  irresponsible  and   reactionary
       statement.

Mrs G M BORMAN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  that  President  Mbeki  continues  to  attract   unfavourable
       publicity in influential newspapers and  journals  around  the  world
       because of his unusual views concerning HIV/Aids;


  (2) further notes that South Africa's good  name  and  reputation  suffer
       because of ill-advised pronouncements by the President; and


  (3) resolves that President Mbeki should be  requested  to  refrain  from
       making any further comment about HIV/Aids  and  the  causes  of  Aids
       other than to promote programmes aimed at saving South Africa's young
       people from this scourge.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Department of Justice and  Constitutional  Development
       is currently investigating more  than  114  cases  of  theft,  fraud,
       corruption and other offences allegedly committed by its officials;


  (2) further notes that the department is also investigating a further  74
       such cases flowing from  its  newly-established  Anti-Corruption  and
       Fraud Hotline;


  (3) calls on the department to  conduct  these  investigations  with  the
       utmost vigour and determination to root out fraud and  corruption  at
       all levels of the department; and


  (4)  further  calls  on  the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional
       Development to keep the House  informed  of  the  progress  with  the
       investigation.

Mr J D ARENDSE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with approval and appreciation  the  generous  donation  of  65
       hectares of land for housing 12 families by Mr Roger Romah, a  farmer
       from Hartebeespoort;


  (2) further notes that low-cost houses have already  been  completed  and
       eight more will be completed soon;


  (3) believes that -


       (a)  Mr Roger Romah's actions are an example of  the  new  patriotism
           needed to reconstruct and heal our country; and


       (b)  to deal with poverty, hunger  and  deprivation,  South  Africans
           must rally to the call by our President for unity in action  for
           change; and


  (4) congratulates Mr Roger Romah for his good act and calls on all  South
       Africans to emulate this example.

[Applause.]

Mrs A VAN WYK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House, despite the commendable  smooth  running  of  the  matric
  examinations in most provinces -


  (1) notes with concern that the nationally-set matric examination  papers
       have been leaked, especially in view of the fact that this will  have
       a negative impact on the credibility of the benchmarking process;


  (2) furthermore expresses its concern  about  the  fact  that  pupils  in
       KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng wrote a back-up paper, thereby  effectively
       negating the claim that there  was  a  uniform  examination  in  five
       subjects; and


  (3)  therefore  urges  the  Minister  of  Education  and  the  provincial
       departments to  tighten  security,  especially  with  regard  to  the
       transportation of papers.

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the United Nations estimates that more  than  10  000  new
       cases of HIV/Aids are diagnosed on the African continent every day;


  (2) further notes with alarm that the United Nations is  predicting  that
       there may be 13 million Aids orphans in Africa  by  the  end  of  the
       year; and


  (3) calls on President Mbeki and other leaders  of  Africa  to  make  the
       fight against HIV/Aids a major priority in their  efforts  to  uplift
       the continent with the  New  Africa  Initiative,  realising  that  no
       upliftment programme will succeed if we  endow  this  continent  with
       millions of HIV/Aids orphans.

[Applause.]

                     MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms N L HLANGWANA: Chairperson, comrades, hon members, Minister  of  Finance,
Comrade Trevor, I want to thank the Minister  and  the  Deputy  Minister  of
Finance for their support during the past two weeks, and  also  the  members
of the Joint Budget Committee for their commitment and hard work during  the
time of trial.

I am also honoured to be taking part  in  this  debate  on  the  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement of 2001, as a Joint  Budget  Committee  member,  for
the first time in the history of this Parliament. We are very proud  to  say
that we have embarked on a new course of action which gives Parliament  more
insight into the budgeting cycle;  ensures  that  our  Budget  reflects  the
needs of our people and that the spending of Government is in line with  the
policy  priorities  of  the  departments;  and  ensures  that  we  hold  the
executive accountable in accordance with the Public Finance  Management  Act
whilst we give them the ability to perform their functions.

Whilst we cannot effect any  changes  in  the  allocations  of  the  current
Budget, we can significantly  influence  allocations  over  the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. It is also important to note that,  in  future,  this
Parliament will have the opportunity  to  engage  at  the  early  stages  of
drafting the Budget. Despite the teething problems and  challenges  that  we
faced as a new committee in the earlier part of our work, our  deliberations
over the past two weeks have reinforced the need for the  existence  of  the
Budget committee.

Having  engaged  with  various  departments  and  civil   society   in   our
deliberations, we  would  like  to  reinforce  the  following:  Firstly,  we
applaud  the  broad  Budget  theme  of  alleviating  poverty  and   reducing
vulnerability as this can only help to reverse the inequalities among  those
who are economically deprived. Here, we are talking  about  the  poorest  of
the poor, especially those in the rural areas.

Secondly, we are finally reaping ``the sweet fruit of  liberty'',  that  the
Minister referred to in February 2001, of the five years  of  discipline  in
the form of a stable macroeconomic foundation to enable service delivery  in
accordance with spending priorities that were identified in the  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement.

Thirdly, our export figures are positive and thus  improve  the  balance  of
payments. Inflation projections are in line with the Reserve Bank's  target.
Interest rates are lower than they were two years ago and the impact of  the
reduction of income tax to lower and middle  income  earners  will  help  to
stimulate spending and saving  which  will  result  in  the  growth  of  our
economy.

The only cloud on the horizon is the continued  depreciation  of  the  rand.
But, given that our currency is grouped with the other  emerging  economies,
many of which are experiencing even deeper depreciations, we are  in  better
shape than other similar economies because of  the  low  inflation  rate.  A
positive spin-off to the weak rand is the expansion  of  our  exports  which
will also contribute to positive growth figures.

The integrated and co-ordinated spending of departments in their  priorities
in cluster form, should be able to help us towards  achieving  reduction  in
poverty levels. In this way, we  can  directly  target  the  plight  of  the
poorest of our people. In the social services  sector,  in  particular,  co-
ordination between social development, education and health  will  certainly
address the prevention and cure of HIV/Aids  and  provide  relief  to  those
infected and affected by the disease. We welcome the increase in  the  child
support grant as children are amongst the most  vulnerable  members  of  our
society.  Enabling  free  delivery  of  services  by  municipalities  should
further assist in alleviating  poverty  levels.  The  restructuring  of  the
local government should help to build  capacity  in  order  to  fulfil  that
spending priority.

The  emphasis  on  investment  and  maintenance  in  infrastructure  is   an
important priority of Government that will not only  enable  more  efficient
and effective service delivery,  but  will  also  contribute  to  employment
creation and growth. This objective is an improvement on the past policies.

We were particularly pleased with the positive comments  from  organisations
like Idasa, FFC, Sacob, Cosatu and an economist from Standard Bank.  Broadly
speaking, they all praised the macroeconomic achievements in the face  of  a
projected economic slowdown.

Now that the  scene  has  been  set,  we  should  progress  further  towards
delivery of  services.  That  is  the  area  where  the  oversight  role  of
Parliament  is  important.  The  presentations  on  the  MTBPS   were   very
informative and helped to assist us to perform  our  constitutional  mandate
and oversight function.

In conclusion, I would like to indicate that it is very  important  that  we
should note that the work that we went through and the  whole  process  were
very progressive. There was a lot of  co-operation  from  all  the  members,
even during the hearings. I must indicate that we  appreciate  the  response
of Ministers and their departments whom we requested to  come  and  give  us
information so that we would be able to perform our  duties.  We  appreciate
their willingness to talk to us. We  commend  all  the  civil  servants  and
everybody who came and gave us information that helped us to  finalise  this
work. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Just before I call the  next  speaker,
may I indicate to members of the House that this is a very important  debate
- a debate that is taking place in this House for the first  time  since  we
started in 1994. It is quite crucial that  members  should  give  those  who
participate in the debate today a chance to be heard. I appreciate the  fact
that you want to have some little meetings in the House, but if  you  intend
doing so, could you please do it very softly and allow members to be  heard.
I would like to ask all the Chief  Whips  please  to  assist  the  Chair  in
getting the noise under control.

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson, I - along, I imagine, with the hon the  Minister
and most South Africans -  experience  mixed  feelings  when  reviewing  the
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement: pleasure and  a  sense  of  achievement
that we have macroeconomic stability -  let  us  not  underrate  either  the
importance of that or the difficulty in achieving it - of which we  can  all
be satisfied and proud. Pleasure and a sense of achievement that, thanks  to
that stability, South Africa is better placed to weather the current  global
economic slowdown and turbulence than most  other  countries.  Yet,  at  the
same time, one has a sense of frustration  that  despite  the  macroeconomic
stability, the fixed investment and economic growth at the  levels  that  we
need in order to reduce unemployment and poverty, remain elusive.

As long ago as February 1995, President Mandela highlighted  the  importance
of growth and investment when opening Parliament, and I quote:


  The  Government  considers  it  a  matter  of  critical  importance  that
  everything should be done to encourage a climate conducive  to  sustained
  and high levels of economic growth. We are therefore ready to  deal,  and
  have been dealing with all matters that are relevant  to  this  goal,  in
  particular to  ensure  the  creation  of  an  investor-friendly  climate.
  Everything must be done to encourage a significant upward movement in the
  rate of investment ...

In August of this year, President Mbeki's  economic  adviser,  Prof  Wiseman
Nkuhlu, was more frank than most when he addressed a seminar.  In  a  report
in the Business Day of 31 August 2001,  he  said  that  there  were  serious
shortcomings in economic policy and its implementation.

He further said South Africa had  maintained  macroeconomic  stability,  but
now needed better incentives to attract investment and  job  creation.  Lack
of incentive to invest could be due to price  levels,  labour  laws,  skills
and other factors. In making decisions on policy,  Government  had  to  deal
with what was in the minds of investors. He continued:


  The reality is that they control the purse and you have to  do  something
  to address their concerns.

He said the  fact  of  the  matter  was  that  our  domestic  investors  and
foreigners were not investing in the country. The lack of success  of  small
businesses in creating jobs showed that this sector also  lacked  sufficient
incentives. He said:


  In many countries this sector is the engine of job creation and  this  is
  not happening. This is a serious shortcoming.

He concluded that we should face that reality, bite  the  bullet  and  admit
that there were, possibly, things they did  not  like  and  if  we  did  not
change them, we would just continue being poor and  would  not  improve.  He
said:


  You cannot just question the problem, and say that you are  dealing  with
  the problem.

This raises the difficulty I have in budget and other  economic  debates  in
this House.  There  is  very  little  said  about  what  the  South  African
Government should and should not be doing. It is much  easier  to  point  at
external factors beyond our control - and this is often very valid  -  which
make our lives more difficult and to ignore  problems  of  our  own  making.
When opposition members offer criticism and make suggestions, they are  more
often than not treated with disdain and contempt,  and  the  opportunity  is
frequently used to unleash personal invective.

Let me illustrate this with  an  example.  Two  weeks  ago,  speaking  at  a
dinner, the Minister is quoted as saying that South Africa could  no  longer
afford to produce  thousands  of  graduates  for  the  international  labour
market. Thousands of skilled people left the country each year resulting  in
the importation of scarce skills  at  high  cost  to  the  economy  and  the
country to fill the vacuum created by those leaving.

In the Budget debate in March, I drew attention to the problem of a loss  of
skills through emigration and raised the question of what  the  causes  were
and what we could do about them. In his reply,  the  Minister,  rather  than
responding to the issues raised,  simply  became  personally  insulting  and
suggested that we must forget about our European past. [Interjections.]

Ironically, he then suggested that the invocation by the  hon  Feinstein  to
our patriotic  activism,  should  become  our  lodestar  with  this  budget.
Perhaps we should pause for a moment to ask  whether  Feinstein's  patriotic
activism protected him when he refused to go along with an attempted  cover-
up by the ANC of the arms deal corruption. If so, why was he  made  to  feel
so  uncomfortable  and  isolated   that   he   resigned   from   Parliament?
[Interjections.]

We welcome the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement as a useful  contribution
to forward planning, sound budgeting and as  a  basis  for  debate.  But  we
would remind the Government of President Mandela's  assurance  that,  and  I
quote:


  ... everything should be done to encourage ... economic growth.

[Applause.]

Mr L ZITA: Chairperson and Deputy President, during the two weeks  in  which
we were involved  in  this  Joint  Budget  Committee,  the  hon  Andrew  was
present. What was most alarming was that for the whole two  weeks  in  which
we were there, he was quiet. He did not say a word for the whole two  weeks.
It is interesting that today, in front of the whole country, he talks  about
proposals. [Interjections.]

On the question of emigration, it would be useful if the DP  could  issue  a
statement, as the head of the Jewish community did,  encouraging  the  white
youth in particular not to leave  the  country.  That  would  be  a  welcome
contribution. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: We are doing that!

Mr L ZITA: You are not doing enough!

South Africa is a developing country. Any developing country has to  address
the challenge of development, improve the capacity  and  efficiency  of  its
economy and move, as smoothly as possible, from an agricultural  society  to
a  predominantly  urban  society.  In  most  of  the  developing  countries,
modernisation was not an organic process led by indigenous  people.  It  was
primarily in the interest of  the  dominant  colonial  classes,  with  total
disregard for the interest of the oppressed people.

Though our colonisers stayed within  the  same  borders  as  us,  they  were
equally as callous about our fate as their European-based counterparts.  Now
that we are the captains of the ship, we must  ensure  that  development  is
fundamentally informed by the interests of the people. We  have  to  combine
economic development and redistribution.

This  challenge  assumes  particular  difficulties   in   the   context   of
globalisation. The  interdependence  of  economies  results  in  them  being
influenced by the developments in other countries. This does not cancel  out
the role of the state, but limits its  possibilities.  Therefore  the  state
has to be both strategic and flexible.

Through  this  budget  statement,  we  as  the  ANC  can  say  that  we  are
consolidating our capacity to use the state. This budget  statement  can  do
this, because a number of fundamental changes have occurred  in  our  fiscal
management and in the restructuring of the economy.

In 1996 we embarked on a prudent fiscal stance to protect our  currency.  As
the ANC, we were also quite aware that we had to  keep  inflation  down.  We
now have an inflation rate that is  in  decline,  which  means  that  prices
overall are going down. Therefore, more money is being  put  back  into  the
pockets of poor people. At the same time, we have  the  capacity  to  expand
our spending in real terms. Therefore, there  is  an  emerging  expansionary
orientation that is necessary for growth.

In 1994 we assumed  responsibility  of  a  very  inefficient  and  protected
economy. The relaxation of the tariff  regime  intensified  competition  and
forced many of our industries to restructure, bring in new technologies  and
look beyond the  confines  of  our  domestic  markets.  Improved  levels  of
productivity  and  the  depreciation  of  the  rand   have   increased   our
competitiveness. The depreciation can, of course, make it difficult  for  us
to import technology, which has to be bought in dollars. But  the  challenge
of translating these improvements into jobs still has to be fulfilled.

Despite these shortcomings, we project  in  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement that we are likely to survive the present global recession  better
than many other emerging  economies.  In  the  short  to  medium  term,  our
economy can even register a  reasonable  growth.  Taxation  reinforces  this
expansionary  approach.  Tax  cuts  for  the  middle  and  working   classes
stimulate consumer demands and enhance the fairness of the tax system.

At the opening of Parliament this year, President Mbeki announced that  more
attention should go to the micro economy, to  complement  the  consolidation
of the macroeconomic achievements. This has to be done so that gains in  the
structure of the economy can be constantly strengthened.  To  achieve  this,
spending on economic infrastructure continues to grow. This is done  through
greater spending in the maintenance of water  and  road  infrastructure,  as
well  as  additional  spending  of  R350  million  in  the   electrification
programme.

As part of reducing costs in the economy, this budget seeks to  improve  the
public  transport  system.  Key  initiatives  in   this   regard   are   the
rehabilitation  of  our  national  roads,  new   road   networks   and   the
refurbishment of the stock of the SA Rail Commuter Corporation.

Land reform initiatives also receive further funding. This  is  designed  to
give a boost to the land restitution programme, as  well  as  to  strengthen
agricultural  infrastructure  such  as  communal  dipping  tanks  and  small
irrigation schemes.  In  the  same  vein,  this  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement complements municipal initiatives through supporting the  delivery
of a basic level of essential municipal services.

Though these are specific initiatives  that  are  designed  to  improve  the
competition of our manufacturing base  and  seek  to  draw  in  the  private
sector  in  job  creation  initiatives,  this  takes   the   form   of   the
rehabilitation and extension of road and rail networks such as  the  Lubombo
SDI and the Skuifraam Dam here in the Western Cape. The flexibility  in  the
state  is  also  reinforced  by  the  institutional   innovations   we   are
introducing, such as the integrated development plans for local  government.
These will further improve the state's capacity  to  respond  to  the  local
needs of the people.

The Joint Budget Committee is  pleased  with  the  direction  in  which  our
budget is going. But, as  a  committee,  we  are  aware  of  the  levels  of
destitution that many in our country experience. It is in  this  light  that
we, as a committee, express support for and anticipate  with  keen  interest
the results of the Taylor Commission on the comprehensive  overhaul  of  our
social security system.

In the light of this intelligent, flexible, and yet strategic framework,  it
is not surprising that all stakeholders who appeared before us were, if  not
excited about, comfortable with the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement.
Indeed a ray of hope is shining on the horizon. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Mr Chairperson, I  am
happy to participate in this ground-breaking  debate,  as  it  concerns  the
management of our budgets, policy options and  the  imperatives  facing  our
country, from the fiscal perspective.

The  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill  and  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement are two very important documents that are being  put  out  to  the
public and to the nation today. They are  important  to  everyone  in  South
Africa and, in the words of our Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor Manuel:


  The 2001 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement outlines matters  that  will
  shape the next years of our medium-term expenditure framework.

As a policy statement this debate becomes very important, not only  for  the
National Assembly but for  every  Government  department,  be  it  national,
provincial  or  local.  Organised  labour,  civil  society  and   commercial
entities ought to concern themselves  deeply  about  this  2001  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement because, more than anything else we have debated  in
this Chamber,  it  determines  whether  or  not  we  will  be  on  a  rising
trajectory in the  year  2002-03,  and  even  possibly  beyond.  The  Public
Finance Management Act sets strict limits  to  the  kinds  of  spending  for
which additional funds may be appropriated,  and  roll-overs  and  virements
allowed.

Therefore,  there  is  much  to  welcome  in  the  new  medium-term   budget
framework. It has the hallmarks of  modern  fiscal  discipline,  a  stronger
governance framework underpinned by the Public Finance Management  Act,  the
advantages of better collection of revenue by Sars and, most importantly,  a
focus on addressing the needs of the most disadvantaged and excluded in  our
society. There are considerable  advantages  in  having  a  clear  long-term
framework which gives our global partners the assurance  that  South  Africa
is going to stick to its fiscal guns, so to speak.

However, I would like to say that this debate must  not  just  end  here  in
this Parliament. It has to  reach  out  into  every  household,  into  every
factory, into every community, because it is these policies that  shape  the
situation of benefits, the situation of advantage for  all  communities.  We
are happy that the Department Of Finance is allowing this  possibility  that
the people's representatives can participate directly  in  establishing  the
basis on which expenditure will be structured in this economy.

However, there are more cogent reasons why I support  this  debate.  We  are
now living in a globalising world. This world is  insisting  on  sustainable
development in terms of social responsibility on the part of  factories  and
employers, as well as environmental sustainability in terms of how  we  grow
our crops, through integrated personnel management, so  that  there  are  no
traces of  dangerous  residues  in  our  vegetables  and  products,  how  we
manufacture our garments, what type of substances and chemicals are used  in
leather tanning, for example. All these issues are now impinging on the  new
world culture in terms of sustainable development.

Countries in the South, which have enjoyed certain advantages such as  cheap
labour, will soon find that lower costs are  not  enough  as  a  competitive
advantage. It is also about being responsible people,  about  responsibility
for the environment. This creates  competitive  advantage  and  we  need  to
factor this into our budget planning, because unless we  give  attention  to
institutions of higher  learning,  to  creating  human  resources  that  can
create new technologies for our industries, technologies that will  make  it
possible for us  to  have  access  to  the  markets  of  the  industrialised
countries of the  West,  we  are  not  going  to  maintain  our  competitive
advantage. For instance, even in the area  of  energy  our  low-cost,  cheap
coal-burning for electricity  will  very  soon  stop  having  a  competitive
advantage, because investors are now even insisting on clean energy.

So the whole tide is changing. It is no longer the  comfortable  zone  where
one could pay low wages and make huge  profits.  Countries  like  Bangladesh
have learned, very painfully, that this path, this  trajectory  of  progress
and economic development, is very short-sighted.

I welcome this debate, because it gives us an  opportunity  besides  punting
our own departments in terms of the budget committee  of  Ministers,  trying
to get extra money. We are being forced to look at  the  policy  imperatives
that are  underpinning  thinking  and  development  in  our  new  democracy.
[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Mr Chairperson, hon Deputy President,  hon  Minister  and  hon
members, a significant aspect of this statement is that  the  Government  is
not deviating from the policy of an inflation target which  currently  falls
within the range of 3% to 3,6%. This must also be seen  against  the  global
economic slowdown and the continuing weakness of the  rand  against  the  US
dollar. The depreciating rand raises the cost of  important  capital  goods,
but the fact remains that the Cabinet  has  decided  that  the  target  will
remain at an annual 3% to 3,6% and this is, in fact, commendable.

The South  African  economy  can  be  broadly  categorised  as  an  emerging
commodity-driven economy. The weakening of the rand  over  the  past  twelve
months has increased exports and  revenue  derived  from  secondary  tax  on
companies and tax profits in the mining sector.  Especially  platinum  mines
have contributed to total revenue earnings.  The  increase  of  our  GDP  is
expected to rise from 2,6% in 2001 to an  average  of  3,3%  over  the  next
three years. There is also relief for lower and middle-income taxpayers.

Allow me to mention  that  two  fundamental  changes  occurred  in  our  tax
structure, namely the  change  from  a  source-based  to  a  residence-based
income tax, and capital gains tax. A  prerequisite  for  sustained  economic
growth is foreign direct investment. Tax stability coupled with  attractive,
competitive tax structures, are also of critical  importance  in  attracting
foreign economic investment.

The announcement by the hon the Minister of Finance of a holistic review  of
the current tax regime for retirement savings is welcomed and long  overdue.
The proviso that the taxation  of  public  benefit  organisations  to  which
taxpayers may make deductible  donations  was  widened  will  alleviate  the
financial position of a number of NGOs that deal with the wellbeing  of  the
less materially privileged members of our society.

A number of concessions relating to the recently  introduced  capital  gains
tax will allow a number of  companies  to  reorganise  themselves.  This  is
basically aimed at ensuring the efficient allocation of  capital,  and  will
have to be implemented in  this  fiscal  year.  Whether  it  will  have  the
desired effect to ease the burden to comply with  this  very  technical  and
complex tax is rather questionable.

One of the key spending areas in this Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement
is the social services cluster. It is extremely important - especially  with
regard to the increases. Allow me to mention  that  protection  goes  up  by
6,8%, economic services by 8,5% and administration services by 7,6%.  Grants
to tackle HIV/Aids through community-based care and life skills will  amount
to R110 million in 2001. It will increase  to  R320  million  in  2002/2003,
R420 million in 2003/2004 and R546 million in 2004/2005.

To conclude, the Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  is  a  representative
document that covers the policies that relate to  national,  provincial  and
municipal government, as well as NGOs and private  companies.  Allow  me  to
congratulate the hon the Minister and his officials on this excellent, user-
friendly document. The New NP supports the statement. [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Chairperson and hon members, may I first express a word  of
appreciation  on  the  establishment  of  the  budget  committee  which  has
reviewed the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement during the last  couple  of
days through hearings.

This engagement of a  parliamentary  committee  on  the  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement leads this country and this Parliament into a  new  era  of
evaluating and making inputs to improve the budget process. It  will  result
in better accountability and oversight, and bodes well  for  a  budget  that
bears the signature of general voters. It  is  a  vast  improvement  on  the
secretive  non-transparent  method  of  budgeting  that  this  country   was
subjected to under the previous regime.

One of the greatest challenges arising from the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement is that of insufficient capacity,  especially  at  provincial  and
local  government  levels,  to  spend  the  allocated  funds  on   earmarked
programmes. During the hearings of the budget committee, Idasa pointed  out,
for example, that up to September 2001  provinces  had  on  aggregate,  only
managed to spend approximately 29% of their capital  budgets.  In  contrast,
current spending by provinces at the same time seemed to be  on  track  with
47% of the aggregate budget. The same picture emerged  with  regard  to  the
spending of provincial conditional grants, where only 16,8% of these  grants
had been spent by September 2001.

In order to succeed in the implementation of successful  economic  policies,
we will have to find ways to improve the capacity to deliver,  and  also  to
create the necessary skills. There is a sense of urgency required. When  one
looks at trend lines over the  next  three  years,  we  would  suggest  that
attention be given to the following three issues.

Firstly, the need to reduce the current high levels of unemployment and  the
need to  create  jobs  for  new  entrants  to  the  labour  market  requires
innovative measures to be introduced. We believe that it is  especially  the
public sector that has an important role to play  in  this  regard,  and  we
would like to have the opportunity to discuss workable  and  viable  options
in this regard with the Government.

Secondly, small business development remains the engine of  growth  for  the
economy. It is  specially  this  sector,  if  handled  correctly,  that  can
stimulate domestic growth. It will not only empower people,  but  also  help
to create jobs.

Lastly, capital expenditure  by  national  Government  has  become  a  major
priority.  It  is  crucial  that  even  more   resources   be   devoted   to
infrastructure development. This trend line can be strengthened.  Again,  we
will be able to put positive proposals on  the  table  for  discussion.  The
final test will be that money will reach the target  that  it  is  earmarked
for. [Applause.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  just  before   the
following speaker takes the podium, I wish to recognise our elders who  have
visited Parliament today from an area of  Gauteng  province  called  Benoni.
They are seated in the public gallery. We welcome you to come and listen  to
discussions. [Applause.]

Ms B P SONJICA: Chairperson,  firstly,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  and
commend the role and work of a group of masters students in  economics  from
the University of the Western Cape led by a lady called Lesley who,  through
this process, had an opportunity to gain exposure  to,  participate  in  and
contribute to matters  of  budgeting  and  public  policy.  Hopefully,  this
experience will serve to widen their scope in making choices  about  shaping
their careers.

The theme of this budget, as already been expressed, is ``Reducing  poverty,
inequality and  vulnerability''.  This  is  an  expression  of  Government's
commitment to better the lives of poor people,  a  commitment  that  it  has
sought to stick to by increasing social spending in recent years.

I  will  be  speaking  about  the  allocations  for  provincial  and   local
governments respectively, which will be  getting  a  major  share  from  the
additional funds of the  2002  budget.  On  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement, the Government commits itself to an increase of  R4  billion  and
R5,4 billion  for  the  provinces  over  the  medium   term,   while   local
governments' baseline budgets will rise by 20,2% and 19,4% over the term.

Both provincial and local governments are key in realising the  Government's
objective of eradicating poverty  through  an  integrated  approach  in  the
delivery  of  services.  For  this  integrated  approach  to  succeed,   co-
ordination and co-operation are needed between departments  and  spheres  of
Government in line with the  integrated  rural  development  strategy.  This
strategy marks a departure from the way in which Government has  been  doing
things, and enhances  better  co-ordination  of  existing  resources  for  a
greater impact on growth and development.

Spending  will  therefore  be  aimed   at   investing   in   infrastructure,
maintenance and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure,  and  enhancement
of South Africa's economic growth. All these, it is hoped,  will  contribute
to job creation.

[Funding is also available for the development of rural areas. We are  happy
about it and also welcome it. We also welcome the increased  allocation  for
land, the reintroduction of animal dips, the development of rural roads  and
the provision of support to  emerging  farmers.  All  this  shows  that  the
Government cares about the plight of the poor. By providing services in  the
areas where people live, the Government also shows that it respects the  way
of life of the people.

Furthermore,  the  Government  has  committed  itself  to   increasing   the
allocation for the delivery of water, toilet facilities and  electricity  to
those who do not enjoy these services. Councillors must start  consolidating
their requests now so that there  are  no  delays  when  these  have  to  be
submitted. The Xhosas have a saying that goes: Procrastination is the  thief
of time.]

The Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  projects  an  allocation  of  R2,8
billion for provincial  infrastructure  grants  which  will  enhance  faster
delivery over the long term, which we also appreciate. We also  welcome  the
initiatives of the provinces to enter into  partnerships  with  the  private
sector. At this point I wish to take this opportunity  to  acknowledge  with
appreciation the involvement of the private sector  in  development,  as  we
all know the programme that Madiba is running. However, we  hope  that  such
partnerships will ensure transfer of skills from skilled to unskilled  South
Africans, as this will have positive results on  our  economy  in  the  long
term.

We welcome the move towards institutional and legislative reform to  improve
the capacity of provincial governments and  accelerate  the  pace  at  which
projects  are  rolled  out.  The   Medium-Term   Budget   Policy   Statement
acknowledges  the  transformational  challenges  that  are  faced  by  local
governments. These, to a certain extent, affected  the  smooth  transfer  of
funds, thus slowing down the process of delivery of much-needed services  to
the people.

To meet these challenges, the Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  projects
a faster growth on local government  allocations,  more  than  national  and
provincial governments respectively. However, it would be prudent to  ensure
that the capacity- building programme, especially for local  government,  is
implemented as soon  as  possible,  so  as  to  avoid  committing  the  same
mistakes that were committed before.

The introduction of the new budget format's improved reporting  requirements
that  will  ensure  that  municipalities  report  regularly  on  income  and
expenditure as well as on the outputs of this programme is  the  right  step
towards ensuring sound management. It is also necessary to establish  proper
accounting  mechanisms  in  situations  where   there   is   no   concurrent
functioning.

Municipal infrastructure grants will grow by 17%  per  year  over  the  next
three years, thus contributing to the provision of services.  The  equitable
share is projected to increase by 13,9% a year to R5,7 billion  by  2004-05.
The equitable share formula is  adjusted  to  take  account  of  free  basic
services  to  equalise  salaries  across  amalgamated  municipalities.  Most
importantly, a portion of the share targets physically weak  municipalities.
However, the objective is that these municipalities should  be  strengthened
and capacitated through institutional  reform  so  that  they  are  able  to
generate their own revenue in future.

In conclusion, the participation of people in all these processes cannot  be
over-emphasised. I see the light is flickering, but I want  to  conclude  by
quoting the President when he said:


  We are on course. Steadily the dark clouds of despair are lifting, giving
  way to our season of hope.

We support the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, Deputy  President,  Ministers  and  members,  the
ACDP welcomes the  medium-term  expenditure  framework.  The  South  African
economy has been performing admirably in weathering  the  negative  economic
fall-outs since the 11 September attack on America.

Our sound fiscal policies  are  leading  this  country  into  an  attractive
emerging market in terms of future investment. We, of  course,  cannot  wait
too patiently for a better future  for  our  nation.  We  must  aggressively
market this country more effectively. We have  successfully  played  to  the
tune of foreign imperatives,  but  have  not  been  equally  successful  and
aggressive in selling the potential benefits this country has to  offer  the
world. There is much room for improvement.

Inasmuch as we are  achieving  macroeconomic  success,  we  lag  desperately
behind in meeting our microeconomic objectives. It is  no  small  indictment
to admit that South Africa's poor  people  are  becoming  poorer.  Room  for
improvement starts here. It is not enough to measure  poverty  in  terms  of
social delivery standards only, even  if  there  has  been  certain  limited
improvement in this regard. We must also measure poverty in  relation  to  a
nation's perception of how well the  country  is  governed.  South  Africa's
foreign debt amounts to 19,7% of the GDP. We welcome this and  we  encourage
the Minister of Finance to further reduce the foreign debt.

The ACDP also welcomes the decline in interest rates.  The  prime  rate  has
fallen to 13%. I would like  to  say  to  Minister  Manuel  we  are  looking
forward to a future of a single digit interest rate and we  hope  that  this
will be achievable. We welcome the inflation target band of 3% to 6% and  we
hope that we will stay closer to 3% than to 6%. The  ACDP  is  heartened  by
the possibility that we can establish ourselves as a  great  nation  at  the
southern-most tip of Africa. Therefore, the ACDP supports  this  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, ten  aanvang  wil  ek  vir  die  agb
Minister  sê  die  VF  steun   hierdie   mediumtermynbegrotingsbeleid.   Die
werklikheid is dat hierdie mediumtermynbegrotingsbeleid ook goed is vir  die
makro-ekonomiese sfeer.
Met my beperkte tyd wil ek my egter toespits op Hoofstuk  5,  wat  spesifiek
oor die mediumtermynbestedingsraamwerk handel wat vir al  die  nasionale  en
provinsiale   sfere   van   regering   geld.   Met   betrekking   tot    die
beleidsprioriteite en die begrotings soos gestel in die dokument  word  daar
prioriteite gevestig ten  opsigte  van  werkskepping  en  die  heropbou  van
plaaslike regering deur gratis basiese dienste.

Ek wil vir die agb Minister sê dit is een ding om 'n goeie  raamwerk  en  'n
goeie beleid op 'n makrovlak te hê, maar die probleme ontstaan  wanneer  dit
kom by die plaaslike vlak waar dit uitgevoer moet word. Met  betrekking  tot
werkskepping   kan   ons    maar    vir    mekaar    sê    dat    daar    'n
werkloosheidversekeringsfonds is waaraan werknemers 1% en die  werkgewer  'n
verdere 1% bydra. Ons kan baie fondse daarstel, maar op die ou einde is  die
vraag steeds: hoe gaan ons sorg dat ons mense, wat  meer  en  meer  werkloos
raak, werk kan kry?

Wat betref die aspek van plaaslike regering help dit  nie  ons  sê  ons  kan
gratis   dienste   lewer,   net   om   dan    eenvoudig    die    finansiële
verantwoordelikheid van die plaaslike regering na die sentrale  Regering  te
probeer verskuif deur te sê daar moet verdere fondse van  sentrale  vlak  af
voorsien word vir gratis basiese dienste nie. Nee, wat die  VF  betref,  sal
die Regering dringend aandag moet gee aan die betaling, deur dié  mense  wat
kan betaal, vir dienste op plaaslike  regeringsvlak.  Die  uitstaande  skuld
verskuldig aan plaaslike regerings beloop tans volgens antwoorde op vrae  in
hierdie Huis al meer as R12 miljard. 'n Mens kan nie dienste  verwag  as  jy
nie daarvoor betaal nie. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, at the outset I would like to  tell  the
hon the Minister that the FF supports this medium-term  budget  policy.  The
reality is that  this  medium-term  budget  policy  is  also  good  for  the
microeconomic sphere.

However, in my limited time I would like to focus on Chapter 5, which  deals
specifically with the medium-term expenditure  framework  which  applies  to
all the national and provincial spheres of government. With  regard  to  the
policy priorities and the budgets as set out  in  the  document,  priorities
are established with regard to job creation and the reconstruction of  local
government by way of free basic services.
I want to say to the hon the Minister that it is one thing to  have  a  good
framework and a good policy at the macro level, but problems arise  when  it
comes to the local level where they have to be implemented. With  regard  to
job creation  we  can  tell  one  another  that  there  is  an  unemployment
insurance  fund  to  which  employees  contribute  1%   and   the   employer
contributes a further 1%. We can establish many funds, but in  the  end  the
question remains: How are we going  to  ensure  that  our  people,  who  are
becoming unemployed to an increasing extent, can get work?

As regards the aspect of local government, it does not help for  us  to  say
that we can deliver free services, and then  to  simply  try  to  shift  the
financial responsibility  of  local  government  to  central  Government  by
saying that further funding must be provided  from  the  central  level  for
free basic services. No, as far as the FF is concerned, the Government  will
have to give urgent attention to the payment, by those people who  can  pay,
for services at local government level. The outstanding debt owed  to  local
governments currently  amounts  to  more  than  R12  billion,  according  to
replies to questions in this House. One cannot expect services if  one  does
not pay for them. [Time expired.]]
Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members, the Medium-Term Budget  Policy
Statement provides an update on economic and fiscal developments  since  the
February Budget and sets out proposals  for  the  2002  MTEF.  In  a  church
situation one would compare it to the reading of the  banns.  Those  against
such proposals should speak right away or forever hold their peace.

Despite the 11 September terrorist incidents in the United  States  and  the
raging war in  Afghanistan,  which  saw  the  international  economic  trend
deteriorating, South Africa's trade performance has remained  impressive  in
the first nine months of 2001. However, it has become evident that  spending
patterns of departments and provincial administrations have to improve.

The National Treasury, in their presentation to the  committee,  brought  to
light that most  departments  and  provincial  administrations  continue  to
spend less than they have been allocated. This  practice  results  in  roll-
overs which are not welcomed. Our advice to them is that  if  they  fail  to
plan,  they  plan  to  fail.  Failure  to  plan  is  evident  in  that  some
departments justify their roll-overs by saying that  it  took  time  to  get
consultants to assume their duty or that they did not have personnel  to  do
the  work,  hence  the  delay  in  starting.  And  delays  in  anything  are
tantamount to denial of services.

Notwithstanding all that, there are plusses that we can add to our  economic
performance, among them growth of 10% in merchandise export volumes  in  the
first half of the year compared to the same period in 2000. Service  exports
grew by 15% over the same period and the consumer price index  increased  by
5,8% within the target range for next year. For 2002-03 we look  forward  to
a budget that will make poverty, inequality and vulnerability things of  the
past. Spending will have to be concentrated on education, health,  municipal
and  welfare  services,  as  well  as  the  security  and  criminal  justice
departments. Let us get down to work and give  affordable  services  to  the
people. The UCDP supports the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, the PAC's response to the   Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement by the hon the Minister of Finance is that  it  gives  this
country the opportunity to reflect on the R48  billion  spent  on  servicing
the apartheid debt. Money saved from servicing this debt could  be  used  to
increase expenditure on social development. This is why  the  PAC  continues
to call for the cancellation of the apartheid debt. That debt  was  incurred
to fight  the  barbaric  system  of  apartheid  and  colonialism  which  was
declared a crime against humanity by the United Nations.

The PAC is calling for a dual  rate  system.  The  structure  and  operation
exchange markets have changed fundamentally and the dual exchange system  is
the best option for protecting the rand in markets  which  are  run  like  a
global casino. Early this year the rand was undervalued by 50%  against  the
American dollar. This shows that speculative traders determine the value  of
the rand rather than the quality of goods and services that  we  sell.  This
means that South Africa's assets in industry, commerce and  agriculture  are
available to foreign investors at  well  below  their  true  value  and  the
country loses.

We support this Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement.

Dr S C CWELE: Chairperson, my input will focus on the impact of the  Medium-
Term Budget Policy Statement on the social services cluster, because  social
spending is the core of addressing poverty  and  vulnerability.  We  welcome
the expansionary budget  because  it  releases  more  resources  for  social
spending in real terms. This translates to R5,6 billion  next  year,  and  a
further R7,5 billion the following year. On average this means  an  increase
of 8,7% for welfare and 8,2% for health.

More significantly, the ANC welcomes the increase in  nonpersonnel  spending
in this cluster, releasing further resources for programmes to  benefit  the
poor, such  as  more  classrooms,  textbooks,  equipment,  learning  support
material  for  education,  hospital  maintenance,  better  distribution  and
availability of medicine at primary health care  level  and  increasing  the
capacity of the Department of Health to cope with the impact of HIV/Aids.

The increase  in  infrastructure  spending  will  also  benefit  Health  and
Education. The ``sweet fruits of liberty'' will come in the form  of  water,
roads and electricity roll-outs, which will result in a  better  quality  of
services in poor areas. The  bulk  of  social  spending  is  implemented  at
provincial level. The development of national norms  and  standards  by  the
National  Government  ensures  equitable  provision   of   services   across
provinces. For example, this means  that  a  child  in  the  rural  Northern
Province will receive  the  same  public  education  as  a  child  in  urban
suburbs, in the long-term.

Much has been said about the lack of capacity for  social  spending  on  the
ground. We welcome the programmes to empower  the  managers  to  turn  these
resources into actual programmes to benefit the  poor  and  the  vulnerable.
Secondly, the MTEF also offers  the  opportunity  for  better  planning  for
spending. The programme managers will know in advance  the  minimum  amounts
which will be available for the  next  three  years.  The  Budget  committee
recommends that the portfolio committees of  Parliament  and  civil  society
monitor and evaluate both the quality and  pattern  of  spending  throughout
the year.

This Government is demonstrating its commitment to dealing with  the  impact
of  HIV/Aids,  by  committing  more  resources  in  the  medium-term.   This
financial year alone,  the  provinces  are  spending  about  R4  million  in
treating the sick. Nationally, close to R1 billion is spent  on  prevention.
A total of R110 million, rising  to  R420  million  in  the  medium-term  is
allocated for life skills  programmes  and  home-based  care.  We  are  also
expanding the roll-out for the mother-to-child  transmission  programme.  In
short, these  programmes  are  directed  at  prevention  and  improving  the
quality of life of those infected and affected by the  epidemic  because  no
one has the cure.

The other specific positive development in the social  services  Cluster  is
the rationalisation  of  health  grants.  This  ensures  easier  access  and
utilisation of these grants. Some of these grants,  for  instance,  will  be
used to ensure better distribution of specialists  through  the  development
of postgraduate training capacity in all  of  our  provinces.  Secondly,  we
will be improving the quality of education productivity through the  rolling
out of the early childhood development  programme  (preschooling)  over  the
next 10 years.

Ngamafushane, siwushayela ihlombe umgomo nezilokotho  zikaHulumeni  zokusiza
izingane   ezihluphekayo   ngokuzilolonga   futhi   azilungiselele   ukuqala
ukufunda.  Uma  sibheka  kwezenhlalakahle,  uHulumeni  uzoqhubeka   ukuxhasa
abahluphekayo ngezimpesheni, ikakhulukazi  izingane.  (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraph follows.)

[In short, we applaud the Government policy and good  intentions  to  assist
poor children by training them so that they may be ready  to  start  school.
As far as welfare is concerned, the Government will  continue  helping  poor
people with pensions, especially the children.]

We encourage the  Government  to  continue  with  the  developmental  social
welfare approach  targeting  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable.  We  shall  be
awaiting,  with  eagerness,  the  Government's  report,  produced   by   the
Commission on Comprehensive Social Security.

In conclusion, as the ANC we are proud to recommend that  Parliament  adopts
the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. We are  on  the  right  track  with
regard to reducing poverty and vulnerability. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the Deputy President and Ministers,  the  long
cumbersome hours put into drawing up these budgets cannot go unnoticed.  The
many departments, personnel and all those thanked by  the  Minister  in  his
statement on 30 October 2001, are thanked by the MF as well.  We  note  that
it is not just about allocating  money,  it  involves  a  lot  of  strategy,
planning, communication, dedication, hours of brain work and many  difficult
negotiation sessions to reach this statement and its undertaking.

The MF supports the aim of the Budget to target poverty  and  vulnerability,
issues that continue to hinder the development of  our  community.  Further,
the large allocation made for social services is  supported,  especially  in
the light of the aim to target more resources  and  services  that  directly
influence living conditions in the community.

Although transparency allows for the citizenry to view the progress made  by
the Government in delivering, the changes resulting  from  the  improvements
made by the Government show that the citizenry  actually  experiences  these
through  education,  health  care,  social  grants,  welfare  services   and
housing. These are areas  crying  out  for  sustainable  development.  These
improvements would certainly  boost  economic  development  and  reduce  the
vulnerability of communities.

The growth of  6,7%  over  the  MTEF  period  for  justice,  protection  and
security services  is  applauded.  The  allocation  to  health  care  grants
appears in order, and the increase in the number of hospitals  in  the  nine
provinces is applauded.

Having viewed the allocations made, there  are  no  objections.  But  it  is
hoped that departments will make use of their allocated budgets to the  best
of their ability so as to attain the ends that their  budgets  so  precisely
aim to attain. The MF supports  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, I can advise hon Ministers that they can  enjoy  a
cup of tea because it is the NCOP that is on  today  and  not  us.  The  AEB
supports this Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. Allow me to  make  a  few
remarks, though. It is official now that the growth rate this year will  not
be the expected 3,5% of the February Budget,  but  2,6%  instead,  with  the
expectation that the rate of 3,7% will only be reached in 2004. This is  not
enough to cater for the basic  needs  of  the  country,  especially  in  the
critical field of job creation.

It is the opinion of the AEB that this slower growth rate is not the  result
of the Minister's Budget, but rather of other  policies  of  the  Government
that affect  investor  confidence.  Possibly  the  most  important  are  the
reluctance of the Government to distance itself clearly and officially  from
the Mugabe tyranny in Zimbabwe,  the  President's  viewpoint  on  Aids,  the
Government's inability to address the so-called ``unforeseen  consequences''
of our labour laws, as well as the consequences of affirmative action.  This
Medium-Term Expenditure  Framework  is,  indeed,  a  wake-up  call  for  the
Government to alter these policies sooner rather than later.

Die AEB glo dat die belastingverligting wat die Minister in  die  vooruitsig
gestel het, sowel as die verhoogde besteding aan veral  infrastruktuur,  wel
daartoe sal bydra dat ekonomiese groei gestimuleer word.  Groot  onsekerheid
heers egter  by  pensioenarisse  in  afwagting  op  die  resultate  van  die
ondersoek na die belasbaarheid van aftreegeld.

Die  verhoogde  besteding  van  15%  op  plaaslike  regeringsvlak  moet  ook
verwelkom word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The AEB believes that the tax  relief  which  the  Minister  held  out  the
prospect  of,  as  well  as  the   increased   expenditure   on   especially
infrastructure, will  indeed  contribute  to  the  stimulation  of  economic
growth.  However,  there  is  great  uncertainty   amongst   pensioners   in
expectation of the results of  the  investigation  into  the  taxability  of
retirement money.

The increased expenditure of 15% at local government level  should  also  be
welcomed.]

We cannot have a situation of ``what Trevor gives, the mayor takes''.

'n Positiewe aspek is die dalende inflasiesyfer wat vir  die  volgende  jaar
op 5,5% en vir 2004 op 4,5%  voorsien  word.  In  dié  verband  verdien  die
Minister krediet vir effektiewe fiskale beheer.

Kortom, om mee af te sluit, die AEB glo dat die Minister en  sy  departement
goeie werk doen, deursigtig optree en  deur  die  beleid  van  'n  drie-jaar
beplanning baie doen om beplanning te vergemaklik en ekonomiese vertroue  te
versterk. Dit is hoog tyd dat sy kollegas  hul  kant  bring  met  beleid  en
optrede wat vertroue, groei en ekonomiese  stabiliteit  kan  verseker.  [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[A positive aspect is the falling inflation rate which is projected at  5,5%
for next year and at 4,5% for 2004. In this  regard  the  Minister  deserves
credit for effective fiscal control.

In  brief,  to  conclude,  the  AEB  believes  that  the  Minister  and  his
department are doing good work, are acting  transparently  and  through  the
policy of a three-year plan are doing a lot to make planning easier  and  to
strengthen economic confidence. It is high time  that  his  colleagues  play
their part with policy and action which would ensure confidence, growth  and
economic stability. [Time expired.]]

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, hon Minister of Finance and hon members, one  of
the  cornerstones  of  a  constitutional  democracy  is  the  principle   of
transparency and accountability. This principle is indeed enshrined  in  the
founding provisions of  our  Constitution.  Unfortunately,  both  the  track
record of the Treasury as well as the principle that  is  enshrined  in  the
Constitution have been breached in this  year's  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement.

As the depreciation of the rand continues, seemingly unabated, the  rest  of
the impact of exchange rate volatility on the cost of the strategic  defence
procurement realises a thick crimson cloak that has increasingly been  drawn
over the expenditure as well as the financing  figures.  Unfortunately,  the
limited reach of the oversight role of our new Joint  Budget  Committee  was
clear when the Department of Defence failed to appear before  it.  We  trust
that this will not be repeated in the future and that the oversight  deficit
this committee already suffers from in its infancy will be addressed.

Instead of having the figures clearly stated in order to show the impact  of
the  depreciation  of  the  rand  on  the  cost  of  the  strategic  defence
procurement, we have  the  following  blind  statement  in  the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework:


  Proposed  allocations  to  defence  increase  over  the  medium-term   to
  accommodate the impact of higher than expected depreciation of  the  rand
  on the cost of this  strategic  arms  package  and  to  provide  for  the
  enhanced role of the SANDF in regional peacekeeping activities.

I am certain that the Warburg Dillon Reed model has  produced  a  number  of
interesting updates after  the  rollercoaster  ride  of  the  rand  and  the
substantial  post-September-11  depreciation,  as  well  as   the   possible
inflation and lower growth rate scenarios that become inevitable  as  global
recession looms in the context of a potentially protracted war.

In  fact,  a  number  of  fundamental  risk  factors  of  this  very   risky
procurement which engaged the  affordability  team  are  materialising  with
very  far-reaching  cost  implications  and   possible   guidance-of-payment
implications. Firstly, an unsuccessful defence budget restructuring  is  not
making  the  transition  from  a  personnel-skewed  budget  to   a   capital
expenditure-skewed budget that is required for this  procurement.  Secondly,
the adverse  exchange  rate  movements  that  I  have  highlighted  earlier,
including an exchange rate depreciation in excess of 20%,  lower  underlined
economic growth. We have already seen a downward revision for this year  and
the global environment  does  not  look  promising  in  terms  of  increased
economic growth.

It has been disconcerting to witness members of the executive hiding  behind
exemptions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act instead of  abiding
by  the  vision  of  open  and  accountable  governance  entrenched  in  our
Constitution. We need to remind members of the executive that the  Promotion
of Access to Information Act is not a shield for Ministers; it  is  a  sword
in the hands of those who seek accountability and  transparency,  be  it  in
our constituencies, in civil societies, on the benches of opposition  or  in
the media. The Minister of Finance will have to  answer  questions  relating
to this procurement for years to come. Let us hope that these  answers  will
be honest and forthcoming. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr D A HANEKOM: Chairperson, this is my maiden speech  and  I  hope  members
will listen carefully. This new  Joint  Budget  Committee  is  an  important
initiative. It is the Budget that makes everything happen  in  our  country,
or not happen as the case may be. It is the  single  most  important  policy
instrument the Government has to achieve its objectives. It affects all  our
lives quite fundamentally. One can have the best laws in  the  country,  the
best laws in the world, the best constitution, the  best  policies  and  the
best programmes, but the bottom line is that if one does not have the  money
to pay for them, one does not get them. And the bottom line is that  if  one
pays for everything out of borrowed money one will not be able  to  do  very
much the following year, and finally one will be bankrupt.

The budget affects every citizen of our country, making  this  short  debate
arguably one of the most important debates of this House. Even as we  speak,
hon members here are working out how they are going to pay  their  bills  at
the end of this month. If one plans carefully, one may be able to  buy  that
TV set next year or that new pair of shoes that one wants to buy  for  one's
child. But one has to budget and plan and stick to one's plan. And so it  is
with Government. The budget and everything that  goes  along  with  taxes  -
debt reduction, infrastructure spending, spending  on  health,  spending  on
education, spending on pensions - affect every one  of  our  citizens  in  a
very real way.

Minister Manuel has managed to pull some rabbits out of the hat  along  with
his team. He will have to explain to us how he manages  to  do  that.  Taxes
have come down. That is good news! Revenue has gone up. That is  remarkable!
Taxes have come down but there is more  money  to  spend,  and  indeed  more
money has been allocated to social  programmes.  Inflation  is  coming  down
steadily. Interest rates are also coming down steadily.  The  Minister  will
have to explain that. There must be some bodies!

How about our reserves? Gross reserves are improved. What about the  foreign
debt? There is an improvement in the foreign  debt  situation  as  well.  In
1999 it was 9,6% of the total export earnings, and in 2000 it  was  down  to
6,2%. Gross Government dissaving is declining. The  economists  are  telling
us that this is good news. But surely,  this  must  be  at  the  expense  of
something - like gross domestic  fixed  investment,  for  example?  Not  so.
Gross domestic fixed investment has gone up, and  Government's  contribution
is growing. This is quite a remarkable achievement. One  day  Trevor  Manuel
must tell us the secrets because we need to know.

But of course, as every South African will know, we still have a long,  long
way to go. We still have challenges of unemployment  in  our  country  on  a
very large scale; poverty levels are alarmingly high and crime is  something
that affects every one of us very badly.

The good news is that the 2002 Budget will focus  on  poverty  as  no  other
budget has ever done. The challenge, however, remains to  eradicate  poverty
altogether, and we are going to have to look at  innovative  ways  of  doing
so. We have a very significant proportion of  our  population  that  is  not
covered by any social grants.  Elderly  people  receive  old  age  pensions,
disabled people receive disability  grants,  single  mothers  receive  child
support grants, but what about millions of other people that  have  nothing?
That is a huge challenge facing us and we will have to deal with  it  in  an
innovative way.

But on the protection services, as they are called  -  justice,  police  and
correctional services - we have to say that we welcome the  fact  that  this
Budget has increased the spending on crime and protection services by  8,9%.
Economic growth will mean  very  little  to  people  for  as  long  as  many
children in our society  are  being  raped  and  abused.  One  can  have  an
excellent state housing programme but as long as one is not secure  in  that
house we have a problem. The ANC really welcomes  this  additional  spending
on protection services. [Applause.]

We were actually amazed in this very important committee to  hear  from  the
DP this morning that they would  abstain  from  voting  in  favour  of  this
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. All parties  on  this  committee  other
than the DP indicated that they would support the Medium-Term Budget  Policy
Statement. Civil society has broadly  welcomed  the  direction  this  policy
statement takes us - that includes  trade  unions,  NGOs  and  many  others.
Business has welcomed it, but not the DP. I truly  think  the  DP  seems  to
have become completely moribund, and has nothing constructive to offer  this
country.

May Trevor keep up the good work! And may Maria keep up the  good  work!  We
still have huge challenges ahead. The ANC supports this  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement enthusiastically. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, hon members, it is  the  fifth  time
that we have tabled the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, but it  is  the
first time that  it  has  been  debated  like  this  in  this  House,  as  a
consequence  of  this  very  detailed  process  that  the  Budget  committee
undertook.

I want to emphasise that this is neither the Budget, nor, as  in  the  press
have coined it, the ``mini budget''. It is, as the  name  suggests,  a  very
important statement within the cycle, that gives a clear indication of  what
is to come in February. But perhaps more importantly, Parliament,  with  the
help of the Chair of Committees, constructed this Budget committee,  thereby
clearly strengthening both the insight  that  Parliament  has  into  budget-
making and its oversight function in the period ahead.

In respect of the debate itself, perhaps I would like to just thank the  hon
Louis Green for his comments, because I think it cut right to the  heart  of
what this is about. The key question is: What do we do  in  respect  of  the
choices we exercise, both in terms of policy and spending,  to  ensure  that
we do, indeed, become the great nation that our people deserve  to  be  part
of? And that, I think is the spirit that drives us all. It is sad that  some
would continue to seek the dark side of the moon. I think we will just  move
past them.

In the spirit of so many of the contributors to this debate, let me  express
appreciation and ask that we march on to the greatness that  will  give  our
people the quality of life that they deserve. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker, hon members,  the  Budget  of  the  financial
year ending 31 March 2002 was dubbed ``Manuel's sweet  fruit  budget'',  and
now the Bill before us is asking hon members to consider adding  more  fruit
to this bowl.

When it comes to preparing a budget, departments estimate their  expenditure
and  submit  draft  expenditure  applications.   National   and   provincial
departments go through  strategic  sessions  to  identify  the  departmental
goals and prepare an initial three year budget estimate. They  need  to  try
and keep in line with the three-year allocations determined in  the  Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework cycle.

Each  department  works  out  an  estimated  budget  without  knowing   what
eventually will be allocated to it.  It  is  almost  like  projecting  one's
personal budget for the following year without knowing what one's income  or
increase will be, because one will only receive that increase at the end  of
the following year. So, therefore,  if  an  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill
needs to be passed, it generally means that there was  a  shortfall  in  the
original Budget to meet the obligations of the Government.

In terms of the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,  chapter  4  section  30,
adjustments to  the  Budget  are  allowed  only  under  certain  narrow  and
specific conditions, the major  ones  being  unforeseeable  and  unavoidable
expenditure that could not have reasonably been predicted.

We are allocating these extra funds to departments. We note in the  Auditor-
General's report that 24% of the total amount of  the  adjustments  estimate
for the 2000-01 financial  year  was  not  utilised.  There  is  a  need  to
determine if the amounts not utilised are unexpended funds or  real  savings
generated by reprioritising activities.

Budgetary controls and sound financial controls must be  vigorously  applied
and actual results must be continually subjected  to  scrutiny.  I  want  to
focus only on certain unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure in  specific
programmes of certain Votes.

As far as communications is concerned, an amount of R600  million  has  been
allocated as compensation for the operational losses of the SA  Post  Office
for two years, ending 31 March 2002. That means an average of  R300  million
each year was needed. If we track the budget ending March 2000 and  the  one
ending March 2001, we note that the decrease  in  these  budgets  is  mainly
attributed to the decrease in the SABC subsidy and the  termination  of  the
Post Office subsidy.

The hon Minister's vision was the elimination of the subsidy to the SA  Post
Office in the 2000-01 financial year, but this could not  be  realised.  One
of the reasons for this was mismanagement of resources in the  Post  Office.
We want to commend the hon the Minister for the  good  work  that  is  being
done  to  root  out  corruption,  and  urge  her  to   continue   with   the
investigation into the operations of the  SA  Post  Office  to  ensure  that
money allocated is well-spent.

We must be proud of our achievements in the fight against corruption in  the
short existence of a democratic order in this country. The Post Office is  a
familiar institution and is essential to the majority of the people  in  the
country, especially in the rural areas. Access to its services  is  a  basic
right.

Broadcasting services were allocated R10  million.  Additional  funding  was
needed for the Independent  Communications  Authority  of  South  Africa  to
finance the telecommunications market initiative, that is the  licensing  of
the second telecommunications  operator.  The  expenditure  was  unavoidable
because the  Independent  Communications  Authority  had  to  put  in  place
structures that are critical to Telkom's initial public offering.  The  full
potential of Telkom's IPO would not be realised  if  these  structures  were
not in place.

The adjustments estimate in the social insurance  programme  of  the  Labour
Vote, commonly known as the UIF, is R605 million. The hon  the  Minister  of
Labour, in the speech on his Vote, said, and I quote:


  The Minister of Finance will be delighted to know that we are not  asking
  for more money to implement this programme. Instead we will  decentralise
  resources from head office to  labour  centres  where  officials  of  the
  department will interface directly with our clients.
The hon the Minister of Labour needs this additional allocation  subject  to
certain conditions. And we  encourage  the  hon  the  Minister  to  continue
implementing these conditions.

The people in this country take it for granted that their remuneration  will
be deposited into their banking accounts. At UIF paypoints we find  families
in long queues that overflow into the streets outside these buildings.  They
wait for long hours for the money that is  sometimes  the  household's  only
income to buy food. Therefore, we agree with the  conditions  that  the  hon
the Minister has outlined, namely that the funds must be monitored so as  to
ensure that they reach the poorest of the poor,  and  reach  them  on  time,
etc.

Finally, the Finance Committee wants to  express  its  appreciation  to  the
national  Treasury  for  the  simplification  and  improved  layout  of  the
adjustments estimate information that was provided. It was easy to read  and
each Vote was clearly  outlined,  displaying  the  amounts  for  roll-overs,
unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure, virement and  other  adjustments,
with explanatory notes justifying these.
The ANC supports the Adjustments Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker, in  my  remarks  on  this  Bill,  I  have  two
compliments, one comment and two concerns.  Other  colleagues  from  the  DA
will raise some other  matters  during  the  discussion  on  the  Votes  and
schedule.

Firstly, I would like to compliment the national Treasury on the new  format
of the additional appropriation estimates and their consolidation  into  the
very useful book that we received this year. In the past one  could  forgive
hon  members  for  not  understanding  what  was  going  on  in  respect  of
additional appropriations and the adjustments estimates. But now, I  believe
that the format is such that any person who  wishes  to  find  out  what  is
going on can do so without having to do a five-year degree in accounting.

Secondly, I would like to compliment the hon the Minister and  the  national
Treasury on the  good  control  that  they  have  exercised  in  respect  of
preventing  overexpenditure.  The  additional  amounts  involved,   if   one
excludes the contingency reserve in the initial budget,  still  remain  less
than 2% higher than the March Budget. I think  that  that  is  a  very  good
performance.

I would like to remind the hon the Minister and departments that,  in  terms
of the Public Finance Management Act - as  set  out  quite  clearly  in  the
document - expenditure, in order to qualify  in  these  estimates,  must  be
unforeseeable   and   unavoidable.   As   the   document   correctly   says,
``unforeseeable'' is expenditure that could not be anticipated.  It  is  not
the same as unforeseen expenditure,  which  is  expenditure  which  was  not
anticipated. Last year, we had a serious problem with this because  we  felt
that many items were, perhaps, unforeseen but were not  unforeseeable.  This
year, there remain some borderline cases but there is  a  great  improvement
on last year.

To turn to our first concern, I would like to say that it is  good  to  keep
within the Budget and quite clearly, that is  so.  But,  when  underspending
results in nondelivery, that is no cause for accolades. Unfortunately,  this
is a widespread problem.

The hon the  Minister  gets  flak  inside  and  outside  of  Parliament  for
insisting on fiscal discipline, often most  vociferously  from  his  party's
political allies. We in the DA support the Minister when  he  asserts  that,
more often than not, it is the  underspending,  inefficiency  or  corruption
which hampers delivery rather than a lack of funds.  What  is  needed  is  a
more stringent calling to  account  of  those  responsible  for  nondelivery
rather  than  simply  throwing  more  funds  at  inefficient  officials   or
Ministers.

Our second concern relates to Census 2001. I am dealing with this  issue  at
some length now because of the very limited time available to the DA  during
the consideration of the Votes and Schedule. The basic field  work  was  due
to be completed on 7 November after one week extension was  granted  by  the
Minister.

The first problem is that it is quite clear that many people have  not  been
counted. For example, in the studios of a local radio station  only  12  out
of 20 people had been called on by the evening of 7 November 2001.  That  is
not a scientific or statistically valid sample, but against  the  background
of the shambles associated with the  1996  census,  it  is  imperative  that
people have confidence in the census. It is of critical importance to  every
South  African  and  to  all  three  spheres  of  government.   Relying   on
postenumeration surveys is not an acceptable alternative to a  comprehensive
and accurate count, to start with.

What is worrying is  that,  having  been  assured  earlier  this  year  that
everything was on track for a successful census, Parliament is now asked  to
increase the census budget by R140  million  or  29%  to  enable  Statistics
South Africa to complete the job. What is even more worrying  is  that  only
one month before the census was due to begin, the final  assessment  of  the
pilot census ``confirmed a worst-case scenario  on  the  quality  of  Census
2001'', and revealed a net undercount with respect to  the  true  population
of 39%.

I would like to quote from the Adjusted Estimates  of  National  Expenditure
document:


  Because census management had identified some of  the  likely  weaknesses
  prefigured by the pilot, and taken drastic and proactive steps to address
  these in the period between April and September 2001, a full-blown crisis
  in Census 2001 was avoided.

Given the experiences of and the lessons that should have been  learnt  from
the 1996 census, it is alarming that the pilot census was  so  far  off  the
mark.  Furthermore,  when  Statistics  South  Africa  appeared  before   the
Portfolio Committee on Finance in May this year, no mention was made of  any
significant problems being encountered. Therefore, it is  of  great  concern
that we are now informed that  a  full-blown  crisis  was  looming.  I  look
forward to the hon the Minister's response with regard to these matters.

However, as I have said, this  Bill  confirms  the  good  fiscal  discipline
exercised, and the DA will therefore be supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam  Speaker,  for  any  government  in  the  world  it  is
essential to make  adjustments  to  the  original,  approved  budget.  South
Africa is no different, and with the vastness of the Budget, it  is  logical
that  there  will  be  certain  areas  of  overrunning  and  sometimes  even
underspending  in  some  departments.  Unexpected  developments  after   the
production make adjustments  inevitable  towards  the  latter  part  of  the
financial year.

The question that should be asked is whether  the  proposed  amendments  are
reasonable and acceptable. The increased estimates of expenditure must  also
be measured against the revenue gains or tax overruns for this fiscal  year.
The IFP believes that  the  adjustment  estimates  for  2001-2002,  measured
against the actual gains of tax revenue, are within  the  prescribed  levels
of overruns.

Now that the Public Finance Management  Act  is  in  operation  and  we  can
measure expenditure estimates  over  a  period  of  several  years,  a  much
clearer picture emerges. Under the circumstances and explanations  given  to
us, we are satisfied with the adjustment estimates.

Within the direct ambit of the Minister of Finance, we are  looking  at  the
national Treasury and Statistics South Africa. A  substantial  proportionate
adjustment is being effected in the population census where R274 million  is
additionally appropriated.  An  accurate  population  census  is  absolutely
essential and the IFP does not have a problem with the  increased  financial
spending. However, we trust that the country will  receive  value  for  this
money and that we will have a more accurate census  than  the  previous  one
and that the count will be substantially accurate.
Personally, I am concerned about several reports of cases where people  have
not been counted. I understand  the  logistical  problems  but  when  easily
accessible semi-urban areas have not  yet  been  visited,  the  alarm  bells
start ringing.

To the credit of the Minister and the  Governor  of  the  Reserve  Bank,  we
refer to the fiscal controls and particularly the success  and  achievements
of the inflation target levels. Another positive aspect is the improved  and
better than expected revenue of  the  Sars.  Higher  than  expected  revenue
enabled us to increase  essential  social  and  security  spending.  Further
positive overruns can be expected from Sars.

We have sympathy with the Minister with  regard  to  the  weakening  of  the
rand. The benefit to exporters is being outstripped by the negative  aspects
of the increased prices  of  imported  goods.  Of  greater  concern  is  the
escalating rand value  of  our  international  debt  without  receiving  any
benefits for it.

I can remember at a time when our rand had been referred to  as  the  4-7-11
rand - meaning that, originally in the 90s, it was quoted at R4 against  the
US dollar. Then, at the beginning of  the  year,  it  weakened  to  such  an
extent that it was quoted at R7 against  the  dollar  and  R11  against  the
pound.

Nowadays, that scenario sounds like music  to  the  ears  with  the  present
situation at almost R10 to the dollar and R14 against  the  pound.  Earlier,
the rand, measured against the basket of international currencies,  did  not
look so bad. But  these  days,  we  have  lost  ground  overall  and  urgent
attention is definitely required, particularly when looking at Botswana  and
several of these other Southern African countries.

The  IFP  will,  nevertheless,  support  and  vote   for   the   Adjustments
Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister and hon members, the main  purpose
of  this  Bill  is  to  appropriate  adjusted  amounts  of  money  for   the
requirements of the state in respect of the  financial  year  ending  on  31
March 2002. It is important to note that  the  vertical  transfer  of  funds
from national to provincial and local  governments  is  stipulated  in  this
particular piece of legislation.
The spending priorities regarding provincial governments  relate  to  social
services such as education and health and the provision  of  basic  services
to local government such as the delivery of free basic services. During  the
past two weeks the  Joint  Budget  Committee  of  Parliament  had  extensive
hearings on the Medium-Term Economic Framework and the Division  of  Revenue
Bill. What was clear, however, was that more information  must  be  provided
to national Treasury on spending measures of relevant departments.

Accounting officers of all respective Government  institutions  need  to  be
held accountable for nondelivery of services to people.  Provinces  received
about 95% of  their  income  through  national  transfers,  equitable  share
formulae and some grants. Municipalities, however, generate  up  to  90%  of
their own revenue. Local government was restructured  in  2000  by  creating
284  local  municipalities,  with  the  aim  of  delivering  more  efficient
services to communities lacking infrastructure and service delivery.

What  is  of  concern,  however,  is  that  there  is  a  tendency  at  some
municipalities to be unable to spend their funds.  It  seems  that  in  some
cases the only way to solve underspending is  for  the  national  Government
and provinces to intervene to address this lack of service delivery.

Poverty has reached alarming proportions, especially in rural  areas,  where
financial services are often absent. Public-private partnerships could  help
to solve this problem  whereby  the  public  departments  join  together  to
increase  the  capacity  and  skills  transfer  to  explore  the   necessary
opportunities in order to improve the infrastructure.

It is noted that this Bill  also  furnishes  adjusted  figures  for  police,
justice, correctional services and defence. A key factor to attain  positive
economic growth is to stabilise the unacceptably high  level  of  crime.  It
is,  therefore,  welcome  that  the  safety  and  security  sector's  future
budgetary allocation will grow by 7% over the medium term.

The operational losses incurred by the Post Office are a  reason  for  grave
concern. Inefficient financial management is not acceptable. The Post  Bank,
in rural areas, is often the only financial institution available and it  is
accepted that the South African Post Office  has  a  social  responsibility.
But, the aim should be for the Post Office  to  restructure  itself,  and  I
think that that is in the national interest.

The New NP supports the Adjustments Appropriation Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker and hon members, one of the major  challenges
flowing from the Adjustments Appropriation Bill for the future is to  reduce
roll-over funds from the previous year which, this  year,  amount  to  R2,16
billion; and to address underspending in  all  three  tiers  of  Government,
which  this  year  amounts  to  R1,95  billion.  It  provides  us  with   an
opportunity to build capacity in provinces and, at local  government  level,
create the necessary skills  which  will  assist  in  capacity-building  and
improving project management.

Related to the  capacity  problem  that  currently  exists,  are  additional
transfers to provinces, provided for in the Adjustments Appropriation  Bill.
Of particular importance, is a supplementary allocation of R500 million  for
infrastructure spending to provinces. It begs the serious question that,  if
provinces are currently not able to spend their capital budgets, where  will
they find the capacity to spend this additional R500 million, which is much-
needed, on infrastructure development? Surely we cannot  budget  more  money
every year for conditional  grants  only  to  find  that  lack  of  capacity
prevented those monies from reaching the intended targets.

The Bill provides for a subsidy, to the Post Office,  of  R300  million  per
year over the next two-year period. This announced R600 million subsidy  for
operational losses in the Post  Office  can  only  be  justified  if  it  is
intended that postal services in South Africa will  become  self-sustainable
and will not rely only on fiscal transfers. We will  appreciate  it  if  the
Minister can confirm this intention.

In conclusion, there are two questions on lesser but  important  allocations
in the Adjustments Appropriation Bill. A few weeks  ago  we  passed  a  very
important Bill in this House to combat  money-laundering  in  South  Africa.
Why did the  Minister  not  foresee  the  additional  R10  million  for  the
Financial Intelligence Centre that he now seeks in this Bill?

The Public Finance Management Act is one of the  most  important  Acts  that
this Parliament has passed since 1999. Hon members  know  that  it  aims  to
promote good financial management with effective service delivery.  National
Treasury has an important role  to  play,  especially  with  regard  to  the
implementation of the PFMA. But in this Bill, national  Treasury  reports  a
saving on the implementatiom of the PFMA amounting to R34,8 million. How  do
we justify a saving on implementation  when  provinces  struggle  to  comply
with the provisions of the PFMA?

With  these  few  comments,  the  UDM  proudly  supports   the   Adjustments
Appropriation Bill.

Mr F C FANKOMO: Madam Speaker and hon members of Parliament, let  me  follow
in the footsteps of those hon members who have deliberated before me.

On 21 February 2001, the Minister of Finance presented the  Budget  for  the
financial year 2001-02 for spending in the current year.  The  objective  of
the  Budget,  as  always,  is  finding  a  balance  between  several   broad
objectives.  Among  those  objectives  are:  to  provide  for   social   and
development expenditure, overcome  poverty,  provide  safety  and  security,
enhance investment in  infrastucture,  maintain  Government  capital  stock,
reduce the overall burden of tax so as to lower  the  costs  of  investment,
job creation and to  release  household  spending  powers.  Thus,  the  main
Budget provided for the year  2001-02  amounted  to  expenditure  of  R258,3
billion.

According to the Adjustments Appropriation Bill, an amount of  R8,5  billion
is  recommended  by  the  Treasury  Committee  to  be  added  to  the   main
appropriation Budget for 2001-02. This shows the commitment  of  the  ruling
Government of the ANC to be ready to provide for the needs  and  demands  of
communities. This is the signal for a  Government  of  the  people  for  the
people.

This additional amount will assist in the realisation of the  promises  made
by the ANC in the election manifesto. One out of the many  promises  is  the
issue of bringing the Government closer to the people.

The Constitution obliged the Government to redraw municipal boundaries.  New
local  authorities  were  constructed,  leading  to  the  local   government
elections of 2000. This led to a new momentum in delivery of basic  services
to lower-income communities.

After the redemarcation of municipalities, a need existed for funding  these
new structures. Thus, the Treasury Committee recommended that  R328  million
should be added to local government.  Thus,  the  adjustments  appropriation
provided  R108  million  as  a  once-off   subsidy   for   remuneration   of
councillors, and  an  additional  R200  million  to  supplement  free  basic
delivery.

The Public Finance Management  Act  sets  strict  limits  to  the  chain  of
spending, but allows additional funding to be appropriated.  This  is  as  a
result of unspent moneys from previous years.  For  example,  an  amount  of
R2,2 billion was not spent in the previous year and has to  be  rolled  over
to the following year for spending. Factors causing roll-overs  are  a  lack
of capacity in the  administration  of  contracts,  lack  of  submission  of
reports to effect payments, late completion of projects,  projects  extended
to the next financial year and a lack of data processing.

I want to ask the Minister if these factors  that  I  have  mentioned  above
contribute to the  roll-overs,  as  I  have  suggested.  If  they  do,  what
corrective measures can be taken to address this? The  overspending  of  any
department results in the application of virement.  This  means  that  funds
can be moved from one programme to the other as long  it  falls  within  the
same division. However, the question remains that, as a budget  is  a  plain
document for the year and used to direct and control the use of  funds,  why
are  there  cases  of  overspending  and  roll-overs?  Do  departments  lack
financial management capacity? If so, are there any arrangements being  made
by the Treasury to correct such pitfalls?

However, I am well  pleased  to  notice  that  most  departments  have  been
allocated sufficient amounts of money for retraining and  human  development
of public personnel. This retraining  should  be  focused  more  on  project
management.  All  public  managers  should  be   provided   with   financial
management knowledge as finance is the  core  factor  that  governs  service
delivery in many departmental  sectors.  Surely  the  retraining  of  public
personnel will improve service delivery  by  Government  institutions.  Thus
the use of virement should be applied in a minimal way and strict  financial
processes should be pursued.

I welcome and support this Adjustments Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, Ministers and hon members, the ACDP would  also
like to commend the Minister  on  the  new  glossy  format  of  this  year's
adjustments. The document is  quite  easy  to  use  and  it  is  a  research
reference  document  that  we  will  be  using  for   future   comments   on
adjustments.

One of the main problems in achieving Government objectives is the  capacity
of our departments to effectively spend their  allocated  funds.  Roll-overs
have been a consistent capability test for our  departments  over  the  past
years. The Minister has recently stated his disappointment at the  inability
of state  institutions  to  effectively  process  financial  resources.  The
Department of Housing, for instance, has  rolled  over  money  amounting  to
R82,375 million. This is a great concern in the face of our nation's  demand
for  good  housing.  Why  must  R75  million  that  was  allocated  to   the
Presidential Job Summits project be rolled over because the national  rental
housing company has not yet been established?

The Department of Arts, Culture, Science  and  Technology  has  a  roll-over
amounting to R21,47 million because programme 5 could not be  completed  due
to contracts that could not be  signed  before  31  March.  Unless  imminent
improvements are forthcoming, we  will  lose  the  fight  against  important
issues such as crime prevention, HIV/Aids,  poverty  alleviation  and  other
equally essential service delivery programmes.

We are glad that the Department of Safety and Security  will  receive  funds
to rectify  outstanding  claims  for  promotions  and  other  benefits.  The
morale, especially of our Police Service, leaves a lot to be desired.  Since
the attacks on America, the world has become a less  secure  place  to  live
in. Therefore, our priority as a nation is to beef up our national  security
on all fronts. In doing so, we will minimise the potential risk  of  opening
up our safety and security personnel to bribery and corruption, thus  laying
bare the vulnerability of our country.

The ACDP supports the Adjustments Appropriation Bill.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and members of  Parliament,  the  Adjustments
Appropriation Bill seeks to open a window into what  has  to  be  spent  and
where to spend it during the forthcoming  medium  term.  Without  detracting
from the good work that is being done by the national  Treasury  and  having
listened to the presentations by some departments, I realise that  there  is
a need to attend to some of the specific requests made by such departments.

A look at the Department of Provincial and  Local  Government  reveals  that
some substantial  amounts  could  be  added  to  assist  the  department  in
realising its task, which is the development  of  the  13  rural  and  eight
urban nodal points. The development is an ongoing exercise, but  it  has  to
be expedited in order that we may break the back of inequality, poverty  and
vulnerability.

The wall-to-wall municipal system which has been introduced as a last  phase
of  democratising  South  Africa  requires  human,  financial  and  material
resources. Rural municipalities are the  most  vulnerable,  as  they  cannot
raise their own funds. They need to be nurtured into being fully  grown  and
self-sufficient to a certain degree. It  is  gratifying,  however,  to  note
that there are increases in all divisions of revenue among  the  spheres  of
government. The gradual tilt of allocating more resources  to  provinces  as
against the national Government is highly appreciated because things  happen
in the provinces. They have to deliver.

A request for some R50 million by the Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs to facilitate restitution could be granted  to  ensure  that  people
are no longer landless. This would bring an end  to  homelessness.  We  note
that it is difficult to meet the needs of all in one budget.  The  financial
cake is small in size and slicing it up will reduce  it  to  crumbs.  Rather
give a slice to one department and give to the others in the future.

We are grateful for this visionary Bill on the appropriation of the  fiscus.
The UCDP supports this Adjustments Appropriation Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC has noted that the  largest  portions
of the budget adjustments are going to  five  national  departments,  namely
Foreign Affairs, Statistics South Africa, Defence, Safety and Security,  and
Public Enterprises. Education remains  the  largest  category  of  spending.
This is commendable. But more of this budget should be spent  in  the  rural
areas or African townships where there is so much need. Several  schools  in
the neediest areas have no laboratories or libraries.  In  this  country  of
gold, diamonds, uranium and  platinum,  many  African  schoolchildren  learn
under trees or in corrugated buildings which are cold when it is  cold,  and
hot when it is hot, making it  difficult  for  students  to  concentrate  on
their lessons.

Provisions for poverty alleviation in this budget are  appreciated,  but  it
is not the kind which will alleviate poverty. Many people  in  this  country
need training, technical skills and land to alleviate their poverty.

The largest adjustments have gone to several departments but not to  Health,
a  critical  department  in  view  of  the  state  of  affairs   in   health
institutions such as Baragwanath Hospital.

The PAC nevertheless supports this Bill, but not with  reference  to  public
enterprises. The PAC has long stated that the privatisation of state  assets
will lead to the loss of thousands of jobs without creating new  jobs.  This
has happened. Unless the Government rethinks  its  policy  on  the  sale  of
assets, the rich will get richer, while the African majority becomes  poorer
and poorer.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the  adjustments  appropriation  appears  to
have a major impact on a variety of departments, and  we  trust  that  these
adjustments are based on a thorough investigation into their validity.

The increases appear to be well allocated. The almost 50% of the  adjustment
allocated to the Safety and Security Budget Vote  for  crime  prevention  is
certainly a good move and, hopefully, the activation of this  will  be  used
efficiently and effectively.

The adjustments appropriation allocated by the labour budget for the  Social
Insurance Programme, to be transferred to the Unemployment  Insurance  Fund,
is supported, although the concern is that more funds need to  be  allocated
elsewhere within the programme.

Further increases elsewhere are supported without  reservation.  Concern  is
expressed, though, with regard to the budget cuts to Votes  4,  20,  22  and
31. The cut experienced by, firstly,  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  in
relation to migration is harsh, in view of the pressure and  extent  of  the
department's administration.  Secondly,  the  cut  in  respect  of  landward
defence under the Defence Vote is questionable. One wonders whether this  is
a wise move, since vulnerability should be prevented.  Thirdly,  the  budget
cut in the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development with  regard
to the administration of the courts should be seen in a  serious  light  and
the importance thereof cannot be overemphasised. Why then a  cut?  Fourthly,
a budget cut in Trade and Industry with respect to enterprise  organisation,
in the light of our poor economic performance over the  past  period,  would
increase nonviability.

However, we trust that there is an explanation for these  decreases  in  the
adjustments appropriation, and that they are in line with  the  department's
policy.  Our  aim  is  to  introduce  a  good  budget  that  would   promote
sustainable development, advancement and  betterment.  I  trust  that  these
adjustments are targeted at  the  same.  The  MF  supports  the  Adjustments
Appropriation Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr  C   AUCAMP:   Mev   die   Speaker,   die   AEB   ondersteun   ook   die
Aansuiweringsbegrotingswetsontwerp,  en  ons  meen  dit  spreek  van   goeie
fiskale beheer. Ons is veral bly om te sien dat die  bedrag  onbestede  geld
aansienlik afgeneem het en dat daar ook 'n  beter  bestedingsvermoë  by  die
departemente is. Ons steun  veral  die  aanpassing  in  die  bedrae  wat  op
veiligheid bestee word. Ons glo dat as  ons  die  misdaadsituasie  in  Suid-
Afrika onder beheer kan kry, dit ook ander aspekte  sal  stimuleer  en  meer
inkomste beskikbaar sal stel.

Die verhoging in besteding aan plaaslike regering moet ook  verwelkom  word.
Dit sal niks help as ons op die derde regeringsvlak 'n impotensie  het  nie,
waar dit die naaste aan ons mense  se  lewens  kom.  Die  verhoging  in  die
besteding op Vigs en die bestryding daarvan word  ook  gesteun.  Ons  spreek
die vertroue uit dat dit gepaard sal gaan met die  uitstraal  van  'n  beter
beeld van die bestryding van Vigs in hierdie krisistyd.

Ons wil die begrotingsdebat ondersteun en  die  Minister  bedank  vir  goeie
fiskale beheer, en dan ook hoop uitspreek met betrekking  tot  die  verwagte
inkomste uit privatisering, wat  dalk  minder  kan  wees,  veral  omdat  die
privatisering  van  Eskom  nie  gerealiseer  het  nie.  Daarvoor  moet   ook
voorsiening gemaak word en die nodige aanpassings gedoen word om op te  maak
daarvoor. Die AEB steun die wetsontwerp soos deur  die  Minister  voorgehou.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr  C  AUCAMP:  Madam  Speaker,  the  AEB  also  supports  the  Adjustments
Appropriation Bill and we consider it to attest to good  financial  control.
We are particularly glad to  see  that  the  amount  of  unspent  funds  has
decreased substantially and that the departments  are  displaying  a  better
expenditure capacity. We particularly support the adjustment to the  figures
that are being spent on security. We believe that if  we  can  gain  control
over the crime situation in South Africa  this  will  also  stimulate  other
aspects and make more revenue available.

The  increase  in  the  expenditure  on  local  government  should  also  be
welcomed. It will do no good if we have an inability at the  third  tier  of
government, where  it  comes  closest  to  the  lives  of  our  people.  The
increased expenditure on Aids and the combating thereof is  also  supported.
We express the confidence that this will be occasioned by the projection  of
a better image as regards the combating of Aids in this time of crisis.

We want to support this budget  debate  and  thank  the  Minister  for  good
fiscal control, and then also express hope regarding  the  expected  revenue
from privatisation, which may be less, especially because the  privatisation
of Eskom did not materialise. Provisions must also be made for this and  the
necessary adjustments must be made to make up for it. The AEB  supports  the
Bill as proposed by the Minister.]

Mr B A MNGUNI: Madam Speaker and hon members, we have  not  reneged  on  our
commitment that, together with the people we represent here,  together  with
all other communities living in South Africa, we will fight for  change  for
a better life for all. This is a duty we cannot afford to postpone.

Although the total roll-overs amount to just over 1%  of  the  total  budget
from the main appropriation, the capital expenditures, which is  worth  R220
million, were not effected last year. We, as the majority  party,  say  that
the majority of the people living on farms and in the rural areas  basically
derive their income from and live on agricultural activities, and  in  order
to do that they need land. It is therefore a very unhealthy  situation  that
16,4% or R139,6 million of Vote 28 is rolled over.
However, there were constraints. That is why  there  is  such  a  roll-over.
Time constraints, delays in processing of payment for services rendered  and
delays of invoices themselves appear to be the main causes  of  these  roll-
overs.  I  do  not  think  that  this  situation  is   acceptable   to   our
constituencies. They expect us to deliver and to deliver on  time.  However,
an additional R50 million for land restitution is greatly  welcomed  because
it indicates that a call for help has been heeded. On the other  hand,  this
does not mean that section  39(2)  of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act
should be overlooked.

Delays or roll-overs are not going to delay delivery. As I said,  only  1,7%
of the total budget for economic services and infrastructure is  rolled-over
funds, compared to the billions  of  rands  that  we  have.  This  is  quite
negligible amount. What we have is actually, in my view, healthy.

We are committed to five years of working for a better Africa and  a  better
world. Our success in Africa depends on the success of  our  continent.  The
shifting of R777 000  by  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  to  the
President's Office to set up a secretariat for  the  New  Africa  Initiative
will ensure that our continent claims its  rightful  place  in  the  world's
economy.

However, the question that we should ask ourselves is: As we  approve  these
funds, do we have  the  means  and  capacity  to  spend  them?  We  say  our
Government is a Government for the people. Our Government  is  sensitive  to
the needs of  the  people.  Departments  have  shown  great  improvement  in
implementing Government policy according to the funds appropriated to  them.
However, there is still room  for  improvement  and  there  is  a  need  for
departments  to  invest  heavily  in   human   resource   development   and,
especially, project management for effective and efficient delivery.

Although there were some departments with  roll-overs  there  was  a  budget
shortfall in the IT management programme, and this  does  not  exonerate  us
from  the  responsibility  of  providing  land  to  the  people.  We  should
therefore strive further to speed up departmental procurements in  order  to
avoid a chain reaction of events emanating from delays.

An additional R20,298 million is  provided  for  provinces  to  support  the
pilot project of preventing mother-to-child transmission of  HIV/Aids.  This
allocation forms part of an enlarged conditional grant to provinces  for  an
integrated HIV/Aids strategy. This is a key initiative which will be  funded
from savings elsewhere on the subprogramme HIV/Aids and  tuberculosis.  This
confirms our unwavering commitment to fight diseases, especially  among  the
poor.

A further R25 million from the central  allocation  for  poverty  relief  is
allocated to the Government's partnership with the Kaizer Family  Foundation
under the Love Life Programme. This partnership focuses on accessibility  of
clinics to the youth, training and funding  community  mobilisers  to  raise
youth awareness on HIV/Aids, and supports the  Love  Life  games  which  are
aimed at providing the youth with a positive message around  HIV/Aids.  This
programme is managed by the Health Trust on behalf of the Government.

South Africa's postal services are rendered obsolete by the  development  of
IT in South Africa. Hon members will agree with me that they prefer  sending
SMS messages to writing letters and posting them and  waiting  for  five  or
seven days for them to be delivered. Therefore,  the  South  African  postal
services have  stiff  competition,  as  hon  members  will  be  sending  SMS
messages to their loved ones instead of Christmas  cards  over  the  festive
season. We have to think about whether we should support the Post Office  by
writing  more  letters  and  sending  more  postcards  in  order  that   the
department to be self-sufficient.

These adjustments are actually addressing the needs  of  the  poor  and  the
majority of the masses. [Applause.]

The MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  may  I  express
appreciation to all the parties that have  supported  this  reading  of  the
adjustment estimate. I am worried about the  hon  Andrew.  He  advised  that
there would be other members of what he called the Democratic  Alliance  who
would speak after him. I did not count one other ... [Interjections.] Oh!  I
see.

Let me deal with some of the issues raised here. The first  relates  to  the
concerns about Census 2001. The pilot study was undertaken  in  March  2001,
as the report says. The results were late in coming through. We  had  worked
on a framework that was adjusted for inflation from the  1996  Census.  When
the results came up, there were certain changes  that  were  necessary,  and
amongst those was the change in ratio of  enumerators  to  supervisors  from
1:10 to 1:5 to improve on the management.

The  Geographic  Information  System  has  kicked  in.   There   have   been
difficulties but the main centre in Census 2001 advised us  that  they  have
been able to zero this down, and  there  are  still  forms  that  are  being
collected as part of a mop-up operation and in the last few days there  have
been some six thousand callers who logged calls indicating that  they  still
had forms  or  wanted  to  be  counted.  The  Statistician-General  is  less
concerned about it, but we had to take these measures in order  to  avert  a
crisis.

In respect to the issues  raised  by  the  hon  Koornhof  on  the  Financial
Intelligence Centre, all that we were doing  was  to  augment  savings  that
were there. Work  on  the  FIC  was  a  bit  uncertain,  but  now  that  the
legislation is through, proper provisioning would be available in  the  next
budget. Similarly we have the savings of R34,867 million on the  procurement
rise from overproviding, but at  the  same  time  we  are  trying  to  bring
systems in line with the  PFMA,  and,  clearly,  it  would  overstretch  the
provision on that side.

A number of speakers raised matters around roll-overs,  unspent  moneys  and
so on. Let me address  myself  particularly  to  the  comments  of  the  hon
Fankomo. I think that it is a bit of an  overstatement.  I  think  that  too
much is made of the fact that roll-overs are  provided.  I  want  to  remind
members of this House that roll-overs are applied for.  They  do  not  arise
automatically. They are  applied  for,  because  one's  planning  can  never
happen exactly within the fiscal frame of 12 months.  One  cannot  say  that
what we are planning to spend will all be spent by 31 March 2002. There  are
all manner of issues, and this document will tell members  where  there  are
invoices that arrived late, etc, and what needs to be provided  for  in  the
next fiscal year.

Similarly, as regards infrastructure, this year we provided, for  the  first
time,  a  huge  chunk  of  money  for  infrastructure  spending  that  arose
primarily  from  savings,  especially  on  debt  service  costs.  Again,  in
providing that, one would have deferments in payments over the years.

In respect of the issues raised by the hon Fankomo, I want to give  him  the
assurance  that  with  the  Institute  of  Public  Finance  and  Accountancy
training is an ongoing issue. It is not something that happens once.  It  is
an ongoing issue.  A  very  detailed  survey  of  training  needs  has  been
undertaken and the work that has been done will  cover  all  36  000  public
servants involved in the chain of decision-making in  public  finance,  from
people capturing information for the IT system all the way  through  to  the
directors-general.  It  is  ongoing.  There  will,  certainly,  be  periodic
reports to the Portfolio Committee on Finance.

I am sure that everybody is waiting to get their teeth into  the  questions,
so let me not detain the House any further. I am primarily here  to  express
appreciation for the support for the First Reading. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a first time.

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                    (Consideration of Votes and Schedule)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members the proceedings will,  as  usual,  take  the
form of a question-and-answer session.  I  shall  put  each  Vote  in  turn,
whereupon members will  have  the  opportunity  to  pose  questions  to  the
relevant Ministers.

Hon members, would you please wait until  I  recognise  you  before  putting
your questions. I shall begin and now put  Vote  1.  Please  note  that  the
Minister in the Presidency will answer the questions on this Vote.

Vote No 1 - The Presidency:

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I just want to ask this one question. We have  a
budget for the Presidency, but there is quite a lot of ...

Nee, ek kan met die agb Minister Afrikaans praat. Daar is baie uitgawes  wat
tog aan die Presidensie verbonde is, wat  nie  by  die  Presidensiebegroting
ingereken is nie. Ons  dink  aan  die  kwessie  van  die  vliegtuig  en  die
beskerming by die lughawe en ons dink aan die kwessie van sekuriteit by  die
Presidentswoning in Kaapstad. Kan die agb Minister  vir  ons  'n  aanduiding
gee  van  watter  bedrae  wat  om   die   Presidensie   wentel,   in   ander
begrotingsposte soos Verdediging en dies meer verskuil is?  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[No, I may speak Afrikaans to the hon the Minister. There are many  expenses
that are related to the Presidency which are not taken into account  in  its
budget. We are thinking of the matter of the aircraft and  security  at  the
airport, and we are thinking of the matter of security at  the  Presidential
residence in Cape Town. Can the hon the Minister give us  an  indication  as
to which amounts relating to the Presidency are  in  fact  hidden  in  other
Votes such as Defence and so on?]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY:  Madam  Speaker,  the  Minister  of  Finance
tells me that members can ask me anything.

The SPEAKER: Order! And make comments, hon Minister.

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, this is the adjustments  appropriation  debate,
in which the total amount that was given was R20 million. Perhaps Mr  Aucamp
could just repeat his question, because I received the translation late.

Mr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, ek het net gevra of die agb Minister  vir  ons
'n aanduiding kan gee van die bedrae ... [Madam Speaker, I merely asked  the
hon the Minister whether he could give us an indication of the amounts ...
An   HON   MEMBER:   Praat   Engels.   [Tussenwerpsels.]    Speak   English.
[Interjections.]]

Mr C AUCAMP: OK! I will speak English. Could the hon the  Minister  give  us
an indication of the amounts that have something to do  with  financing  the
Presidency. It is actually budgeted for under other Votes, such as  Defence,
with regard to the issue of aircraft or Foreign Affairs  -  those  types  of
things. I do not think that we have the whole picture of the expenditure  on
the Presidency by only looking at the President's Vote. There are a  lot  of
other expenses. Is there an indication of what those amounts are?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, may I  suggest  that  when  the  Vote  for  the
Minister of Defence comes up, Mr Aucamp asks him about  the  plane,  because
that falls under his budget. What falls under the budget of  the  Presidency
are those items that are dealt with directly by the Presidency.

Foreign Affairs is a separate department and  its  budget  falls  under  the
Foreign Affairs Vote, it does  not  fall  under  the  Presidency.  What  has
happened with regard to the appropriation budget, as  members  will  notice,
is that additional funds were made available to the Presidency to cater  for
the visits that are made by the President and the  Deputy  President,  since
the Department of Foreign Affairs will only pay  for  a  limited  number  of
support staff to accompany the  President  and  the  Deputy  President.  Any
additional staff that accompany the two principals would then have  to  come
out of the Vote of the Presidency. Next year I am going to sing a  song  for
Cassie, but not today.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I have heard  what  the  Minister  said,  but  I
suggest that it would be appropriate that there should be  some  interaction
and a system that would ensure that at the end of the day we have the  whole
picture of what it costs South Africa.

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, well I might be  in  a  position  to  give  the
whole picture if I knew what  the  member  wanted  in  terms  of  the  whole
picture. It seems to  me  that  I  have  to  respond  to  the  Vote  of  the
Presidency.  Where  other  departments  may  or  may  not  impact  upon  the
Presidency, it would seem to me appropriate  to  refer  those  questions  to
those particular sections, so that they  can  answer  for  moneys  that  are
allocated to them.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, with regard to  unforeseeable  and  unavoidable
expenditure under programme 3, it states here that state and foreign  visits
by the President and the Deputy President have placed an  additional  burden
on limited resources in  the  Presidency.  If  the  resources  are  limited,
should state and foreign  visits  not  also  be  limited  according  to  the
resources?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, I can tell Mr Green that the  visits  that  the
President and the Deputy President make obviously  depend  on  a  number  of
other factors and not just on whether or not the  resources  are  available.
But obviously the member is correct in the sense that one cannot  engage  in
activities which go so much beyond the  budget  that  there  is  not  enough
money to pay for them. As the member  will  notice  from  the  appropriation
budget, only an additional amount of R13 million had to  be  made  available
to cover those expenses.

The SPEAKER: Order! I take it that the Minister's offer to sing a  song  was
not a private arrangement, and I am asking the staff to  note  it  for  next
year's adjustments estimate.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, on a point  of  order:  There  are
provisions in the Constitution which are very serious and  this  House  must
take them seriously. There should be no meting  out  of  cruel  and  unusual
punishment in this House. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I think perhaps we will have comment after we have  been
entertained or otherwise, Minister Asmal.

Ms H I BOGOPANE: Madam Speaker, we need to congratulate  the  Presidency  on
actually increasing the budget for the Office on Rights of the  Child.  That
is very commendable given the realities of what children are going  through.
However, from the adjustment we learned  that  the  Presidency  had  made  a
decision that the accounting systems  for  the  Youth  Commission  would  be
separate from that of the  Presidency.  Would  the  Minister  just  indicate
whether the Presidency is going to have  monitoring  mechanisms  that  would
ensure that the Youth Commission handles the money appropriately?

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Madam Speaker, I assume Minister  Asmal  was
speaking of himself. [Laughter.] And I agree with him  that  he  should  not
sing at all.
With regard to the moneys that have been  made  available  to  the  National
Youth Commission, this commission  is  a  statutory  body  and  basically  I
cannot wait for the money to go from the Treasury via the Presidency to  the
National Youth Commission. In terms of the Public  Finance  Management  Act,
the CEO of the Youth Commission is responsible for  the  accounting  of  the
spending of that money. But we do not have in  the  Presidency  an  internal
audit committee, that will then sit with the Youth Commission and also  look
at their books and check that the moneys  that  have  been  appropriated  to
them are correctly spent.

Vote No 2 - Parliament:

The SPEAKER: Order! Are there any questions?  [Interjections.]  Not  even  a
motion from the floor to increase the budget? [Interjections.] I  am  really
disappointed, hon members. [Laughter.]

Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs:

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, with regard to  unforeseeable  and  unavoidable
expenditure on page 23 of Vote 3, there have been exchange losses  amounting
to R79 million. Of course we read that the national Treasury  has  allocated
an amount of R110 million to Foreign Affairs. But surely the  value  of  the
rand has been declining steadily against  the  US  dollar  and  the  British
pound over a period of the last few years. Surely the exchange  rate  losses
could have been more accurately predicted, or is that unreasonable?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, probably  if  we  had
the connections that Mr Green has with higher beings,  we  might  have  been
able  to  predict  it  better.  The  volatility  of  the  currency  and  the
international economic terrain is such  that  one  cannot  predict  what  is
going to happen to the currency.

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker,  my  question  is  more  or  less  the  same
regarding programme 2 under foreign relations, about the  whole  problem  of
the devaluation of the rand against the dollar. I understand the problem  of
embassies abroad and how  to  finance  them.  I  understand  the  Minister's
problems as well, but is there some percentage that they work on  when  they
make these calculations to predict more or less the  percentage?  I  suppose
they will have to do something to be able to predict  for  the  future  what
that percentage will be.
The DEPUTY MINISTER: Madam Speaker, we have attempted to  do  this,  and  in
fact we are in constant discussion with Treasury to see how we can  minimise
the impact of the volatility of the currency, but as I said earlier, it  has
been very difficult to predict  what  is  impacting  on  our  currency.  Our
macroeconomic strategy is regarded, even by the IMF and the World  Bank,  to
be one of the best of emerging economies. We  are  doing  everything  right,
but given the new globalised financial architectural system, we  still  have
not found a mechanism to control the movement of capital  as  it  is  taking
place at the moment. We hope that the transformation  of  the  international
financial architectural system will allow us to really  control  speculators
who are dealing with currencies all over the place.

Vote No 4 - Home Affairs:

Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, we refer to page 28 of the adjusted  estimates,
where it says that funds for IT-related equipment would be allocated to  the
various programmes. It is not  clear  whether  the  upgrade  of  a  movement
control system would be a priority. So the question is  whether  that  would
be  a  priority.  On  the  other  hand,  the  department  is  allocating  an
additional R7 million for the printing of passports, due  to  the  fact  the
Government printing works failed to warn that there is not enough  money  to
fill the posts at refugee receiving offices. It is also  not  clear  whether
the allocated R315 000  for  the  implementation  of  the  basic  accounting
system will be sufficient. And then the  additional  R2  million  for  legal
costs due to inadequate capacity  to  speed  up  the  harmonisation  of  the
various Acts with the Constitution  could  have  been  avoided  with  better
planning and the retaining of experienced staff. It would be appreciated  if
this question could be addressed.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, I am rather amazed because  the
hon member who asked the question is a member of the Portfolio Committee  on
Home  Affairs  and  I  think  that  the  committee  itself   did   something
unprecedented when it raised with  the  Treasury  the  whole  issue  of  the
underfunding in my department. When  the  hon  member  talks  about  whether
there should have been proper planning, I do not know what he means in  that
context. He is a member of the committee that took  the  unprecedented  step
of taking the matter of underfunding to the Treasury. [Interjections.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, just to follow up on the  reply  given  by  the
hon the Minister, I want to refer to page 27, with regard  to  the  printing
of passports. There has been an additional R7 million for  the  printing  of
passports, an increase from R10 to R20  per  blank  document,  which  is  an
increase of 100%. How is it possible  that  the  Government  printing  works
could increase the price of printing a passport from R10 to  R20  without  a
warning to a  state  department,  in  so  doing  causing  unforeseeable  and
unavoidable expenditure?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, we all appeared before  the  Ministers'  Budget
Committee and, in fact, asked for more money. But the budget  committee  has
the last word on these things. So the question  is  out  of  place  in  that
context, because I do not see how  the  hon  member  can  now  ask  me  that
question when we have to make do with what is actually given to  us  by  the
budget committee. We have to literally cut our coat according to our  cloth.
[Laughter.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, we often read  that  Home  Affairs  is  the  one
department which is underbudgeted. Can I ask the hon the Minister to  inform
this House whether he is satisfied that he  will  be  able  to  perform  his
duties as Minister with the budget he has for the rest of the year?

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, I am sure that this is an opportunity you do  not
want to miss. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, of course, I do  not  think  that  there  is  a
single Minister amongst my colleagues who is ever satisfied with what he  or
she is given. I challenge any single Minister who is satisfied.  [Laughter.]
As hon members can see, the hand that went up was that of  our  Minister  of
Finance, whose distinction is parsimony. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Let the record show that the only  Minister  who  raised
his hand was the Minister of Finance. Please note that the  Deputy  Minister
will be answering the questions on Vote No 5.

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government:

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, since the elections  in  December  2000,  the
number of councillors has decreased by some 30%, ostensibly to  save  money.
However, the wage bill for councillors has gone from R418  million  to  R756
million, an overall increase of 55%. In  addition,  the  recently  announced
increases will push the bill up even more.

The Minister has allocated R108 million  to  municipalities  which  do  need
assistance, and my question is: Will  these  municipalities  get  the  upper
limit and will the department conduct  an  audit  before  handing  over  the
money so that it is satisfied that the municipalities are functioning  in  a
responsible and accountable manner in the collection of  rates  and  service
charges?

The SPEAKER: Order! I apologise.  I  believe  the  Minister  of  Finance  is
responding to that.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, it is important  to  draw  attention
to the fact that councillors need to be remunerated in the same  way  as  we
are  as  public  office-bearers.  The  remuneration  has  now   become   the
responsibility of the Commission  on  the  Remuneration  of  Public  Office-
bearers, which is chaired by Justice Goldstone.

I do not think that any department can hold public office-bearers to  ransom
on performance. There  is  a  series  of  other  issues,  including  general
transfers. One should bear in mind that the Constitution  does  not  in  any
way allow us to minimise equitable  share  transfers  to  other  spheres  of
Government, except in severe circumstances. That applies both  to  provinces
and local government, and we cannot just behave with gay abandon in  respect
of this. In fact, if that was the case, we  might  have  to  deal  with  the
issue of some councils paying certain managers probably thrice what  Cabinet
Ministers are paid and so on. We would have to  deal  with  those  kinds  of
issues and we cannot. We need systems that would be a lot more responsive.

Part of the changes and the transitional funds are about ensuring  that  the
underpinnings are there to improve on efficiencies generally.  The  pressure
on local authorities to collect what is due,  and  not  to  create  a  moral
hazard are in place, and we will  continue  with  that.  Project  liquidity,
which provides an ongoing flow of information to the national Department  of
Provincial and Local Government is, in fact, the one test we have to  ensure
that moneys that are due to local authorities are being collected.

Dr C P  MULDER:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  an  additional  amount  of
R458 million is being budgeted for this department.  Of  this  amount,  R333
million, that is 72%, is classified  as  unforeseeable  or  unavoidable.  Of
this amount, R108 million is for an increase in  salaries  for  councillors,
R200 million for free basic services, R20 million for additional grants  and
only R5 million for disaster relief in the Western Cape due to the floods.

The question I would like to ask is: Is it not true that of the 72%  of  the
total  amount  allocated,  only  R5  million  is  really  unforeseeable   or
unavoidable? Was  it  not  foreseeable  that  the  other  amounts  would  be
budgeted for during the financial year?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, the establishment of councils  on  the  6th  of
December last year happened at a time when the Budget was already  close  to
finalisation. What has also remained in question has been  the  fiscal  base
of the newly demarcated local authorities, because one cannot just take  the
old and draw lines around them, because of the  bases  of  shifting.  And  I
think it is taking these issues into  account.  The  first  issue  that  has
arisen has been adequate remuneration of councillors. Thus  the  first  R108
million takes account of that.

In respect of the free basic services, it  is  a  new  issue.  We  tried  to
ensure that local authorities in the main will be able to provide  the  free
basic services. The horizontal division between  local  authorities  of  the
equitable share is, in fact, based on a formula that takes into account  the
number of poor people  that  live  in  that  local  authority.  As  capacity
constraints have risen, we have had to provide adequately for that.

What also arose in the demarcations is that  there  are  local  authorities,
especially district councils, where there is no  revenue  base  at  all.  We
cannot have councils  that  cannot  even  perform  the  most  elementary  of
functions. There was an instance  in  Tugela  in  Kwazulu-Natal  where  they
litigated against the Minister of Finance on the issue of  the  availability
of an equitable share. So the R20 million tries to take account of that.

I just ask that colleagues here understand that when we got  up  to  address
this House on the Budget  on  23  February  this  year,  we  said  that  the
introduction of the new system of local  government  would  require  a  fair
amount of nurturing. Nurturing and spoiling are  not  the  same  thing.  But
what we are seeing in terms of this R330 million, in the main, is  the  kind
of nurturing where we are trying to  assist  local  authorities  to  get  on
their own feet, not in the sense that  we  will  always  be  there,  but  to
ensure that we can deal with many  of  the  transitional  issues  that  have
arisen.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, my  question  is:  Regarding
the R3,3 million that has been allocated as savings, this is mainly  due  to
the delays in the filling of vacant posts. Why  is  there  delay,  and  when
will these vacancies be filled, because this has been going on  for  a  long
time?

The second question relates to the  roll-over  of  the  R81  million.  Which
projects referred to in Programme  2  under  the  heading  ``Governance  and
Development'' were  delayed  and  which  were  funded  by  the  Consolidated
Municipal Infrastructure Programme and the Local Economic Development  Fund?
We are sorry that we have to ask these  questions  in  the  absence  of  the
Minister.

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, the first one  is  always  the  difficult  one.
Part of the general administration - the Minister  for  the  Public  Service
and Administration will be able to advise on that - is that  we  are  moving
away from an approach that fixed on an establishment that one needs to  fill
vacancies and then a series of funded posts.

But I think in trying to design appropriate structures  for  the  department
we all run into the situation where we identify certain needs  that  we  are
trying to provide for. One does not always find the requisite  skill.  Every
weekend there are numerous advertisements placed in  newspapers  to  try  to
attract staff, but we would be better advised not always to  fill  vacancies
unless we have appropriate skills. So, that is on the administration side.

In respect of the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure  Programme  and  the
Local Economic Development Fund, what we saw, as  the  elections  approached
last year, were two trends.  One  trend  was  that  some  local  authorities
wanted to spend money that was not there to  try  to  catch  votes,  and  in
other instances the uncertainties  arising  from  demarcation  of  municipal
areas resulted in a slowdown of expenditure. In respect  of  infrastructure,
I would hazard that, as I am speaking, the slowdown is  still  in  evidence.
It is also there for instance in the call on funding  from  the  Development
Bank of Southern Africa. Local authorities have not been able to  get  their
infrastructure planning up to speed, and so the roll-overs  arise  in  these
circumstances. If the money is not all spent by 31 March, we must  recognise
the responsibility to try ensure that local authorities are in fact able  to
make a call on the available infrastructure spending. These  are  the  kinds
of issues that arise also in provinces, but they  are  quite  pronounced  in
respect of national Government.

Mr G SOLOMON: Madam Speaker, there has been a projected  increase  over  the
next three years for the equitable share for  local  government  and  a  36%
increase for municipal capacity-building. There  has  been  an  increase  in
municipal infrastructure and in general there is a projected allocation  for
local  government  that  far  exceeds  that  of  provincial   and   national
government. Will the Minister comment on the view  that  this  is  the  most
significant increase for local government yet in terms of  the  budget,  and
will he promise that if local government delivers he will allocate yet  more
money to it?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, the Minister of Minerals and Energy  says  that
this is not an Indian bazaar. [Interjections.] We are not  going  to  haggle
here. I do not want to stand up and make promises. But I think the trend  is
an important one. The recognition of the importance of local  government  as
the first line  of  government  in  the  everyday  lives  of  people  is  an
important one. Hitherto we have had the kind of  rule  that  required  local
authorities to raise about 95% of their own needs. I would like  to  believe
that we can return to that situation. But in order  to  get  there  we  will
have to strengthen the capacity. Part of that capacity will be addressed  in
the Municipal Finance Management Act, when it comes through  Parliament,  in
support of  shared  services  between  local  authorities  such  as  spatial
planning capabilities and so on. Part of it will also be ensuring  that  the
funds for infrastructure are spent, because if the infrastructure is  rolled
out, the  response  of  people  to  paying  services  may  be  significantly
improved.

I think the other issue where we should make a big change is  with  ensuring
that we have free basic services in all 284 local authorities that are in  a
position to deliver free basic services. The  step  change  from  the  first
tier of service is not that great and places many working  families  outside
the bounds of service affordability.

These are the challenges, and I think I should come back to the term I  used
in respect of the question raised by the hon Mulder  earlier,  and  that  is
the nurturing role we play and the responsibility that we  have  in  respect
of local authorities. So, that is not about promises, but about  recognition
of the role of local authorities and trying to assist that they  can  be  in
the best position to deliver the best quality services to our people.

Vote No 8 - Public Enterprises:

Mr R J HEINE: Madam Speaker, I will rather make a short statement  that  the
Minister can comment on. The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement reflects  a
disastrous phase of the Government's  privatisation  process.  South  Africa
has  missed  one  opportunity  after  another  to  implement  an   effective
privatisation programme.

The delays in selling Telkom and M-Cell shares mean that the  proceeds  from
privatisation will be down by 83% this year and by 18% over the three  years
from 2002 to 2004.  It  is  a  pity  that  the  2001  privatisation  process
faltered because of opposition, not because of technical  and  feet-dragging
issues, but also because of certain ideological debates. This  feet-dragging
is clearly illustrated by the long planning stage. An amount of R70  million
is now required  because  of  an  underestimated  budget  for  a  successful
commercial public offering. This unacceptable delay damages the  credibility
of Government policy positions in this regard.

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Madam Speaker, I think  the  DP  is  so
politically  insolvent  that  I  have  no  option  but  to  privatise  them.
[Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

The MINISTER: The budget for the Telkom IPO  was  unforeseen  and  therefore
unavoidable, which is why we have added R70 million. It is so  that  we  can
execute a successful Telkom IPO to educate South Africans so that  they  can
own shares  in  this  state-owned  company,  and  not  the  views  that  are
expressed by the representative of the now defunct alliance. [Laughter.]

Vote No 13 - Arts, Culture, Science and Technology:

Mr S L DITHEBE:  Madam  Speaker,  the  Government  has  identified  cultural
industries as one of the growth sectors of  the  economy,  as  well  as  the
importance of innovation in enhancing our levels of competitiveness. In  the
light of this, could the hon the Minister explain why it is that  an  amount
of R565 000, earmarked for poverty  relief  programmes,  had  to  be  rolled
over, as well as, R717 000 in respect of the  innovation  fund  trust;  R4,6
million in respect of innovation fund projects and nearly R1,1  million  for
the public understanding of science and technology? Are there any  deadlines
regarding when the committed funds have to be expended?

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Madam  Speaker,  I
would like to remind the hon member that to spend money,  one  has  to  plan
first. What has happened in all these cases is that the spending plans  were
not finalised timeously and, therefore, we have asked for  roll-overs.  Most
of the expenditure takes place in collaboration with the  science  councils,
such as the CSIR, Mintek and others. Furthermore, poverty relief  funds  are
spent in conjunction with the provinces.

We sent out a call for proposals from provinces. Some of them  responded  in
time and others did not. For instance, the Western Cape, as  far  as  I  can
remember, had not finalised its plans, nor had a  few  other  provinces.  So
that money has to be kept until the proposals and the sound  business  plans
are acceptable before it is released.

Equally so, also, with the issue of cultural industries. We have just had  a
craft indaba and there is a music task  team  report  which  has  just  come
through. But to spend the money on those projects in fact requires a lot  of
strategic planning, which has not happened. But it  will  have  happened  by
the end of the financial year.

As far as the issue of innovation is concerned, we have  a  huge  number  of
projects which have been adjudicated. But the payments  have  not  yet  been
made and we are busy transferring  the  innovation  trust  to  the  National
Research Foundation. That also takes its time. But the plans to spend  these
moneys are there and there is no danger of their not being spent.

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Aucamp, just a moment. I believe the  time  allocated
to the AEB ... [Interjections] Sorry, I had the wrong  time.  My  apologies,
you may now take the microphone.

Vote No 14 - Education:

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I do not see in the budget the exact amount  for
private schools. We had a situation earlier this year  in  which  Cosas  had
riots and so on, because of the large spending on private schools.  Can  the
hon the Minister give us an indication? It seems to me that  the  amount  is
so low that it does not even register in the Budget. Can  he  tell  us  what
the amount is and whether they will send adjustments in that regard?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam  Speaker,  the  hon  member  Aucamp  should
realise that he and his ancestors wanted that federal system. In  education,
one has that federal system. The amount does not appear  here,  because  the
educational budget is for  provinces.  Provinces  have  a  block  amount  of
money, a lump sum. It is for them to decide that. And, of course, it  varies
from province to province. In one province a private school will  get  about
approximately 1,2% to 1,5% of the provincial expenditure  on  education.  In
other provinces it will be about 4,5%, 5% or 6%.
We should remember, of course, and this is the reason we had  hearings  this
morning on the National Curriculum Statement, next door, that the  provinces
have to  implement  national  policy.  According  to  the  national  policy,
schools will not get assistance if they, in fact, charge fees four, five  or
six times the cost per student in that province. That is  a  graduated  one.
Some schools will get up to  60%  of  the  expenditure  from  the  province,
whilst others might get from 10% up to 15%.

Basically, it is an antipoverty drive to ensure that  poor  private  schools
get the Government grant. So the myth that  the  Government  is  subsidising
rich schools is a myth, and that is the reason it ought to be removed.  But,
of course, I would like to tell the hon Mr Aucamp that I want  a  much  more
unitary system. If  we  move  towards  that  the  national  department  will
allocate the money to the private schools and then next  year  or  the  year
after the amounts will appear in this Appropriation Bill.

Vote No 15 - Health:

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, of course, as far as HIV/Aids  is  concerned  we
welcome any increase in the budget. But what is worrying is  that  when  one
examines the figures, one will find that by far the  biggest  single  figure
here concerns roll-over funds. When examining  Programme  2,  the  strategic
health programmes, and the Government Aids action plan,  the  reasons  given
for the roll-overs are lengthy planning and information gathering.  I  would
just like to know whether the hon the Minister could  give  us  a  bit  more
detailed  explanation  concerning  what  the  lengthy   planning   and   the
information gathering are about?

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, as hon members know, health  is  also
a concurrent responsibility of the provinces. Therefore, when we talk  about
lengthy planning we mean that the provinces plan at different  levels.  Even
though we try and monitor them, obviously they plan at different levels.

Furthermore, the tendering processes themselves tend to be  rather  lengthy.
What has also happened is that sometimes we offer the tenders and  they  are
approved, accounts are not rendered, and, therefore, it is not possible  for
us to pay, because we just  do  not  have  the  accounts  to  pay.  This  is
something that we are trying to follow up.

One will also recall that we have reported in the portfolio  committee  that
the difficulty also emanates from  the  NGOs  because  they  have  not  been
giving us the accounts. In fact, we have had to do something  extraordinary,
to ask accountants to go right round the provinces in order to  gather  this
information so that, indeed, we do use the  finances  judiciously,  and  not
waste them.

Vote No 17 - Social Development:

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Madam Speaker, I would like to address the issue  of
the  budget  for  Social  Development,  specifically   the   back   pay   of
beneficiaries. Now the fact  is  that  when  the  budget  was  allocated  in
February this year, the policy was still that  backpay  would  only  be  for
three months. After that there was a rulling that it would be for  the  term
or period of application.

I have a reply from the hon the Minister, somewhere in  June,  stating  that
an amount of R262 214 120 was to be made available for  the  extra  backpay.
Now I do not see that in the adjustments. So I would like  to  ask  the  hon
the Minister in what way was provision made for this specific amount?
The SPEAKER: Order! I am not sure. I understand that the acting Minister  of
Social Development is going to respond.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I am pleased that there  are  more
questions for Social Development than for Education. This  matter  is  being
reviewed in the department. Of course, there are  other  outstanding  issues
concerning how far one goes retrospectively in providing for the grants.

There are also legal issues that arise and, I  think,  when  the  matter  is
finally resolved a special application will be made to the Treasury to  deal
with this issue. [Laughter.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Speaker, I see  the  Minister  of  Finance  does  not
agree. May we have his answer, please? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I think the body  language  did  give  the  answer,  but
please respond, Minister. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Yes, the  household  is  divided.  [Interjections.]
Madam  Speaker,  the  beneficiaries  of  grants  are  paid  from  provincial
budgets. Now, the adjusted  estimates  here  only  deal  with  the  national
Votes.

Look at  what  has  been  provided  to  the  provinces,  and  this  is  very
important, to ensure that provinces are better able to  provide  for  social
grants. On the one hand there are the backlogs. There  has  been  successful
litigation against social development in general. It was  brought  primarily
in respect of the Eastern Cape, but the norm has to be  applied  nationally.
On the other had there is the take-up of child support grants, essentially.

If one looks at the allocations to provinces it is not just  done  in  terms
of the norms of the normal equitable share. Provinces  that  have  a  higher
call on welfare payments, for instance, the Eastern Cape, has 22,5%  of  its
budget going to welfare as opposed to Gauteng, where it is 14%. We have  had
to tweak the formula so that the economic  component  was  reduced  and  the
welfare component raised, to ensure that provinces, between now and the  end
of the fiscal year, are better  able  to  deal  with  the  call  on  payment
backlogs.

The SPEAKER: Order! ACDP, I think it is your two minutes that have  expired.
So I cannot allow another question.
Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I would like to  ask:
How is it possible for us to keep Ministers accountable if we are given  two
minutes and there are 33 Votes? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I think you need to  raise  that  either  at
the Whips Forum or the Rules  Committee.  [Interjections.]  Order!  No,  hon
Minister Asmal, you are not getting another two minutes. [Laughter.]

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Madam Speaker, I have less of a question  and  more  of  a
plea. It relates to the regulations limiting  the  child  support  grant  to
children under the age of  seven.  I  am  pleased  to  see  that  a  healthy
appropriation has been given to social development. However,  many  children
fall in the age group between 7 and 18. My plea is:  Can  the  Minister  not
see his way clear, in future appropriations, to  do  something  about  this,
because many, many children are left out.

This relates to my second plea, which concerns the effect  of  the  HIV/Aids
pandemic on the social development budget.  I  am  sure  we  can  expect  an
avalanche of applications for grants, particularly the child support  grant,
in the wake of this pandemic. Again, I would like to  make  a  plea  to  the
Minister to see if we cannot plan ahead to ensure  that  these  children  do
not fall through the cracks, because we are increasingly  hearing  more  and
more stories of Aids orphans, in particular, falling through the cracks.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, regarding the first  question,  or
plea, there is a commission on comprehensive social  security.  I  was  told
this morning that the commission will report at the end of this month.  This
is not a matter for the Treasury. This is a  matter  of  Government  policy.
Mercifully, the Treasury does not make Government policy. The initiation  is
made by the department and goes to the Cabinet, which decides on policy.

There are enormous  expenditure  issues  to  look  at  with  regard  to  any
proposals concerning the lifting of the age. I do  not  see  the  connection
between HIV/Aids and the child support grant. The child  support  grant  has
nothing to do with this. In  fact,  the  department  has  a  very  developed
HIV/Aids  programme.  This  year  alone  it  has  spent  R13,4  million   in
assistance to provinces, and it will spend R47 million in 2002-2003 and  R51
million in 2003-2004. This  is  to  mitigate  the  socioeconomic  impact  of
HIV/Aids on vulnerable groups; to contribute to the  reduction  of  HIV/Aids
among very vulnerable groups - women, youth and children - and, finally,  to
work on appropriate policies in the provinces to look  at  the  consequences
of HIV/Aids on young people. So,  it  is  a  developing  programme  and  the
department is also involved closely with the provinces on this.

Finally, what the Minister of Finance said does not contradict what  I  said
at all. [Interjections.] I said that this was a matter  for  the  provinces.
It is a matter for the provinces. There will be an occasion, though, at  the
end, when all the legal actions are brought together,  where  the  provinces
will be under some threat as far as finance is concerned. Then,  there  will
have to be a further calculation as to how this will be met.

The SPEAKER: Order! I will not stop any party getting two for the  price  of
one. So if there are two answers, that will be permitted.

Vote No 19 - Correctional Services:

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  regarding  the  capital
expenditure  budgeted  especially  under  programme  7,  is   the   Minister
convinced that that amount will contribute to  alleviating  the  problem  of
overcrowding and bring the department more in line in terms of  the  Act  of
1988?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Speaker, I am  not  quite  sure
what the end of the question is.

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, under  programme  7  in  the
Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill,  there  is  some  R308  million  that   is
appropriated for asset procurement, maintenance and operating  partnerships.
The question to the Minister is: Will this be directed  only  at  the  Apops
system or will this money also be directed at alleviating  the  overcrowding
problem in terms of building new prisons and  upgrading  certain  facilities
that we have, so that we may be more in line with the Act of 1988?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, no, it would not simply  be  allocated  to  the
Apops system.  It  will  also  be  allocated  generally  for  relieving  the
overcrowding in prisons through dealing with the  dilapidated  prisons  that
we have. I do not know whether people realise that the prisons that we  have
at the moment are ten years old and older. Therefore, they  were  not  built
for the kind of  programmes  on  which  we  are  progressively  deciding  as
Government in terms of buildings, rehabilitation, low-cost housing,  and  so
on.

Vote No 20 - Defence:

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Speaker, the DA notes with concern the  shortfall  of
approximately R68 million for the deployment of troops in the DRC. Only  R19
million of  the  R88  million  will  be  repaid  to  South  Africa  for  the
deployment of specialist  elements  in  the  United  Nations'  organisations
mission. Now, support by Parliament and ultimately the public was gained  on
the understanding that the UN would be funding this mission.

Dit blyk nou dat die Suid-Afrikaanse belastingbetaler ongeveer 75%,  oftewel
R68 miljoen, sal betaal vir die ontplooiing van  Suid-Afrikaanse  troepe  in
die boekjaar  2001-02,  'n  aspek  wat  nooit  voorheen  duidelik  deur  die
Minister of die departement bekend gemaak is nie. Die vraag is nou  wat  dit
die Suid-Afrikaanse belastingbetaler gaan kos om te betaal vir  die  huidige
ontplooiing  van  troepe  in  Burundi  sowel   as   vir   die   voortgesette
ondersteuning in die DRK. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It seems now as if the South African taxpayer will pay  approximately  75%,
or R68 million, for the deployment of South African troops  in  the  2001-02
financial year, an aspect which has never been made clear  by  the  Minister
or the department before. The question now is what it will  cost  the  South
African taxpayer for the current deployment of troops in Burundi as well  as
the ongoing support in the DRC.]

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, first  of  all,  I  think  that  Adv
Schmidt should remember that we explained the particular  formula  that  the
UN follows when deployments take place. There is,  certainly,  a  percentage
that is higher than 50% that the UN funds.

With regard to our own experience, as South Africa, we  made  a  point  over
and over again in the course of last year that,  because  South  Africa  had
not been part of the peace support operations on  the  international  scale,
it was imperative for this country to acquire  the  necessary  equipment.  A
lot of the expenditure that he is referring  to  has  to  do  with  the  new
acquisition which we had to make  for  the  necessary  equipment  for  those
operations. It was a once-off acquisition.

With regard to Burundi, approximately three weeks ago the  Deputy  President
addressed the question at length. The point was made  quite  clear.  In  his
words, South Africa is not going to spend one cent of the  taxpayer's  money
on that  operation,  because  the  facilitator  is  raising  all  the  funds
necessary to fund the operation. Even now, there is no deviation  from  that
position.

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, the UDM applauds and agrees with  Programme  8
in  terms  of  which  the  Department  of  Defence  has  requested   certain
adjustments to honour the United Nations' mandated peacekeeping  operations.
In terms of our defence objectives and obligations, we see  these  as  being
totally unavoidable and indispensable.

I noticed that in the Minister's budget, there is no specific  reference  to
the HIV/Aids programme anywhere. Does this mean that the  Minister  believes
that there is enough funding  provided  for  dealing  with  HIV  within  his
department and the National Defence Force?
The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, the medical programmes are all  under  military
health support. All of them are embodied in  there,  and  members  will  see
that all of them fall under other subprogrammes. But,  there  is  a  further
breakdown, which is,  unfortunately,  not  included  here.  If  we  were  to
further break it down, we would be able to indicate very clearly  where  the
amount  fits  in.  It  does  not  appear  here,  but,  it  is  under   other
subprogrammes as a specific amount that has been set  aside.  Unfortunately,
it does not appear here, but we could make it available to the hon member.

Dr C P MULDER: Mev die Speaker, ek wil die agb Minister van Verdediging  vra
of hy die agb lid mnr Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk  gaan  oproep  vir  militêre
diens in Burundi, en wat die koste gaan wees - dit so sydelings. [Gelag.]

Met verwysing na die Spesiale Verdedigingsrekening wil ek die  agb  Minister
vra of dit so is dat geld verdien uit die  verkoop  van  wapentuig  van  die
SANW weer in sy begroting gestort word? My vraag aan die agb Minister is  of
hy voorsien dat die SANW nog meer toerusting gaan verkoop sodat die geld  na
hom   teruggekanaliseer   kan   word    by    wyse    van    die    Spesiale
Verdedigingsrekening? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I want to ask the hon Minister of Defence  if
he is going to call up  the  hon  member  Mr  Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk  for
military service in Burundi and what the cost will be - that is just by  the
way. [Laughter.]

With reference to the  Special  Defence  Account  I  want  to  ask  the  hon
Minister if it is true that money earned from the sale of  weaponry  of  the
SANDF is to be deposited in  its  budget  again?  My  question  to  the  hon
Minister is whether he envisages that  the  SANDF  is  going  to  sell  more
equipment so that the money could be channelled back to it  by  way  of  the
Special Defence Account?]

The SPEAKER: Order! Minister, I did promise  there  would  be  two  for  the
price of one. Now you have two questions to answer.

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, excuse me, could you say that again, please?

The SPEAKER: Order! I said I did promise the opposition that there would  be
two for the price of one. So, you have two questions to answer - the one  is
tongue in cheek and the other one is related to the budget.

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, I propose to postpone my answer  to  the  first
one, which I will deal with in due course. [Laughter.] With  regard  to  the
purchase of equipment, let me say that we relied upon  the  special  account
to finance that portion of the main acquisition for the SA National  Defence
Force relating to the strategic arms package. Now, that does not  relate  to
the acquisition that I was referring to, and which we will have to  do  from
time to time in respect of the special peace support operations.  When  that
comes up, we will always have to go back and raise money that as  unforeseen
and, perhaps, unavoidable expenditure and request funding for it.

The special account is to maintain the needs as set out in  our  mandate  to
protect the country and to maintain the necessary capabilities.

The SPEAKER: Order! Before I take questions from the New NP and  the  FF,  I
just want to read a question that was addressed to the Chair. I  would  like
to respond to it. The question was: How much  time  does  each  party  have?
Could I indicate that the ANC has 17 minutes and 40 seconds, the  DP  has  2
minutes and 55 seconds, the IFP has 6 minutes, the New  NP  has  4  minutes,
the UDM has 2 minutes, the FF has no time, the UCDP has 2 minutes,  the  PAC
has 2 minutes, the FA has 2 minutes, the AEB has 35 seconds, and  Azapo  has
2 minutes. [Laughter.]

Mr H A SMIT: Madam Speaker, in a written reply to me earlier this year,  the
hon the Minister of Defence stated  that  an  amount  of  approximately  R70
million was still outstanding from the Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  for
assistance  rendered  by  the  Department  of  Defence  during  the  general
elections in Mozambique. My question is: Is that amount  still  outstanding,
or what is the current position?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, the Department of Foreign Affairs  is  the  one
through which that money was received and passed on to the  Treasury.  As  I
stand here, I am not in a position to confirm whether that  money  has  been
collected or delivered yet. Many times in disaster situations such as  those
countries make pledges through the UN and do not live up to  them.  I  could
check that out and I would not be able to confirm it straight away.  I  know
that some of the countries still have outstanding money that is part of  the
amount that they pledged to support those disaster relief activities.

I think that I would like to take this opportunity to say that, with  regard
to the question which was raised earlier on, about the amount of  money  set
aside for the Aids programme, it is, indeed, reflected in the  Estimates  of
National Expenditure, on page 430, and the amount is R243 million.

Mr H A SMIT: Madam Speaker, I want to make it very clear that the  funds  in
question were not  for  assistance  during  the  disaster  relief,  but  for
assistance during the general elections in Mozambique.

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, I have already made the same point  that  I  am
not in a position, as I  stand  here,  to  say  whether  the  Department  of
Foreign Affairs was able to deal with that  matter  or  whether  it  remains
unresolved. As I stand here, I am not  in  a  position  to  deal  with  that
detail.

Vote No 22 - Justice and Constitutional Development:

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Speaker, the Minister has repeatedly  said  that  the
core function of the Department of Justice is the courts. The courts are  in
a mess. Today the portfolio committee was briefed  by  the  director-general
to the effect that the system of court administration in our country is  out
of date; that it is not coping adequately with the current pressures  on  it
in terms of volume of work and the expectations of the community;  and  that
the backlog of outstanding cases in the district courts is  a  whopping  120
000, in the regional courts 46 000 and in the High  Courts  approximately  1
000 cases. There are huge numbers of vacant court posts.

Yet, in this adjustment account R271 million has been taken away from  court
administration  and  given  to  the  National   Prosecuting   Authority.   I
understand that this is because the prosecutors are now being paid from  the
National Prosecuting Authority budget. But the  result  of  this  and  other
adjustments in this adjustments appropriation  in  favour  of  the  National
Prosecuting Authority is that the latter's budget has now doubled from  R415
million to R822 million. It now amounts to more than half of the budget  for
court administration, which is a mere R1,3 billion. Is this not unbalanced?
The growing National Prosecuting Authority empire seems to be a Rolls  Royce
operation compared to the court operation, which is more like a  broken-down
bakkie. Surely in a situation such  as  this,  court  administration  should
have received more funds rather than less. There is a tremendous  number  of
notch increases that have not been funded in this budget and posts that  are
occupied but not funded. I wonder if the  Minister  could  comment  on  this
situation as it appears to us from this adjustments appropriation.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Madam  Speaker,  I
am certain that the hon member will remember from  her  previous  life  that
whenever a function shifts, it does so with  its  resources.  One  does  not
keep resources where the function was and yet move the  function  elsewhere.
I suppose if the hon member is honest - and I know that  she  is  making  an
effort to be honest - she  would  accept  that  this  is  how  things  work.
[Laughter.]

While the situation in courts is not a bed  of  roses,  an  honest  observer
would give credit where it is due. People are working  very  hard  in  those
courts with minimum resources, and  yet  the  backlogs  are  being  whittled
down. They even spend their own time in the courts on Saturdays, instead  of
spending that quality time with their families. We  as  the  people  of  the
Republic of South Africa - and certainly, as public representatives - owe  a
huge debt of gratitude to these men  and  women  who  work  in  the  system,
instead of saying that the situation is a mess. [Applause.]

We accept that there are many shortcomings. By the way,  these  shortcomings
are not a post-1994 development or phenomenon. They were inherited by  those
who deemed it necessary, in their skewed wisdom, to make  11  countries  out
of one. They created  11  departments  of  justice,  11  court  systems,  11
prosecuting systems and so on, instead of one. Resources were wasted there.

The situation we witnessed with  Minister  Buthelezi  in  Mahlabathini  only
last week leaves so much to be desired. Yet, we cannot run away  from  this.
Neither can we shift functions and  keep  resources,  because  we  think  we
should use those resources where there is a greater need. If  we  did  that,
we would be acting in a manner which will be grossly improper.  We  have  no
intention to do so.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker,  the  Bible  says  those  who  have  should  not
despise those who have not. Therefore, I will ask a question  on  behalf  of
the ACDP because they do not have any speaking time left. [Laughter.]

The amount of R19 million has been allocated to the  Department  of  Justice
in respect of people who have been referred by the  courts  for  psychiatric
observation in order to determine their fitness  to  stand  trial.  Why  has
this function  been  shifted  to  the  Department  of  Justice  without  the
necessary funds? It is signed: ``The hon Green''. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I thought the clause allowing a shift to  other  parties
was still due to go through Parliament. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, for a very long time a whole lot of us -  maybe
because of our understanding of where  we  come  from  -  assumed  that  the
funding for this function came from elsewhere. This was  until  the  problem
literally descended on our laps, and uncomfortably so  too.  We  were  happy
with the way things were working. The function was, indeed, being  performed
elsewhere. But when provinces started complaining that they were  not  being
paid or, for that matter refunded for performing this  function,  it  dawned
upon us that we needed to find funding  for  this  exercise.  So  all  along
there was no need to find funding for this. It is only now that we have  had
to do so. Indeed, we are eternally grateful to the Treasury for acceding  to
our request.

Vote No 23 - Safety and Security:

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, Programme 2 talks about preventing  the  cycle
of crime. Will that include the plea from the  management  of  the  SAPS  to
allow them to increase the number of police officers  by  16  450  within  5
years? Will this be accommodated in that programme?

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, at present we  stand  at
117 000. We are pushing that by the end of this financial year there  should
be 23 000. But this is still inadequate. We have accordingly  presented  our
case to the Treasury for 16 000 additional personnel in the  next  three  to
four years. We hope that this request will be accommodated.

Adv A H GAUM: Madam Speaker, I refer  to  the  items  Crime  Prevention  and
Detective Services under ``Other Adjustments''. We  welcome  the  additional
allocation for vehicles. However, in view of the huge shortage of  vehicles,
do the additional allocations under these  programmes  only  cater  for  the
modernisation, upgrading and replacement  of  vehicles  or  is  it  also  to
reduce these shortages? If so,  to  what  extent  will  these  shortages  be
reduced in view of these allocations?

The MINISTER: Madam Speaker, at present we  stand  at  25  000.  We  have  a
complement of 25 000 vehicles.

The ideal situation would be when we reach 27 000. What has been done  right
now is that we, as a result of an additional allocation  that  the  Treasury
has given us, will be able to buy,  in  the  course  of  this  year,  6  300
vehicles, which will be a very great improvement. The  shortfall  of  1  200
for us to reach 27 000 will be addressed over the next few years.

Vote 24 - Agriculture:

Mr A J BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, in the  main  Budget  there  was  much  to  be
commended and it is therefore a major disappointment that  the  Agricultural
Research Council receives no additional  funding  now,  since  the  Auditor-
General warned earlier this year that this council  faces  collapse  in  the
absence of timeous funding.

I also wonder what the hon members who represent  the  Eastern  Free  State,
Northern  KwaZulu-Natal  and  Mpumalanga  are  going  to  report  to   their
constituencies regarding the total  absence  of  any  mention  of  the  cold
weather disaster in September this year. By all accounts this  unforeseeable
disaster will cost those areas in excess of R100 million. I must remind  the
Deputy Minister that many of the farmers who  were  affected  count  amongst
the poorest and some have lost all their stock.

Can the Deputy  Minister  enlighten  us  on  these  two  glaring  omissions,
notwithstanding the delight with which the previous Minister of  Agriculture
welcomed the medium-term provisions today?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND  AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  the
hon member, Mr Botha of the DA must  perhaps  just  remember  what  kind  of
items go into a budget such as this medium-term budget.

With regard to the ARC, if we were to allocate  more  money  now  it  should
have been tested against the test of  unforeseeability  and  unavoidability.
That is not what is at stake here at all. So I  think  that  question  falls
away. We will see what happens in the new budget in the new year.

With regard to the cold weather and the death of the  animals  in  the  Free
State and Northern Natal, that will be addressed here in  due  course,  just
as in the medium-term budget that the member has before him at  the  moment.
Some of the flood disaster money is still being expended in this budget.  So
that will come in due course. It is being processed in the  provinces,  from
where it will be coming to the Presidency and from there onwards it will  be
disbursed. There is no need to worry about it at this stage.

Vote 25 - Communications:

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker, the Minister of Communications has made  a  name
for herself as the most agile in the Cabinet by  continuing  with  flipflops
and somersaults on matters such as how many competitors Telkom should  have.
[Interjections.] She could earn herself a  place  in  the  national  Olympic
squad; not content with a grand finale she is now performing  a  magnificent
backflip on the Post Office.

The  Minister  has  failed  to  deliver  on  the  promise  of  a  break-even
organisation.  Regrettably,  it  is  the  taxpayer  who  will   suffer   the
consequences of this folly, forking out R1,5 billion  over  the  next  three
years to an organisation which already owes a  further  R1  billion  to  the
Post Bank. Moreover, yet again the ANC administration ensures that the  poor
will be the losers, as there is no guarantee that the subsidy will  be  used
to fulfil our obligations to the anti-poverty drive through roll-out.

Can the Minister explain exactly what the money has been allocated  for?  It
is high time that the Minister of Communications does the  honourable  thing
and polevaults herself out of the Government before she trips up yet again.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, I do not know if there is any  point
in responding to that young man from the brat pack. It is just a  viewpoint;
it is not a question. [Interjections.] I think that the DP is  turning  this
adjustments estimate into a circus and not  a  point  of  accountability.  I
take exception.

Vote No 26 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism:

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker,  I  would  like  to  focus  my  question  on
programme 2 on the Johannesburg World Summit.

Since South Africa will be hosting this conference, I  would  like  to  know
from the Minister whether there is, in this budget,  any  provision  for  an
awareness programme for councillors, and also the implementation  of  Agenda
21, which was passed during the Rio Conference 10 years ago?  May  I  please
be informed whether this budget provides  for  the  awareness  programme  as
well as the implementation of Agenda 21?

The SPEAKER: Order! The Minister is not present. Minister  of  Finance,  are
you taking that response?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, I am not aware  that  there  is  any
specific programme during this fiscal year. In respect of  preparations  for
next year, the Jowsco, Johannesburg World Summit Company,  and  the  general
preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, are quite  far
advanced. The Jowsco has been launched, work is being done and I think  that
colleagues would be aware of the fact that there is already  publicity  and,
in fact, a lot of activity also within the NGO community, so  much  activity
that the leadership of Sangoco, the South African  National  NGO  Coalition,
who participated in the preparations of  the  WSSD,  to  date  have  already
fallen out. So that does not cost money. It is part of the general  work  of
the department and would be covered without  making  a  specific  allocation
for it in the adjustments estimate.

Vote No 27 - Labour:

Mr N J CLELLAND: Madam Speaker, this Adjustments Appropriation Bill  is  the
second blow to real skills development this year. Earlier this year we  were
informed by the Department of Labour that Setas were only able  to  pay  out
R47 million, out of the R1,25 billion collected  through  the  skills  levy.
Now the department forfeits a  further  R50  million  earmarked  for  skills
development because Setas have not finalised their project planning in  good
time.
I think it would be appropriate to warn the department and the  Minister  of
Labour that skills development  in  South  Africa,  particularly  under  the
Setas system, is under  threat  and  demands  decisive,  capable  leadership
intervention.  Is  the  Minister  confident  that  Setas   are   still   the
appropriate vehicles for skills development, and is he confident that  their
performance will improve radically in the next period?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, the Setas, in the first  place,  are
not of Government. They are  owned  collectively  by  business  and  labour.
Therefore, the question is more appropriately addressed  to  those  sectors.
In fact, the Setas exist as a paragon of what is  possible  with  regard  to
tripartisan decision-making in skills development. All that  Government  can
do, is to provide a leading or guiding hand, and part of that  has  been  to
collect the revenues.

However, the actual programmes of implementation must be  developed  jointly
by business and labour as the key participants in the Setas. Clearly,  there
is now a failure, because big business tends to see the Setas or the  skills
development levy as a tax and that they can walk away  from  responsibility.
That requires ongoing engagement and it is a tripartite  engagement.  It  is
not of the Ministry of Labour.

Secondly, the other issue is that there  is  an  institutional  matter  that
must be addressed, ie the small and  medium  enterprises,  which  are  small
contributors to the Skills Development Fund. They are minor participants  in
the Setas, and are not advantaged by being able to draw against  the  Skills
Development Fund.

However, these are ongoing issues and part of it requires a change in  mind-
set. That change in mind-set is one that requires a commitment to  long-term
investment in human capital formation. That is about business. There  is  no
problem with the shortage of capital in this regard. It  is  about  engaging
business quite differently.

Vote No 29 - Minerals and Energy:

Mr J H NASH:  Madam  Speaker,  on  page  156,  under  the  heading  ``Energy
Management: Electricity basic services support areas'', the  report  states,
``the development of free basic electricity to consist of pilot projects  in
nodal and selected targeted urban  areas''.  Which  target  areas  does  the
department have in mind?

Secondly, will the additional funds  be  provided  from  the  Department  of
Minerals and Energy in addition to the equitable share of  local  government
to subsidise nongrid electricity systems?

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Chair, the areas where we  intend
to pilot free basic energy are in all the provinces. We  have  targeted  the
poorest areas as identified and announced by the President  earlier  in  the
year.  They  include  towns  and  villages  like  Antiok,  Makepesvlei,  Ga-
Ragopora, Gesese, Maropong, Mathopestad, Malope City, and so  on.  They  are
all in the poorest districts of the country.

About whether the free basic energy is additional to  the  equitable  share?
Yes, it is.

The SPEAKER: Order! I think that the time of the New  NP  has  expired.  Are
there any parties that wish to ask supplementary questions?

Vote No 32 - Transport:

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam Speaker, I would like to ask  a  couple  of  questions.
The first is that in the roll-overs we see for the second  time  now,  there
is  one  with  regards  to  expenditure  on  the   implementation   of   the
administration of adjudication of road traffic offences.  We  are  doing  it
for the second time now and we seek reassurance from the  Minister  that  we
will now begin to implement that amount.

Secondly, with regard to the unforeseen and  unavoidable  expenditures,  the
bulk of them are directed at addressing subsidies for public transport,  and
we certainly support that because public transport does  require  subsidies,
but one has a sense that this has become a bit of an inexact science.  Could
we have the assurance of the Minister that in future we  will  try  to  plan
much better for  the  kinds  of  subsidies  that  need  to  flow  to  public
transport?

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Madam Speaker, firstly, steps have been taken  to
ensure that the infringement agency which needs to be set  up  in  terms  of
the administrative adjudication of road traffic  offences  will  be  set  up
before the end of the current financial year. In fact, we hope that it  will
be on its feet before the end of this calendar year. There  is  progress  in
that regard.

With regard to the issue of subsidies,  this  is  a  very  difficult  issue,
because the whole public passenger transport system  is  under  scrutiny  at
the  moment  to  ensure  that  there  is  better  rationalisation  promoting
intermodalism so as to ensure that there is greater movement towards  trains
also taking into account that  the  minibus  taxi  industry  is  really  not
subsidised and present. The  whole  subsidy  system  is  under  scrutiny.  I
cannot promise  that  there  will  be  results  in  the  ensuing  year,  but
certainly, the process of developing a subsidy  system  which  benefits  the
poor and not just the operators, is under consideration at present.

Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, the SA Rail Commuter  Corporation  budget  has
reflected operational shortfalls of R100  million  and  R23,5  million  last
year. Does the Minister foresee this particular  trend  continuing  and,  if
so, how does he see it being resolved?

The MINISTER:  Madam Speaker, part of the problem with the SARCC budget  has
been that we could not foresee the extent of inflation and the extension  of
services. We have received additional allocations, for which I am  grateful,
and my hope is that our baseline allocation will make adequate provision  so
as to ensure that this problem does not recur.

  CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL: LOSS OR RETENTION OF MEMBERSHIP OF
                  NATIONAL AND PROVINCIAL LEGISLATURES BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, on  behalf  of  the  Acting  Chief  Whip  of  the
Majority Party, I move without notice:


  That the House, in  terms  of  Rule  238(3),  gives  permission  for  the
  legislative proposal to be proceeded with.

The LEADER OF GOVERNMENT BUSINESS: Madam Speaker, as  Leader  of  Government
Business, I wish to inform this House that I have noted that  the  Portfolio
Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development, working in  conjunction
with  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional   Development,   has
introduced draft legislation, namely Loss  or  Retention  of  Membership  of
National and Provincial Legislatures Bill, 2001.

The purpose of this legislation is to establish mechanisms, firstly,  for  a
member of the National Assembly or a provincial legislature  who  ceases  to
be a member of the party which nominated that member  to  retain  membership
of such legislation. Secondly, it provides for an existing  party  to  merge
with another party, or any party to  subdivide  into  more  than  one  party
whilst allowing a member of  a  legislature  affected  by  such  changes  to
retain membership of such legislature.

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and the  Department
of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  have  in  the  meantime  also   been
instructed to prepare draft  legislation  amending  section  157(3)  of  the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, and section  27  of  the
Local Government Municipal Structures Act, 1998, respectively, in  order  to
introduce similar mechanisms at local government level.

In terms of the  Constitution,  particulars  of  these  amendments  will  be
published for public comment and will  be  considered  by  Parliament  early
next year. I  have  thus  agreed  with  the  chairperson  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Justice and  Constitutional  Development,  hon  Adv  Johnny  de
Lange, that while the portfolio committee will, with the permission of  this
House, continue to process the Bill before this House, the  Bill  will  form
part of a package of amending Bills that will come before this  House  early
next year. [Applause.]

              7 April 2001.

              (Secretary  to   Parliament)   Mr   Mtutu   Masiza   (Manager:
              International Relations) and Ms  Ina  Wium  (Deputy  Speaker's
              Office).


              Inaugural Ceremony


              The Conference was opened by the President of the  Council  of
              State and the Council of Ministers of the  Republic  of  Cuba,
              His  Excellency  Mr  Fidel  Castro  Ruz,  who   declared   the
              Conference opened in an unusual 10  minute  long  speech.  The
              ceremony was also  addressed  by  the  President  of  the  IPU
              Council, Dr Najma Heptulla, the Representative of  the  United
              Nations,  Sir  Kieran  Prendergast  and  the  Speaker  of  the
              National Assembly for People's Power, Mr Ricardo Alarcon.


              Supplementary Item


              Of the seven requests received, the item proposed by Cuba  was
              agreed upon. The topic was:-
              "Contribution of  the  world's  parliaments  to  the  struggle
              against terrorism, in conformity with resolution 55/158 of the
              United Nations General Assembly"


              Item 7: Emergency Supplementary Item


              The German  delegation  put  forward  a  proposal  for  urgent
              consideration of a matter  regarding  Afghanistan.  The  topic
              was: "International action to meet the emergency situation  in
              Afghanistan, compounded by the recent destruction of  cultural
              heritage by the Taliban".


              Mr Tony Marais represented the South African delegation in the
              discussions. Ms B. Mugo from Kenya was appointed to chair  the
              proceedings of the Drafting Committee.


              The resolution called on  the  "...Taliban  to  respect  human
              rights  in  accordance   with   the   relevant   international
              declarations, conventions and covenants" and to "end the grave
              violations of  the  human  rights  of  women  and  girls,  and
              especially guarantee that women and  girls  have  unrestricted
              and equal access to  health  care,  education  and  employment
              outside the home".


              Item 3: General Debate on the political, economic  and  social
              situation in the world


              The Deputy Speaker and Mr Moss Chikane delivered  speeches  at
              the General Debate. The Deputy Speaker's speech was about  the
              Millennium Africa Recovery Program. She urged the  Parliaments
              - especially from the developed  world  -  to  understand  and
              support this African initiative on  the  basis  that  Africans
              would drive it on Africa's terms.


              The first highlights of the debate were the numerous exchanges
              between the Arab countries and Israel, which led to  a  number
              of rights of reply.


              The second was the second  address  to  the  assembly  by  the
              President Fidel Castro Ruz.  In  this  speech,  the  President
              placed particular emphasis on the situation in the  developing
              countries, noting that since the last IPU meeting  was  hosted
              in Havana in 1981, the gap between the poor and the  rich  had
              widened tremendously. The President also described  at  length
              the economic difficulties faced by Cuba as a direct result  of
              the United States embargo against his country.


              Item 4: Securing observance of the principles of international
              law in the  interests  of  world  peace  and  security  (First
              Committee)


              Messrs J H van der Merwe and Tommy Abrahams represented  South
              Africa in the Committee whose deliberations were  led  by  the
              International Committee of the Red Cross.  Mr  Van  der  Merwe
              participated in the Drafting Committee  and  was  one  of  the
              nominees to chair the proceedings. Eventually, Mr Paez of Cuba
              was appointed chairperson of the committee.


              Item  5:  Education  and  culture  as  essential  factors   in
              promoting the participation of men and women in political life
              and as prerequisites for the development of peoples


              Ms Sandy Kalyan and Mr Kobus Dowry attended the discussions of
              the debate and delivered speeches. Ms Kalyan was  subsequently
              interviewed by the Cuban television  programme  on  the  South
              Africa's aids epidemic and steps taken to combat it.


              Appointments into Committees


              Ms L. Motsumi, MP from Botswana, was elected  as  one  of  the
              Vice-Presidents  to  the  Fourth  Committee.  Ms  Motsumi  was
              replacing Ms Mavis Chidzonga who was no longer a member of the
              Zimbabwe Parliament.


              Discussion panel on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on
              the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women


              Ms Gwen  Mahlangu  attended  the  meeting  of  men  and  women
              parliamentarians whose panelists  were  members  of  countries
              that  had  already  ratified  the  Optional  Protocol  to  the
              Convention on the Elimination of All forms  of  Discrimination
              Against Women.


              On 10 December 1999 the Optional Protocol of  CEDAW  was  open
              for signature, ratification and accession.  This  Protocol  to
              the Convention entered into force on 22 December 2000.   There
              are now 18 state parties to the Optional Protocol and  it  has
              been signed by 65 State parties to the Convention.
              South Africa has signed and ratified the  Convention  but  not
              the Optional Protocol.  As a result, in  Cuba,  when  a  panel
              discussion around the  Protocol  took  place,  we  were  given
              observer  status.  At  this  meeting  Angela   King   gave   a
              presentation encouraging the IPU and its members to ratify the
              CEDAW and its Protocol and that CEDAW and the IPU were working
              together to prepare a handbook for parliaments on the Optional
              Protocol to the Convention.


              Most countries,  including  South  Africa,  committed  to  the
              ratification of the Optional Protocol. A  decision  was  taken
              that the panel was a success and at future meetings of  IPU  a
              panel discussion should be held on matters affecting women. It
              was decided  that  in  Ouagadougou  (Burkina  Faso),  a  panel
              discussion be held on `Genital Mutilations', as this  practice
              is still rife in African countries including the host  country
              to the next IPU.


              IPU Council


              During the 104th IPU Council meeting in  Jakarta,  the  Deputy
              Speaker and Mr Fjuck of Estonia were appointed  to  study  the
              audited finances of the Union and to make  a  presentation  in
              Havana. The  report  presented  by  the  two  parliamentarians
              raised a number of issues about the financial situation of the
              IPU. Among the most sticking points was  the  non-contribution
              of the United States Congress.


              The  Deputy  Speaker  held  several  meetings  with  the   IPU
              Secretariat and Mr Fjuck in order to  finalise  the  financial
              report that was tabled to the Council. Parliaments need to pay
              attention to the financial position of  the  IPU.  A  possible
              increase to the financial  contributions  cannot  be  avoided.
              With the USA in arrears (its contribution amounts  to  15%  of
              the Budget of the IPU), the country is due to be removed as  a
              member in terms of the Rules of the IPU.


              Bilateral Meetings


              The Delegation was involved in  numerous  bilateral  meetings.
              The Deputy Speaker attended a  working  lunch  of  Leaders  of
              African delegations called by Speaker Adjetey of Ghana.


              There was a meeting with the Leader of the Swedish delegation,
              in that country's capacity as Chair of the European Union. The
              discussions  mainly  centered   on   the   forthcoming   World
              Conference Against Racism to be held in  Durban  in  September
              2001.


              The Deputy Speaker held separate lengthy discussions with  the
              Deputy Speaker and the Speaker of the  National  Assembly  for
              People's Power of Cuba.


              The Delegation  received  a  briefing  about  the  nature  and
              character of the Cuban political system.  The  briefing  dealt
              with local  government  elections,  parliamentary  system  and
              civil society organisation. The Delegation  was  afforded  the
              opportunity to ask questions and interesting discussions  took
              place as a result.


              Other Activities


              Mr T. Abrahams was delegated  to  join  delegates  from  other
              countries on a visit to  the  Cuban  Medical  School.  It  was
              illuminating to learn about the extent of the role  played  by
              Cuba  in  training  Cubans  and   prospective   doctors   from
              practically every country in Latin America. In Cuba the  state
              covers  all  costs  incurred  in  the  training  of  students,
              including non-Cubans. It was reported that, in Cuba, a  doctor
              is available for every 250 members of the population.


              Mr M Chikane joined the visit to Cuban Sports Institute. After
              the visit, Mr Chikane commented that  "Cuba  knows  those  who
              wish to survive tomorrow, plan yesterday and plant today".  He
              also  mentioned  that  the  open  door  policy  of   Cuba   to
              international youth to study sport was a priceless course that
              would put that country ahead of other countries who invest  in
              other  things.  This  endeavour   encapsulates   international
              relations, tourism and friendship for the nations to come.


              At the last meeting of the  delegation  an  honourable  member
              confessed that he had come to Cuba with a  negative  attitude.
              He went on to say he was going  away  with  positive  memories
              about the country.

        it, recommends that the House, in terms of  section  231(2)  of  the
        Constitution, approve the said Treaty.

4.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Hague Conference Statute  on  Private  International
     Law, dated 7 November 2001:


        The Portfolio Committee on Justice and  Constitutional  Development,

     Report to be considered.

5.    Eighth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated  24
     October 2001:


     The Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,  having  considered  and
     examined the extensive written and verbal evidence  from  the  National
     Commissioner of the SA Police Service regarding  the  Auditor-General's
     Reports on the SA Police Service and the  Secretariat  for  Safety  and
     Security for the 1998-99 and  1999-2000  financial  years,  and  having
     briefly reviewed parts of the Auditor-General's Report  for  2000-2001,
     reports as follows:


     A.     Background


         The  Committee  welcomes  the  National   Commissioner's   personal
         commitment to improving  financial  management  and  accountability
         within a Department with a budget of approximately  R14,5  billion.
         The Committee  also  welcomes  the  National  Commissioner's  frank
         acknowledgement  regarding   areas   where   problems   are   being
         experienced. The  Committee  noted  that  significant  improvements
         have taken place in a number of areas, inter alia as  a  result  of
         the introduction of the Integrated Strategic Plan last year,  aimed
         at addressing areas of  deficiencies  identified  in  the  Auditor-
         General's Report. Particularly welcome is  the  reported  reduction
         in the number of staff members on paid suspension from 624 to  184,
         the absenteeism figure that has been managed down, as well  as  the
         reduction in the number of  trained  members  doing  administrative
         work. The Committee eagerly looks forward to  confirmation  by  the
         external auditors of the improvements, and  to  future  reports  by
         the National Commissioner of such improvements, as a result of  the
         corrective strategies.


         The Committee further welcomes the quarterly reports  furnished  to
         it and the Auditor-General  by  the  National  Commissioner,  which
         afford the Committee the opportunity to  follow  developments  with
         more regularity.
         The issues mentioned below are specific areas still of  concern  to
         the Committee.


     B.     Audit Committee and Internal Audit


         The Committee noted comments  by  the  National  Commissioner  that
         progress is  being  made  with  the  implementation  of  the  PFMA,
         including  the  appointment  of  a  Chief  Financial  Officer,  the
         Internal Audit function and the compilation of applicable  internal
         prescripts as required by the provisions of the PFMA.


         However, the Committee  noted  the  delay  in  the  appointment  of
         appropriately skilled individuals to the Internal  Audit  function,
         as well as the difficulties arising from  the  composition  of  the
         Internal Audit committee, which did not comply with the  provisions
         of the PFMA.


         The Committee further noted that,  while  progress  is  being  made
         with  the  Audit  Committee,  as  highlighted   by   the   National
         Commissioner, interim steps should have been  taken  to  ensure  an
         acceptably composed and functioning internal audit unit due to  its
         importance as a tool  to  assist  management.  (See  recommendation
         L.3.)


     C.     Management of assets and debt control


         The Committee has noted that, in terms of pararagraph 3.3.  of  the
         Auditor-General's Report on the financial year ending on  31  March
         2001, numerous weaknesses in logistical management  were  reported.
         The Committee heard evidence at the hearing on 20  June  2001  that
         progress has been made with regard to certain of these  matters  as
         well as with the required reporting and control  measures  relating
         to  debt.  The  Committee  expects  further  improvement   in   the
         management  of  long  outstanding  debt.  It  is  hoped  that   the
         improvements reported  by  the  National  Commissioner  during  the
         hearing will be reflected in the next annual report.


         With regard to the Provisioning Administration  System  (PAS),  the
         Committee noted that the shortcomings of this  system  as  well  as
         the shortcomings of the existing Workshop Accounting System do  not
         appear to sufficiently equip the police to keep adequate  track  of
         assets and to  capture  sufficient  amounts  of  data  on  existing
         assets. The Committee further noted that  the  SAPS  are  currently
         phasing in a new Workshop Accounting System that is  to  be  rolled
         out nationally. The Committee wishes to express  its  concern  that
         the PAS in particular does not seem to be in full  compliance  with
         the provisions of the PFMA. (See recommendation L.4.)


     D.     Unauthorised expenditure


         1. R116 737 000 (1996-97) and R3 405 508 (1997-98)


              Over the last three years the Committee had requested from the
              Department  further  information  relating   to   unauthorised
              expenditure for the financial years 1996-97 (R116 737 000) and
              1997-98 (R3 405 508). Having  considered  further  information
              submitted by the National Commissioner, and  having  concluded
              that the expenditure  was  in  line  with  the  goals  of  the
              Department and that no one had unduly benefitted in  any  way,
              the Committee  recommends  that  the  amount  in  question  be
              authorised or validated by Parliament.


         2. R189 000 (1998-99)


              The Committee noted that in terms of an  amount  of  R189  000
              (1998-99) for consultants that emanated from the Department of
              Justice, a  reply  from  the  State  Tender  Board  was  still
              outstanding.  The  Committee  awaits  further  information  by
              January 2002 from  the  National  Commissioner  regarding  the
              State Tender Board's long outstanding view on the  matter,  as
              well as other steps that the National  Commissioner  plans  to
              take in this regard.


     E.     Fuel and oil


         Fuel cards and the vehicle  fleet  management  system  has  been  a
         concern to the Committee for  a  number  of  years.  The  Committee
         noted  the  assurance  by  the  National  Commissioner  during  the
         hearing on 20 June 2001 that the  automated  fuel  card  system  is
         under control. It further noted that no losses and shortcomings  of
         closed-down fuel sites would be written  off.  (See  recommendation
         L.5.)


     F.     National Secretariat for Safety and Security


         The Committee noted the finding  by  the  Auditor-General,  in  his
         Report on the 2000-01 financial year, that  clarity  regarding  the
         position and functions of the Secretariat needed to be obtained  in
         order to ensure the effective civilian oversight of the  SAPS.  The
         Committee also noted that in the 1999-2000 financial year,  unspent
         funds amounted to R12,1 million (48,6%).


         The Committee further noted the Department's implementation of  the
         Minister's directives that the  Secretariat  be  rationalised.  The
         Committee, however, notes the slow progress made  in  rationalising
         the secretariat, including its structure, within  the  bigger  SAPS
         structure,  its   budget   and   resource   allocations   and   the
         accountability thereof. (See recommendation L.6.)


     G.     PERSAL


         The Committee has noted that the PERSAL  system  produced  valuable
         management  information   relating   to   personnel   and   related
         expenditure. Given the magnitude of the  personnel  expenditure  of
         the SAPS and the Department's exposure to related liabilities  such
         as leave, medical aid and housing guarantees, the Committee  wishes
         the National Commissioner to note the recommendations in  paragraph
         L below. (See recommendation L.7.)


     H.     Dog School: Pretoria


         The Committee noted the concern once again raised by  the  Auditor-
         General  that  the  Dog  School  was  not  functioning   optimally.
         However, the Committee accepts  the  undertaking  of  the  National
         Commissioner that the identified problems will be addressed in  the
         integrated strategic plan of the SAPS, scheduled  for  finalisation
         by July 2001, a copy of which should be submitted to the  Committee
         and  the  Auditor-General  by  the  end  of  December  2001.   (See
         recommendation L.8.)
     I.     POLMED


         The Committee noted that  the  National  Commissioner  appointed  a
         team in January 2001 to conduct  a  full-scale  investigation  into
         the functioning of POLMED. The Committee  further  noted  that  the
         results of this investigation have been submitted to the  Board  of
         Trustees in order to develop a  target-linked  implementation  plan
         to be submitted to the National Commissioner.


     J.     Consultancy services


         The Committee noted that an  internal  forensic  investigation  had
         been conducted. The Committee and the  Auditor-General  received  a
         copy of the report of that investigation, which  will  be  reviewed
         (to be held in abeyance until Cluster 1 has reviewed  the  internal
         forensic investigation report).


     K.     PMG accounts


         The Committee noted progress made in respect of the  implementation
         of POLFIN (Police Financial System) and the comments  made  by  the
         SAPS that the efficiency increases due to  POLFIN's  implementation
         will impact on the  PMG  Account.  The  Committee  will  track  the
         progress in this regard in the quarterly reports, which are  to  be
         submitted to it.


     L.     Recommendations


         In view of  the  above  comments  and  conclusions,  the  Committee
         recommends that:


         1. The Auditor-General, during the  2001-2002  audit,  ensure  that
              the audit plan include those areas highlighted by the National
              Commissioner  and  Management  as  areas  of  improvement   or
              weakness (see paragraph A: Background).


         2. The National Commissioner continue to submit quarterly  progress
              reports, but that in  the  interest  of  expediency  these  be
              furnished in a standardised format,  to  be  provided  by  the
              Committee secretariat.


         3. The Committee be  informed  whether  the  four  vacant  internal
              auditor posts have now been  filled,  and  who  the  permanent
              Chairperson and members of the Audit  Committee  now  are,  as
              well as how many meetings are planned by the Committee for the
              remainder of the financial year. In  addition,  the  Committee
              should indicate what key performance results it expects of the
              internal audit for the 2001-02 financial year. In the event of
              permanent appointments not yet having been made to either  the
              Audit Committee or the internal audit unit, interim steps  are
              taken  to  ensure  an  acceptable  composition  and  a   well-
              functioning Committee and  that  progress  be  reported  on  a
              quarterly basis.


         4. The accounting officer report  within  two  months  on  progress
              made with regard to his full compliance with the  requirements
              of section 38(1)(c) and (d) of the PFMA regarding  debtor  and
              fixed asset management, including -


              (a)  the  reliability  of  the  information  provided  by  the
                  Provisioning Administration System (PAS),  especially  the
                  impact of modifications to the  current  systems  and  the
                  associated   risks   created   by    and    during    such
                  modifications;


              (b) the  utilisation  of  such  debtor  and  asset  management
                  information by management;


              (c) progress made  with  PAS  training  against  predetermined
                  milestones;


              (d) management's use of age  analysis  of  debtors  (including
                  advances) and resultant action; and


              (e) the extent of completion and success of the implementation
                  on the new Workshop Accounting  System,  and  whether  any
                  quality assurance process has been carried  out  regarding
                  the implementation process.


         The Committee further recommends that:
         5.  In  the  quarterly  reports,  the  National  Commissioner   and
              Management indicate progress made with the fuel  card  system,
              management  of  all  fuel  depots,  and  whether  all  stocks,
              including fuel, are properly controlled and accounted for.


         6. The Committee be fully informed  in  the  quarterly  reports  on
              progress  made  with  the  rationalisation  process   of   the
              Secretariat, with special reference to the  issues  raised  in
              paragraph  F  above,   indicating   the   planned   date   for
              finalisation.  The  Committee  further  recommends  that   the
              Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security consider the entire
              matter of the rationalisation of the National Secretariat  for
              Safety and Security, given the emphasis which section  208  of
              the Constitution places on its role  and  the  high  level  of
              unspent funds.


         7. In respect of PERSAL, the National Commissioner -


              (a) fulfil his responsibility of ensuring  that  the  National
                  Treasury is  regularly  informed  of  the  SAPS'  specific
                  PERSAL needs so that these can be updated;


              (b) scrutinise all available exception reports on  PERSAL  and
                  take appropriate steps thereon;


              (c)  if  necessary,  arrange  workshops  for  relevant   staff
                  presented by the National  Treasury  on  PERSAL  features;
                  and
              (d) ensure that State guarantees  of  staff  members  who  had
                  resigned, are always redeemed or recovered.


         8. Detail on corrective  steps  implemented  at  the  Pretoria  Dog
              School be reported in quarterly reports to the Committee.


         9. Given the prominence of  POLMED's  related  expenditure  in  the
              SAPS vote, both the results of the investigation  into  POLMED
              called for  by  the  National  Commissioner  as  well  as  the
              implementation plan drafted by the Board of Trustees of POLMED
              be furnished to the Committee in the next quarterly reports.


     Report to be considered.

6.    Ninth Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated  24
     October 2001:


     The Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,  having  considered  and
     examined the Report of the Auditor-General on the financial  statements
     of Vote 10 - Education for the year ended 31 March 2000  [RP  119-2000]
     and certain papers referred to it, reports as follows:


     Financial management


         1. Fraud Prevention Plan


              The Committee took cognisance  of  the  fact  that  the  fraud
              prevention plan was not yet presented to the National Treasury
              and certain processes still needed to be concluded.


              The Committee therefore recommends that everything possible be
              done to implement the proposed fraud prevention plan  as  soon
              as possible, and that the Accounting Officer  report  back  to
              the Committee on the progress  made  thereon  by  31  December
              2001.


         2. Appointment of Chief Financial Officer (CFO)


              The Committee is concerned that a CFO was not appointed in the
              Department by 1 April 2001, in terms  of  the  PFMA.  However,
              having  heard  evidence  presented  by  the  Department,   the
              Committee took cognisance of the fact that  the  CFO  will  be
              appointed by the end of 2001.


              The Committee therefore recommends that  the  Department  take
              all the necessary steps to ensure the  appointment  of  a  CFO
              with the appropriate skills, qualifications and experience  by
              the end of December 2001, and report to the Committee  by  the
              end of January 2002 on the matter.
         3. Internal audit and Audit Committee


              The Committee took note of the  Accounting  Officer's  concern
              about the limited financial management expertise available  in
              the public sector. Given the implementation of the PFMA,  this
              expertise is becoming available only at a premium that may not
              be affordable in terms of the public sector salary scales.


              The Committee recommends that the Accounting Officer persevere
              with the  actions  aimed  at  improved  financial  management,
              specifically with regard to the following:


              (a) To ensure that the Audit Committee fully complies with the
                  requirements of section 77 of the PFMA.


              (b) To bring the Internal Audit Component up to full  strength
                  and  ensure  continuous  professional  training  for   the
                  relevant staff. The Department  should  seek  advice  from
                  the Monitoring Unit: Internal Audit and Audit  Committees,
                  established within the Office of  the  Accountant-General,
                  on the adequacy  of  staffing  the  Department's  Internal
                  Audit Unit in terms of generally accepted benchmarks,  and
                  report to the Committee in  this  regard  by  31  December
                  2001.


              (c) To  tighten  relevant  control  measures  to  prevent  any
                  irregularities regarding cash cheques.


              The Committee further recommends that  a  progress  report  be
              submitted regarding the finalisation of  the  Risk  Assessment
              Plan by 31 December 2001.


         4. Special audit investigation at six universities


              The Committee expressed its satisfaction on progress  made  in
              respect of the previous resolution [Paragraphs 4(1) and (2) of
              Sixth Report, 2000]. However, the Committee is still concerned
              that some of  the  universities,  which  formed  part  of  the
              special audit investigation, do not seem to have the  capacity
              to carry out the corrective steps  set  out  in  the  business
              plans  developed  as  a  result  of  the  special  audit.  The
              Committee further notes the appointment of  administrators  at
              two of the six universities. Also, the Committee  again  notes
              that section 41A of the Higher Education Act,  1997,  empowers
              the Minister of Education to intervene in cases of  "financial
              or other maladministration of a serious nature".


              The Committee therefore again recommends that:


              (a) The Department supply the Committee with bi-annual reports
                  on progress made at the two universities.


              (b) The Department  continue  its  endeavour  to  establish  a
                  process of  greater  control  over  funds  transferred  to
                  higher education institutions, especially in the light  of
                  the  autonomy  of  the  universities,   thereby   ensuring
                  greater accountability and the possible prevention of  the
                  need for the Minister to intervene in  the  administration
                  of the universities in terms of section 41A of the  Higher
                  Education Act, 1997, the Committee to be kept  abreast  of
                  developments in this regard.


              (c) Where there are clear signs of maladministration at higher
                  education institutions, the Minister of Education  at  all
                  times  be  kept  informed  timeously  by  the   Accounting
                  Officer in order for the  Minister  to  consider  when  it
                  would be appropriate to invoke section 41A of  the  Higher
                  Education Act.


         5. Transfer payments


              The Committee notes that more than  90%  of  the  Department's
              total budget is transferred to higher education  institutions.
              Although  during  the  hearing  the  Committee  expressed  its
              satisfaction  on  the  control  measures  instituted  by   the
              Department, it whishes to  stress  that  strict  adherence  to
              Treasury Regulation 8.4 is required, as it is meant to provide
              assurance to the  tax-payer  that  departments  exercise  some
              element of control over money transferred to outside bodies.


         6. Savings/underspending
              The Committee noted the explanation and evidence given by  the
              Accounting  Officer   with   regard   to   the   savings   and
              underspending, and is  encouraged  by  the  implementation  of
              control mechanisms by the Department in this regard.  However,
              the  Committee  wishes  to  alert  the  Department  about  the
              difference between savings and underspending: Whereas  savings
              is generally encouraged, underspending is normally  indicative
              of poor planning and management.


              The Committee therefore recommends that the Accounting Officer
              continuously monitor underspending and take  active  steps  to
              minimise the percentage of underspending.


     Report to be considered.
7.    Tenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated  24
     October 2001:


     The Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,  having  considered  and
     examined the Reports of the Auditor-General on the financial statements
     of Vote 17 - Home Affairs for the year ended 31 March 1999 [RP  141-99]
     and Vote 16 - Home Affairs for the year ended 31  March  2000  and  the
     Performance Audit of the Migration Process [RP 125-2000],  as  well  as
     certain papers referred to it, reports as follows:


     A.     Unauthorised expenditure


         1. 1998-99 financial year, R808 753


              Unauthorised expenditure amounting to R705 758,38 was incurred
              during the 1998-99 financial year and comprises the following:


              (a) An amount of R620  307,07  in  respect  of  attorney  fees
                  related to the case of  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs
                  versus K Baranato  because  the  appointment  was  not  in
                  accordance with the provisions of the State Attorney  Act,
                  1957.


              (b)  An  amount  of  R85  451,31  in  respect  of  rental  for
                  accommodation  for  two  district  offices  due   to   the
                  Department's inability to obtain a signed lease  agreement
                  from the Department of Public Works.


              Unauthorised expenditure amounting to R102 994,62 was incurred
              during the 1997-98 financial year in respect of attorney  fees
              for the same purpose and on the same conditions as referred to
              in paragraph (a) above.


         2. 1999-2000 financial year, R19 168 463,82


              Unauthorised expenditure totalling R19 168 463,82 was incurred
              and comprises the following:


              (a) An amount of R1 139 430,08  in  respect  of  a  television
                  commercial ran  by  the  national  television  broadcaster
                  during the period 11 to 29  January  1999,  for  which  no
                  State Tender Board approval  was  obtained.  Although  the
                  services were rendered during the 1998-99 financial  year,
                  the expenditure incurred was only settled during the 1999-
                  2000 financial year.


              (b) An amount of R13 803 863,74 in respect of  expenditure  in
                  excess of the voted funds which is mainly due to,  amongst
                  others, lack of funds as a result of  supernumerary  staff
                  for which funds were not allocated and an increase in  the
                  allowance of officials abroad,  due  to  foreign  exchange
                  fluctuations.


              (c) An amount of  R4  225  170  was  incurred  in  respect  of
                  payments made for the chartering of  flights  for  illegal
                  immigrants.  This  expenditure  was  incurred   prior   to
                  obtaining approval from the State Tender Board to  deviate
                  from the required tender procedures.


              Although the Committee  is  satisfied  with  the  explanations
              provided by the  Accounting  Officer  regarding  each  of  the
              instances of unauthorised expenditure reported, the  Committee
              expresses its dissatisfaction at  the  Department's  disregard
              for State Tender Board directives.  It  is  unacceptable  that
              rules and regulations are contravened, even in cases where the
              projects achieve a desirable objective.


              In expressing the above sentiments, the Committee notes  that,
              with regard to the  unauthorised  expenditure  for  the  years
              mentioned, the following issues need to be borne in mind:


              *Technical non-compliance


              *Services/goods were rendered/received


              *Value for money were received


              *The State had suffered no loss.


              The  Committee  therefore  recommends  that  the  unauthorised
              expenditure for the 1998-99 financial year (R808 753) and  for
              the 1999-2000 financial year (R19 168 463,82) be authorised by
              Parliament.


              The Committee further recommends that the Accounting  Officer,
              with  regard  to  the  expenditure  incurred  in  repatriating
              illegal immigrants:


              *Provide documentation to the Committee where the State Tender
                Board has agreed to extend this contract.


              *Give written feedback to the Committee  with  regard  to  the
                negotiations with the South African National Defence Force.


              *Inform the Committee on the status of  this  contract  by  31
                December 2001.


     B.     Internal control - Market Street Regional Office


         The Committee heard evidence relating to the reported  shortcomings
         in the internal  control  system  at  the  Market  Street  Regional
         Office. It is encouraging to note the  corrective  steps  taken  by
         the  Department  to  prevent   a   recurrence   of   the   reported
         shortcomings. However, the  Accounting  Officer  is  reminded  that
         internal control forms one of the pillars  of  effective  financial
         management in any organisation, and therefore the Committee  cannot
         over-emphasise its importance.


         The  Committee  noted  the  Accounting  Officer's   comments,   and
         therefore recommends that the Accounting Officer,  by  31  December
         2001, provide the Committee with:


         1. A progress report on the implementation of LOGIS.


         2.  A  status  report   on   the   Market   Street   establishment,
              particularly on the issue of supervision.


     C.     Government Printing Works
         1. The Committee  notes  that  the  only  outstanding  matter  with
              regard to the closure of the Umtata Printing Works is a number
              of security personnel that  have  not  been  transferred.  The
              Committee recommends that the Accounting  Officer  bring  this
              matter to a close and submit a final report to the  Committee,
              which includes  the  total  amount  of  fruitless  expenditure
              incurred in the closing of the Umtata Printing Works.


         2. The Committee further recommends  that  the  Accounting  Officer
              provide it with:


              (a) The actions taken and a status report on the overdraft  of
                  the Paymaster-General Account.


              (b) A progress report on the steps introduced to minimise  the
                  outstanding debt by 31 December 2001.


     D.     Performance audit of migration process


         The Committee noted the matters referred  to  in  the  Report  with
         regard  to  the  process  of  collecting  outstanding   debt   from
         carriers, the recovering of cost  for  repatriation  of  prohibited
         persons, the availability of equipment  and  documentation  at  the
         Lindela Detention Camp and the general condition  of  equipment  at
         the Johannesburg International Airport.


         Having  heard  and  considered  further  evidence   submitted   and
         explanations given by the Accounting Officer on  the  key  findings
         mentioned  in  the  Report,  the  Committee  recommends  that   the
         Accounting Officer submit a detailed report  on  the  following  by
         the end of December 2001:


         1. Specific actions aimed at the  collection  of  outstanding  debt
              centrally, an implementation plan for  these  actions  and  an
              assessment of the steps implemented.


         2. Progress made in  modifying  the  immigration  code  to  address
              cases of non-compliance.


         3. The progress and results of  the  negotiations  with  Mozambique
              and Zimbabwe to ensure that  prohibited  persons  reach  their
              destination.


         4. All cost implications  and  expected  savings  of  the  proposed
              changes in the structure at the Lindela Detention Camp and  of
              the management of such a facility by the Department itself.


         5. How and when the Department  envisage  to  revisit  the  current
              migration system to ensure that it complies with all the needs
              and requirements the Department is confronted with.


         6. The progress made in establishing agreements with ACSA and  SARS
              to improve, maintain and secure  facilities  and  controls  at
              ports of entry.


     E.     Accounting Officer


         The  Committee  is  concerned  that  the  currant  status  of   the
         Accounting Officer remains uncertain, as this may  impact  on  good
         governance and financial management within  the  Department.  These
         issues could include expenditure incurred,  contracts  and  tenders
         entered  into  and  other  administrative  matters.  The  Committee
         therefore asks Parliament  to  request  the  appropriate  executive
         authority to take the necessary steps to clarify the status of  the
         Accounting Officer as soon as possible.


     Report to be considered.

8.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Housing on  Gauteng  study  tour,
     dated 14 February 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Housing having undertaken a  study  tour  to
     Gauteng on 29 September 2000, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The Committee has decided to embark on the provincial study  tours,
         as a means to fulfill its monitoring and  oversight  function.  The
         Committee intended to establish the progress made on  the  "Housing
         the Nation" programme and, have exchange  of  experience  with  the
         Legislature and hear the feelings of people  on  the  ground  about
         the programme.


     B.     Findings


         1. Meeting with MPLs and officials of Department of Housing


              The Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Housing  welcomed
              members of the Portfolio  Committee  to  the  Legislature.  He
              indicated that  the  Legislature  has  passed  the  provincial
              Housing Act  in  1998.  The  Act  established  the  Provincial
              Housing Advisory Board.


              The Chairperson also submitted the department's annual  report
              for 1999-2000. The report addressed issues  such  as  economic
              development strategy, construction of housing on  well-located
              land, the housing backlog and the provincial waiting list. The
              department has a programme of priorities:


              *Greenfields Housing schemes


              *Mass housing projects


              *In-fill housing scheme


              *Employer-backed housing scheme


              *Informal settlement upgrading scheme


              *Institutional housing (rental and high density)


              *Enforcement of housing norms and standards.


         2. Briefing on projects and site visit


              (a) Tsutsumani (All African Games Athletics Village)


                  Background


                  In September 1999, South Africa was awarded  the  7th  All
                  Africa Games, scheduled to take place in  Johannesburg.  A
                  site  in  Alexandra  Far  East  Bank  was  identified   as
                  suitable for constructing a village for  the  athletes.  A
                  total number of 1 799 housing units  were  constructed  to
                  accommodate athletes and their  supporting  staff.  Tshepo
                  Development Corporation was an  appointed  constructor  to
                  build the village.


                  The Gauteng Department of Housing  assisted  by  providing
                  subsidies to construct  housing  to  accommodate  athletes
                  during the Games. On completion of the Games, these  units
                  were to be transferred in terms of  institutional  subsidy
                  arrangements to qualifying beneficiaries.  The  Department
                  also provided the service of a project manager during  the
                  construction process. The institutional  housing  subsidy,
                  based on 1 799 units, was R31,28  million.  The  estimated
                  total development cost was R90 million.  The  balance  was
                  obtained through external arrangements.


                  Current status


                  SEMAG  Housing  Corporation   was   established   by   the
                  developer  as  the  housing  institution  to  manage   the
                  housing  stock.  SEMAG  experienced  isolated   cases   of
                  illegal occupation as early as May 2000. In July  2000,  a
                  large-scale invasion took place  in  unoccupied  Alexandra
                  FEB Phase 2 of Tsutsumani. An application  for  an  urgent
                  court order to evict illegal  occupants  was  granted.  In
                  Tsutsumani  village  there  were  250  illegal  occupants.
                  During the invasion,  incidents  of  vandalism  and  theft
                  occurred. The categories that received  urgent  attention,
                  were those where occupation  had  not  yet  occurred.  The
                  reasons for units not being occupied, were mainly:


                  *    Subsidies have not been approved.


                  *     The  beneficiary  has  not  yet  paid  the  required
                    deposits.


                  *    Beneficiaries cannot be traced, are deceased, etc.


                  *    Beneficiaries complying  with  all  requirements  are
                    not  willing  to  occupy   allocated   units   due   to
                    intimidation.


                  *    The invaders physically remove beneficiaries  who  do
                    occupy their allocated units.


                  Currently beneficiaries on the waiting  list  are  matched
                  against the type selected  and  their  affordability.  The
                  department  expected  to  allocate  the  remaining  vacant
                  housing units by the end of September 2000.


              (b) Carr Gardens Rental Housing Project


                  The Carr Gardens Rental Housing  Project  was  hatched  in
                  May 1998, when Cope Housing Association  was  selected  as
                  the  preferred  housing  association  by  the   developers
                  (Ginker), and elected to offer  the  Johannesburg  Housing
                  Company  a  portion  of  the  land  which  the  provincial
                  government  had  made  available  for  affordable  housing
                  development.


                  Subsidies were  approved  for  the  project  in  September
                  1999.  The  government  contribution  was   27%   of   the
                  development cost, the balance of  which  came  from  funds
                  raised by the company through the Flemish government.


                  Carr Gardens  provided  access  to  good  quality  housing
                  through    the    conventional    rental-housing    model.
                  Beneficiaries signed  a  lease  agreement  that  regulated
                  their rights and  obligations.  The  Johannesburg  Company
                  with which tenants entered into  agreements,  was  defined
                  as a  "social  landlord",  because  the  company  provided
                  accommodation to a low-income group with state  subsidies.
                  The company reinvested the profits in the  development  of
                  further rental housing.


                  Carr Gardens provided an excellent example of  what  could
                  be done to integrate new affordable housing into  existing
                  urban fabric in an  interesting  and  enriching  way.  The
                  site of the project  already  had  existing  architectural
                  structures  that  were  historically  significance.   This
                  included an old charge office and cellblock, protected  in
                  law by the Monuments Council.  In  consultation  with  the
                  Monuments Council, the developer, the Housing  Association
                  and  the  provincial  government,  the  old  and  the  new
                  structures on the site have been integrated in a way  that
                  provided residents with a friendly  and  habitable  living
                  environment.

9.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Housing on Study Tour to  Eastern
     Cape, dated 14 February 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Housing, having undertaken a  visit  to  the
     Eastern Cape on 18 and 19 January 2001, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         A multiparty delegation undertook the study  tour  to  the  Eastern
         Cape. The delegation consisted of seven members and  two  officials
         from the Committee Section: Ms N E Hangana (Chairperson and  Leader
         of the delegation), Ms M S Maine, Mr W M Skosana, Mr J H Nash  (all
         ANC), Mr D K Maluleke (DP), Mr B W  Dlamini  (IFP),  Chief  N  Z  C
         Mtirara (UDM), Mr M Nguqu (Committee Secretary)  and  Ms  K  Pasiya
         (Committee Assistant).


         The Committee decided  to  go  on  the  tour  to  as  part  of  its
         monitoring and oversight function. The main purpose  of  the  visit
         was to undertake tours to various people's projects and  inner-city
         developments.


     B.     Start of visit


         The  Department  of  Housing,  Local  Government  and   Traditional
         Affairs made two presentations to us during the visit.

              (1) Eastern Cape Housing Perspective


                  (a)  Expenditure patterns after 1995


                       The 1994-95 financial year was not reflected  because
                       no money was spent during that period. At that  time,
                       the province was tasked to  attend  to  institutional
                       and logistical arrangements. An attempt was  made  to
                       start to consolidate and  integrate  the  then  three
                       fragmented  administrations  -  the  Cape  Provincial
                       Administration (CPA) and those of the  former  Ciskei
                       and the Transkei. The provincial housing board was at
                       that time operating from Cape Town. The Eastern  Cape
                       did not have a housing board.


                       From 1995 to 1996  expenditure  started  to  increase
                       gradually. An amount of R64 million was spent in that
                       year.


                       Expenditure increased to R132 million during the 1996-
                       97 financial year. It went to R268 million  in  1997-
                       98, and to R382 million in 1998-99. During 1999-2000,
                       R328 million was spent.


                       In the 2000-01 financial year, R183 million had  been
                       spent up to the time of the visit.


                  (b)  Medium Term Expenditure Framework
                       The Eastern Cape operates within  a  three-year  MTEF
                       budget cycle. For the  current  financial  year,  the
                       province  has  been  allocated  an  amount  of   R422
                       million,  and  R490   million   and   R577   million,
                       respectively, for the two ensuing years.


                       As from  this  financial  year,  provinces  are  only
                       allowed a 5% roll-over of annual allocations. If  the
                       amount is larger than that, they lose the money.


                  (c)  Budget split


                       As regards the budget split for this financial  year,
                       notice should be taken that R480 million has  already
                       been allocated. This is more than what  the  province
                       has. During 1996-97, the provinces  were  allowed  to
                       overcommit   themselves   in   respect   of    budget
                       allocations for that specific  year,  by  almost  the
                       same amount. Despite these commitments, the money was
                       never received.


                       The Eastern Cape had  entered  into  legal  agreement
                       with land developers, and  it  had  to  honour  these
                       commitments, even if the additional money  was  never
                       received. They are still in the  process  of  phasing
                       out these commitments. Hopefully they will break even
                       by 2002-03, and thereafter start from scratch.


                       (i)   Capital housing scheme


                             R3 million was voted towards the "transfer  of
                             houses" programme. This was a National Housing
                             Programme, called the "R7 500 capital  housing
                             scheme".  All  State  housing  schemes   built
                             before June 1993 were transferred to the names
                             of the  occupants,  at  the  maximum  discount
                             price of R7  500.  If  the  outstanding  house
                             price was  less  than  R7  500,  the  occupant
                             received the house free of charge.


                             The Eastern Cape had a total of 150 000 houses
                             to be transferred, of which 94 000 had already
                             been transferred.


                       (ii)  Expenditure on State assets


                             The provincial housing board had State  assets
                             in the  form  of  flats,  especially  in  Port
                             Elizabeth and East London,  which  it  had  to
                             maintain. These stocks were in the process  of
                             being phased out under  the  discount  benefit
                             scheme.


                       (iii) Hostel upgrading


                             R12 million  were  voted  for  this  financial
                             year. This  will  primarily  be  utilised  for
                             Matthew Goniwe and  Libombo  hostels  in  Port
                             Elizabeth and Butterworth, respectively.


                             Upgrading  was  already  completed   in   East
                             London, Duncan Village Hostel B, Somerset East
                             and Uitenhage. These were  hostels  identified
                             for   upgrading   in   terms   of   a   hostel
                             redevelopment programme in the province.


                       (iv)  Old business


                             With the change-over in 1994-95, the  province
                             had old projects up and running in some of the
                             towns.  R500  000  was  voted  to  have  these
                             projects completed.


                       (v)   Capacity building


                             R1,06 million was reserved for the training of
                             municipal officials and  department  officials
                             on policy implementation.


                             The  course  was  initially  offered  at  Wits
                             University, but has since  been  decentralised
                             throughout the province.


                       (vi)  People housing process


                             R5,2 million was allocated  in  1998-99  as  a
                             ring-fence amount.  This  money  can  only  be
                             spent for the particular purpose it  had  been
                             voted for.


                       (vii) Rural housing


                             R15  million  was  allocated  as  follows:  R4
                             million to the disaster-struck rural  part  of
                             Umtata area; and the residual amount to the 10
                             regional authorities in the province.


                             The province identified rural growth points in
                             terms of their provincial growth strategy. The
                             first growth  point  was  the  Lady  Grey/Lady
                             Frere/Dordrecht/Indwe Triangle.


                             At political level, this area  was  identified
                             as a rural growth point. Focus  was  beginning
                             to shape towards the area.

                       The creation of housing ownership  opportunities  was
                       the primary policy objective of the Eastern Cape.


                       The total number of home owners created was 173  928.
                       This consisted of 94 425 houses transferred in  terms
                       of the  State  discount  benefit  scheme  and  houses
                       completed.


                  (e)   Provincial   Initiatives   to   kick-start   housing
                       development


                       The  following  initiatives   were   taken   by   the
                       Department, and some of them had a positive impact at
                       national level:


                       (i)   Meeting between  the  Premier  of  the  Eastern
                             Cape, the MEC for Housing and Local Government
                             and the  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Land
                             Affairs - to  address  land  release  problems
                             which negatively affected ongoing progress and
                             thus resulted in under-expenditure.


                       (ii)   Appointment  of  a  Provincial  Task  Team   -
                             introduce  project   management   systems   to
                             identify and subsequently address blockages.


                       (iii) Establishment of the Eastern Cape  Tribunal  in
                             terms of the Development Facilitation Act - to
                             some extent  this  has  also  alleviated  land
                             release.


                       (iv)  Introduction  of  a  Provincial  Pilot  Housing
                             Scheme -  municipalities  and  local  emerging
                             contractors  were  given  an  opportunity   to
                             engage   in   small-scale   construction    in
                             identified areas where there were no  approved
                             housing projects with provincial support.


                       (v)   Operation Masakhe: The Department embarked on a
                             mass  housing  delivery  initiative,  designed
                             around a partnership  between  all  levels  of
                             government and the private sector.


                       (vi)  Utshani Fund - established by the  Ministry  at
                             the  behest  of  the  South  African  People's
                             Homeless Federation in Port Elizabeth (Eastern
                             Cape).


                       (vii) Integrated Housing Development -  the  province
                             approved and  supported  attempts  to  promote
                             integrated housing development,  as  could  be
                             seen in Cradock, a community which was  thrown
                             into disarray by political upheaval during the
                             80s. A project to build 2 000 units  with  the
                             assistance of NURCHA brought together  various
                             sectors  within  Cradock   to   create   jobs,
                             establish small industries, train artisans and
                             empower the community to actively  participate
                             in their own development.


                       (viii)Social  Housing  -  with  the   assistance   of
                             "Housing Association South Africa",  based  in
                             The Netherlands,  a  housing  association  had
                             been established in East London to  manage  an
                             institutional     subsidy      to      promote
                             densification.


                       (ix)  Earth Construction Technology - a pilot project
                             gained  after  a  presentation  at  the   1996
                             Habitat Conference in Turkey, bringing  skills
                             to produce  bricks  using  earth  construction
                             technology. This project  transformed  into  a
                             s21 company after two years  and  was  at  the
                             time  of  writing  called  the  Van  Der  Leij
                             Foundation,  by  means  of   which   a   large
                             community centre,  three  show  houses  and  a
                             brick  factory  were  constructed.  A  housing
                             project containing all the various subsidy was
                             approved  by  the  Eastern   Cape   Provincial
                             Housing Development Board and construction was
                             due to commence.


                       (x)   Individual subsidies for emerging contractors -
                             individual subsidies, with  support  from  the
                             Department,  were   approved   at   manageable
                             numbers  to  emerging  contractors  to   build
                             capacity while offering  beneficiaries  better
                             top structures.


                       (xi)   New  provincial  norms  and  standards  -  the
                             political functionary of the  Department  laid
                             down new  provincial  housing  delivery  norms
                             which had to be introduced  in  the  following
                             sequence (in line with the  GEAR  strategy  of
                             alleviating poverty and building  the  economy
                             of the country):


                             *    Job creation


                             *    Skills development


                             *    Maximum product (40 square metre)


                       (xii) Capacity building -  the  province  had  proved
                             beyond doubt that unless  the  municipalities,
                             clearly  mandated  by  the  Housing   Act   to
                             undertake    housing     development,     were
                             capacitated   to   do   so   efficiently   and
                             effectively, inroads made to date would not be
                             harnessed.   Consequently,   the    Department
                             entered into partnership  with  various  role-
                             players    to    capacitate    municipalities,
                             provincial officials, emerging contractors and
                             communities, especially women.  The  following
                             partnerships  were   making   a   considerable
                             difference:


                             *      Department   of   Housing   and   Local
                                Government (Province) and the Department  of
                                Labour


                             *      Department   of   Housing   and   Local
                                Government  and  GTZ   through   the   Urban
                                Upgrading and Development Programme


                             *      Department   of   Housing   and   Local
                                Government  and  the  People's   Partnership
                                Trust


                             *      Department   of   Housing   and   Local
                                Government and the Delta Foundation


                             *      Department   of   Housing   and   Local
                                Government, Wits  University  and  the  Fort
                                Hare Institute of Government


                  (f)  Rapid Land Development Programme


                       The  Department  of  Housing,  Local  Government  and
                       Traditional Affairs had introduced a  phased  housing
                       programme  which  would  disaggregate  the   existing
                       project-linked  housing  subsidy  scheme   into   two
                       distinct  phases.  The  first  phase  would   provide
                       beneficiaries with land, civil services and tenure in
                       a planned manner. The second phase would provide  for
                       the provision of  top  structures  to  be  funded  in
                       ensuing financial years.


                       Poverty alleviation and the building of the  national
                       economy  were  government  priority.  The  provincial
                       housing protocol was therefore:
                       *     Job creation


                       *     Skills development


                       *     A satisfactory product - minimum of  40  square
                         metre


                       The Department had been talking  to  big  contractors
                       towards the establishment of partnerships between the
                       established and emerging  contractors.  For  example,
                       the  big  developer  would  be  responsible  for  the
                       provision of infrastructure, thus  carrying  out  the
                       more specialised work while the  emerging  contractor
                       would come into the  partnership  to  build  the  top
                       structure.  The  whole   idea   was   for   the   big
                       contractor/developer   to   mentor    the    emerging
                       contractor. This would facilitate a  situation  where
                       the established  developer  would  leave  the  skills
                       behind when departing.


                       The Department was in contact with the Department  of
                       Labour with a  view  to  access  funds  for  training
                       emerging contractor,s  but  the  department  and  the
                       municipality had to have a  common  understanding  of
                       the  need  for  building  the  partnership,  as   the
                       training provided had to be within the project.


                       The rapid land development  programme  therefore  had
                       three key strategic thrusts:


                       *     Building of partnerships


                       *     Building of servicing stock


                       *     Effective planning that would  assist  in  fast
                         tracking expenditure.


                  (g)  Plan of Action for Housing: 2000 and beyond


                       The political functionary of the Department announced
                       during the tabling of the Department's 2000-01 policy
                       speech that three White Papers would be published  by
                       November 2001, namely Housing, Local  Government  and
                       Administration  and  Finance.  The  following  policy
                       measures would constitute the  command  line  of  the
                       Department  in  respect  of  housing,   pending   the
                       completion and publication  of  the  White  Paper  on
                       Housing:


                       *     Systematic elimination of the housing backlog


                       *     Finalising the transfer of State rental  houses
                         to occupants


                       *      Encourage  private  bond  holders  to  respond
                         positively  to  the  government's  initiatives   in
                         assisting them


                       *     Getting people who earn regular income  to  pay
                         for services rendered to them by municipalities


                       *     Improve the quality of house delivered


                       *     Improve housing subsidy management


                       *      Resequencing  the  housing  (or  any  capital)
                         project delivery protocol


                  (h)  Challenges


                       The  road  ahead  was   definitely   geared   towards
                       accommodating policy shifts and  finding  alternative
                       sources of financial support to address:


                       *     To further promote the People's Housing Process


                       *     To allocate funds towards the special needs  of
                         disabled persons
                       *      To   kick-start   rural   development   on   a
                         progressive basis


                       *     To promote rental housing


                       *     To attend  to  the  immediate  welfare  of  the
                         victims of gross human rights violations


                       *     To assist with  subsidy  distribution  of  land
                         restitution claims


                       *      Promoting  holistic   integrated   development
                         planning  through  the  integration  of   different
                         sectors and  the  integration  of  the  efforts  of
                         different actors


                       *     To promote the building of partnerships between
                         emerging contractors and established developers  in
                         particular


                  (i)  Shortfalls experienced
                       The decrease in the Housing 2000-01 budget allocation
                       to  the  province  had  a  negative  impact  on   the
                       Department's strategic approach towards  implementing
                       rural  development  after  the  announcement  of  the
                       national rural policy.  The  Department  had  limited
                       funds to start housing initiatives in the 10 regional
                       authorities in the Eastern Cape, and would  have  had
                       to opt for small pilot projects in the interim.


              (2) Good Housing Development Practices


                  (a)  Background


                       The  Department  of  Housing,  Local  Government  and
                       Traditional Affairs, in partnership with  the  German
                       Development Agency, through the Urban  Upgrading  and
                       Development Programme (UUDP),  decided  to  create  a
                       platform  aimed  at  sharing   lessons   learnt   and
                       experiences gained during the implementation of  low-
                       cost housing projects. The workshop also served as  a
                       platform to inform and consult with  stakeholders  on
                       new national and provincial policy,  legislation  and
                       strategic trends on housing development and  expected
                       impact on housing delivery in the province.


                       Between December 1999 and  May  2000,  prior  to  the
                       workshop,   a   comprehensive    investigation    was
                       undertaken into good practices in  the  planning  and
                       implementation  of  a  selected  group   of   housing
                       projects  which  were  approved  by  the   Provincial
                       Housing Development Board in  terms  of  the  current
                       national  housing  subsidy  programme.   15   housing
                       projects  were  identified,  of  which   three   were
                       eliminated during the investigation process.


                  (b)  Selection of Projects


                       Projects  were  selected  as  good  practice  on  the
                       following criteria.


                       (i)   Housing process  -  institutional  arrangement,
                             financial   arrangements,   beneficiary    and
                             community   participation,   local    economic
                             development, and private/public partnership.


                       (ii)  Housing product - consolidation process, design
                             and choices offered, planning  issues,  method
                             of construction and value for money.


                       The  investigation  placed  emphasis  on  beneficiary
                       participation and on quality of the housing  product.
                       The investigation may not have been representative of
                       all   housing   projects   in   the   province,   but
                       demonstrated what could be delivered through  careful
                       design and delivery processes.
                  (c) Types of Projects


                       These projects could be classified into four types:


                       *     Greenfields projects, as extensions of existing
                         built-up areas


                       *     In situ upgrading projects through  a  People's
                         Housing Process


                       *     High density projects


                       *     Small-scale pilot/rolling projects for  smaller
                         communities.

                       ---------------------------------------


                       The  majority   of   projects   selected   for   this
                       investigation constituted greenfields projects, where
                       new  residential  areas  were  created  adjacent   to
                       existing   built-up   areas.   Examples   of    large
                       greenfields  projects  were  Cradock   Vision   2000,
                       Dimbaza  South  Phase   2,   Ngqeleni,   Libode   and
                       Keiskammahoek.  These  projects  were  targeted   for
                       beneficiaries living in informal  settlements  or  in
                       backyard shacks.


                       Only three of the 12 projects were in situ  upgrading
                       projects or had a component of in situ upgrading.  In
                       the case of  the  two  Uitenhage  projects,  existing
                       residential  areas  and   existing   buildings   were
                       upgraded and/or converted to family accommodation. In
                       Dimbaza,  220  subsidies  were  used  for   upgrading
                       existing settlements.
                       The  two  pilot  projects   were   also   greenfields
                       projects, but land within the  inner  municipal  area
                       was used. These projects required the subdivision  of
                       a  large  piece  of  land,  to  be  concluded  before
                       individual ownership could be granted.
                       The primary  source  of  funding  was  project-linked
                       subsidies,  which  were  used  in  nine  of  the   12
                       projects. Two projects were implemented via the pilot
                       project programme, which was a  unique  programme  in
                       the  Eastern  Cape.  The  Belgravia  housing  project
                       utilised institutional housing subsidies for a social
                       housing project.


                       In 11 of  the  12  projects,  domestic  water  supply
                       consisted of an individual erf connection with  water
                       piped to the residential unit. The only exception was
                       the Bizana Project, where one communal standpipe  per
                       five residential units was provided.  Sanitation  was
                       in the form of waterborne sewerage in 10  of  the  12
                       projects, with ventilated and improved  pit  latrines
                       provided in the rural towns of Bizana and Libode.


                       All  projects  had   gravel   roads,   with   surface
                       stormwater, except in the two Uitenhage projects  and
                       in the  Belgravia  project,  where  bitumen  surfaced
                       roads were provided. Electricity  was  generally  not
                       supplied as part of the project, the exceptions being
                       the Belgravis project, Keiskammahoek,  Cradock,  Ugie
                       and the two Uitenhage projects.


                       The  Housing  Development  Board   supported   larger
                       greenfields housing projects via  the  project-linked
                       subsidy mechanism.


                  (d)  Good Practice Lessons


                       (i)   Greenfields Projects
                             *    Building Quality:  The  emphasis  in  the
                                Libode  project  on  training  and   quality
                                control for the emerging contractors ensured
                                a good end  product  for  the  beneficiaries
                                (note that  beneficiary  interests  such  as
                                quality and size of the top  structure  were
                                paramount,  a   long-term   objective,   and
                                accordingly considered more  important  than
                                considerations such as short-term  jobs  for
                                the unemployed.


                             *    Design: The  innovative  design  (veranda
                                house)  in  Dimbaza,  triggered  an   owner-
                                initiated consolidation process.


                             *      Choices   on   Top    Structure:    The
                                construction  of   different   show   houses
                                enabling beneficiaries  to  choose,  was  an
                                important   step   to   ensure   beneficiary
                                satisfaction and to a certain degree  helped
                                instill a sense of ownership and pride.


                             *    Participation: Beneficiaries  had  to  be
                                kept informed on all facets of  the  project
                                from inception to completion through  proper
                                communication    and    community    liaison
                                strategies. Project Committees had  to  have
                                balanced   representation   from   all   key
                                stakeholders  in   the   project.   Whenever
                                possible, beneficiaries had to  be  given  a
                                choice  in  respect  of  the  top  structure
                                (choice  in  design,  choice   in   building
                                materials, choice in placing  the  house  on
                                the erf). Projects  with  a  high  level  of
                                beneficiary  participation  through  Project
                                Committees and strong local leadership  were
                                the most successful  projects  in  terms  of
                                speed of delivery, choice and variety in the
                                top structure and subsequent  consolidation.
                                Maximum    community     and     beneficiary
                                participation   depended   on   strong   and
                                organised community structures (Cradock  and
                                Dimbaza) and clearly  defined  institutional
                                arrangements, allowing for project ownership
                                by beneficiaries/community  structures.  Had
                                the Local Authority been in full control  of
                                the   project   management,   not   allowing
                                consultants to  forge  ahead,  beneficiaries
                                could make informed decisions  and  come  up
                                with  creative  and  innovative  ideas   and
                                mechanisms, like self-generated solutions to
                                problems (Libode).
                             *    Empowerment: The financial limitations of
                                and the purpose housing  subsidies  did  not
                                allow for general  skills  development.  One
                                result of  these  limitations  was  that  in
                                certain   cases   empowerment    was    only
                                incidental  to   housing   development.   In
                                several cases up-front selection  of  groups
                                to be empowered ensured  that  training  had
                                impact and effect. Beneficiaries were first-
                                time homeowners. In the Dimbaza  project,  a
                                series   of   workshops   around    property
                                ownership,  services  and  maintenance   was
                                held.  Such  education  programmes  assisted
                                beneficiaries  and  local   authorities   to
                                integrate new low-cost  housing  areas  into
                                the town.


                             *      Beneficiary   qualification   criteria:
                                Transparent objective criteria  were  to  be
                                introduced to select potential beneficiaries
                                where  the   housing   need   exceeded   the
                                potential  supply  of   units.   Pre-project
                                selection was also helpful to  identify  the
                                real participants in the project and to open
                                proper channels of communication to them.


                       (ii)  In  situ  Upgrading  through  People's  Housing
                             Process


                             *       Beneficiary    driven    construction:
                                Utilising   sweat   equity   and    emerging
                                contractors, a high standard of services and
                                one of the biggest top structures  could  be
                                achieved. The project demonstrated that some
                                low-income    earners    could    contribute
                                financially through savings schemes.


                             *    Gender: Women demonstrated their  ability
                                to take up "conventional men's jobs" in  the
                                building industry.


                       (iii) High Density Projects


                             *      Integration:   In   Missionvalle    and
                                Belgravia the good location of the projects,
                                relatively  close  to  the   city   centres,
                                resulted in racially mixed  communities,  an
                                important element of social integration  and
                                more compact cities.


                             *    Planning: In the  Missionvale  project  a
                                more  compact  lay  -   out   was   achieved
                                resulting in larger top - structures  of  up
                                to 54 square metre.  Smaller  sites  ensured
                                more      cost-effective      infrastructure
                                installation and low maintenance costs.


                             *    Gender: The majority of  tenants  in  the
                                Balgravia project were women.  This  pointed
                                to the need for women (often single parents)
                                to  obtain   accommodation   in   a   secure
                                environment. High-density developments  were
                                attractive to single parents.


                             *     Institutional  Relationships:  Both  the
                                Missionvalle  and  Belgravia  projects   had
                                representatives from business bodies such as
                                the Border-Kei Chamber of Business  and  the
                                Delta   Foundation,   which   ensured    the
                                necessary expertise.
                       (iv)  Pilot Rolling Projects


                             *    Location of projects: Small projects were
                                developed on land readily available  in  the
                                towns. They contributed to consolidating the
                                municipal area.


                  (e)   Why  share  good  practices  and  not  indicate  bad
                       products?


                       The intention was to  influence  developers  that  to
                       share ideas and information certain things  could  be
                       done in certain  ways.  The  intention  was  also  to
                       downplay bad practices rather than promoting them.


         2. Housing Association East London (HAEL)


              Overview on role of East  London  Transitional  Local  Council
              (ELTLC) in and the history of HAEL
                  HAEL was a very young and  vibrant  organisation.  Initial
                  contacts between the  City  of  East  London  and  various
                  organisations in The Netherlands  dated  back  as  far  as
                  1993, when the first discussions  on  alternative  housing
                  solutions took place.


                  These   discussions   eventually   led   to   the   formal
                  establishment of HAEL as a s21 Company on 5 May 1998.  The
                  initiative came about  as  a  result  of  a  joint  effort
                  between  the  City  of  East  London   and   the   Housing
                  Association South Africa (HASA), a  foundation  comprising
                  32 housing associations in The Netherlands.


                  Together,  the  above   parties   undertook   to   provide
                  affordable  social  housing  to  those  sections  of   the
                  community that did  not  have  the  means  to  finance  or
                  construct a dwelling themselves.


                  Besides addressing  the  housing  problems  to  low-income
                  earners  in  East  London,  HAEL  undertook  to   make   a
                  concerted contribution towards the social  and  functional
                  integration  of  the  city  by   directing   its   efforts
                  primarily at compacting the urban form.


                  HASA  committed  itself   to   providing   technical   and
                  financial assistance during the first five years. In  1997
                  a  Dutch   Project   Manager   was   seconded   to   HEAL.
                  Similtaneously, the East  London  TLC  supported  HAEL  by
                  making  land  available  at  below   market   prices   and
                  providing   technical   and   financial   support.    HASA
                  principles  complement  the  city  council's  policies  on
                  promoting visible, upward mobility and  in  breaking  with
                  the past high level of dependency  for  housing  on  local
                  authorities.


                  The composition of HAEL's  Board  of  Directors  reflected
                  the  developmental  stage  that  the  organisation  founds
                  itself in, with representatives of the parties  that  were
                  involved in the establishment  of  the  organisation.  The
                  eight-member  board  comprised  representatives  from  the
                  Border-Kei Chamber of Business (BKCOB),  the  East  London
                  TLC, HASA and the NHFC.


                  Funding was  generated  from  grants  from  the  following
                  organisations and/or  institutions:  Housing  Institutions
                  Development  Fund   (HIDF),   East   London   TLC,   HASA,
                  Provincial Housing Board, and the City of Leiden.


                  Among the weaknesses and threats  facing  HEAL  were  high
                  interest rates, the unstable economic situation,  lack  of
                  a social safety  net,  HIV/AIDS,  and  the  perception  of
                  rental stock as being inferior.  Critical  success  points
                  included strategic partnership  between  ELTLC  and  HASA,
                  "buy in" from NHFC and PHB, lengthy  secondment  of  Dutch
                  advisor, on-line access to specialist knowledge via  HASA,
                  and the commitment of staff.


                  HAEL wished and strived to become fully independent and  a
                  financially-sustainable South African enterprise by 2002.


     C.     Group (on-site) visits
         1. Belgravia Valley


              Belgravia Valley was a mixed grouping  social  housing  inner-
              city development project, consisting of two phases.  In  total
              the complex had 338 housing units. The project was managed  by
              HAEL.


              The  first  phase  boasted  150  walk-up  units.  Construction
              started in October 1998 and was completed  in  November  1999.
              The size of the units ranged between 35 and 67 square metre of
              one, two and three  bedrooms.  Tenants  would  pay  a  monthly
              rental of between R625 and R890, depending on the size of  the
              unit occupied.
              Construction  in  Phase  2  started  in  January   2000,   and
              completion was foreseen for  February  2001.  There  were  288
              rental units of between 24 to 63  square  metre.  They  varied
              from one- to three-bedroom flats. Rental ranged  between  R650
              and R900 per month, again depending on the size  of  the  unit
              occupied.


              Over ans above the monthly rentals, tenants  were  liable  for
              their own consumption of metered water and electricity to  the
              East London Transitional Council (now Buffalo City).


              Funding for the  project  came  from  a  variety  of  sources.
              Firstly, there was an institutional  subsidy  grant  from  the
              government. Secondly, a mixed grant and  loan  fund  from  The
              Netherlands.   Thirdly,   there   was   funding    for    bulk
              infrastructure from the ELTLC. Fourthly, there was a loan from
              the National Housing Finance Corporation (NHFC).


              Tenants for the Belgravia Valley project were drawn  from  all
              over the city - 50% from Duncan Village and the remaining  50%
              from the municipal waiting list.


              Potential tenants  underwent  a  rigorous  screening  process,
              which consisted of five interview sessions.  HAEL's  criteria,
              which included  gross  and  net  income,  household  size  and
              composition, credit worthiness and cash-flows, were discussed.
              Once  that  stage  was  passed,  applicants  would  receive  a
              tenants' guide to study and a date  to  attend  the  four-hour
              HAEL tenants' training  programme.  This  programme  was  very
              interactive and covered the understanding of social, financial
              and maintenance rights and responsibilities of the tenant  and
              HAEL's and tenants' participation. An  evaluation  and  slogan
              competition concluded the session. Tenants then chose  a  unit
              and signed a lease agreement.


         2. Smuts Ngonyamaville


              Beneficiaries are actually  involved  in  building  their  own
              houses.
              The  community  designed   plans   for   their   own   houses,
              subsequently endorsed by  the  provincial  housing  board  and
              submitted to the local municipality for approval. The building
              costs (including material supply) accompanying  these  designs
              were calculated up to the last cent, with the  involvement  of
              the community. Beneficiaries were not dependent on  the  State
              subsidy grant of R16 000 alone - those  who  could  contribute
              some finance to build bigger houses, did so voluntarily.


              Initially, in 1998, the cost of building a single  house  unit
              of 51 square metre was R11 021,51, after  expenses  for  basic
              infrastructure were exhausted. Due  to  deliberate  delays  by
              officials of the ELTLC and increase by suppliers in respect of
              materials, the project could at the end of 1999 only manage  a
              48 square metre unit. When construction was supposed to  start
              in August 2000, the material costs brought down the unit  size
              to 40,5 square metre. However, some beneficiaries  still  made
              contributions to enlarge the houses to 48 square metre.


              The  Smuts  Ngonyamaville  people's  housing  process  project
              consisted of 427 housing units. A total of between 107 to  138
              units  were  under  construction.   Foundations  had   already
              started and/or had been laid for  31  and/or  125  units.  186
              units are in trenches.
              Within one year, the project reached tremendous  achievements.
              These included hiring a competent architect, bringing students
              on an internship programme from Botswana, creating  employment
              for the local people, designing houses,  performing  financial
              cost estimations for the houses and hiring containers to kick-
              start construction.


              Despite  all  this,  the  project  was  experiencing  problems
              dealing with the ELTLC, the provincial department  of  finance
              and, at times, the provincial housing board. Officials of  the
              municipality were not co-operative. There was no running water
              on the building site. The  municipality  promised  to  connect
              water at the rate of R100 per unit  per  month  to  provide  a
              support centre and to make  land  available  for  free.  After
              spending R60 000 on  fencing,  the  municipality  reneged  and
              demanded that the land be paid for and charged at  double  the
              initial R100 rate for water.


              The Accounts Administrator in  the  provincial  department  of
              finance did not want to come to the  site  for  payments,  the
              office being situated in Port Elizabeth, which  was  too  far.
              The community had to  raise  transport  fare  from  their  own
              pockets - rather than from the subsidy grant  -  in  order  to
              reach the office for payment.


              All in all, Smuts Ngonyamaville people's housing process was a
              typical reflection of a nation at work, building the country.


         3. Sinebhongo Village


              Sinebhongo Village was  a  Rotary-funded  project  for  single
              mothers. The project consisted of 100 complete  housing  units
              of 45 square metre each - two bedrooms, a lounge,  a  kitchen,
              and an inside toilet and shower. A total number of  52  houses
              were already occupied by beneficiaries.


              The names of the legible beneficiaries were selected from  the
              local municipal waiting list (single mothers only).  The  cost
              of R28 000 per housing unit was derived from the R16 000 State
              subsidy grant as well as the R12 000 fund from the Rotary Club
              of East London/USA. Similarly, the beneficiaries made personal
              contributions of R177  and  R250  for  water  connections  and
              electricity boxes, respectively. The community had  access  to
              basic infrastructure such as tarred streets,  drainage  water,
              sewage etc.


              In an endeavour to stimulate and  hasten  provincial  economic
              growth in terms of rural  development  strategy,  the  project
              utilised  a  local  emerging  contractor  in   the   name   of
              Christopher Funding Mfana Construction. The bulk of the labour
              force  was  selected  from  the  community,  particularly  the
              beneficiaries.


     D.     Comments and recommendations


         1. Partnerships between provincial and local governments should  be
              enhanced to speed up the  delivery  of  services  to  all  our
              people, particularly the poorest of  the  poor  in  the  rural
              areas. The Committee deems it necessary  to  strive  to  forge
              partnerships  among  the   three   spheres   of   governments,
              particularly between  provincial  and  local  governments,  in
              order to fast-track service delivery. There is a dire need  to
              strategically co-ordinate activities between the national  and
              provincial governments on legislation.


         2. The Committee believes  that  provinces  should  impact  on  the
              national legislative-making  process  before  it  reaches  the
              NCOP. Provinces should be able to influence legislation at the
              level of Portfolio Committee in the National  Assembly.  There
              should be extensive public hearings and public submissions  at
              provincial level to strengthen the national legislative-making
              process.


         3. Overseas visits should be tidied up in order to  facilitate  co-
              ordination amongst the  different  role-players.  Revisits  in
              respect of international and continental  trips  by  different
              role-players on housing to the same host country is desirable.
              On a recent visit to Brazil,  the  Committee  discovered  that
              there were too many delegations from South Africa on housing -
              different groups from different provinces.  Ultimately,  these
              visits began to antagonise the host countries.


         4. The  capacity  of  emerging  contractors  should  be  given  all
              necessary support in terms of rural  development  strategy  in
              order to stimulate economic growth in the province.


         5. The selling of State-subsidised  houses  is  a  cause  of  major
              concern for the government. The government should as  soon  as
              possible intervene and regulate the  sale  of  subsidy  houses
              funded by the State.


         6. Ongoing discussions between  the  government  and  provinces  on
              budget spending to promote service delivery  (housing)  should
              be encouraged.


         7. Local municipalities are the vehicle to steer  development,  and
              until  that  is  realised,  development   will   not   happen.
              Stakeholders  involved  in  rural  development   should   show
              commitment.


         8. There is a need to change the mindset of some of  the  municipal
              officials.

         The delegation managed to lay the basis  for  a  very  constructive
         relationship with the provincial government of  the  Eastern  Cape.
         Open and constructive discussions took place between  the  MEC  for
         Housing, Local Government and  Traditional  Affairs,  Mr  Gugile  E
         Nkwinti, his department's senior manager and the delegation.


         The visit also succeeded in  highlighting  the  government's  rural
         development strategy in terms  of  the  economic  growth.  The  MEC
         pointed out the provincial initiatives towards  the  implementation
         of the rural development strategy.

10.   Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Housing  on  Study  Tour  to
     Northern Cape, dated 23 May 2001:
     The Portfolio Committee on Housing, having undertaken a  visit  to  the
     Northern Cape from 18 to 20 March 2001, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         A multiparty delegation, under the leadership  of  Ms  M  S  Maine,
         consisted of six members and two officials, went on the tour: Ms  M
         Buthelezi (ANC), Mr L P M Nzimande (ANC), Ms E Ngaleka (ANC), Mr  B
         W Dhlamini (IFP), Mr A Singh (DP), Ms Jojozi (Committee  Secretary)
         and Ms Pasiya (Committee Assistant).


     B.     Objectives of Tour
         The Committee went on tour with the following objectives:


         1. To fulfil its monitoring and oversight function.  The  Committee
              intended to  establish  progress  made  on  the  "Housing  the
              Nation" programme.


         2.  To  have  an  exchange  of  views  and  experience   with   the
              Legislature and hear the feelings  of  people  on  the  ground
              about the housing projects.


         3. To visit the various housing projects such as  People's  Housing
              Projects and other Inner City Developments.


     C.     Meeting with MEC


         1. Housing Impact


              The Northern Cape has a low population density in most  areas.
              Some housing projects are far from Kimberley as  the  province
              is very vast. A number of criticisms from  various  dimensions
              regarding housing programmes have resulted in the  development
              of policy tensions. The Northern Cape government is delivering
              faster compared to other provinces and is playing a large role
              in housing projects. They have placed more emphasis on people-
              driven delivery. The main  idea  of  the  concept  of  "people
              driven  delivery"  is  that  the  people  are  in  control  of
              decisions taken about their own  housing  constructions.  This
              has  resulted  in  much  larger  top  structures  and   higher
              satisfaction  levels.  The  "People's  housing  process"   has
              contributed enormously to the delivery of houses  much  bigger
              than 36 square metres.


         2. Housing Delivery


              (a) In 1995 the Department decided that no  developers  should
                  build houses smaller than 33 square  metres.  Considerable
                  progress has been made with  regard  to  the  delivery  of
                  houses,   achieved   through   co-ordinated   efforts   of
                  developers,  financial  institutions,  local  authorities,
                  women's groups in  housing  and  material  suppliers.  The
                  past six years have been a great success for the  Northern
                  Cape - over 22000 houses have been built.


              (b) The Department has identified a few projects for  disabled
                  people and is waiting for Disabled People of South  Africa
                  to get back to it.


         3. Housing Allocation


              (a) The  national  Department  of  Housing  allocated  R65,475
                  million to the provincial Department of  Local  Government
                  and  Housing  (the  Department)  for  a  low-cost  housing
                  programme for  the  2001-02  financial  year,  which  will
                  deliver  3 500  units  across  the  entire  province.   In
                  support  of  the  national  Department,   the   Department
                  embarked on a process to draft  a  housing  plan  that  is
                  appropriate,   realistic   and    affordable    for    the
                  continuation of the housing process in the  Northern  Cape
                  during 2000-2001.


                  This plan will serve the following purpose:


                  *     To  serve  as  a  guideline  for  all   departmental
                    officials   to   implement   the   housing    programme
                    effectively.


                  *    To serve as a tool to communicate  the  processes  to
                    be followed with external stakeholders. The process  is
                    therefore transparent.


                  *     To  integrate  the  housing   process   with   other
                    programmes.


                  *     To  propose  a  clear  strategy  with  targets   and
                    timeframes for the 2000-01.


         4. External Factors / Problems Experienced


              There  are  different  circumstances  which  have   a   direct
              influence on the low-cost housing programme, namely:


              (a)  The  geographic  vastness  and  low  population   numbers
                  resulting in long distances between small communities  and
                  towns. The Northern Cape is a vast province and there  are
                  long distances between  housing  projects  and  towns.  To
                  transport building material to the different  projects  is
                  very costly.
              (b) Building material is not always available in  small  towns
                  and has to be transported over long distances.


              (c) The constant migration of  communities  between  towns  as
                  well as between towns and cities.


              (d) Funds allocated to the Department for housing projects are
                  not adequate to address the needs of the communities.


              (e) There are only three areas where  women  are  involved  in
                  construction and yet most beneficiaries are women.


              (f) It is difficult  to  identify  disabled  people  from  the
                  application forms that are used for housing applications.


              (g) There is sometimes conflict  between  developers  and  the
                  Department.  When  the  Department  give  advice  to   the
                  communities,  the  developers  complain  that   they   are
                  playing too much of a role in housing delivery.


              (h) The pace of delivery is very slow in the province. This is
                  due to the following:


                  *    It takes time before projects are approved.  This  is
                    due to the fact that there is a lot  of  administrative
                    backlog, there is shortage of personnel  to  deal  with
                    administration  and   finances   related   to   housing
                    delivery. In the Department, there are 22 staff members
                    to deal with administration  and  finances  related  to
                    housing delivery. The head of the Department is at  the
                    level of Chief Director. In other provinces the head is
                    at the  level  of  Deputy  Director-General.  In  other
                    provinces there are about 100 staff  members  who  work
                    with housing delivery projects.


                  *    There are not enough funds  to  process  applications
                    for people who qualify for housing subsidies.


         5. Future Developments


              (a) This year, the province will review what has been built so
                  far and the constraints women face in obtaining access  to
                  housing opportunities. The  Department  will  continue  to
                  forge  links  with  the  private  sector   and   financial
                  institutions.  Subsidy  benefits  subject  to   individual
                  savings  performance  will  be  made  a  prerequisite   to
                  gaining access to both ownership  and  rental  housing.  A
                  sound strategy based on  the  public/private  partnership,
                  to reward those who save, would appear  to  be  the  right
                  route to follow.


              (b) People with moderate incomes still do not have  access  to
                  ample  affordable  housing  finance,  hence   a   strategy
                  aligned to the Savings Strategy is  needed  to  ensure  an
                  adequate flow of private lending funds to  the  low-income
                  segment of the market on terms and  conditions,  and  with
                  lending  practices  that   are   appropriate,   fair   and
                  equitable.


              (c) The provincial government will continue its  endeavour  to
                  provide shelter to the homeless and to gently restore  the
                  rights of our people to a secure place in  which  to  live
                  with peace and dignity.


     D.     Galesewe Housing Support Centre


         The primary objective of the Centre is  to  facilitate  beneficiary
         families to build or to make improvements to their own houses.


         1. Project Objectives Achieved


              The project has achieved a significant increase in the rate of
              delivery of low-cost housing.


              The  Centre  was  involved  in   the   facilitation   of   the
              construction of  houses  in  Roodepan  (391)  and  Boikhutsong
              (415). The construction of houses in  these  areas  have  been
              finalised.


              The projects where the Centre has played a major role  in  the
              implementation process, was Greenpoint  (233),  Coville/Floors
              (64), Chris Hani Park (251), Boikhutsong  Phase  11  and  John
              Mampe 111.


         2. Problems Experienced


              (a) The pace of delivery is slow.


              (b) In winter the shacks that are built in  some  areas  catch
                  fire.


     E.     Chris Hani Park - People's Housing Process


         1. Project Profile


              (a) This project was started on 23 March 1999. Weekly meetings
                  were held with  the  Community  Development  Forum  in  an
                  attempt to resolve all problems regarding the  development
                  of the top structures.


              (b) The Department has supported 20 females with the necessary
                  tools to build their own  houses.  The  houses  they  have
                  built are bigger than the houses that the Housing  Support
                  Centre in  conjunction  with  the  Kimberley  Municipality
                  have built.


              (c) The houses built were  45  square  metres  and  54  square
                  metres in  extent,  respectively,  with  two  bedrooms,  a
                  kitchen, a lounge and a bathroom. The owners have  to  pay
                  R150,00 for electricity connection. The houses cost  about
                  R15 000, including services. The  owners  are  happy  with
                  the houses.


         2. Problems experienced


              (a) A large  number  of  people  want  to  withdraw  from  the
                  Kimberley City Council housing  projects  because  of  the
                  bigger  houses  that  the  20  females  have   built   for
                  themselves. The problem with these  houses  is  that  they
                  are not of good quality and standard.


              (b) Confusion is created by the fact that the  Department  has
                  started with a  second  project  in  the  community.  This
                  project is going to be stopped due to  political  problems
                  in the area. Two houses still need to be built.


              (c)  There  are  people  who  are  occupying  a  church   site
                  unlawfully. A rezoning application  for  the  church  site
                  has been submitted to town planning.  This  is  to  ensure
                  that these people are accommodated.


     F.     Kutlwanong


         1. Project Profile


              (a) Kutlwanong is located  eight  kilometres  from  Kimberley.
                  Kutlwanong was founded in 1994  through  an  effort  of  a
                  local  civic  organisation,  which  put  pressure  on  the
                  municipality to establish a recognised community from  the
                  growing settlement.  Kutlwanong  housing  project  is  the
                  result of  the  USA/SA  Gore/Mbeki  Binational  Commission
                  Energy Conference,  held  in  Kimberly  in  1995.  Several
                  community  leaders  attended  the  conference,  and   this
                  spawned a decision by the Kutlwanong Community to use  the
                  environment engineering firm of PEER Africa to  help  plan
                  and rebuild the township into a holistic, sustainable  and
                  economically  viable  community.  The  intention  was   to
                  incorporate   environmental    and    energy    efficiency
                  awareness, economic upliftment and capacity building  into
                  the planning, development and implementation process.


              (b) The community is governed by an elected council of  eight,
                  called  the  Kutlwanong  Civic  Executive  Committee.  The
                  Executive Committee works closely with  its  community  to
                  ensure  that  they  have  support  in  their  initiatives.
                  Because housing is a  priority,  the  Executive  Committee
                  met  with  developers   before   selecting   PEER   Africa
                  (community-based developer)  to  assist  in  training  the
                  community to build new homes. The  Kutlwanong-style  house
                  is a product of participative  management  and  design  by
                  PEER Africa. The process involved, firstly,  understanding
                  the  resident's  acceptable  living  standards  and   then
                  developing those standards into a basic  house  plan.  The
                  beneficiaries defined the number of rooms  and  the  total
                  space required to achieve a liveable, comfortable home.


              (c) The Kutlwanong style house has the following features:


                  *    Correct (northward) orientation of the dwelling.


                  *    Placement of windows on the north side of  the  house
                    to maximise thermal benefit in winter, when the sun  is
                    low on the horizon.


                  *    Extension  of  roof  line  to  shade  windows  during
                    summer, when the sun is high on the horizon,  and  thus
                    minimises unwanted solar gain.


                  *    Installation of an insulated ceiling to moderate  the
                    thermal comfort zone in the dwelling.


                  *    Installation of wall cavity to further  prevent  heat
                    loss in winter and heat gain in summer.


                  Kutlwanong has an adequate infrastructure: Paved and  wide
                  streets,  electricity,  individually  serviced  water  and
                  sewerage plots. Provision of formal housing is a  priority
                  for the community.


         2. Problems Experienced


              (a) Kwatlenong is not conveniently located,  potential  places
                  of employment and shopping are far away and  transport  to
                  these places is very expensive.


              (b) At present, the majority of the community live in 20 to 30
                  square  metre  shacks  constructed  of   corrugated   iron
                  sheeting. These shacks have no ceilings and  curtains  are
                  often used  as  room  dividers.   The  shacks  are  colder
                  inside than outside in the winter, and hotter inside  than
                  outside in the summer.


              (c) There is high rate of  unemployment  in  the  area,  which
                  makes it difficult for  the  community  to  sustain  their
                  houses.


     G.     Warrenton


         1. Project Profile


              Prior to the implementation of the housing policy in 1994, the
              lack of  adequate  housing  was  the  single  largest  problem
              Warrenton Municipality had to contend with. It  was  therefore
              decided that at least 1 000 houses be built in  Warrenton  and
              surrounding areas in order to address  the  lack  of  adequate
              housing, which by that time had reached crisis proportions.


              The various communities of Warrenton,  in  collaboration  with
              the  CBOs,  Warrenton   Municipality   and   the   Department,
              identified the urgent need for the  provision  of  housing  as
              well as to upgrade the unacceptable living conditions for  the
              inhabitants of Warrenton. This was  the  birth  of  the  first
              housing   project   in   Ikhutseng.   Warrenton   Municipality
              constructed 200 houses in  a  former  traditional  poor  black
              township,  which  was  completed  in   1996.   Ikhutseng   was
              enormously disadvantaged and is still suffering the effects of
              the apartheid government reign.


              The construction of the 121 houses in Warrenvale by  Warrenton
              Munipality, as well as  the  construction  of  600  houses  in
              Ikhutseng  by  Grinaker   Housing,   were   approved   shortly
              afterward. The construction of the 121  houses  in  Warrenvale
              and the construction of 475  houses  in  Ikhutseng  were  both
              completed in 1996, thereby generating a number  of  employment
              opportunities.


         2. Problems Experienced


              (a) Some of the houses are collapsing, especially  during  the
                  rainy season. The Department is trying to fix them.


              (b) There are people who apply for houses  when  they  already
                  own houses.


     H.     Windsorton


         1. Project Profile


              The town of  Windsorton  has  encountered  many  of  the  same
              experiences as Warrenton, but  in  many  instances  conditions
              were far worse.


              The first project was approved during  1995  by  the  MEC  for
              Local Government  and  Housing.  This  project  was  completed
              during 1998 whilst the size of the structures were  as  little
              as 16 square metres, which was not acceptable to the  MEC.  He
              was horrified at the delivery of these small  top  structures,
              which  formed  part  of  the  initial   projects   that   were
              implemented in the Northern Cape.


              Communities started complaining about the small top structures
              that were delivered by China Feng Pu and New Way  Development.
              The MEC issued a directive, stating  that  all  houses  to  be
              constructed in future would not  be  smaller  than  32  square
              metres. Housing delivery has since become  a  major  topic  of
              discussion at a number  of  meetings  and  news  reports,  and
              although the housing programme has been  criticised  severely,
              the government will  continue  in  its  endeavour  to  provide
              shelter to the homeless, whilst gently restoring the rights of
              people to a secure place in  which  to  live  with  peace  and
              dignity.
         2. Problems Experienced


              (a) Roofs are not intact - beneficiaries  have  placed  stones
                  and bricks on top of the roofs.


              (b) In 1998, 41,60 square metre houses were  built.  In  2000,
                  44,8   square   metre   houses   were   built.   Now   the
                  beneficiaries  of  the  41,60  square  metre  houses   are
                  complaining that their houses  are  small  and  that  they
                  also would like to occupy the bigger houses.


     I.     Comments and Recommendations


         1. In order to  ensure  that  housing  delivery  occurs,  roll-over
              funds allocated to other provinces for housing projects should
              be made available to needy provinces.


         2. Housing subsidy application  forms  should  cater  for  disabled
              people, so that the Department would be able to determine from
              them who are disabled.


     J.     Conclusion


         The Committee members  are  convinced  that,  with  regard  to  the
         delivery of houses, the Department has played a big  role.  Amongst
         the provinces that the Committee has  visited,  the  Committee  has
         observed that the Northern Cape has delivered more houses than  any
         other province.

11.   Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Housing  on  Study  Tour  to
     Northern Province, dated 20 June 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Housing, having undertaken a  visit  to  the
     Northern Province from 16 to 20 April 2001, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The  multiparty  delegation   undertook   the   study   tour.   The
         delegation, under the leadership of Mr G Scheeneman,  consisted  of
         five members and two officials: Mrs M M Ramakaba-Lesiea  (ANC),  Mr
         M W Skhosana (ANC), Mr B W Dhlamini (IFP), Mr A Singh (DP), Ms  A-M
         Jojozi  (Committee  Secretary)   and   Ms   K   Pasiya   (Committee
         Assistant).


     B.     Objectives


         The Committee went on the tour with the following objectives:


         1. To fulfil its monitoring and oversight function - the  Committee
              intended to establish progress  made  with  the  "Housing  the
              Nation" programmes.


         2. To exchange views with the Legislature and hear the feelings  of
              people on the ground on housing projects.


         3. To look at  the  various  housing  projects,  such  as  People's
              Housing Projects and other Inner City Developments.


     C.     Provincial Department


         The Department determined that houses built should not  be  smaller
         than 40 square metre. R334 million was allocated for housing.  With
         the flood disaster experienced in February 2000, 23 000 houses  had
         to be built, and 3 000 have been completed. The  remaining  20  000
         have to be funded from the R334 million allocated for housing.  R48
         million was rolled over from the previous year.


         The  Department  has  a  huge  backlog  in  respect  of  rebuilding
         people's homes.


         Some beneficiaries refuse to occupy houses built in townships,  and
         others sell their houses for far less than  the  actual  cost.  The
         Department does not have  a  mechanism  to  curb  this  corruption.
         There are also foreigners with false IDs' which  are  difficult  to
         detect. They also engage in marriages of convenience  in  order  to
         qualify for houses.


         The Department did not have sufficient funds to train developers.


         There were squatter camps, especially close to  rural  towns,  with
         which the Department had problems.


         The government did respond appropriately to the flood  disaster  of
         February  2000.  The  Department  needed  a  policy   on   disaster
         management to enable them to  address  the  plight  of  communities
         experiencing disasters.


         There  was  tension  between  traditional  leaders  and  new  local
         government systems.


         The Department of Labour did not follow up on trained people  after
         projects were finished in order to ensure that those  people  could
         be employed elsewhere. No certificates were given  to  the  traines
         people.


         Former white towns had legislation which  made  provision  for  how
         land  should  be  developed.  Rural  areas  were  not  taken   into
         consideration.  For  example,  the  housing  manual  did  not  make
         provision for upgrading rural settlements.


         Some of the projects took about  six  months  or  one  year  to  be
         approved.


     D.     Sengatane Housing Project (Rural Project)


         1. Project Profile


              Sengatane is a rural village on tribal land.  It  is  situated
              about 30 km west of  Pietersburg  under  the  jurisdiction  of
              Aganang  Municipality.  The  first  people  to  live  in  this
              village, settled in the early 1900s,  almost  100  years  ago.
              Many  people  had  built  their  own  houses,  and  some  were
              traditional mud  houses.  In  recent  years  the  village  was
              enlarged by approximately 100 stands. These stands were mainly
              taken by young people who grew up in the village.


              In 1994 the community initiated the Sengatane Housing  Project
              by approaching  VBL  Consulting  Engineers  CC  to  launch  an
              application on their behalf. The Project was approved in  1995
              and 243 units  (40  square  metres)  were  allocated,  with  a
              contract value of R3 645 000, (Geo-technical Allowance of R269
              730). The value of the project  was  R3  914  730  The  Tribal
              Authority involved itself in the Project because Sengatane was
              on tribal land. The first occupant moved in in 1998. A  school
              has been built in the area and services  have  been  improved.
              The services offered, were water connection in the  yards  and
              ventilated and improved pit toilets. Two  local  artisans  and
              labourers were used for constructing houses.


         2. Problems experienced


              The Project was delayed because of the following:


              (a) Different role-players had to  be  consulted.  The  Tribal
                  Authority was one of  the  role-players  that  had  to  be
                  consulted,  as  the  Project  was  on  tribal  land.   The
                  municipality had to request  permission  from  the  Tribal
                  Authority to allow developers to  start  the  Project  and
                  also to the transfer land to  Municipality.  Beneficiaries
                  had to be issued with title deeds. This  resulted  in  the
                  availability  of  land  becoming  a  point   of   dispute,
                  traditional leaders fighting among themselves.  Eventually
                  it was agreed by the Northern Province Housing Board  that
                  permission to occupy land was sufficient tenure  right  to
                  allow people to obtain  subsidised  houses.  This  dispute
                  delayed the project for three years before  the  agreement
                  was signed.


              (b) Transfer of power from the Transvaal Housing Board to  the
                  Northern Province Provincial  Housing  Board  also  caused
                  delays to the approval of the Project.


              (c) Shortage  of  water  in  the  area  was  a  huge  problem.
                  Beneficiaries were  scattered  amongst  non-beneficiaries.
                  Non-beneficiaries refused to pay  for  water  connections.
                  The  contract  with  the  developer  stipulated  that  the
                  developer should install water connections to  all  units.
                  The fact that not everybody qualified for the subsidy  and
                  only those who did were contributing towards the  cost  of
                  the water service, was a problem for  the  developers,  as
                  they were required  to  install  services  for  everybody,
                  regardless of whether they were contributing or not.  This
                  made the installation of services  very  uneconomical  for
                  the developer.


              (d) Potential beneficiaries were intimidated. Some people were
                  told by outsiders, including  tribal  leaders,  that  they
                  would eventually have to pay for the houses. This  led  to
                  many  people  rejecting  the  Project  and  opposing   the
                  developer in every possible way.


              (e) The housing manual was written for urban development,  and
                  does  not  make   provision   for   upgrading   of   rural
                  settlements. For example, many of the people who  live  in
                  rural areas have  built  their  own  houses  -  of  better
                  standard than RDP houses. But they do not have  access  to
                  water and sanitation, and they also need  these  services.
                  The Provincial Housing  Board  was  requested  to  make  a
                  ruling in this regard. They provided those people  with  a
                  full subsidy, except the top structure  component  of  the
                  subsidy. The saving brought about was  utilised  to  serve
                  more  people   in   the   community.   286   beneficiaries
                  benefitted  from  the  Project  without   increasing   the
                  Project budget.


              (f) Traditional leaders  are  not  represented  in  the  local
                  council.


              (g) Houses are very hot in summer and very cold in winter.


         3. Positive features


              (a) The Project is community-driven.


              (b) The local community was empowered by    trained,  as  they
                  were  involved  in  all  the  work  done  with  regard  to
                  building the  structures.  This  enabled  them  to  obtain
                  employment in other areas.


              (c) The community earned about R1,5 million  in  the  form  of
                  wages.


              (d) The standard of living of the community has improved.


     E.     Jane Furse Project Linked


         1. Project Profile


              Jane Furse is about 130 km north of Pietersburg.  The  Project
              is allocated 1 000 units, (40 square metres) and out of  1 000
              units,  524  (52%)  were  completed  and  521  transferred  to
              beneficiaries. 250  sites  were  set  aside  for  middle-class
              income earners. The Project was approved at the end  of  1996,
              and it was expected to be completed  by  November  2001.  More
              than 10 subcontractors were employed.


         2. Problems experienced


              The town register was delayed. The MEC  for  Local  Government
              and Housing wanted to comply with the  new  regulation,  which
              stipulated that an advertisement must be published and that 21
              days have to pass before  the  community  can  be  allowed  to
              participate in the Project. This  new  regulation  came  about
              after the Project was started and it resulted in a delay.


              (a) The community had to apply for title of streets/roads,  as
                  they were in a bad state.


              (b) It took  about  three  months  to  negotiate  with  Tribal
                  Authorities.


              (c) P4 and P5 certificates slowed the  construction  progress-
                  most projects are stopped due to them.


              (d) Only about 286 people have paid the electricity connection
                  fee. Most people were under the  impression  that  it  was
                  free of charge. Eskom can only  install  electricity  when
                  about 80% of the beneficiaries  have  paid  the  fee.  The
                  beneficiaries are  prepared  to  pay  the  connection  fee
                  after Eskom has installed electricity. The refusal to  pay
                  the fee was caused by the fact that the  municipality  had
                  delayed explaining  to  beneficiaries  that  there  was  a
                  certain amount to be payed for connection.


              (e) There are about 1 500  people  on  the  waiting  list  for
                  houses.


         3. Positive features


              The Project has created employment for local people, as  local
              contractors and suppliers have  been  used.  The  Project  has
              improved the lives of many people, as electricity, water  taps
              and water sewage were installed.


     F.     Witrivier (Agrivillage)


         1. Project Profile


              (a) In  1999,  the  Housing  Board  was  approached  by  local
                  councillors  and  representatives   from   the   Witrivier
                  community. The aim was to request the Board to assist  the
                  Witrivier   community   to   acquire   subsidised   houses
                  agreement was reached in October 2000. Town  planning  has
                  been   consolidated   and   reaffirmed.   There   was   no
                  electricity in the area and installation of services  were
                  to be done at the beginning of May 2001. 550  houses  have
                  been registered under  the  township.  Beneficiaries  were
                  people working in the mines and on farms in the area.  The
                  Project was called Agrivillage and the beneficiaries  were
                  encouraged to engage in agricultural  activities,  whether
                  farming or agricultural (crop)  production.  The  idea  of
                  Agrivillage came about when beneficiaries  who  were  farm
                  workers, were identified.


              (b) Engineering designs have been completed. The houses to  be
                  built, are 40 square metres, with an outside  toilet.  The
                  community used to be skeptical of the  project,  as  there
                  were delays before it was started. The  Project  is  three
                  months behind and the community  is  not  happy  with  the
                  delay.


              (c)  Services  are  offered  by  an  emerging  contractor  and
                  interested unemployed people in the community are  trained
                  to provide top structures.


         2. Problems experienced


              The Project was delayed because of the following:


              (a) The construction of houses was supposed to have  commenced
                  in January 2001, but in February 2001  it  was  discovered
                  that  the  Witrivier  township  falls   under   the   "old
                  KwaNdebele homeland".  The  land  had  to  be  transferred
                  from Land Affairs to the local council. This  transfer  of
                  land  took  a  long  time  to  be  completed,  as  various
                  stakeholders had to  be  consulted  before  town  planning
                  could bring the township  to  the  stage  of  opening  the
                  register. Town planning for the area was done in  Pretoria
                  in 1980, and  the  new  government  had  to  do  own  town
                  planning. This has not been completed; and the  developers
                  are hoping that it would be completed  within  two  and  a
                  half months. The process of opening the township  register
                  entails making contact and reaching an agreement with  the
                  chief of the area. And the  Department  of  Land  Affairs,
                  inviting objections pertaining to any claims to the  land.
                  This delayed the Project, and the community is anxious  to
                  get  the  houses.   Beneficiaries   still   have   to   be
                  identified.


              (b)  The  developers  were  hoping  to  start  with  the   top
                  structures in January  2001.  This  did  not  happen.  The
                  community was expecting the  top  structures  to  be  made
                  available to them by February/March 2001.  The  completion
                  and transfer of units to beneficiaries will only  be  done
                  after opening of the township register.


              (c) The 550 houses to be built, are not adequate, as there are
                  more farm workers who need houses.


     G.     Ramathlodi Park (Inner City)


         1. Project Profile


              (a)  Ramathlodi  Park  is  situated  about   seven   km   from
                  Pietersburg on the way to the University of the North.  It
                  is a middle-income housing  project,  falling  within  the
                  Polokwane municipal jurisdiction.  The  Project  commenced
                  on April 2000, following the approval date on 20  December
                  1999. The contract was signed on 14 April  between  TEBCON
                  Development and the Department  of  Local  Government  and
                  Housing. The total budget for  this  Project  was  R1  250
                  000. Actual construction of houses was expected  to  start
                  in July 2001; after that the services will be handed  over
                  to the municipality. The developer is presently  marketing
                  the stands. 544 hectares of  the  farm  where  the  houses
                  will be built,  is  owned  by  TEBCON.  The  area  has  no
                  municipality wards. The developers have been on  site  for
                  three months.


              (b) The area is going to be electrified by Eskom  and  streets
                  will be tarred.  TEBCON  has  been  in  contact  with  the
                  relevant departments  (i.e.  Education,  Health,  etc)  to
                  ensure  that  all  required  and  essential  services  are
                  provided.


              (c) 1% White, 0% Indian, 0% Coloured  and  99%  Africans  have
                  submitted applications for stands. Most of the  applicants
                  will be financed by financial institutions.


         2. Problems experienced


              (a) The developers are unable to build show houses  to  market
                  stands, as they were refused approval  by  the  Department
                  of Local Government and Housing.


              (b) Heavy rains in the area have slowed progress with building
                  sewage pipelines.


              (c) A  communication  breakdown  between  officials  has  also
                  caused delay.


              (d) 70% of the applicants do not qualify for  stands  and  30%
                  are overqualified. This means funds which  are  not  used,
                  will be sent back to the Department  of  Local  Government
                  and Housing.


     H.     Nancefield Hostel/Extension 4


         1. Project Profile


              (a) Nancefield hostel is situated in  Nancefield  Township  in
                  Messina.  The  hostel  was   established   in   1965   and
                  accommodated males only. An application was  made  to  the
                  Northern Province Housing Board to  redevelop  the  hostel
                  into  family  units.  There  were  about  500  males   who
                  occupied the hostel. The initial application  was  for  63
                  family units, but  it  was  clear  that  others  would  be
                  without  accommodation.  Land  was  identified  where  250
                  units could be built for them. 74 family  units  came  out
                  of the hostel (at R1 121 000). The remaining 250  families
                  will be accommodated in the housing  units  to  be  built.
                  The family  units  were  officially  handed  over  to  the
                  beneficiaries  in   December   2001   and   will   receive
                  electricity before the end of 2000.  Hostel  dwellers  are
                  happy with the new arrangement  and  they  feel  that  the
                  change is a great improvement.


         2. Problems experienced


              (a) At first it was difficult to convince hostel dwellers that
                  family units are important for them and their families.


              (b) With regard to Extension 4, there were  beneficiaries  who
                  were not occupying their sites, and it  was  difficult  to
                  trace them. These unclaimed houses were occupied by  those
                  without houses, until the beneficiaries  claim  them.  The
                  Department cannot sell houses to those who need  them,  as
                  there is legislation in place to protect those with  title
                  deeds.


              (c) There are people who apply for houses  when  they  already
                  own houses.


     I.     Nzhelele/Tshipise Flood/Disaster Project


         1. Project Profile


              (a) Nzhelele/Tshipise is about 190 km north of Pietersburg. In
                  February 2001, the area experienced  floods  and  most  of
                  the people were affected. The  Tshipise  disaster  project
                  has about 530 units, scattered in about  36  villages.  At
                  least 107 units (up  to  wallplate)  and  237  foundations
                  have been completed. The Project is  managed  by  a  woman
                  developer with about 110 employees.


              (b) At present, some of the people who were  affected  by  the
                  disaster are accommodated in  tents,  in  schools  and  by
                  relatives. The Department has managed to fund about 1  054
                  units in different areas that  were  also  struck  by  the
                  flood  disaster.  Traditional  Leaders  have   given   the
                  council some land to build  about  500  units  (54  square
                  metres).


         2. Problems experienced


              (a) Funds allocated for the Tshipise Disaster Project are  not
                  enough. The Department has decided to use funds  allocated
                  for other projects to  assist  the  areas  most  affected.
                  There are a number of people who need houses but  who  are
                  poor and cannot afford to rebuild their own houses.


              (b) Developers and contractors delay construction of units.


     J.     Mukumbani People's Housing Process


         1. Project Profile


              (a)  The  Mukumbani  People's  Housing  Process  project   was
                  approved in April 1999 (250 housing units). An  amount  of
                  R1 268 00 allocated for this Project is already  deposited
                  in the Thohoyandou TLC project  account  for  construction
                  of the housing units. It was  specified  in  the  business
                  plan that all 40 labourers and four office-bearers  should
                  undergo  capacity-building  training   at   the   Northern
                  Training Trust (NTT). The NTT  has  provided  training  to
                  these labourers and office-bearers.


              (b) 43 units (52 square metres) have  been  completed  and  37
                  local labourers out  of  the  40  labourers  trained,  are
                  involved in the construction of these units.  The  Project
                  has six office-bearers. Each office-bearer is paid  R1 000
                  for 12 months.


              (c) The Department  of  Labour  has  provided  free  training.
                  Different organisations identified people  to  be  trained
                  and names were submitted to  that  department.  The  local
                  council has assisted with technical  issues  by  assessing
                  the  houses  built  and  assisting   local   builders   in
                  improving their skills. Salaries  for  builders  are  paid
                  though the establishment grant.


              (d)  No  developers  are  involved  in  the  Project,  because
                  developers determine their own housing  structures,  which
                  the  beneficiaries  are  not  happy  with  sometimes.  The
                  community  feels  that,  as   beneficiaries,   they   have
                  experienced less problems when building their  own  houses
                  according  to  their  own   needs   and   to   their   own
                  satisfaction. There is less theft  of  building  material,
                  as the community is  aware  that  should  they  steal  the
                  building material, they will be the ones to suffer.


              (e) Local building-brick companies are used and they  have  to
                  go through the normal tender process,  hence  they  charge
                  reasonable prices.


         2. Problems experienced


              Like all other projects the Mukumbani project was delayed  due
              to the following:


              (a) Construction was supposed to have commenced in  July  1999
                  but this  did  not  happen,  due  to  some  technicalities
                  between the Department of Finance and  the  Department  of
                  Local Government and Housing. Although it only started  on
                  15 October 2000, some significant progress has been made.


              (b) On rainy days, it is difficult to work, due to the type of
                  roads builders have to cross  to  reach  the  construction
                  sites where they have to deliver building materials.


              (c) Some people do not want to see  progress  and  development
                  taking place in the area.


     K.     Meeting with MEC


         1. Problems experienced


              (a) There is a high level of poverty in  the  province.  State
                  intervention  is  needed  to  provide  both   social   and
                  economic  infrastructure  so  as  to  eradicate   poverty.
                  Providing houses to people can  assist  in  ensuring  that
                  poverty is eradicated. Housing should be seen as not  only
                  a social development  but  as  building  the  economy.  In
                  February  2000,  the  province  was  struck  by  a   flood
                  disaster, and infrastructure like roads and  bridges  were
                  damaged. The damage  was  about  R2  million,  which  also
                  contributed  to  the  backlog  in   respect   of   housing
                  projects.
              (b) Projects are delayed because some communities  fight  over
                  land, transfer of land and the way in which land is  being
                  administered (more powers  are  given  to  the  Minister).
                  Land claims also contribute to this delay.


              (c)  The  Department  of  Local   Government   and   Housing's
                  administration    has    experienced    some     problems.
                  Resignation,  suspension  and   dismissal   of   officials
                  involved  in  housing  projects  within   the   Department
                  resulted in projects being delayed.


              (d) Developers sometimes use funds allocated to them for other
                  purposes.  The  Department  will   be   terminating   some
                  contracts with developers who  were  allocated  funds  and
                  have delayed starting their projects. For  example,  there
                  are developers who were given funds in 1997 and  who  have
                  not finished their projects. The Department  will  monitor
                  their  progress   closely   and   will   terminate   their
                  contracts, should they not meet their deadlines.


         2. Future developments


              This year the Department  will  address  the  entry  of  women
              developers  and  women  constructors   in   the   construction
              industry. In a Minmec meeting  held  in  April  2001,  it  was
              agreed that more than 10% of  the  housing  budget  should  be
              allocated  to  women  contractors.  The  MEC  has  engaged  in
              discussions with women constructors and developers.


     L.     Comments and recommendations


         1. The Department of  Housing  and  Local  Government  should  hold
              meetings with community development forums in order  to  solve
              and discuss problems experienced by communities.


         2. There should be a joint venture between  developers,  management
              and the council  to  solve  problems  experienced  before  and
              during the construction of projects.


         3. The issue of P4 and P5 certificates has to be addressed.


         4. Town planning should  be  completed  before  other  stakeholders
              like developers are consulted in respect of projects.


         5. Informal training offered by developers  should  be  accompanied
              by certificates to ensure that those who are trained, are able
              to get employment elsewhere.

     SUBMISSION OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL: MEMORANDUM, IN TERMS OF RULE 238 OF
     THE RULES OF THE NATIONAL  ASSEMBLY,  BY  THE  PORTFOLIO  COMMITTEE  ON
     JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and  Constitutional  Development
         is hereby requesting the permission of the House in terms  of  Rule
         230(1) for the introduction of the  following  legislation  in  the
         House:-


         (a)     Particulars of the proposed legislation


              The  legislation  will  comprise  a  Loss  or   Retention   of
              Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures  Bill,  and
              will be aimed at substituting items 23 and 23A of  Schedule  2
              to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 (Act
              No. 200 of 1993).


         (b)     Objects of the proposed legislation


              1.  In terms of item 23A of Schedule 2 to the Constitution  of
                  the Republic of South Africa, 1993, an Act  of  Parliament
                  may, within a  reasonable  period  after  the  new  (1996)
                  Constitution took effect, be  passed  in  accordance  with
                  section 76(1) of the 1996 Constitution to amend that  item
                  and item 23 in order to provide for the  manner  in  which
                  it will be possible for -


                  *    a member of a legislature who ceases to be  a  member
                       of the party which nominated that member,  to  retain
                       membership of such legislature; and


                  *    any existing party to merge with  another  party,  or
                       any party to subdivide  into  more  than  one  party,
                       whilst allowing a member of a legislature affected by
                       such  changes,   to   retain   membership   of   such
                       legislature.


              2.  The Bill therefore aims to substitute the  said  items  23
                  and 23A in order to provide for  the  procedures  referred
                  to above.


         (c)     Financial implications for the State


              The proposed legislation will not lead to any expenditure  for
              the State.

     Amendment Bill [B 46B and B 46D - 2000] (National Assembly -  sec  76),
     dated 9 November 2001:


         The  Mediation  Committee,  having  considered  the  Cultural  Laws
         Second Amendment Bill [B 46B and B 46D - 2000]  (National  Assembly
         - sec 76), as well  as  the  papers  referred  to  it,  reports  as
         follows:


         1.  The  Cultural  Laws  Second  Amendment  Bill  [B  46B  -  2000]
              (National Assembly -  sec  76)  was  passed  by  the  National
              Assembly on 24 May 2001 and submitted to the National  Council
              of Provinces for approval.


         2. The National Council  of  Provinces  passed  the  Cultural  Laws

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Joint Budget Committee on the  Medium  Term  Expenditure
     Framework, dated 13 November 2001:


     The Joint Budget Committee report as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The terms of reference of the Committee was:


         1. To analise  and  debate  the  2001  Medium  Term  Budget  Policy
              Statement (MTBPS).


         2. To conduct hearings on the  Medium  Term  Expenditure  Framework
              (MTEF) and the Division of Revenue Bill.


         3. To engage in the budgeting process throughout the  budget  cycle
              in order to allow Parliament  to  have  an  input  during  the
              drafting stage of the budget.


         The Committee was formed on 30 October 2001, the same day that  the
         MTBPS  was  tabled.  In  an  effort  to  interrogate  the  spending
         priorities of national departments, as outlined in the  MTBPS,  the
         Committee invited the following participants:


         (a)     National departments, as mentioned in the MTBPS.


         (b)     Civil society.


         (c)     Business leaders.


         (d)     Chairpersons of Portfolio and Select Committees.
         The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review (IGFR) formed a basis  for  the
         discussion on the Division of Revenue.


         The broad policy priorities of the government over the Medium  Term
         Expenditure Framework  (MTEF)  is  the  "reduction  of  poverty  to
         alleviate inequality and vulnerability". The context in which  this
         can be  achieved,  is  through  the  following  priorities  of  the
         national government, as listed in the MTBPS:


         *  "Continued  emphasis  on  investment  in,  and  maintenance  and
              rehabilitation of infrastructure, enhancing South Africa's job
              creation and economic growth prospects over the medium to long
              term".


         *   "Strengthening  programmes  that  address  the  impact  of  the
              HIV/AIDS epidemic".


         *  "Rebuilding Local Governments and meeting commitments to  ensure
              free basic service delivery".


         *  "Strengthening capacity in the safety  and  security  sector  to
              prevent and combat crime".


         *  "Restructuring national entities, specifically the  Unemployment
              Insurance Fund and  the  SA  Post  Office,  enabling  them  to
              improve the quality and access to service delivery".


         *   "Further  strengthening  of  tax  administration  capacity  and
              establishing a financial intelligence centre to assist  global
              efforts in combating money laundering".


     B.     South Africa's macroeconomic environment


         The government's commitment to budgetary restraint  over  the  past
         five years has produced a reduction in borrowing and debts  service
         costs.  The  resulting  increase  investor   confidence,   led   to
         increases  in  gross  domestic   fixed   investment,   which   will
         facilitate strong real growth  in  spending  over  the  next  three
         years while  still  maintaining  a  sound  and  sustainable  fiscal
         policy  stance.  In  addition,  improved  efficiency   in   revenue
         collection has improved tax compliance and  tax  morale,  resulting
         in additional resources to reduce government debt and provide  room
         for tax cuts.


     C.     Benefit of depreciating rand


         The depreciating rand to the dollar  has  benefitted  the  economy,
         mainly in  encouraging  higher  and  more  diversified  exports  of
         manufactured  goods  and  services,  leading  to  the  increase  in
         competitiveness of our exports and sustaining  growth.  However,  a
         depreciated  rand  raises  the  cost  of  imported  technology  and
         services to  maintain  our  competitive  advantage  in  the  export
         market.


     D.     Resilience of economy contributing to relative growth


         The current momentum in economic growth places South  Africa  in  a
         rather comfortable position to  respond  to  the  downturn  in  the
         world economy with an appropriate mix of  tax  relief,  accelerated
         infrastructure spending and further capital expenditure  on  social
         services and municipal  infrastructure  providing  real  growth  in
         public spending. The European Union Commission's  report  on  South
         Africa indicates that trade is up by 35%, in rand terms,  with  the
         slowdown in the European economy not expected to be as big as  that
         of the United States. The United States is expected, after  the  11
         September attacks, to  begin  substantial  public  spending  and  a
         series  of  interest  rates  cuts  to  stimulate  growth  in  their
         economy, shoyuld improve the economic outlook for  next  year.  The
         European  Union  has  already  started  implementing  monetary  and
         fiscal policies to stimulate growth, leading to further demands  in
         our export market. Further increases in  stability  and  confidence
         in our economy is expected to come from an upgrading of our credit-
         worthiness from  Moody's  next  year.  This  will  also  result  in
         increased fixed investment and reduced borrowing cost.


     E.     Tax policy and administration


         The restructuring of SARS along with other tax reforms has  enabled
         more revenue to be collected at a lower tax rate,  contributing  to
         both a steady improvement in the fiscal position  and  further  tax
         relief. Two most significant changes  to  the  tax  structure  have
         been the change  from  a  source-based  tax  to  a  residence-based
         income tax, with the introduction of capital gains tax.  Residence-
         based income tax adds to the fiscus by taxing the foreign  earnings
         of South  African  companies  and  individual.  Capital  gains  tax
         remedies  a  fundamental  deficiency  in  the  income  tax  regime,
         thereby improving  the  overall  equity  and  efficiency  of  South
         Africa's tax system.


         As part of  the  drive  to  stimulate  growth  in  the  economy  by
         creating  jobs,  a  wage  incentive  aimed   at   encouraging   the
         employment of learners has been introduced. This wage incentive  is
         set to encourage job creation by reducing the cost  of  hiring  new
         workers and to increase the skills base by  offering  learnerships.
         It  is  also  to  encourage  the  formalisation  of  the   informal
         employment sector, which will see further contributions to the  UIF
         and  other  goverment  programmes,   ultimately   benefitting   the
         workers.


     F.     Improvement in savings and investments  by  national  government
         and households


         The monetary policies pursued by the government  have  resulted  in
         declining interest rates. Inflation targeting  by  the  SA  Reserve
         Bank in the band of 6 to 3  per  cent  has  led  to  certainty  for
         investors.  Low  inflation  results  in  more   disposable   income
         benefiting  poor  people.  Both  investments  and  savings  in  our
         economy have shown signs of recovery  with  Gross  domestic  saving
         rising from 14.3 to 15.3 per cent of GDP from  1998  to  the  first
         half of 2001. Declining interest rates and  inflation  is  expected
         to accelerate gross fixed capital formation contributing to  growth
         in our economy, rising from 2.6 per cent in  2001  to  average  3.3
         per cent over the next three years.


     G.     Competitiveness


         The Department of Trade and Industry has also highlighted the  need
         for the increase in quality of raw  materials  produced  to  ensure
         competitiveness of South African exports. Examples  mentioned  were
         improvements needed in the quality  of  leather  produced  for  the
         motor vehicle industry in order to ensure exportable  quality.  The
         department is also involved in advising SMMEs and  entrepeneurs  to
         become more competitive by producing  goods  that  are  of  a  high
         quality and standard.


     H.     Fiscal Policy


         The 2001 Budget  announced  a  change  in  fiscal  policy  from  an
         environment where the focus was on  reducing  the  deficit  to  one
         that decidedly  contributes  towards  economic  growth.  Continuing
         with the trend, the Budget for  2002  is  expented  to  announce  a
         further acceleration in  public  spending,  especially  on  capital
         infrastructure and provides room for  a  reduction  in  tax  rates,
         especially to low and  middle-income  workers.  This  more  growth-
         oriented fiscal policy is possible  because  of  a  healthy  fiscal
         position and declining debts service  costs.  The  Government  will
         continue to moderate its borrowing in order to reduce debt  service
         costs and interest rates in the long-term.


     I.     Medium Term Expenditure Framework


         In keeping  with  the  budget  theme  for  next  year  -  "Reducing
         Poverty,  Inequality  and  Vulnerability",  the  following  section
         outlines  how  departments  are  responding  to  the   government's
         priorities in the way in which the policies are  changing  and  the
         2002 budgets are being put together.


     J.     Restructuring national entities


         The  Committee  supports  the  additional   allocations   for   the
         restructuring of the SA Post  Office  over  the  MTEF  period,  but
         caution that it should become  self-sustainable  in  future,  while
         retaining  its  social  responsibilities  to  deliver  services  to
         previously underserved areas. The operational  losses  incurred  by
         the SA Post Office can in part be attributed to the failure of  the
         strategic  management  partner,  poor  financial   management   and
         corruption. Furthermore, the extension of  services  to  areas  not
         covered is not compromised.


         Another spending pressure on the MTEF arises from the  past  policy
         and administration of the UIF, which has resulted in  poor  funding
         mechanisms  to  deal  with  increased  levels  of  unemployment.  A
         turnaround strategy by the Department of  Labour  was  designed  to
         ensure that the  fund  becomes  sustainable  in  future.  Extending
         coverage to high-income earners  whose  contribution  will  cushion
         reserves, as they are less likely to  lose  their  jobs  and  claim
         unemployment benefits, will ensure this objective.  The  use  of  a
         sliding scale  for  paying  out  claims  will  also  help  in  this
         endeavour. In addition, funds are collected from all employers  who
         make deductions, and SARS is now responsible for  collections.  The
         collection and benefit of the fund has  furthermore  been  extended
         to farm and domestic workers, whose  sectors  are  more  vulnerable
         than  those  of  people  in  permanent  employment.  Installing   a
         computer-based database system should facilitate this turnaround.


     K.     Poverty alleviation


         The key objective identified in the MTBPS is  poverty  alleviation,
         to reduce the burden on the most  vulnerable  members  of  society.
         Social development  is  the  one  area  where  the  government  can
         directly attempt to eradicate poverty.  The  Department  of  Social
         Development  has  taken  a  step  towards  eradicating  poverty  by
         implementing a poverty relief programme. This programme will  focus
         on food, security, income  generation,  youth  development,  micro-
         financing and the integration of people with disabilities.  In  its
         contribution, this programme supports employment of more  women  in
         construction to generate income for their own  means  of  survival.
         From the Health Department's side, there is huge investment in  the
         school-feeding  programme  that  provides  nutrition  to  those  in
         poorer communities.


         The poverty relief  fund  provides  further  benefit  for  projects
         aimed at alleviating the plight of the  rural  poor,  women,  youth
         and  the  disabled.  Funding  of  R1,5  billion  is  available  for
         projects that address water resourcing, waste management,  creation
         of   infrastructure   and   protection    of    water    resources.
         Infrastructure  projects  under  way  include  créches,   community
         facilities,  access  roads,  community  gardens  and  water  supply
         projects.


     L.     Social services cluster


         The social services cluster forms the  backbone  of  the  MTEF,  as
         outlined in the MTBPS. The various departments in the cluster  have
         all  committed   themselves   to   undertake   an   institutionally
         integrated approach to increase  the  infrastructural  capacity  to
         deliver on social services through, in some instances, jointly  co-
         ordinated projects.


         "Education and training  are  long-term  investment  that  lay  the
         foundation for  an  improved  quality  of  life  through  increased
         skills and capabilities", conferring a positive externality in  the
         sense that the benefits spill over to  the  entire  population.  An
         educated labour force is much more innovative and can  bring  about
         technological advancement,  which  will  eventually  contribute  to
         growth.


         Within the social services cluster,  the  Department  of  Education
         has its emphasis on the following objectives:  Equity,  efficiency,
         quality and  accountability.  Priorities  include  HIV/AIDS,  Early
         Childhood  Development  (ECD),  and   school   effectiveness.   The
         department is specifically focusing  on  ECD,  since  they  believe
         that it  addresses  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  allocation  of
         resources for early childhood development is particularly  welcomed
         by the FFC.


         A lack of investment on maintenance has  also  been  identified  in
         provincial education departments and the  number  of  schools  that
         needs repairs  still  remains  high.  The  national  Department  of
         Education has established a Directorate: Physical Planning to  look
         into the spending rates of various provinces.


     M.     Capacity problems


         One of the challenges facing the Department  of  Education  is  the
         lack of capacity to  convert  money  into  resources,  e.g.  buying
         learner support material or building classrooms. It is often  found
         that provinces do not know how to spend money in a timely and cost-
         effective  way.  This  problem  usually  exists  because  of   poor
         planning at management level.


         The  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  is  a  challenge  to  society  and   the
         government at large. The National Integrated  Plan  (NIP)  includes
         making resources available for  implementing  programmes  available
         to  the  Departments  of  Health,  of  Social  Development  and  of
         Education.  These  programmes  are  also  linked  to  the   poverty
         reduction strategy. The NIP is lead by  the  Department  of  Health
         and is aimed at spending money on prevention priorities,  expanding
         home-based care and community-based  care  programmes,  life-skills
         programming schools  and  voluntary  counselling  and  testing.  In
         respect of the Education Department, roll-overs  will  be  used  to
         pay HIV/AIDS officials that will be appointed to work  on  projects
         relating to HIV/AIDS.


         The FFC highly commends the additional allocation of resources  for
         the integrated strategy against HIV/AIDS -  R320  million  to  R422
         million for 2002-03 to R546 million for 2004 - to strengthen  home-
         and community-based care, and  support  voluntary  counselling  and
         testing and strength life-skills programmes  in  schools.  However,
         the FFC has reservations  about  including  this  as  part  of  the
         equitable share because  HIV/AIDS  and  other  diseases  associated
         with it may be covered in the PHC sector budgets.


         The child support grant has been extended to  reach  three  million
         beneficiaries by the end of  2002-03.  Despite  available  funding,
         problems persist. e.g. children  not  being  supported  because  of
         foster  parents  misusing  the  money.  This  leaves   the   Social
         Development Department to work  together  with  the  Department  of
         Home Affairs to make sure that applicants have  the  necessary  and
         valid identity documents and birth  certificates  when  they  apply
         for grants. This departmental co-operation can also  speed  up  the
         application processes.


         Even though additional  resources  have  been  made  available  for
         increases in the child support grant  and  other  grants,  the  FFC
         fears that the budgeted values - 2 000 values  were  used  -  would
         underestimate the demand placed on  these  grants,  especially  the
         foster care grant.


         On the housing front, the change in focus from quantity to  quality
         of housing has slowed down the delivery process. In  addition,  the
         department needs  to  develop  a  proper  planning  and  relocation
         approach, as well as focus on the integrated rural development  and
         urban renewal plans for future developments.


     N.     Co-ordination between departments


         In the administration services  cluster,  the  Department  of  Home
         Affairs  has  placed  itself  in  a  position  to  facilitate   the
         integration of all departments - Health, Police, etc,  as  well  as
         the Department of Labour (UIF), to  ensure  effective  delivery  of
         services and to  enable  access  to  pension  funds,  the  UIF  and
         welfare grants. The proper financial management system should be  a
         priority for the department, i.e. a  system  to  give  all  details
         about an individual when applying for grants,  identity  documents,
         UIF, etc.


         With  the  inheritance  of   infrastructure   backlogs   especially
         prevalent in housing, health  and  education,  the  government  has
         undertaken to  increase  spending  on  infrastructure  maintenance,
         rehabilitation,  and  on  construction  to  provide  the  necessary
         microeconomic framework, complementing  the  already  macroeconomic
         achievements, to bring about an  integrated  departmental  approach
         to sustain and support the delivery of public services.


     O.     Protection services cluster


         The objective of an integrated justice system,  comprising  police,
         justice,  correctional  services  and  defence,   is   pivotal   in
         stabilising crime levels  and  promoting  growth  in  the  country.
         Evidence presented to the  Committee  attested  to  the  fact  that
         integration of policy priorities  and  budgetary  allocation  is  a
         crucial  factor  within  this  cluster.  In  order  to  "strengthen
         capacity in the safety and  security  sector  and  to  prevent  and
         combat crime the budgetary allocation will grow  by  7,2  per  cent
         annually over the medium term". The  Committee  noted  that  a  key
         part of the hearings was devoted to personnel issues  and  salaries
         across the cluster.


     P.     Skills development and job creation


         One of the key issues for the Department of Labour  is  sustainable
         job creation in accordance with the job summit  commitments  agreed
         to in  1999,  through  special  employment  programmes,  integrated
         provincial projects,  sectoral  job  creation  and  human  resource
         development.  The  skills  development  levy  is  largely  used  to
         achieve this objective.


         In addition, the department aims to instil ordinary  citizens  with
         the necessary skills required in the job market. Another  challenge
         for the department is the training of people for these  programmes,
         especially in rural areas.


     Q.     Division of revenue


         The Committee considered a  report  on  the  vertical  transfer  of
         funds from  national  to  provincial  and  local  governments.  The
         spending priorities of the government, with respect  to  provincial
         and local government, encompasses social services spending  on  the
         provincial side and  the  provision  of  basic  services  to  local
         government.  In  line  with  this,  the  government  adjusted   the
         vertical share of the spheres of government to enable execution  of
         these priorities. In order to achieve equity,  revenue  is  divided
         horizontally by means of  unconditional  grants  (equitable  share)
         and  conditional  grants.  In  addition,  local  governments   have
         undergone  major  restructuring,  in  order  to  deliver  efficient
         services,  and  some  of  this  cost  burden  is  being  met   from
         nationally raised revenue.


         Some concerns raised by the Committee includes the fact that  these
         grants may not be sufficient to address  the  challenges  ahead  of
         local government, where  people  can  experience  direct  benefits.
         Some thought needs to  given  to  increasing  their  share  of  the
         equitable grant. Whereas a previous concern was the flow  of  funds
         to local governments, the challenge currently is the  underspending
         of funds. Second is the lack of capacity that still  exists  within
         some  departments  to  spend  allocated  funds.  In  addition,  the
         Committee was of the opinion that the mindset of local  governments
         should be  changed  to  include  three-year  budgets  and  spending
         priorities in order to ensure sustainable spending, providing  that
         the necessary spending capacity is available. This, in  turn,  will
         lead  to   the   improvement   in   and   increase   of   municipal
         infrastructure, in line with government priorities.  In  addressing
         the capacity problem, more information needs to be provided to  the
         National Treasury on spending measures in order to  have  proactive
         strategies to deal with underspending, as this could lead  to  lack
         of growth and non-delivery of services,  in  direct  opposition  to
         government priorities. More co-operation between different  spheres
         of government will ensure that local governments take ownership  of
         functions  assigned  to  them,  for  instance  to  make  sure  that
         affordable service charges accompany provision of low-cost  housing
         by the national government to  the  lower-income  groups.  Finally,
         the Committee is of the opinion  that  the  rural  development  and
         urban  renewal  strategies  should   be   vigorously   pursued   by
         provincial and local governments  through  co-operative  governance
         and a sound infrastructure planning.


         Provinces and municipalities are the  service  delivery  agents  of
         the government, and it is all  the  more  important  that  they  be
         capacitated to adjust their spending priorities to be in line  with
         those of the national government. Whereas  provinces  receive  most
         income (95%) through national transfers, i.e. the  equitable  share
         and various unconditional grants, municipalities have  the  ability
         to generate up to 90% of their own revenue. This  capacity  depends
         on their respective tax bases, and varies for Category A, B  and  C
         municipalities. Some financial  assistance  is  thus  required  for
         local government  in  particular,  where  major  restructuring  has
         taken place with the  amalgamation  of  284  local  governments  in
         order to meet spending priorities. This was done with  the  aim  of
         delivering   more   efficient   and   effective   services   across
         boundaries, particularly to areas  lacking  in  infrastructure  and
         service  delivery.  The  provision  of  services  to   communities,
         promoting  social  and  economic  development  and   infrastructure
         development, should be done in a sustainable way, and also  involve
         the community organisations.  Due  to  varying  tax  bases  between
         municipalities resulting in lack of  capacity,  there  is  often  a
         tendency for some  municipalities  to  be  unable  to  spend  their
         funds. It  therefore  becomes  important  for  provincial  and  the
         national government to intervene and support the  local  government
         to address service backlogs and improve service delivery. Once  all
         these structures are in place, municipal managers  should  then  be
         held  accountable  for  non-delivery  of   services,   arrears   in
         payments, deficits, corruption and non-reporting of information.


         The  other  way  of  improving  service  delivery  and  eradicating
         poverty  is  PPPs,  whereby  the  public  departments  are  joining
         together to increase the capacity and  skill  transfer  to  explore
         the  necessary  opportunities  and  improve   infrastructure.   The
         Department of Provincial and Local  Government  is  overseeing  the
         implemention  of  the  Integrated  Development  Plans   (IDPs)   in
         municipalities to direct resources towards key  policy  priorities.
         Furthermore,  the  effective  implementation  of   the   Integrated
         Sustainable  Rural  Development  Programme  (ISRDS)  uses  existing
         funding to focus on  improving  service  delivery  in  co-ordinated
         manner.


     R.     Minister of Finance's response to inputs of Committee


         1. General observations on inputs


              (a) Most input were supportive of the  growth-oriented  budget
                  statement.


              (b) Some people argue for faster growth and  others  for  less
                  borrowing and tax cuts.


              (c) The 2002 budget provides a balance that will contribute to
                  strong growth in  respect  of  infrastructure  and  social
                  services, as well as  tax  relief,  mainly  for  low-  and
                  middle-income workers.
         2. Current economy


              Although the global economic slowdown will affect  our  growth
              negatively, we are  still  projected  to  post  positive  real
              growth in the economy, due to:


              *   Strong fiscal position provides room for fiscal policy  as
                  a growth stimulant.


              *   The export sector is performing well, due to a competitive
                  currency.


              *   Inflation is on a downward trend, and we have not  had  to
                  hike interest rates or run up foreign liabilities, as  was
                  the case in 1998.


         3. Fiscal policy


              (a) The fiscal  framework  makes  provision  for  strong  real
                  growth in spending next year.


              (b) The frameworks create  room  for  tax  cuts  to  stimulate
                  expenditure on consumption.


              (c) Limitations to  borrowing  and  low  interest  rates  will
                  render growth in spending more sustainable.


              (d) PPPs and  regulatory  reform  can  be  used  to  stimulate
                  capital investment and job creation.


              (e) An increase in the deficit to 2,6% is projected.


         4. Tax policy


              (a) No major tax reforms in 2002.


              (b) Tax cuts will aim  to  stimulate  consumer  demand,  lower
                  employment  cost,   improved   overall   progression   and
                  fairness of the tax system.


              (c) During 2002, the government will  review  retirement  fund
                  taxes, public benefit organisations and  specific  sectors
                  where the effective rate is low.


         5. Spending framework


              (a) Top priority in 2002 will be given  to  reducing  poverty,
                  inequality and vulnerability.


              (b)  Other  priorities  are  increased  spending   on   health
                  services,    social    grants,     municipal     services,
                  infrastructure,  policing  and  administration   services,
                  strengthening of programmes and tackling HIV/AIDS.


              (c) The government must improve the quality of spending.


              (d) A situation of underspending  is  improving  signalled  by
                  government capital formation grew in  the  first  half  of
                  2001, the size of roll-overs is declining and  conditional
                  grant mechanisms are changed to aid spending.


         6. Intergovernmental finances


              (a) Growth in local government share caters for the  extension
                  of services to those at  present  excluded,  provision  of
                  free basic services and covering costs  of  governance  in
                  fiscally weak municipalities.


              (b) The transformation of local government should improve  the
                  level of efficiency and quality of services to the poor.


              (c) The provincial share rises to accommodate the social grant
                  take-up  and   inflation-related   increase   in   grants,
                  programmes to fight HIV/AIDS,  early  childhood  education
                  and acceleration of spending on infrastructure.


                  The Minister said that "hearings conducted in  the  Budget
                  Committee are a very positive development and that  inputs
                  and comments made will be factored into the 2002 Budget".


     S.     Comments and recommendations


         1.  The  Committee  supports  the  theme  of  the  2002  budget  of
              addressing poverty and vulnerability.  The  Committee  further
              agrees  with  major  priorities  of  the  government  and  the
              expansionary fiscal policy as  projected  over  the  MTEF.  It
              proposes to release funds to deal  with  the  social  problems
              affecting  the  poor,  while  at  the  same  time  stimulating
              economic growth and job creation over the medium to long term.


         2. The Committee is concerned with the lack of  capacity  to  spend
              in some areas of spending where services are delivered.  While
              there are improvements, the government must  put  measures  in
              place to deal with these urgently.  Committees  of  Parliament
              must play a role in monitoring this. Committees of the various
              legislatures  must  also,  scrutinise  and   monitor   monthly
              expenditure figures released by the Treasury on  a  continuous
              basis and hold departments accountable in accordance with  the
              PFMA. This should limit the  roll-over  of  funds  and  reduce
              underspending.


         3. The Committee is concerned  with  the  levels  of  co-ordination
              between government departments, despite the  cluster  approach
              of ministries at national  level.  This  is  more  visible  in
              government capital projects, with  the  resultant  roll-overs.
              The Committee  therefore  recommends  the  intensification  of
              better co-ordination at all levels, better  planing  at  local
              level and the utilisation of PPPs to enhance delivery, provide
              skills and expertise, where necessary. However, there needs to
              be proper regulation of these PPPs in order to avert  problems
              similar to those experienced with in some areas.


         4. The lack  of  financial  services  in  the  rural  areas  is  of
              concern, as such services are crucial for  rural  development.
              Possible mechanisms  for  financial  services  to  reach  poor
              areas, via The Post Bank, is one option in respect of  such  a
              service. The government,  via  the  Department  of  Trade  and
              Industry, is urged to explore  increased  spending  on  small,
              medium and micro enterprises.


         5.  Effective  co-ordination  for  maintenance  and  infrastructure
              between Department of Public Works and orther  departments  is
              necessary for maintenance and the roll-out  of  capital  works
              programmes of government.


         6.  There  is  a  need  to  strenghtened  the  capacity  of   local
              government in order  to  carry  out  its  mandate  to  deliver
              services.


         7. The Committee recommends that in future departments should  make
              presentations to the committee as clusters to further  improve
              co-ordination between departments.


     T.     Conclusion


         The Committee would like to thank all  participants  in  the  MTBPS
         hearings, as this will assist Parliament in its oversight role  and
         further contribute to the budget process.

5.     Report  of  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Powers  and  Privileges   of
     Parliament, dated 2 November 2001:


     The Ad Hoc Committee on Powers and Privileges of Parliament reports  as
     follows:


     1.     The Ad Hoc Committee was appointed on 5 April 2001.


     2.      The  Ad  Hoc  Committee  was   instructed   to   consider   the
         recommendations of the Joint Subcommittee on Powers and  Privileges
         of Parliament, and to introduce a Bill in accordance  with  Chapter
         13 of the National Assembly Rules, by 7 September 2001.


     3.     The Ad Hoc Committee members were appointed on 1 June 2001.


     4.     The Ad Hoc Committee met on 6 and 13 June  2001,  to  elect  its
         chairperson and to plan its work. It was decided to await  a  third
         draft of the Bill, which would include amendments suggested by  the
         Joint Rules Committee at its last meeting.


     5.     A third  draft  Bill  was  prepared  by  the  Parliamentary  Law
         Advisers, and published in the Government Gazette on 11 July  2001.
         The public was invited to comment on the contents of the  Bill  and
         make recommendations to the Ad Hoc Committee on it within 21  days,
         in terms of National Assembly Rule 240(a).


     6.     A few stakeholders suggested possible amendments to the Bill.


     7.     Having considered the draft Bill, written submissions by members
         of the  public  and  some  research  work  on  the  subject  matter
         throughout the world,  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  realised  that  the
         scope, range and complexity of the matters to be dealt with in  the
         legislation were of particular consequence to Parliament, and  that
         there was much to be derived from  investigating  all  contributing
         factors,  including  incidences   which   may   have   bearing   on
         legislation on these matters.


     8.     At its meeting on 21 August 2001, the Ad Hoc Committee agreed to
         utilise its mandate to confer with the Ad Hoc Select  Committee  on
         Powers and Privileges of  Parliament,  by  holding  joint  meetings
         with them. It was the view of the Ad Hoc Committee  that  it  would
         also save time to co-ordinate  the  meetings  of  both  Committees.
         This, however, meant that the  programme  of  meetings  had  to  be
         amended to accommodate the cyclic nature of the NCOP's  activities.
         The Ad Hoc Select Committee elected  its  Chairperson  on  21  June
         2001, and held its first meeting on 7 September 2001.


     9.     However, one of the Ad Hoc Select  Committee's  responsibilities
         is to consult with provincial legislatures on matters which  affect
         them. Such consultation was entered  into  with  the  legislatures,
         but to date only two of the nine legislatures have responded.  That
         process has therefore not been completed.


     10.    In view of the above, it became clear that the Ad Hoc  Committee
         would not be able to complete its work within  the  period  it  was
         given to do so, also as a  result  of  the  duties  of  Members  of
         Parliament at that time.


     11.    The Ad Hoc Committee was consequently given an extension of  its
         deadline for reporting to the National Assembly  until  2  November
         2001.


     12.    The Committees requested the parliamentary researchers to do  an
         in-depth study of similar legislation in  the  world,  particularly
         in Africa, with a view to  introducing  legislation  providing  for
         South African public representatives worthy of high esteem.


     13.    All parties agreed that, to save time and meet the new deadline,
         it was important to run workshops jointly with the  Ad  Hoc  Select
         Committee. The Committees held workshops  on  13,  14,  26  and  28
         September and 2 October 2001, at which they  considered  the  third
         draft Bill. These workshops were successfully concluded and led  to
         the foundation being laid for the fourth draft of the Bill.


     14.    The Committees held public hearings on  the  legislation  on  26
         September 2001. Although a number of stakeholders had been  invited
         to participate and had indeed indicated  their  interest  in  doing
         so, only Prof C Murray of the Law  Faculty  at  the  University  of
         Cape Town, Mr R Louw of the Media Institute of South Africa and  Mr
         N Dieltiens of Freedom of Expression gave their views on the  third
         draft of the Bill.


     15.    After earnest discussions on  the  legislation  and  identifying
         numerous provisions to be amended,  the  Committees  requested  the
         Parliamentary Law Advisers  on  28  September  2001  to  prepare  a
         fourth draft of the Bill, including all possible provisions  to  be
         considered for inclusion in a final draft Bill.


     16.    The fourth draft of the Bill was made available  on  17  October
         2001, and distributed to members of the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  18
         October 2001. It is the  intention  of  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  to
         consider the fourth draft with a view to improving it, with a  view
         to preparing a fifth and final draft.


     17.    One of the logistical difficulties encountered  by  the  Ad  Hoc
         Committee is that, unlike other parliamentary  Ad  Hoc  committees,
         ad hoc committees do not have their own  time-slots  for  meetings.
         This fact makes it well  nigh  impossible  to  find  meeting  times
         which do not clash with several other committee meetings which  the
         members of the Ad Hoc Committee are supposed to attend, as part  of
         their duties as Members of Parliament.


     18.    The Ad Hoc Committee had permission to meet on 24 October, 2,  7
         and 14 November 2001, to consider the fourth  draft  of  the  Bill.
         Unfortunately, the Ad Hoc Select Committee was not  in  a  position
         to  meet  on  24  October,  and  the  meeting  had  therefore  been
         cancelled.


     19.    At its meeting on 2 November 2001, the Ad Hoc Committee resolved
         to request the National Assembly to grant it  a  further  extension
         of its deadline until 31 March 2002. It also agreed not to meet  on
         7 and 14 November 2001, but that its work be prioritised  for  next
         year. It is the intention of the Ad Hoc Committee to meet  from  14
         January 2002 in order to finalise its work. The  Ad  Hoc  Committee
         further  resolved  that  the  Chairperson  of  Committees  of   the
         National Assembly be requested to ensure that the Ad Hoc  Committee
         be granted specific time-slots in 2002, in order to  enable  it  to
         hold  its  meetings,  despite  meetings  of  portfolio  and  select
         committtees.
