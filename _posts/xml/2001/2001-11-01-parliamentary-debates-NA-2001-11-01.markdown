                BIRTHS AND DEATHS REGISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon members, it  gives  me  great
pleasure to introduce the Births  and  Deaths  Registration  Amendment  Bill
2001. This, I need hardly emphasise, is a vital piece of  legislation  which
is not only progressive in nature, but fundamental in  its  compliance  with
the values enshrined in our Constitution,  namely,  quality  and  individual
freedom to choose. Many a time it is easy to  speak  of  these  values,  but
giving effect to them is a giant step in the  right  direction  in  ensuring
that ours is a democracy not only in word, but also in substance.

This Bill brings the age of majority in  line  with  what  the  Constitution
provides as it is the supreme law of  the  land  to  which  all  other  laws
should be subject. In the interests of the  country's  fledgling  democracy,
the Bill also takes a great step in the right  direction  by  levelling  the
playing field with regard to  equality  and  freedom,  regardless  of  one's
marital status.

In terms of this Bill, gone are the days  when  divorced  women,  with  sole
custody and guardianship of their  minor  children  had  to  resort  to  the
courts to change the surnames of their children in their  sole  custody  and
guardianship according to their wishes. The  general  legal  principles,  in
line with equity, equality and freedom of choice, are thus being  reinforced
in this Bill.

The fact that parents will be  allowed  to  register  their  children  under
either one of their surnames, or under both surnames joined  together  as  a
double-barrelled  surname  is  clearly  not  a  prescription  or  even   the
establishing of a new trend, but an indication  of  the  respect  engendered
and  enjoined  by  the  values  of  freedom  of  choice  enshrined  in   our
Constitution. In this rainbow nation, various people, parents, families  and
couples   have   different   wishes,   lifestyle   preferences   and    even
idiosyncrasies.  These  must  be  respected  and  accommodated  in  a   more
practical way. This is exactly what this Bill does. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

        CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND
       CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON JUDICIAL OFFICERS AMENDMENT BILL

Order disposed of without debate.

Report adopted.

 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AMENDMENT BILL CONSTITUTION OF
             THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA SECOND AMENDMENT BILL
           JUDGES' REMUNERATION AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Mr  Chairperson,
along with the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Bill,  this
debate concerns the  first  Constitution-amending  Bills  that  I  have  the
pleasure to introduce wearing the cloak  of  the  Minister  responsible  for
constitutional development.

I need not belabour the point that amendments  to  the  Constitution,  being
the supreme law of the land, need to comply with  very  specific  procedural
requirements, such as are set out in section 74 of the Constitution  itself.
Those  requirements  are  aimed  at  enhancing  the  democratic   principles
underlying  our  Constitution  by  ensuring  that  proposed  amendments  are
thoroughly canvassed among all interested parties and role-players and  that
the maximum degree  of  consensus  is  achieved  regarding  changes  to  our
Constitution.

I am raising this principle at the very outset,  because  as  the  Portfolio
Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  set  about   their
business of considering the  proposed  amendments,  it  became  clear  that,
notwithstanding the fact that both Bills had been published in  the  Gazette
for public comment well within the prescribed timeframes  for  introduction,
some aspects thereof still required further consultation with many key role-
players. It was accordingly decided that those matters  should  be  referred
back to the line-function  departments  for  further  discussions  with  the
interested parties, and that such amendments as may be required  would  then
be resubmitted to Parliament for consideration. I think that  this  approach
which  has  been  followed  by  the  portfolio  committee  and  this   House
underscores  our  total  commitment  to  upholding  the  democratic   values
underlying the Constitution, thus further  enhancing  the  stature  of  this
institution.

The amendments to the Constitution are contained in two Bills and,  for  the
sake of convenience, I  will  refer  to  them  as  the  first  Constitution-
amending Bill and the second Constitution-amending  Bill  respectively.  The
reason we are dealing with two  Constitution-amending  Bills  simultaneously
is that the first Constitution-amending Bill is required  to  be  passed  by
the National Assembly whilst the second Constitution-amending Bill  must  be
passed by both the National Assembly and the NCOP. The  first  Constitution-
amending  Bill  deals  with  matters  pertaining  to  the   judiciary,   the
appointment  of  Deputy  Ministers  and  the  borrowing  powers   of   local
governance,  while  the  second  Constitution-amending   Bill   deals   with
financial provisions exclusively.

As the amendments pertaining to the judiciary are  closely  related  to  the
Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Bill,  allow  me  to  deal
with the provisions relating to Deputy Ministers and financial  matters.  In
terms of section 91(3) of the Constitution, the President  of  the  Republic
may select any number of Ministers from among the members  of  the  National
Assembly and may  select  no  more  than  two  Ministers  from  outside  the
Assembly. In  terms  of  section  93,  Deputy  Ministers  may,  however,  be
appointed from among the members of the National Assembly only.

The effect of the requirement in section 93 that Deputy  Ministers  must  be
appointed from among the members of the National Assembly  is  that  if  the
President appoints a Deputy Minister from a party that has very few  members
of  Parliament,  that  party's  effective  participation  in  the   ordinary
business of Parliament might be severely compromised. Clause 5 of the  first
Constitution-amending Bill is consequently  aimed  at  bringing  section  93
into line with section 91(3) by making provision for the appointment of  not
more than two Deputy Ministers  from  outside  the  National  Assembly.  The
amendments contained in clauses 3 and 4, amending sections 54 and 58 of  the
Constitution,  are  consequential  to   clause   5   and   relate   to   the
accountability and privileges of non-Assembly Deputy Ministers.

The national Treasury has been involved in a process of  reviewing  national
legislation and financial matters. That  review  has  revealed  a  range  of
difficulties, both  legal  and  practical,  in  the  implementation  of  the
financial legislative  regime  contemplated  in  the  Constitution.  Section
216(1) of the Constitution for example requires  that  national  legislation
must establish a national Treasury and prescribe  measures  to  ensure  both
transparency and expenditure control in each sphere of government.

Parliament complied with that  constitutional  mandate  in  respect  of  the
national and  provincial  spheres  of  government  by  enacting  the  Public
Finance  Management  Act  in  1999.  In  respect  of  the  local  sphere  of
government, Cabinet has approved the introduction of the  Local  Government:
Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill,  which,  like   the   Public   Finance
Management Act, will  ensure  that  all  revenue,  expenditure,  assets  and
liabilities of municipalities are managed efficiently and effectively.

The Local Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill,  amongst  other
things,  regulates  municipal  borrowing   and   makes   it   possible   for
municipalities to have access to long-term borrowing at an affordable  rate.
These  important  and  necessary  changes,   however,   require   that   the
Constitution be amended to allow for the enactment of  legislative  measures
and  mechanisms  for  effectively  dealing  with  financial  emergencies  in
municipalities and to regulate municipal borrowing. As earlier announced  by
the Minister of Finance, the constitutional  amendments  to  allow  for  the
enactment of legislative measures and mechanisms for dealing with  financial
emergencies in municipalities have been postponed to the beginning  of  next
year in order to allow for further consultation.

I would be remiss in my duty to this august House if, Madam Speaker, I  were
to omit to mention  that  the  new  section  230A,  set  out  in  the  first
Constitution-amending Bill, brings about a  significant,  albeit  necessary,
change to our constitutional scheme. It  makes  provision  for  a  municipal
council to bind  itself  and  a  future  council  in  the  exercise  of  its
legislative  authority,  if  that  is  necessary  ``to   secure   loans   or
investments for the municipality''. This amendment is informed  by,  amongst
other things, the Constitutional Court's decision in Fedsure Life  Assurance
Ltd  v  Greater  Johnnesburg  TMC,  in  which  the  Constitutional   Court's
President, Justice Chaskalson, said:

It seems plain that when a  legislature,  whether  national,  provincial  or
local,  exercises  the  power  to  raise  taxes  or  rates,  or   determines
appropriations to be made out of public funds,  it  is  exercising  a  power
that under our Constitution is  a  power  peculiar  to  elected  legislative
bodies.  It  is  a  power  that  is  exercised  by  democratically   elected
representatives after due deliberation.

In order for a municipal council to raise affordable long-term  loans,  they
may be  required  to  make  collateral  promises  regarding,  amongst  other
things, how it will exercise  its  power  to  raise  taxes  or  rates.  Such
promises may have the effect of fettering the manner in  which  a  municipal
council and its successor in title  will  exercise  the  power  to  enact  a
budget.

It has been  considered  necessary  constitutionally  to  empower  municipal
councils  to  fetter  the  exercise  of  their  legislative  and   executive
authority, for the purpose of  raising  loans  or  investments,  because  in
Southern Metropolitan Substructure v Thompson the Witwatersrand  High  Court
has, per Acting Judge Pretorius, stated the principle against the  fettering
of executive action by contract as follows:


  A local authority may not, by contract, fetter itself so  as  to  disable
  itself from exercising its discretion as required by law.  Its  paramount
  duty is to preserve its own freedom to decide in every case as the public
  interest requires at the time.

Given that the law,  like  society,  is  dynamic,  the  review  of  national
legislation on financial matters has, as indicated above, revealed  that  in
some instances there may have been  confusion  in  the  conclusions  we  had
earlier made when, as elected representatives of our people, we drafted  the
Constitution. For example, we provided in section 220  of  the  Constitution
for the establishment  of  the  Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission  to  make
recommendations  to  Parliament,  provincial  legislatures  and  any   other
authorities provided for in legislation.

While we provided that this important body would make  recommendations,  and
not decisions, on financial  and  fiscal  matters,  and  that  it  would  be
independent, impartial and subject only to the Constitution and the law,  we
structured it as if it were a financial and  fiscal  bargaining  forum  with
representatives of each province and  local  government.  Besides  the  fact
that the FFC's composition, on the FFC's own admission,  is  cumbersome  and
has resulted in many vacancies, it also goes against the fundamental  tenets
of this body as being independent, also of provinces, impartial and  subject
to the Constitution and the law.

The FFC should not be subject to mandates given by the national  Government,
provinces and local government. The amendment of section  221  will  rectify
this anomaly, and result in an effective membership  of  only  nine  people.
Provision is made for the enactment of national legislation to regulate  the
participation of premiers and organised local government in the  appointment
of FFC members. There is, of course, a consequential  amendment  to  section
163 to deal with organised local government's participation in the FFC.

The legislative review undertaken by the national  Treasury  has  emphasised
the need for a comprehensive, transparent, coherent and  accountable  budget
process. To ensure this, it is proposed that, firstly, sections 77  and  120
of the Constitution should be amended to extend the definition  of  a  money
Bill to include Bills which abolish  or  reduce  or  grant  exemptions  from
taxes, levies, duties or surcharges. Secondly, section 73 is amended to  add
the Division of Revenue Bill  envisaged  in  section  214  to  the  list  of
legislation to be introduced in the National Assembly  by  the  Minister  of
Finance.

With regard to the judiciary, firstly, provision is made for the  Office  of
the President of the Constitutional  Court  to  become  that  of  the  Chief
Justice of  South  Africa.  This  necessitates  a  number  of  consequential
amendments, including the conversion of the offices  of  ``Deputy  President
of the Constitutional Court'' to ``Deputy Chief Justice'',  ``Chief  Justice
of the Supreme Court of Appeal  to  ``President  of  the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal'' and ``Deputy Chief Justice of the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal''  to
``Deputy President of the Supreme Court of Appeal''.

Secondly, section 176 of the Constitution is amended in order to enable  the
legislature to extend the term of office of Constitutional Court  judges  by
means of an Act  of  Parliament.  At  present,  section  176  provides  that
Constitutional Court judges hold  office  for  a  nonrenewable  term  of  12
years, and must retire at the age of 70, whereas other  judges  hold  office
until they are discharged  from  active  service  in  terms  of  an  Act  of
Parliament.

Since  the  advent  of  the  new   constitutional   dispensation   and   the
establishment of the Constitutional Court, there has been uncertainty as  to
which court is the highest or apex court in  the  Republic,  and,  likewise,
which office is the highest judicial office in the Republic.  The  amendment
seeks to deal with this.

The Judges' Remuneration  and  Conditions  of  Employment  Bill,  2001,  was
originally introduced into Parliament as  the  Judicial  Officers  Amendment
Bill. Due to a number of reasons, the Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and
Constitutional Development  decided  to  deal  with  only  those  provisions
contained  in  the  Bill  which  pertained  to  judges'   remuneration   and
conditions of employment which cannot be held in  abeyance  until  the  2002
session of Parliament.

In this process, the committee  also  gave  impetus  to  the  initiative  of
rationalising the laws of the  former  Republic  of  South  Africa  and  its
homelands relating to our  superior  courts.  This  rationalisation  process
will continue next year. I may mention for the information of  hon  members,
that some time ago I appointed a task team under  the  able  chairpersonship
of the  Honourable  Justice  Chaskalson,  President  of  the  Constitutional
Court, who will, once the Bills under  discussion  are  promulgated,  become
the Chief Justice of South Africa.

The purpose of this task team is to make recommendations pertaining  to  the
process of rationalisation  and  transformation  of  the  court  structures,
including recommendations relating to draft legislation, where  appropriate.
This task team works  according  to  an  agenda  to  achieve  the  necessary
reforms to our court structures.

The first item on its agenda, namely to make provision for the head  of  the
Constitutional Court to become Chief Justice, assisted  by  a  Deputy  Chief
Justice, and for the head of the Supreme  Court  of  Appeal  to  become  the
President of the Supreme Court of Appeal, assisted by a Deputy President  of
the Supreme Court of Appeal, has now been achieved.  I  will  come  back  to
this item if time allows me. The task team has  further  formulated  a  six-
stage approach to be followed  in  achieving  our  final  goal,  namely  the
complete  transformation  and  reform  of  our  court  structures  and   the
production of one single judiciary for the Republic of South Africa.

Hon members will remember the protagonists for life tenure argued that  this
- the approach that we have now changed - would be in the best interests  of
the Constitutional Court as an institution,  while  the  antagonists  argued
that the Constitutional Court, with all its powers, was,  from  the  outset,
intended to be presided over by judges with a  limited  or  rather  a  fixed
tenure of office, in a court almost set apart from the  ordinary  courts  of
the land. The Bill, as I have said, does  exactly  what  these  protagonists
and antagonists were wanting to achieve or to maintain.

Let us have a closer look at some of the key provisions of the  Bill,  which
give rise to this happy medium. Oh, I see  that  the  light  is  flickering.
Therefore, we may not be able to do some of these things. But with the  time
left,  may  I  thank  the  portfolio  committee,  and  the  other  portfolio
committees that were involved in  this  exercise,  for  dealing  with  these
Bills in the manner that they did, and may I  commend  all  three  Bills  to
this House. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  other  hon  Ministers,  hon
members, ladies and gentlemen, I rise on behalf of the ANC in  unconditional
support of these three Bills. It has been a  very  interesting  week.  I  am
surprised that member is still talking so much. They used to  say  one  week
was a long time in politics, but I think in South Africa we have  confounded
even that theory it seems that one hour  or  one  day  is  a  long  time  in
politics. So it has been an interesting week, and I am in a jovial mood.

As members know, there are  five  Bills  that  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Justice and Constitutional Development  has  passed  and  we  have  done  so
unanimously. Two of them will be dealt with tomorrow and the other three  we
are dealing with together today. I want to emphasise that all five of  these
Bills have been unanimously passed by the parties  in  the  committee.  This
is, of course, apart from the constitutional amendments  where  the  IFP  is
not necessarily opposed to the content of the  amendment  but  in  principle
they are not dealing with or voting on any constitutional  matters  at  this
stage.

It is really a proud moment to say that this has happened in the  committee.
We have really become a team in the committee. At one stage we  only  had  a
pack of forwards, a fly half and a scrum half; we now even have  a  backline
and we are operating like a good team. I  hope  we  do  not  play  like  the
Sharks played the other day, but rather like Western Province. But  we  have
a very good team, at least, that will be able to do so  and  take  our  work
forward.

Let me say a few thank yous. Firstly I want to thank our Minister again  for
the way that he has conducted and overseen the passing of these five  pieces
of legislation. As usual, he has guided us with a very steady hand,  yet  he
has also given us a lot of flexibility to deal  with  the  matters.  I  also
want to thank the other two Ministers, the Minister of Finance,  Mr  Manuel,
and also the Minister for Provincial and Local Government, Mr  Mufamadi  for
the help  that  they  have  given  us  with  the  constitutional  amendments
regarding those matters that we have dealt with from their departments.

And then I say a big thank  you  to  the  other  two  portfolio  committees,
particularly Ms Barbara Hogan and Mr Yunus  Carrim,  the  chairpersons,  and
those members of the committees who attended our meetings to  help  us  pass
these constitutional amendments. We thank them very much.  We  learned  much
from them during those meetings.

Then to my long suffering  committee.  I  want  to  thank  everyone  in  the
committee for the long hours we have sat  with  these  matters.  I  want  to
start with the opposition. Dr Delport, Mrs Camerer, Mr Mzizi, Mr  Swart  and
all the others - we cannot do the work that we do without you.  Then  to  my
crowd on this side, thank you very much for the support, the hard  work  and
the guidance.

Then to the departments. Thank you for some excellent  work  in  respect  of
all three departments for some excellent. There  was  Mr  Momoniat  and  Adv
Nkahla from the Department of Finance, Messrs De Lange,  Basset  and  Rudman
from Justice, and from local Government the director-general Mr  Zam  Titus,
and others. I thank them very much for the excellent  work  they  performed.
And then to the staff of the committee, to Adv Zenzile and  Ms  Hertzenberg,
thank you very much. They are a wonderful asset of the committee.

Let me now deal with the Bills a bit. I  want  to  deal  with  two  aspects,
firstly, a procedural matter  and  then  some  substantive  issues.  As  the
Minister  has   pointed   out,   during   our   deliberations   around   the
constitutional amendments the issue of  consultation  became  a  very  vexed
question, and we had some irate submissions and  inputs  during  the  public
hearings.

As the Minister has pointed out, we noted that the  legal  requirements  for
consultation had been properly complied with, by  Government,  in  terms  of
the  Constitution.  The  problem  was  that  before  these  amendments  were
published, it would seem that in some instances there  was  no  consultation
on these constitutional amendments, in other  instances  there  was  limited
consultation with small groups of persons.

Within the committee - I am talking here on behalf of all  three  committees
and all the parties - there was a very  strong  feeling  that  it  was  very
important that when we bring constitutional amendments to  this  Parliament,
there has to be a process whereby these issues  are  taken  to  the  broader
society, through the media and other means, to  allow  that  hegemony,  even
consensus, is reached around the amendments before they come to  Parliament.
Otherwise we get very  irate  submissions  sometimes  about  very  incorrect
points, abuse and even personal  attacks  on  individual  persons,  which  I
think in the main is totally uncalled for.

There  definitely  have  been  some  shortcomings  in   these   consultation
processes, and we have urged the departments to make  sure  that  this  does
not happen again. However, on the other hand, we must also mention that  the
people that make submissions to this Parliament should also make  sure  that
they follow the right procedures. Sometimes there is  consultation  and  the
other party does not keep its side of the bargain.  In  those  instances  we
should equally say that civil society and those  that  do  make  submissions
should also get their house in order. There were also some  shortcomings  in
this regard.

Let me deal with some of the substantive issues.  I  will  first  deal  with
some of the justice issues. The first issue, as  the  Minister  has  pointed
out, is that, as hon members know, we in this country have two  courts  that
stand at the apex of our courts system.  The  Constitutional  Court  is  the
highest court in our country  on  constitutional  matters,  and  on  matters
other than constitutional matters,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal  is  the
highest court.

Therefore, there has been an anomaly in our system, where we  have  had  two
heads at the top of the justice system. Since last year, at  and  after  the
justice colloquium, a lot of discussion has taken place around this  matter,
and there is broad consensus, if not  absolute  consensus,  in  our  society
that we should really  rationalise  this  situation  so  that  we  have  one
definite head of our court system. That is what has happened now.

The President of the Constitutional Court now becomes the Chief  Justice  of
South Africa. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Appeal  now  becomes
the President of the Supreme Court of Appeal.  And,  of  course,  the  Chief
Justice of South Africa will now also hold the position of  the  chairperson
of the Judicial Service Commission. We now have  a  very  definite  line  of
seniority in our court system. We do not any longer have this  split  system
as far as the leaders of the judiciary  are  concerned.  This  proposal  was
passed unanimously, including in respect of all the submissions received.

The second  issue  was  the  tenure  of  Constitutional  Court  judges.  The
proposal was to remove the issue  of  tenure  from  the  Constitution,  and,
therefore, that Constitutional Court judges be treated exactly the  same  as
other judges. And basically that would mean that they remain in  office  for
15 years active service, or at least until they are 70 years old.

The Constitutional Court judges supported this proposal and so did  some  of
the judges in the Supreme Court of Appeal. But  there  was  also  widespread
resistance to this proposal. We realised very early on that  we  would  have
to find a compromise to accommodate both sides  of  the  divide  within  the
legal fraternity.

It was very clear that the legal fraternity was, at  the  very  least,  very
badly split on this issue. The committee, very early  on,  decided  that  we
would need a compromise in terms of which we would try and meet some of  the
arguments from both sides of the spectrum within the  legal  profession,  as
well as a political compromise that all parties could support. It  was  very
important that the message from this Parliament was that we  put  forward  a
united view on the tenure of constitutional court judges.

I am very happy to announce that we were able, as  the  committee,  to  find
such a compromise. Basically, what we did is  the  following.  We  have  not
removed  the  term  of  office  of  Constitutional  Court  judges  from  the
Constitution, but have left it there. However, we have included  the  words,
``except where an  Act  of  Parliament  particularly  extends  the  term  of
office''. We have done that particularly because of the fears  that  an  Act
of Parliament would be able to reduce the tenure. We have made sure that  an
Act of Parliament would only be able to extend the tenure.

Therefore, firstly, we have made an appropriate constitutional amendment  in
this regard. Secondly we  have  taken  all  the  principles  that  apply  to
judges' salaries and their condition of employment and  have  extended  them
equally to Constitutional Court judges whilst retaining the term of  office.
We have done this through  clause  3(2)  in  the  new  Judges'  Remuneration
conditions of Employment Bill reiterating that the  term  of  office  is  12
years for a Constitutional Court judge or 70 years of age, whichever  occurs
first, where upon they are discharged. But we have provided  two  exceptions
that apply.

The first exception that we have created is that if a judge has  served  his
or her 12-year term of office and, at that stage, he  or  she  has  not  yet
completed a 15-year term of active service as a judge  on  the  Bench,  then
they would remain on until they have served for 15 years.

The second exception that we have provided, in order to make the  rules  the
same for Constitutional Court judges  and  other  judges,  is  that  when  a
Constitutional Court judge reaches 70 years of age, and he or  she  has  not
yet fulfilled 15 year of active service as a judge, then equally,  they  can
stay on until they are 75 years old or until they have completed a 15  years
stint as an active judge, and then they would have  to  be  discharged  from
active service.

So, what we have done is that we have now also  extended  to  Constitutional
Court judges the two principles applicable  to  judges,  namely,  that  they
have to complete 15 years of active service before they are discharged  from
service, or that they can stay on for  longer  after  they  reach  70  years
until they are 75 years of age.  Furthermore,  we  have  also  provided,  in
clause 4(4)  of  the  Bill,  that  a  Constitutional  Court  judge  who  had
previously been appointed as a judge may voluntarily decide to stay  on  and
go back to where he or she acted as a judge previously and fulfil a  further
period of active service there once they  leave  the  Constitutional  Court,
but of course, only if they are still eligible in terms of the rest  of  the
Act to serve as a judge.

We have equally provided that a Constitutional Court judge  who  was  not  a
judge previously can apply to the Judicial  Service  Commission  after  they
have been discharged as a Constitutional Court judge and be appointed  as  a
judge elsewhere; again, on condition that they are still eligible  to  be  a
judge. We have then provided certain provisions  to  make  sure  that  these
judges, who go  back  to  the  Bench  once  they  have  been  discharged  as
Constitutional Court judges, will not receive a double salary for doing  so.


We have further provided for one instance where the  Constitutional  Court's
judges can resign. That is the instance where they have served 12  years  or
have reached 70 years of age, whichever comes first. In that instance,  they
can resign as Constitutional Court judges if  permitted,  in  terms  of  the
Act. But there is a penalty involved. The penalty is that  in  future  their
so-called pension or their salary  upon  discharge  would  not  include  the
inflation-beater provision. It would not apply in that instance.  So,  there
is a penalty or a sanction involved for not staying on for the whole  period
that a Constitutional court judge has to serve.

There are also  other  aspects  of  the  Bill  that  we  have  changed,  and
harmonised. I am not going to go into detail in  respect  thereof.  I  would
just like to say that we have also rationalised, for the  first  time,  that
this Bill will apply to all judges. Whether they were  appointed  previously
as judges in the so-called  RSA  or  whether  they  were  appointed  in  the
previous Bantustans, all of that has now been harmonised into  one  Act.  In
order to do that, we also had to make certain transitional  arrangements  to
make sure that they fit smoothly into the new system.

There is also one other important factor dealt with in  this  Bill.  It  has
been found that an inflation-beater had not applied to those judges who  are
of a rather senior age, and who actually  had  gone  on  pension  under  the
Previous Pensions Act and not under the Judges'  Remuneration  Act.  We  now
find that many of those judges really live in dire  circumstances  in  terms
of the salaries that they receive. We have now made provision  in  this  Act
that their salaries be dealt with differently and that the  inflation-beater
will apply equally to them. We hope  that  this  will  solve  a  very  acute
problem, namely that some of our older judges have fallen  upon  hard  times
in this instance.

I would just like to say one thing  about  the  financial  matters  we  have
dealt with in the constitutional amendments:  There  was  also  an  enormous
ruckus and uproar about certain so-called interventionist clauses  that  had
been dealt with as a constitutional amendment. As the House  knows,  clauses
100 and 139 of the Constitution are what we  call  interventionist  clauses,
in so far as they allow one level of  government  to  intervene  in  another
level of government if that level of government is  not  fulfilling  certain
executive obligations. There were certain amendments that I am not going  to
go into detail about that were proposed in terms  of  these  interventionist
clauses, and this generated a lot of  resistance  from  certain  inputs  and
submissions in the committee.
Secondly, there is also a provision in the Constitution that provides for  a
third  interventionist  mechanism.  What  was  being  provided  for  was  an
enabling clause in  this  Constitutional  amendment  in  terms  of  which  a
mechanism was provided for  to  allow  Government  to  deal  with  financial
crises at local government level.

We looked at this matter carefully and there was a lot of resistance to  it.
In the end, we found that once we looked  at  the  legislation  Finance  was
wanting to introduce in this  regard,  clearly  the  intervention  that  was
being asked for was quite fundamental  in  terms  of  intervening  in  local
government. We very clearly saw that the enabling clause was  not  going  to
do the trick for the department, and that what one in fact needed  was  what
we call a trumping clause, which will allow this interventionist  clause  to
be able to trump other aspects of the Constitution  with  which  it  was  in
conflict.

For all these reasons - all three of these interventionist  matters,  namely
both the introduction of the one new mechanism  and  the  amendment  of  the
other two mechanisms - it was decided by the  two  relevant  departments  to
withdraw these matters with the intention  of  definitely  introducing  them
during the coming year,  as  this  would  enable  further  consultation  and
deliberations on  the  matter  and  specifically  enable  us  to  amend  the
enabling clause to a trumping clause. In the end, that was the best  way  to
deal with the matter.

Secondly, there  was  also  a  new  borrowing  clause  introduced  into  the
Constitution because, as the House knows, section 230  of  the  Constitution
already provides that municipalities may borrow money as  long  they  comply
with national legislation. However, a legal  opinion  was  obtained  by  the
Department of Finance clearly indicating that  the  problem  was  that  they
interpreted  section  230  to  mean  that  the  legislative  powers   of   a
municipality could be bound when making these loans. If that  is  the  case,
the binding of the legislative powers is usually given  as  collateral  when
one signs these loans, because, in all probability, loans were not going  to
be easily given, particularly to smaller municipalities.

We then had to amend the Constitution accordingly to provide  not  only  the
power to make loans, but also the power for the municipal council, in  fact,
to executively and legislatively bind future councils and the  municipality.
We had to do that by rationalising these  two  issues  into  a  new  clause,
which is now clause 230A.

Regarding the other financial provisions, as  the  House  knows  there  were
certain  amendments  that  were  suggested  to  the  Financial  and   Fiscal
Commission, in particular, that its size should be reduced. This was  agreed
to, but it was felt that where provinces previously had some  say  in  these
matters was this was now completely taken away. So  we  have  provided  that
national legislation can be passed to make sure that  provincial  and  local
government have a role to play during  the  nomination  process  before  the
executive make these appointments. I hope that gives hon members  some  idea
of what we have tried to do here. As we have said, these two  constitutional
amendments are closely linked.

I just want to point out in the end that  the  Judicial  Officers  Amendment
Bill, as the Minister has pointed out,  was  introduced  in  Parliament  and
deals with judicial officer who have a lot of  important  matters  affecting
judicial officers. This Bill was introduced very late  and  therefore  there
are various matters, for example how we  deal  with  judicial  officers  who
have same sex partners, how we deal with the qualifications  of  magistrates
how  we  deal  with  a  particular  mechanism  to  decide  the  salaries  of
magistrates and judges, that we are  referring  to  the  next  parliamentary
session, and we will deal with those matters that we  have  not  dealt  with
them.

I thank the House very much for listening to me, and  I  thank  hon  members
for their support for these Bills. [Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Chairperson, the hon Johnny de Lange referred  to  what  was
happening on the political front. He also stated that he  was  in  a  jovial
mood. I want to share a secret with hon members. It is  because  earlier  in
the week I could assure him that he had no  chance  of  losing  his  beloved
opposition in his committee. [Interjections.]

I am going to confine my contribution today to two  issues  only:  First  of
all the composition of the Financial and Fiscal  Commission,  which  we  are
changing, and secondly, the amendments affecting the Constitutional Court.

Die aantal lede van die FinansiÃ«le en Fiskale Kommissie word  verminder  van
twee-en-twintig  tot  nege.  In  beginsel  is  ons  ten   gunste   van   die
vermindering  van  die  getalle  van  lomp  en  groot  komitees,   rade   en
kommissies. Dit is onnodig dat ons so 'n groot kommissie het.

Ons het egter 'n bekommernis. In die  huidige  samestelling  word  spesifiek
voorsiening gemaak vir nege persone wat per provinsie  na  die  belange  van
die provinsie omsien. Dit verval. Dit word verminder na drie lede  wat  deur
die President vanuit 'n poel aangestel sal word. Verder word ook die  totale
getal lede wat die President sal aanstel van nege na twee verminder.

Ons wil 'n beroep doen op die agb President - en ons is oortuig daarvan  dat
hy hieraan gehoor sal gee - om 'n goed gebalanseerde kommissie aan te  stel,
wat behoorlik na die belange wat aan daardie  kommissie  opgedra  word,  sal
omsien. Ons het vertroue dat hy dit sal doen.

Ek wil nou aandag  gee  aan  die  wysigings  wat  aangebring  word  aan  die
Konstitusionele Hof, in besonder die wysigings ten opsigte van die  regters.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The number of members of the  Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission  is  being
reduced from twenty-two to  nine.  In  principle  we  are  in  favour  of  a
reduction in the number of  members  of  cumbersome  and  large  committees,
councils  and  commissions.  It  is  unnecessary  to  have  such   a   large
commission.

We have a concern, however. In the present  composition  specific  provision
is made for nine persons per province to take care of the interests  of  the
province. This falls away. This is being reduced to three members  who  will
be appointed by the President from a pool. Furthermore the total  number  of
members to be appointed by the President is being reduced from nine to two.

We want to appeal to the hon the President - and we are  convinced  that  he
will listen to this - to appoint a well-balanced commission that  will  take
proper care of the interests that the commission will be entrusted with.  We
have every confidence that he will do so.

I would now like to devote attention to the amendments that are  being  made
to the Constitutional Court, in particular the amendments in respect of  the
judges.]

The original proposal that  the  term  of  office  of  Constitutional  Court
judges be equated to that of other judges was controversial. It even  caused
members of the judiciary to  take  up  different  positions.  The  different
terms of office that have existed up to now have  been  highlighted  by  the
hon Mr De Lange. The portfolio committee has  reached  consensus  to  retain
the  12-year  nonrenewable  term  and  the  70-year  age  limit,  but   also
introduced the opportunity for Constitutional Court judges to stay on  until
the age of 75 in order to complete a 15-year term on the  Bench,  which  may
of course include previous service in the High  Court.  All  differences  in
relation to gratuities and other benefits could thereby be eliminated.

Daar is argumente ten  gunste  van  kort  termyne  vir  Konstitusionele  Hof
regters. Laat ons kortliks daarna kyk. In die  eerste  instansie  word  gesÃª
dat ons in beginsel nie moet torring aan 'n  grondwet  nie.  Natuurlik  nie,
maar waarna ons moet oplet, is om nie aan beginsels te verander nie. Wat  is
die beginsel wat by die Konstitusionele  Hof  ter  sprake  is?  Dit  is  die
beskerming, die absolute beskerming van sy rol en  van  sy  onafhanklikheid.
DÃ­t is die beginsel wat ons moet beskerm. Of 'n  regter  dan  nou  vir  sewe
jaar, soos dit aanvanklik was, of vir 12 jaar, tot hy 70 is, of  tot  hy  75
is, aangestel word, kan nie hierdie beginsel aantas  nie.  Hierdie  beginsel
kan aangetas word deur  die  integriteit  van  die  regters,  nie  deur  hul
ouderdom  of  hoe  lank  hul  dien  nie.  Tweedens   word   gesÃª   dat   die
Konstitusionele Hof se uitsprake politieke impak het, en niemand behoort  so
baie mag vir lank te hÃª nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[There  are  arguments  in  favour  of  short  terms  for  judges   of   the
Constitutional Court. Let us look at this briefly. In the first place it  is
being said that in principle we should not tamper with  a  constitution.  Of
course not,  but  what  we  have  to  be  attentive  to  is  not  to  change
principles. What is the principle at issue in respect of the  Constitutional
Court? It is the protection, the absolute protection of its role and of  its
independence. This is the principle that we must protect.  Whether  a  judge
is appointed for seven years, as was  initially  the  case,  or  for  twelve
years, until he is 70, or until he is  75,  cannot  affect  this  principle.
This principle can be affected by the integrity of the judges, not by  their
age or the length of their service. Secondly, it  is  being  said  that  the
findings of the Constitutional Court have  political  impact,  and  not  one
should have so much power for too long.]
But the simple fact is that the Constitutional Court delivers  judgments  in
bulk. All the judges sit and eight of the  12  judges  are  required  for  a
quorum. This provision immediately minimises the possibility of  politically
loaded judgments. One judge, even a number of judges,  cannot  easily  steer
judgments in a particular political direction. It was also said that a  long
term may lead to stagnation.

Al wat ek kan vra, is: watter verskil is daar met ons gewone hof van  appÃ¨l?
DÃ¡Ã¡r word ook met regsbeginsels gewerk en tog het  daar  oor  baie  jare  'n
stadige groei plaasgevind met konsepte,  fundamentele  benaderings,  allengs
en stadig, maar daar is tog verskuiwe. Dan word daar  gesÃª  dat  die  gevaar
van 'n verpolitiseerde Konstitusionele Hof tog vermy  moet  word.  Dus  word
geargumenteer  dat  termyne  korter  moet  wees.  Ek  wil  radikaal  daarvan
verskil. Dit moenie 'n politiek-gelade hof  wees  nie,  en  hoe  korter  die
termyn, hoe makliker vir die regering van die  dag  om  kans  te  hÃª  om  sy
regbank te laai. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[All I can ask is: what  difference  is  there  to  our  ordinary  court  of
appeal? These legal principles are also dealt with and yet over  many  years
a gradual growth occurred, with concepts,  fundamental,  approaches,  slowly
but surely, but there were changes. Then it is said that  the  danger  of  a
politicised Constitutional Court must be avoided.  It  is  therefore  argued
that terms must be shorter. I want to disagree totally with  this.  It  must
not be a politically loaded court, and the shorter the term  the  easier  it
would be for the government of the day to have an opportunity  to  load  its
Bench.]

But let me state the reason we really support this  amendment.  The  concept
of a constitutional state,  that  is,  a  state  where  the  sovereignty  of
Parliament is curtailed by the principle that the court  may  adjudicate  on
the constitutionality of an Act  of  Parliament,  was  accepted  during  the
Kempton Park negotiations. At issue was  whether  this  authority  would  be
vested  in  the  then  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal  or  in  a  new   separate
constitutional court.

The decision was in favour of a  separate  constitutional  court.  The  main
reason was that  the  then  existing  Supreme  Court  did  not  reflect  the
diversity of our new order. In terms of the 1994 Constitution, the  term  of
office of judges is seven years.  But,  members  should  remember  that  the
Constitutional Court was not entrenched in the constitutional principles  as
a separate court. However, our final Constitution did make provision  for  a
Constitutional Court and extended the term to what it is now.

Since its inception and to the present day,  the  Constitutional  Court  has
firmly established itself locally and internationally. A set  of  principles
rapidly developed, and the jurisprudence, based  on  constitutionality,  has
and is taking shape. In terms of our present Constitution,  all  courts  can
pronounce on the validity  of  Acts  of  Parliament,  subject,  however,  to
confirmation by the Constitutional Court. This in itself  is  indicative  of
how  the  concept   of   constitutionality   has   already   permeated   our
jurisprudence. In fact, it is safe to say that the Bill  of  Rights,  as  an
inherent part of  our  Constitution,  has  become  a  guiding  star  in  the
interpretation and application of our  Acts  of  Parliament.  Secondly,  the
question  of  constitutionality  features  prominently  in   the   portfolio
committee and in Parliament.

All of this occurred in a remarkably short space of time and speaks  volumes
for the integrity of our Constitutional Court. It may well be that we  shall
reach a stage in future when this theoretical basis for the  development  of
our law becomes so ingrained that the court of  appeal  could  appropriately
deal with questions of constitutionality. However, for  the  moment  we  may
rest assured that the Constitutional Court is  successfully  transforming  a
legal system that was once based on parliamentary sovereignty  to  a  system
based on constitutional sovereignty.

In conclusion, may I thank  the  chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee,
committee members and staff for the way in which we operated this year.  The
committee sat for no fewer than 390,5 hours this year. We  worked  to  reach
consensus in almost all cases and we were able, in almost all instances,  to
reach such consensus. Our chairperson, the hon  Johnny  de  Lange,  deserves
praise for his approach in this regard.

Mr G SOLOMON: Chairperson, unlike Dr Delport, I am going to deal  with  only
one issue.

As 'n mens deurmekaar raak met twee dinge, dan werk dinge  somtyds  nie  uit
nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [If  one  deals  with  two  issues  at  once,  things
sometimes do not work out. [Interjections.]]

Those of us who listened to Question 356, asked by Dr Mulder, and  who  also
listened to the eloquent reply by the Deputy Minister, would have some  idea
as to the amendment which I am going to talk about.

This amending Bill also deals with  an  amendment  to  section  230  of  the
Constitution.  This   section   deals   with   the   borrowing   powers   of
municipalities. The amendment contained in clause  17  of  the  Bill  allows
municipalities to raise loans  for  capital  and  current  expenditure,  and
empowers them to bind themselves and future municipalities, in the  exercise
of their executive and legislative authority, to  the  loan  or  investment.
Loans for  current  expenditure  may  be  raised  only  when  necessary  for
bridging purposes during a fiscal year.

What is the rationale behind  this  amendment?  Local  government  in  South
Africa has gone through some profound changes  since  the  new  dispensation
and particularly after the 2000  local  government  elections.  Besides  the
implications of the shifting of boundaries and  the  amalgamations  to  form
284 new municipalities, the role of municipalities has become  more  crucial
in creating a better life for all in South Africa. In fact, I  believe  that
the growing tip of the democratic process is at the local government  level.
It is at this level where the democratic process succeeds or fails.

Many national and provincial departments are also considering which  of  the
functions  are  best  performed  at  local  level.  These  include   housing
delivery, primary health care and the  district  health  system,  water  and
municipal policing. It is therefore envisaged that  municipalities  will  be
playing an increasingly important role in service delivery in order to  face
the  challenges  of  eradicating  poverty  and  improving  the  social   and
economical conditions of ordinary  working-class  people  in  South  Africa,
both rural and urban.

The Medium-Term Budget Policy  Statement  of  the  Minister  of  Finance  is
particularly  encouraging  and  reassuring  in  this  regard.  The  Minister
conceded  that  local  government   faces   significant   challenges   after
amalgamating various local  authorities  into  the  new  councils  with  new
boundaries. The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement agrees  that  the  major
fiscal challenge, particularly to small rural municipalities, is to  support
their new role through effective revenue  mechanisms,  as  set  out  in  the
policy document of the national Treasury:


  A large shift in resources to local government  strengthens  Government's
  commitment to expand the delivery of basic municipal  infrastructure  and
  to fund free basic services.

This,  however,  is  not  coming  without  the  normal  very  important  and
responsible  conditions  from  the  Minister,  as  set  out  in  the  policy
document:


  To  this  end,  national  Government  is  expanding  its  monitoring   of
  developmental outcomes at local level through  the  introduction  of  new
  budget formats and improved reporting requirements that will ensure  that
  municipalities report regularly on income and expenditure, as well as  on
  the outputs of their programmes.

I have also spoken to ANC  councillors.  They  welcome  the  amendment,  but
insist  on  close   co-operation   between   the   national   Treasury   and
municipalities in terms of monitoring particularly the operating budgets  of
municipalities. The operating budgets of municipalities  were  exceptionally
high in the past. In the case of the Cape Town City Council it was 58%  when
the ANC took over the council and we brought it down to 38%.

What the department is saying to municipalities is that it will assist  them
to improve financial management locally, but they must  spend  within  their
budgets and collect revenues due, with due regard to  the  circumstances  of
the  poorest  of  the  poor.  In  practice,  we  find   that   major   urban
municipalities have good and  distinct  revenue-generating  powers  and  are
only marginally dependent on transfers from national Government. Many  rural
and smaller urban municipalities, however, have much weaker fiscal  capacity
and depend considerably on transfers from national  Government.  They  might
find themselves, therefore, with cash-flow  problems,  particularly  towards
the end of the fiscal year.

When they  looked  at  section  230  of  the  Constitution,  the  committee,
together with the Department of Finance and other role-players, agreed  that
in order to establish a comprehensive  fiscal  policy  framework  for  local
government  the  contradictions  between  the   constitutional   and   legal
parameters, principles of public finance and the goals of  local  government
policy must be resolved. In other words, the borrowing  framework  must  not
only restore capital market access to municipalities, but must also  provide
certainty regarding the rights of the borrower and the lender.

This amendment, together with the  ongoing  budget  and  finance  management
reforms, will place local government in a better position to  face  the  new
challenges of delivery of more and better  quality  services  to  all  South
Africans on a sustained basis.  This  will  enable  municipalities  to  play
their proper role  envisaged  in  the  new  local  government  dispensation,
namely to tackle the  challenge  of  poverty  and  improve  the  social  and
economic conditions of,  particularly,  all  working-class  South  Africans,
both urban and rural.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, when one is faced  with
an uphill task, one should always seek advice.

The three Bills that we are debating today,  affect  the  Constitution.  The
amendment of the Constitution is something that does not occur  every  year.
This is right. One does not easily tinker with the Constitution. One  is  in
fact duty-bound to  protect,  safeguard  and  stand  behind  it.  The  first
Constitution-amending Bill comes  five  years  after  the  Constitution  was
approved. After a great deal of soul-searching  and  after  many  months  of
deep thinking, certain changes are being effected.

The IFP wishes that this occasion could have been take to seize the bull  by
the horns to accommodate traditional  leaders.  Unfortunately,  we  are  not
doing  that.  We  are  changing  the  title  of   the   President   of   the
Constitutional Court, providing for the office of the Deputy Chief  Justice,
etc.  Today,  we  are   also   dealing   with   financial   emergencies   in
municipalities and matters connected therewith. All  of  these  matters  are
weighty and need attention.

Siyamcela uNgqongqoshe ukuthi ake  acabangisise  ngale  mithetho  eshiyekile
laphayana kumThethosisekelo. Lokhu kwenza umthwalo wethu ube  lukhuni  futhi
kube lukhuni ukuthi siye phambili. [We appeal to the  hon  the  Minister  to
think deeply about the laws that were omitted from  the  Constitution.  This
makes things difficult for us, even to go forward.]

At the same time, we  could  have  looked  at  Chapters  7  and  12  of  the
Constitution with a view to resolving a long-standing matter  regarding  the
role of traditional leaders in relation to the municipalities. It  has  been
suggested to our IFP justice study group that legislation  would  be  enough
to deal with a matter that concerns many in our constituencies. If  that  is
so, where is the draft copy of such legislation? Even a  rough  draft  would
show us that the deadlock was being resolved.

The first Constitution-amending Bill deals with the concerns of  judges  and
the Government in respect of financial  emergencies  in  municipalities.  It
does not deal with the concerns of our  main  constituencies.  There  is  no
other development to show that the problem is about to be  resolved  to  the
satisfaction of all. For that reason, and that  reason  alone,  we  withhold
our support for the Bill. It is our expectation that in the interests of co-
operative governance, we will reach out to one  another  and  resolve  these
outstanding matters.
For  similar  reasons,  we  also  withhold  our  support  for   the   second
Constitution-amending Bill. This Bill deals extensively with fiscal  matters
at provincial and municipality level. Once again, an  opportunity  is  being
missed here. Some of the  poorest  and  most  disadvantaged  people  in  our
country  reside  in  traditional  areas.  They  need  to  benefit  from  the
municipal expenditure without sacrificing the communal and cultural  systems
to which they belong.

Provision could have been made in this Bill to  accommodate  them  and  that
did not happen. The IFP would like to see equal development on every  square
inch of our national territory. The new  dispensation  must  not  leave  the
soil where our people's cultural  and  ancestral  roots  grow  deep  without
nourishment. It must not  do  that.  In  withholding  our  support,  we  are
expressing the very deep-felt anxiety among the  leadership  of  traditional
societies and saying that we should  not  strip  them  of  their  powers  or
withhold  development  funds  from  them.  They  are  crying   out   to   be
accommodated, and accommodated they should be.

Finally, I come  to  Bill  72  of  2001  which  has  now  been  renamed  and
renumbered as Bill 83 of 2001, the Judges' Remuneration  and  Conditions  of
Employment Bill. This is a Bill which goes to the  heart  of  the  principle
for which we are arguing. Let us find an accommodation that is in  the  best
interests of our country  and  those  who  lead  and  protect  it.  Our  new
democracy is inclusive  and  it  should  accommodate  all  segments  of  our
society. One segment has not been accommodated. In support  of  the  request
for accommodation, we withhold our support for all three Bills.

Siyamcela-ke  umhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe.  Okuhle  ukuthi   uma   umhlonishwa
uNgqongqoshe engase akuthathe lokhu akubukisise kahle, uzothola ukuthi  nale
mikhukhu  egcwele  lapha  emadolobheni  kungenxa  yokuthi  abantu   bayasuka

esiwabiza  ngokuthi,  ``they  are  the  pioneers'',   ababengama-politicians
akuqala. Sinaleli lizwe esinalo nje yingoba kwakukhona lawo makhosi.  Amanye
amakhosi alifela leli lizwe, amanye amakhosi  ayijele.  Ngisho  inkosi  yami

Ake sibheke indaba yamakhosi, mayingabi  inhlekisa.  Angikhulumi  ngamakhosi

13:1-5,  bazokuzwa-ke  ukuthi  amakhosi  lawa  okukhulunywa   ngawo   ayini.
Amakhosi ayekhona kudalo. Asikho isizwe  esingenabo  ubukhosi.  ONgqongqoshe
make  balubukeze  lolu  daba,  balufakele   izibuko.   Sengigadle   zephuka,
angehlele ngezansi. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[We therefore put our request the hon the Minister. What is good about  this
is that if he considers this seriously he  will  notice  that  these  shacks
surrounding our cities are  caused  by  people  moving  from  the  areas  of
amakhosi to the cities, where there are municipalities that will treat  them
better. We should not abandon the amakhosi, whom we call  the  pioneers,  or
first politicians. We have this country today  because  of  amakhosi.   Some
amakhosi died for this country and others went to jail. Even my  Zulu  King,
if members could visit the prison outside  Parliament,  will  find  that  my
king was once arrested and put there.

Let us look at the issue of amakhosi. It should not be  a  joke.  I  am  not
talking about the amakhosi of the Zulu people only. Others may think that  I
am referring to them only. Amakhosi are  all  over  the  country.  If  these
people do not believe in amakhosi, they must read Romans 13: 1-5,  and  they
will know who the amakhosi are that we  are  talking  about.  Amakhosi  were
even there in the past. Every nation has its own kingdom. Ministers have  to
reconsider this issue. They have to look at it carefully, and I  would  like
to stop here.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, I would like  to  agree  with  other  speakers
that in recent days the studious, collegial and co-operative  atmosphere  in
the Portfolio Committee on Justice has really  provided  a  pleasant  refuge
from the political turmoil outside.

The final form of the two Constitution-amending Bills currently before  this
House illustrates the important role that should  be  played  by  opposition
parties,  whether  in  co-operative  or  adversary  mode,  in  holding   the
Government to account and persuading the governing  party  to  abandon  ill-
considered and unwise action which would have  set  an  appalling  precedent
for constitutional change.
When  in  July  Minister  Maduna  originally  published  these  Bills  which
suggested  radical  changes,  particularly  to  the   relationship   between
national, provincial and local government,  and  which  had  the  effect  of
weakening provincial powers, there  was  an  outcry.  The  New  NP  and  the
Western Cape government led the way but we were soon joined  by  none  other
than Cosatu, organised local government  including  Salga,  a  multitude  of
NGOs, academics, masses of judges and  a  host  of  provincial  governments,
several of whom are run by the ANC.

An ANC Minister knows that he is in trouble when his  legislative  proposals
attract comments such  as  this  one  from  the  ANC-controlled  North  West
provincial government, and I quote:


  We reject the proposed constitutional amendments, not only due  to  their
  dubious content, which would affect the very core of the existence of the
  co-operative system of governance, but also because  there  had  been  no
  consultation with provincial governments in relation to these amendments.

To be fair to Minister Maduna, in subsequent correspondence, made  available
to the portfolio committee, between Minister Manuel and  Minister  Mufamadi,
these two Ministers did shoulder responsibility for  most  of  the  proposed
changes.

Very wisely, the chairman of our committee, the hon Johnny  de  Lange,  then
set to work to build consensus around the  proposed  amendments  which  were
broadly  acceptable,  while  the  rest  were  rejected.  He   deserves   our
congratulations. We in the New NP fully support  his  approach  that,  where
constitutional amendments are passed, these should preferably be  passed  on
the basis of the widest possible consensus. We can now support these  Bills.
We would also like to thank the officials for their  hard  work  in  getting
these Bills into shape.

There were three main problems with the  first  Constitution-amending  Bill.
Firstly, it introduced  inappropriate  provisions  to  deal  with  financial
emergencies in municipalities. These were  the  brainchild,  apparently,  of
Treasury officials, and they were told, in no uncertain terms,  to  go  away
and think again. Secondly, there was a provision allowing the  President  to
appoint two Deputy Ministers from outside Parliament, without  spelling  out
the  rights  and  obligations  of   these   Deputy   Ministers   and   their
accountability, and this is now being rectified.

Thirdly, and  most  problematically,  the  proposed  legislation  introduced
changes to the constitutionally entrenched tenure  of  Constitutional  Court
judges, putting their tenure on a par with other High Court judges  who  are
governed by ordinary legislation. This proposal has  wisely  been  rejected.
The Bench was divided  on  the  issue,  with  the  majority  condemning  the
proposal.

We in the New NP believe it is most important that the tenure of  judges  of
our High Court be guaranteed in the Constitution, with the added  protection
from  political  interference  this  gives.   Although   all   courts   have
constitutional jurisdiction, the Constitutional  Court  is  in  a  different
league, in that  it  is  able  to  pronounce  on  the  constitutionality  of
legislation and, if necessary, to overturn it.

The  problems  which  Constitutional  Court  judges  experience  with  their
conditions of service, which were behind the original  proposal,  have  been
addressed, firstly, through a  compromise  amendment  to  the  Constitution,
allowing  a  modest  extension  of  the  tenure,  in  line  with  conditions
available to other judges in terms of an Act of  Parliament.  This  has  now
been finalised and, as the hon De Lange told us in great detail, as  he  had
20 minutes to speak about it, does not  detract  from  the  constitutionally
entrenched tenure.

Detailed provisions relating to the conditions of service  and  remuneration
of all judges and Constitutional Court judges have now been included in  the
new Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Bill, which  puts  the
judges on a par in terms of their conditions of service.  This  solution  to
what was naughtily called the ``Chaskalson  amendment'',  because  of  Judge
Chaskalson's  impending  retirement  at  the  age  of  70,  we  believe   is
satisfactory.

The other mainly technical provisions in this  Bill  relate  to  a  decision
universally supported in the legal fraternity  and  judicial  circles,  that
the President of the Constitutional Court should be the  Chief  Justice.  We
support that as well, and trust that the  incumbent  Judge  Chaskalson  will
now be in a position to fill the post of  Chief  Justice  because  of  these
amendments. We would support his  appointment,  if  it  is  made,  as  Chief
Justice. He is without doubt our pre-eminent judge and will bring honour  to
the post.

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment  Bill  has
now been pruned of all its most controversial provisions aimed  at  allowing
direct intervention  by  national  Government  and  local  government,  thus
bypassing provincial powers, basically because of the collective outrage  of
organised local  government  at  the  proposals.  Let  us  hope  that  local
government will continue to be listened to.

The only controversial provision left is that of  changing  the  composition
of the Financial and Fiscal Commission by eliminating the representation  of
each province and reducing the commission from 22 to nine  members  for  so-
called  ``practical  considerations''.  Although  the  chairperson  of   the
commission, Murphy Morobe, acknowledged in his submission to  the  portfolio
committee that the reduction in the number  of  commissioners  would  indeed
result in undermining the constitutional  principle  of  representivity,  he
nevertheless   argued   for   the   reduction   because    of    ``practical
considerations''.
The portfolio committee  agreed  to  the  New  NP's  proposal  of  at  least
increasing the number of provincial representations from  two  to  three  to
give a greater chance for opposition representation and also to involve  the
premiers of provinces in both the compilation of the list of candidates  and
the final choice of provincial representatives. However, we  cannot  support
a provision which does not allow each province  to  be  represented  on  the
commission.

We support the Bill as a whole, but we  must  note  our  objection  to  this
clause. [Applause.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson, hon members, the UDM understands  the  principle
that the Constitution is the supreme law of the country, and should  not  be
lightly tampered with by amending it at the  whim  of  any  political  party
which wishes to advance  a  particular  agenda  such  as  consolidating  its
political position. Such a practice would erode the democratic character  of
the Constitution and negatively impact on the transformation process.

The amendment of the Constitution of South Africa  regarding  the  President
and Deputy President of the Constitutional Court  vis-Ã -vis  the  Chief  and
Deputy Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Appeal is  long  overdue.  This
amendment will clear up the confusion about the junior and senior judge  and
the two courts. This amendment provides for the  appointment  of  the  Chief
Justice and Deputy Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court.

The  tenure  of  Constitutional  Court  judges  is  amended  by   empowering
Parliament to pass the Act which  expressly  extends  the  term  of  office.
Clause 7 of the Bill makes provision for a Deputy  Minister  appointed  from
outside the Assembly to be accountable to Parliament.

Section 230 is amended  by  adding  section  230A,  which  provides  that  a
council or municipality may,  within  a  framework  prescribed  by  national
legislation, bind  itself  and  future  councils  in  the  exercise  of  its
executive and legislative authority to the  extent  necessary  in  order  to
secure loans or investments  for  the  municipality.  This  is  a  necessary
amendment, as it makes it possible for a council or municipality  to  render
services which they could not render without a loan.

The (Judges) Remuneration and Conditions of  Employment  Bill  provides  for
the  remuneration  and  conditions  of   employment   of   judges   of   the
Constitutional Courts, the Supreme Court of Appeal and the  High  Court,  to
the extent that their terms of office, salaries, allowances  and  gratuities
after they retire from active service are covered in this Bill.

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second  Amendment  Bill  is
important  as  it  makes  provision  for  national  supervision   of   local
administrations if a municipality fails to  comply  with  an  obligation  in
terms of legislation or the Constitution, and to extend the  principle  that
provinces' equitable shares of the  revenue  raised  nationally  are  direct
charges against the national revenue fund to  local  governments'  equitable
shares.

The UDM supports the Bills. [Applause.]

Ms L MABE: Chairperson, I am not surprised that the hon Sheila  Camerer  was
very happy on the day when some of the premiers differed  on  constitutional
amendments. It was the first time I saw her in such a happy mood.  But  what
is interesting is that those premiers are still ANC members, and  they  will
still support the ANC Government.
The hon Delport has indicated that the courts should not be  politicised.  I
really do not understand why people should continue to say that  the  courts
should not politicised, because we have a powerful Bill  of  Rights  and  it
will protect whoever thinks that the Constitutional Court's  judges  may  be
politicised.

I heard the hon Mzizi saying that the traditional leaders have  problems  in
terms of the amendments to the Constitution, and  that  they  had  not  been
catered for. I believe that the member knows  very  well  that  there  is  a
process which the Government is engaged in to ensure that those  traditional
leaders will be catered  for,  because  the  Constitution  of  this  country
ensures that traditional leaders have their  rights  in  the  governance  of
this country.

I thought that the hon Mr  Mzizi  would  remember  that  yesterday,  in  the
debate, the President indicated that Government is committed to the  African
Renaissance. And I do not understand how, if the Government is committed  to
the African Renaissance, it is  possible  that  the  same  Government  could
ignore the role which has to be played by traditional leaders.
With regard to the Constitution of the Republic of  South  Africa  Amendment
Bill, I will refer to the amendments  which  deal  with  the  judiciary  and
Deputy Ministers. With regard to the judiciary,  a  justice  colloquium  was
held in October 2000, where the participants from all branches of the  legal
fraternity reached consensus that there should  be  one  court  system  with
different levels of courts.

There was also an agreement that the President of the  Constitutional  Court
should be the Chief Justice. The amendments are a  step  towards  forming  a
single court system, as  the  legacy  of  the  previous  dispensation  still
exists in the judicial system. Therefore, it is important to  transform  our
justice system to comply with constitutional requirements, and  this  cannot
be achieved overnight.

With regard to the first Constitution-amending Bill, which we are  debating,
clause 15 brings about minor changes, as has already been indicated  by  the
previous speaker, as well as the chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee.
The whole section still remains intact  and  there  should  be  no  fear  or
unease in the minds of people that there have been drastic changes  to  that
section.
Section 176 of the Constitution states that a Constitutional Court judge  is
appointed for a nonrenewable term of 12 years, and must retire  at  the  age
of 70. Therefore, there is no security of tenure  for  these  Constitutional
Court judges. One must note the great  disparity  between  the  benefits  of
judges of the Constitutional Court and those of other courts in  that  other
judges do not have a nonrenewable term of 12 years, but  their  security  of
tenure is entrenched in the Constitution.

The Constitution is the  supreme  law  of  the  country.  Consequently,  the
Constitutional Court is the highest court in  the  country  and  its  judges
must therefore have security of tenure, just like other judges, in order  to
attract capacity and potential to this court. The Constitution must  provide
security of tenure to these judges because they must hold office until  they
are discharged from active service and they do not retire. We must  remember
that judges other than Constitutional Court judges hold  office  until  they
are discharged. They do not retire from the justice  system  or  from  their
duties.

The amendment to section 176 states that Constitutional  Court  judges  will
hold office for a nonrenewable term of office of  12  years  or  until  they
attain the age of 70 years, whichever  occurs  first,  except,  as  the  hon
chairperson of the portfolio  committee  has  indicated,  where  an  Act  of
Parliament extends the term of  office  of  a  Constitutional  Court  judge.
Thus, if a 12-year term of office expires and the judge has not reached  the
age of 70, he or she may continue service in another  court  for  up  to  15
years.

However, one must also remember that there is a saying which goes  ``once  a
judge always a judge''. It would  be  frustrating  to  young  Constitutional
Court judges who have completed a  12-year  term  of  office  to  receive  a
monthly salary from the Government  whilst  performing  no  service  to  the
state, whereas these judges could continue serving for a few extra years  so
that they may be useful to the  country.  It  would  be  a  waste  of  human
resources for a judge to retire at the age of  52  years,  as  a  result  of
being a judge in the Constitutional Court.  This  would  be  an  unfortunate
situation.

The Bill also seeks to ensure  that  Constitutional  Court  judges  maintain
their judicial independence in a climate of  security  of  tenure.  However,
the big question is: What will the future financial implications be if  many
Constitutional Court judges retire at the end of a 12-year term  of  office,
even before they reach the age of 60? Because this would mean that we  would
have many judges who would be earning a salary at the end of the month,  but
who would be doing nothing for the  state.  That  would  be  an  unfortunate
situation.

The Bill also addresses the current problem where the Chief Justice  is  not
a Constitutional Court judge  and  cannot  exercise  any  jurisdiction  over
judges of that court. It also clears up the  problem  in  the  legal  system
with regard to the question as to which office constitutes the head  of  the
judiciary in the country. The Bill states that the  Chief  Justice  will  be
the head of the judiciary and the Constitutional Court.  The  present  Chief
Justice will become the President of the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal.  These
amendments are therefore a step towards the rationalisation  of  the  courts
and the judicial system, which is a long route and one this department  must
undertake.

With regard to Deputy Ministers,  section  91  (3)(c)  of  the  Constitution
states that the President  may  select  no  more  than  two  Ministers  from
outside the Assembly. Clause 7 of the Bill brings section  93,  which  deals
with Deputy Ministers, in line with section 91(3)(c). The  amendment  states
that the President may appoint any number of  Deputy  Ministers  from  among
the members of the National Assembly and, at the same  time,  no  more  than
two Deputy Ministers from outside the Assembly, to  assist  members  of  the
Cabinet.

The amendments therefore bring more skills into Parliament.  A  new  clause,
section 93(2), states:


  Deputy Ministers appointed in terms of subsection (1)(b) are  accountable
  to Parliament for the exercise of their powers  and  the  performance  of
  their functions.

Section 92(2) states:


  Members of the Cabinet are accountable collectively and  individually  to
  Parliament for the exercise of their powers and the performance of  their
  functions.

Thus, Ministers appointed from  outside  the  Assembly  are  accountable  to
Parliament. The same must apply to Deputy Ministers appointed  from  outside
the Assembly.

Currently, section 54 gives Cabinet members  who  are  not  members  of  the
National Assembly the right to attend and speak in the Assembly, but not  to
vote. The amendment of this section extends this right to  Deputy  Ministers
appointed in a similar manner, and the amendment to section 58 is  technical
as it gives Deputy Ministers the privileges accorded to Cabinet members  and
members of the  National  Assembly  in  the  Constitution.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES: Order! May I solicit  the  assistance  of
the Whips in ensuring that we have better order?

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, hon Minister, I would particularly like to  thank
the Hon Gwen Mahlangu for coming to listen to my speech, and  I  trust  that
she has some good news about the asbestos case.

The constitutional amendment which  undoubtedly  elicited  the  most  public
debate related to the  life  tenure  of  the  Constitutional  Court  judges.
Whilst a compromise has been reached, the comments by  the  Judge  President
of the Transvaal Provincial division, Judge Ngoepe are worth repeating:


  It has always been accepted that the Constitutional Court wields  immense
  political power. Very importantly, as the apex Court, it  has  the  final
  say on issues  placed  before  it.  As  it  has  the  last  word  on  the
  interpretation and application of the  Constitution,  its  pronouncements
  influence the nation's political course. Also,  as  its  definitions  and
  understanding of the values enshrined in the  Constitution  constitute  a
  bench mark, its pronouncements materially influence  the  nation's  moral
  course.

An illustration of the exercise of this moral and  political  power  can  be
found in a 1999 judgment  which  declared  section  25  (5)  of  the  Aliens
Control Act to be unconstitutional. The subsection omitted to  give  persons
who are partners in same-sex life partnerships the benefits  it  extends  to
married spouses under this section. For the very first time,  and  in  order
to remedy what it found to be a  constitutional  defect  in  this  Act,  the
Constitutional Court decided to add words to legislation.  The  words  added
were ``partner in a permanent  same-sex  life  partnership''.  This  clearly
illustrates the political and moral  power  that  the  Constitutional  Court
wields and begs the question as to why the Court, in that instance, did  not
merely allow Parliament to remedy this  legislation,  as  it  normally  does
when legislation is found to be unconstitutional.

Whilst the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court  of  Appeal  have  the
final say in their own spheres, they differ fundamentally in  the  way  they
operate. Constitutional Court judges sit en banque, and should these  judges
have been granted life tenure, the possibility of a different set of  judges
reconsidering their previous decision  on  any  issue  would  be  well  high
impossible. This is unlike the Supreme Court of Appeal which  does  not  sit
en banque, and can and has reconsidered its  previous  judgments.  As  Judge
President Ngoepe went on to say:


  This would be highly undesirable in a court with a  final  say  on  inter
  alia political and moral issues. It is important to bear in mind that the
  reconsideration of a previous decision by a completely different  set  of
  minds is  a  necessary  mechanism  of  self-control  for  a  court  whose
  decisions are not appealable.

The ACDP was thus opposed  to  the  life  tenure  for  Constitutional  Court
judges  and  welcomed  the  reversion  to  the  limited  tenure   provisions
contained in section 176 of  the  Constitution.  As  far  as  the  financial
amendments are concerned, we agreed that it was necessary that the  Minister
of Finance should have control over the proliferation  of  levies  emanating
from departments desirous  of  increasing  their  financial  powers  and  we
support this amendment.

Having considered  the  various  amendments,  the  ACDP  also  welcomes  the
reconsideration of clauses relating to  local  government  intervention.  We
support the amendments to the Constitution and the Judges' Remuneration  and
Conditions of Employment Bill.

In conclusion, we would like to add to what the  previous  speaker  said  in
commending  our  chairman  the  hon  Johnny  de  Lange,  for  the  gracious,
gentlemanly  and  genteel  manner  in  which  he  chaired   the   committee,
particularly in dealing with us as opposition members, and  for  binding  us
together as a team. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members,  the  noise  level
is unacceptably high. You cannot converse in a manner meant to  disrupt  the
right of the speaker at the podium to be heard. You may  make  conversation,
but in subdued tones. Please assist the Chair  in  keeping  and  maintaining
the decorum of the House.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, the first  Constitution-amending  Bill  is
critical, because it will  enable  different  organs  of  state  to  operate
constitutionally, as the existing Act did not cater for certain  aspects  as
required by the same Constitution.

We know already that there was  an  outcry,  and  rightfully  so,  when  the
Deputy Minister of Education was appointed. The Constitution did  not  cater
for this appointment. The Act had far-reaching  implications  as  it  tested
the legislature's ability to make rules and  monitor  their  implementation,
so as to ascertain whether we flout the same rules we make.

The action to appoint the Deputy Minister was done with good  intentions,  I
would like to believe, but  the  procedures  adopted  to  appoint  him  were
unconstitutional. We also welcome the approach to amend the Constitution  to
enable local authorities to deliver so as to empower a municipal council  to
bind itself in the exercise of legislative authority. It  is  also  a  well-
known fact that some of our municipalities are not  financially  viable  and
may need special  measures,  created  by  Parliament,  to  deal  with  their
financial needs.

The amendment to change the  title  of  ``President  of  the  Constitutional
Court'' to ``Chief Justice'' also addresses the  confusion  in  jurisdiction
regarding who should preside over the election of political  office-bearers.
This amendment would also address this constitutional challenge.

We support these amendments with a view to preventing our organs  of  states
from operating ultra vires. It is not only relevant, but  crucial  that  our
men and women ... [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, apologies to Miss  Rajbally.  The  PAC  supports
this amendment. One of the amendments we wish to  comment  on  concerns  the
appointment of Deputy Ministers. We support this change as  the  limitations
on the President in these appointments were never clear to us in  the  first
place. We would still question why the number of appointments is limited  to
two.

If, in the future, the President seriously wished  to  appoint  more  Deputy
Ministers under this section,  it  would  mean  a  new  amendment  would  be
required. It is a bad constitution that responds to a  single  situation  or
individual such as, for instance, the Sobukwe laws of 1964 and 1970.

The amendments  affecting  the  Chief  Justice  bring  about  some  definite
improvements, resulting  in  one  judge  becoming  the  head  of  the  whole
judicial system. The old system of two parallel systems under two  presiding
officers is thus corrected. The duties of  the  Chief  Justice  are  clearly
outlined. The retirement age for judges of the Constitutional Court is  also
brought in line with that of other judges. This is also supported,  provided
the amendment is not being made for one judge only, as stated above.

The PAC supports the above amendments, but we wish to add that it is a  pity
that the amendment of section 25  was  not  included  in  these  amendments.
Several parties and members have assured us  that  the  two-thirds  majority
required for this amendment could be easily  obtained.  This  amendment  was
urgently required to strengthen the arm of the  Government  in  making  land
available for the previously disadvantaged communities.

A new democratic South Africa is meaningless, unless  the  majority  of  the
citizens of  this  country  obtain  land  that  is  desperately  needed  for
housing, agriculture, recreation, business, mining,  etc.  After  sunset  it
has become very dark, and we patiently and hopefully await sunrise.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the amendments  to  the  Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa, made  in  this  Constitution-amending  Bill,  deal
with the improvement of  an  organ  of  state,  namely  the  judiciary,  the
appointment of Deputy Ministers and local government.

Compiling the  Constitution  of  South  Africa  was  a  joint,  timeous  and
stressful process, and adjustments are expected  that  would  inculcate  the
improvement of its content. The adjustment made with regard  to  the  office
of authority within the judiciary is noted. However, the  extension  of  the
term of office of  Constitutional  Court  judges  has  raised  eyebrows,  as
regards  what  mechanism  has  been  put  in  place  to  ensure   that   the
independence granted to this body remains intact.

The second Constitution-amending Bill, appears adequately to address  issues
that  caused  practical  difficulties   in   the   implementation   of   the
Constitution.

It is felt that the decision by  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and
Constitutional Development to create a  separate  Judges'  Remuneration  and
Conditions of Employment Bill, has certainly avoided the introduction  of  a
Bill that is cluttered and cumbersome in terms of amending  legislation,  as
would have been the case if it was included  within  the  Judicial  Officers
Amendment  Bill.  The  Bill  appears  to  attend  to  the  remuneration  and
conditions of employment of judges of the Constitutional Court, the  Supreme
Court of Appeal and the High Court.

All three Bills, discussed in this  debate,  appear  to  introduce  positive
changes and adjustments and, if  incorporated  effectively,  will  serve  to
correct that which needed to be amended.

Noting the amendments made to the Constitution, the MF continues to  support
the supremacy of its authority and upholds all duties  to  the  Constitution
as the supreme law of the state. The MF  supports  the  two  amending  Bills
pertaining to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, as  well  as
the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, of course the AEB welcomes  the  ruling  that  two
Deputy Ministers may be appointed from outside the National  Assembly.  This
amendment will make it possible for the AEB to appoint another  MP  the  day
its leader is appointed as Deputy Minister. [Laughter.] Well, if  one  could
appoint a Botha what is wrong with an Aucamp? [Laughter.] The  AEB  supports
both the  Constitution-amending  Bills  and  the  Judges'  Remuneration  and
Conditions of Employment Bill.

Let me make a few remarks. Firstly, the provision for appointing two  Deputy
Ministers from outside the National Assembly  provides  for  more  inclusive
government, but it also provides  an  extra  benefit,  if  I  understand  it
correctly, in that it will enable the President to appoint a  specialist  in
a particular field, if needed.

Tweedens, die bepaling dat die President van  die  Konstitusionele  Hof  die
Hoofregter van Suid-Afrika word, is in orde.  Hoewel  die  AppÃ¨lhof  en  die
Konstitusionele Hof op afsonderlike terreine werksaam is, is dit tÃ³g so  dat
die Konstitusionele Hof die finale eindpunt van die  regsproses  is.  Verder
is dit ook 'n  simboliese  bevestiging  van  die  feit  dat  Suid-Afrika  'n
regstaat is met konstitusionele en nie parlementÃªre soewereiniteit nie.

'n Termyn van 12 jaar, of in party gevalle 15 jaar, vir 'n  regter  van  die
Konstitusionele  Hof,  is  ook  positief.   Konstitusionele   sake   is   'n
gespesialiseerde terrein, en die vrug van hierdie spesialisasie kan  verlore
gaan as die termyn te kort is. Ook is ons oortuig dat die langer termyn  van
regters in die  Konstitusionele  Hof  eerder  die  onafhanklikheid  van  die
regbank teenoor regeringsinmenging sal versterk, as in die geval van  korter
termyne waar die aanstellingsgeleenthede veel meer sal wees.

Die AEB steun die verkleining van die FinansiÃ«le en  Fiskale  Kommissie  van
22 na 9 lede, want 22 lede is amper 'n sinode. Lomp en oorlaaide  kommissies
is kontra-produktief en vaartbelyning moet die wagwoord wees.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Secondly, the provision that the  President  of  the  Constitutional  Court
becomes the Chief Justice of South Africa is in order. Although the  Supreme
Court and the Constitutional Court operate in separate spheres, it is  still
a fact that the Constitutional  Court  is  the  final  point  of  the  legal
process. It is furthermore also a symbolic confirmation  of  the  fact  that
South  Africa  is  a  constitutional  state  with  constitutional  and   not
parliamentary sovereignty.

A term of 12 years, or in some instances  15  years,  for  a  judge  of  the
Constitutional Court is also  positive.  Constitutional  matters  are  of  a
specialised nature, and the fruits of this specialisation  can  be  lost  if
the term is too short. We are  also  convinced  that  the  longer  terms  of
judges in the Constitutional Court will rather strengthen  the  independence
of the judiciary against government  interference,  as  opposed  to  shorter
terms where there will be far more appointment opportunities.

The AEB supports the reduction in the  size  of  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission from 22 members to 9, because 22 members is  virtually  a  synod.
Unwieldy and overloaded commissions are counter-productive and  streamlining
should be the watchword.]

The AEB also supports the empowering of local governments  to  borrow  long-
term funds, as long as  the  accompanying  legislation  ensures  that  sound
fiscal principles are  applied,  and  we  appreciate  the  omission  of  the
intended restriction of the powers of local governments.

Finally, let us not regard these constitutional changes as the  final  ones.
Constitutional developments addressing the position of  traditional  leaders
and  more  effectively  accommodating,  the  progressive  nature   of   this
constituency, still have to be made ... [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  When  the  hon  member  is
appointed  Deputy  Minister,  he  will  have  the   extra   speaking   time.
[Laughter.]
Ms N MAHLAWE: Chairperson, I have been called upon to speak on  the  Judges'
Remuneration and Conditions of  Employment  Bill,  and  I  am  going  to  do
exactly that and nothing else. The hon the Minister and the hon  chairperson
of the portfolio committee have already made reference to the amendments  in
this particular Bill, and I am not going to repeat them.

The Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Bill provides for  the
remuneration and conditions of employment of judges  of  the  Constitutional
Court, the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal  and  the  High  Courts  and  matters
connected therewith.  It  seeks  to  repeal  the  Judges'  Remuneration  and
Conditions of Employment Act of 1989, and introduce  legislation  regulating
the remuneration and  conditions  of  employment  of  all  judges  in  South
Africa.

It also seeks to make  the  head  of  the  Constitutional  Court  the  Chief
Justice of South Africa, in  line  with  the  proposed  amendments,  and  to
include the offices of the Deputy Chief Justice and the Deputy President  of
the Supreme Court of Appeal in the legislation regulating  the  remuneration
and conditions of employment of all judges.

The Bill provides for transitional  arrangements  so  as  to  recognise  the
active service performed by judges  of  the  former  TBVC  states,  that  is
Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei, to place these judges on  a  par
with all the other judges of South Africa and to amend  the  legislation  in
respect of widows of judges who receive a pension.

I shall now look  into  some  substantive  issues.  Clause  2  of  the  Bill
contains  the  following  provisions  relating  to  the  annual  salary   of
Constitutional Court judges and other judges. It provides for  an  allowance
of R3 500 per annum to a Constitutional  Court  judge,  in  addition  to  an
annual salary which is paid  at  a  rate  determined  by  the  President  by
proclamation in the  Gazette.  Such  an  allowance  is  not  taxable  unless
Parliament expressly provides otherwise. The  annual  salary  and  allowance
shall be paid as a direct charge against  the  National  Revenue  Fund.  The
proclamation may be issued with effect from a date which may not be  earlier
than one year prior to the date of the proclamation, and a copy  of  such  a
proclamation  shall  be  submitted  to  Parliament  within  14  days   after
publication thereof.

As regards the discharge of Constitutional Court  judges  and  other  judges
from active service, the Bill provides that  a  judge  shall  be  discharged
from active service on the date on which he or she attains  the  age  of  70
years, if he or she has completed a period of active  service  of  not  less
than 10 years. If on that date, he  or  she  has  not  completed  10  years'
active service, he or she  shall  be  discharged  on  the  date  immediately
following the day on which he or she completes a period of 10 years'  active
service.

If a judge has attained the age of 65 years  and  has  performed  15  years'
active service and informs the Minister that he or she no longer  wishes  to
perform active service, such judge shall  be  discharged  by  the  President
from active service. If a judge  is  incapable  of  performing  his  or  her
official duties due to a permanent infirmity of mind or body, he or she  may
be discharged by the President.

Clause 3(1) deals with the  discharge  of  Constitutional  Court  judges.  A
Constitutional Court judge who holds office in terms of  section  176(1)  of
the Constitution, must be discharged from active  service  on  the  date  on
which he or she attains the age of 70 years or has completed a 12 year  term
of office as a Constitutional Court judge. He or she may also be  discharged
on the grounds of permanent infirmity of mind  or  body  or  if  he  or  she
requests such a discharge, and the President will discharge him if he  deems
it fit to do so.

Clause 5 of the Bill deals with the salary payable to  Constitutional  Court
judges or judges after discharge from active service and states  that  after
discharge from active service such  a  judge  shall  be  paid  a  salary  in
accordance with the  formula  A/B  x  C.  A  represents  the  annual  salary
applicable to the highest office held by the Constitutional Court  judge  or
judge concerned, B represents 15 and C represents the  period  in  years  of
active service of the said judge.

Clause 6 of the Bill provides that a Constitutional  Court  judge  or  judge
should be paid a gratuity after discharge from active service,  in  addition
to any salary payable to him or her.

Clause 7 refers to  the  performance  of  service  by  Constitutional  Court
judges and judges after they have been discharged  from  active  service.  A
Constitutional Court judge or judge who has not attained  75  years  of  age
must be available to perform service  for  a  period  which,  in  aggregate,
amounts to three months a year. If he or she has attained 75 years  of  age,
he or she may perform service on a voluntary basis.

Clause 9 provides for the surviving spouse of a Constitutional  Court  judge
or other judge who dies while performing active service.  She  or  he  shall
receive an amount equal to two thirds of the salary  which  was  payable  to
that particular Constitutional Court judge or other  judge.  If  a  gratuity
would have been paid or payable to that particular judge who was  discharged
from active services, such  gratuity  shall  be  payable  to  the  surviving
spouse, and this is in addition to any other amounts payable to the spouse.

A  motor  vehicle  owned  by  the  state  may  be  made   available   to   a
Constitutional Court judge or other judge who holds office  in  a  permanent
or acting capacity for use in the course of his or  her  official  functions
as well as for his or her private purposes.

Finally, this Bill makes transitional arrangements for  a  judge  in  active
service, in terms of Act 27 of 1989 of Bophuthatswana and Decree 19 of  1990
of the former Transkei. These judges also have to be put on a par  with  all
judges in South Africa. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,  allow
me first and foremost to thank all the hon members and all the parties  that
participated in this debate.  I  am  personally  very  happy  that  we  have
concluded the debate in the way we did. I have  no  doubt  that  almost  all
parties represented here are going to vote in favour of these three Bills.

The position of the IFP is unfortunate and regrettable, because there  is  a
process that Cabinet has embarked upon to  address  the  question  that  hon
member Mzizi has quite legitimately raised. I personally have no doubt  that
the process may be too  slow,  too  complex,  too  cumbersome.  Nonetheless,
there is this process that is attempting to address  the  problem  that  the
hon member has legitimately identified.

We  would,  indeed,  have  been  happier  if  the  IFP,  this  time  around,
associated itself with these  Bills,  because,  as  will  be  remembered  as
regards an earlier occasion, the IFP took a similar stance  with  regard  to
constitutional development in this country.

A few remarks have been made which I think do  warrant  some  response.  The
first issue was that the Constitutional Court  wields  tremendous  political
power. It does not. All our higher courts,  as  a  result  of  a  deliberate
choice that we made as the people of the Republic  of  South  Africa,  wield
the awesome power of judicial review. However, none of our courts  are  thus
transformed into a site of political power. They remain very much courts  of
law, and that includes the Constitutional Court. So, no one  is  right,  not
even a judge president, in suggesting  that  the  Constitutional  Court,  by
virtue of being a constitutional court, is a  political  court.  We  do  not
have political courts.

The only time this country had a political court was  when  the  NP  of  old
decided to empower Parliament to do judicial work in the 1950s, in  response
to the constitutional crisis around the coloured vote. We do not  have  that
in this country.

It has been suggested that the president of Azapo was appointed as a  Deputy
Minister unconstitutionally. No, that was not the case. The President  acted
in terms of section 93 of the Constitution, which allows him to appoint  any
member of the National Assembly as a Deputy Minister if he  so  chooses.  So
there is nothing unconstitutional about that. We are not,  in  other  words,
addressing an issue of unconstitutionality by  the  amendment  that  affects
Deputy Ministers.

It has also been asked why only two Ministers. I want to say  that  this  is
in line with the choice that we  made  when  we  enacted  the  provision  of
section 91(3)(c) of the Constitution, which allows the President to  appoint
no more than two Ministers  of  Cabinet  from  outside  this  Assembly.  So,
indeed, the amendment that this House has adopted is intended to  bring  the
appointment of Deputy Ministers in line with that position.

Lastly, a suggestion has been made that we have to examine section  25,  viz
the property clause in the Constitution, with regard to the issue  of  land.
I do no think that this is necessary, because that is not where the  problem
lies. The property clause does not disempower us if we want to  address  the
issue of land. We can  expropriate  any  property  we  so  choose,  but  the
problem, I suspect, and personally believe, lies elsewhere.

There is no need for us to  tamper  with  the  property  clause  unless,  of
course, we deliberately choose to cause economic  instability  unnecessarily
- cutting off our noses in order to spite our beautiful faces. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put:  That  the  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa
Amendment Bill [B 68B - 2001] be read a second time.

As there was no objection, the Speaker announced that, for the  Bill  to  be
passed, a supporting vote of at least two  thirds  of  the  members  of  the
National Assembly was required.

Members were therefore requested to register their names in support  of  the
Bill.

       ever lower inflation rates, increasingly efficient revenue collection
       and resistance to global economic shocks.

Mrs P W CUPIDO: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the impossible position in which the  Premier  of  the  Western
       Cape, Gerald Morkel, was placed by the New NP  leader's  betrayal  of
       opposition voters;


  (2) recognises that Mr Morkel has had to choose between the wishes of his
       voters and the authority of the party bosses;


  (3) acknowledges that by choosing the voters Mr Morkel risks  losing  his
       job; and
  (4) commends him for making that tough choice and  staying  true  to  the
       mandate given to him by the people of the Western Cape.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with great sadness that 10 people, including two children, were
       killed and 19 seriously injured when  the  bus  in  which  they  were
       travelling overturned near Machadodorp,  Mpumalanga,  on  Friday,  26
       October 2001;


  (2) conveys its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of the
       deceased, and prays for the full recovery of the injured; and


  (3) urges all motorists to take care while on the road,  especially  with
       the holiday season fast approaching.
Mr L M KGWELE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with appreciation, the publication of the Draft Revised National
           Curriculum Statement by the Minister of Education;


       (b)  that  an  extensive  consultation  process  has  been  followed,
           including public comment and hearings, in order to ensure  broad
           participation in the review process; and


       (c)   that  despite  unfounded  objections  from  some  narrow-minded
           elements who still resist change,  the  Draft  Curriculum  seeks
           responsibly and with great care to inculcate  knowledge,  skills
           and values in our young people  preparing  for  adulthood  in  a
           democratic society; and


  (2) therefore congratulates the Minister of Education and  his  dedicated
       team on their endeavour to make our curriculum relevant for the  21st
       century, and urges them to hold fast in their important task.

[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the DA lost its court case against  the  Johannesburg  Executive
           Mayor;


       (b)   this  exercise  places  a  severe  financial  burden   on   the
           financially embarrassed DA; and


       (c)  vast sums of donor funds have been wasted in order to enable  DA
           leaders to sit  in  mayoral  committees  with  the  ANC  in  the
           Johannesburg Metro; and
  (2) further notes the DA's hypocritical stance, in that  in  the  Western
       Cape they  are  not  interested  in  becoming  part  of  co-operative
       governance in the interest of all people of  South  Africa,  but  are
       rather  spreading  disinformation  which  creates  confusion  amongst
       councillors who must serve the people.

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:
  That the House -


  (1) expresses the view that judicial procedure cannot and should  not  be
       compromised if justice is to be done, as  nearly  happened  when  the
       Scorpions and  the  National  Intelligence  Agency  installed  hidden
       cameras in a Pagad case courtroom;


  (2)  notes  that  this  highlights  the  lack  of  co-ordination  between
       departments in the criminal justice system;


  (3) calls on the Minister for Justice and Constitutional  Development  to
       ensure that the Scorpions do not act as a law  unto  themselves,  and
       that they respect the Constitution and laws of the country; and


  (4) calls on the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development  and
       the Minister  of  Safety  and  Security  urgently  to  implement  co-
       ordinated plans to deal with the complex issue of organised crime and
       urban terror, for it is clear that as long as they proceed without  a
       proper strategy  and  co-ordinated  management,  the  criminals  will
       escape justice.

Mrs B M NTULI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the increase in incidents of child rape:


       (a)  the gang rape of a nine-month-old child by six men;


       (b)  a grandfather who raped his infant granddaughter in Kimberley;
       (c)  the report of another child rape incident in the Free State; and


       (d)  a dozen other unreported incidents;


  (2) further notes that the ANC Women's League plans to hold  a  march  to
       highlight the problem of child abuse and child rape;


  (3) believes that child abuse and child rape constitute barbaric, deviant
       behaviour which must be met by the full wrath of the law;


  (4) condemns child abuse and child rape; and


  (5) calls on the communities to mobilise and to co-operate with police to
       eradicate this evil from our communities.

[Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that yesterday the leader  of  the  ACDP,  Rev  K  R  J  Meshoe,
           pertinently put particular questions to the hon President of the
           Republic during the debate on the new partnership  for  Africa's
           development;


       (b)  that regrettably the  hon  the  President  did  not  answer  the
           questions directly, particularly those pertaining to the cost of
           the peacekeeping operation in Burundi, notwithstanding the  fact
           that the information was at his disposal, as is indicated in the
           President's letter contained in today's Announcements,  Tablings
           and Committee Reports;


       (c)  that the Deputy President in his response to a similar  question
           by the UDM on 17 October 2001, stated: ``There is absolutely  no
           cost''; and


       (d)   with  concern  that,  according  to  the  Presidential   letter
           submitted to the Speaker, the cost will be R1,5 billion and that
           at this stage there is no guarantee of donor funding,  with  the
           result that the South African taxpayer might have  to  foot  the
           bill;


  (2) notwithstanding the above, supports  the  call  of  the  Minister  of
       Defence to church congregations to pray for the safety of the troops,
       particularly in view of the fact that no cease-fire has  been  signed
       and that their lives are at risk because of the poor logistical back-
       up ...

[Time expired.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mev die Speaker, hiermee gee ek  kennis  dat  ek  tydens
die volgende sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis kennis neem dat -


  (1)  die  huidige  interne  gevegte  in  die  DA  en  die  Nuwe  NP   die
       geloofwaardigheid van politici  by  die  kiesers  benadeel  en  hulle
       negatief beÃ¯nvloed teenoor alle politieke partye;


  (2) hierdie gevoel onder kiesers kan veroorsaak dat kiesers apaties  word
       teenoor politiek en aanleiding kan gee daartoe dat hulle  besluit  om
       nie deel te neem aan toekomstige verkiesings nie;


  (3) die Vryheidsfront 'n beroep doen op kiesers  om  nie  die  roete  van
       onbetrokkenheid te volg nie, maar eerder betrokke te bly  en  daarmee
       seggenskap te behou in die bepaling  van  hulle  toekoms  in  hierdie
       land; en


  (4) die VF 'n party  is  wat  konsekwent  optree,  gegrond  is  op  vaste
       beginsels en ingestel is op politieke oplossings wat tot voordeel van
       alle kiesers in Suid-Afrika sal wees, en daarom  'n  beroep  doen  op
       kiesers om die VF te steun in hul poging om hierdie wen-wen-oplossing
       te verwesenlik.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  during  the
next sitting I shall move:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the current internal struggles within the  DA  and  the  New  NP  are
       harmful  to  politicians'  credibility  with  voters,   making   them
       negatively disposed towards all political parties;


  (2) this feeling among voters may make them  apathetic  towards  politics
       and may prompt their decision not to participate in future elections;
  (3) the FF appeals to voters not to follow the route of apathy but rather
       to remain involved, thereby retaining a say  in  the  determining  of
       their future in this country; and


  (4) the FF is a party which acts consistently, based on sound  principles
       and attuned to political solutions that will be advantageous  to  all
       South Africa's voters, and therefore appeals to voters to support the
       FF in their effort to achieve this win-win solution.]

Ms S B NQODI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development  received
       widespread support during the debate that took  place  in  the  House
       yesterday, 31 October 2001;


  (2) believes that the overwhelming support this plan  received,  reflects
       the success of the ANC-led Government in mobilising all  stakeholders
       in our society to embrace the needs and interests  of  the  continent
       and to work towards its revival; and


  (3) commends the Government and President Thabo Mbeki, together with  his
       counterparts in other African countries, for working on the elaborate
       plan which will make this century an African century.

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that the majority of DA councillors have pledged their  support
       to the DA and to  fulfilling  the  mandate  they  received  from  the
       voters;


  (2) expresses its appreciation for the commitment of these councillors to
       do their work and deliver services to all the people;


  (3) believes that the ANC's intolerance of opposition is a danger  signal
       for healthy multiparty democracy; and


  (4) commends those councillors who continue to put the interests  of  the
       people first.

[Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House, whereas -


  (1) the advent of democracy in  South  Africa  created  a  constitutional
       dispensation within which women could for the first  time  aspire  to
       the highest  positions  in  the  country  in  all  spheres  of  human
       endeavour, and play pivotal roles in all these areas, to  unlock  the
       full potential of the nation and to serve with distinction the  cause
       and future of democracy and humanity; and


  (2) the large-scale entrance of women into  politics,  business  and  the
       professions, amongst other activities, is  a  clear  and  distinctive
       signal that ours is indeed an open and all-embracing  democracy  with
       in-built provisions for stability and sustainability,


  therefore resolves to pay great and rousing tribute to all the  women  in
  our country who through their vision, position and commitment give us the
  promise and the certainty that South Africa's democracy is indeed builton
  a solid foundation that will sustain it  and  support  it  far  into  the
  future.

[Applause.]
Mr B MTHEMBU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Physical Science paper was leaked in Gauteng;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  two matric pupils have been barred from writing examinations and
           could face criminal prosecution; and


       (b)  the problem of leakage has been confined to Gauteng;


  (3) commends the Government on  taking  stringent  security  measures  to
       ensure that the results are credible; and


  (4) calls on all the communities to co-operate  with  the  Department  of
       Education and law-enforcement officers to expose the perpetrators  of
       this corruption.
Mnr S SIMMONS: Mev die Speaker, ek gee kennis dat  ek  tydens  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van Nobel-pryswenner F W de Klerk se verklaring  dat  die
       inisiatiewe van Marthinus van Schalkwyk vir die vestiging van 'n meer
       inklusiewe model van regering verwelkom word;


  (2)  voorts  kennis  neem  dat  die  DA  se  lot  diÃ©  van  'n  krimpende
       minderheidsparty sonder invloed sal word, soos mnr Ian Smith se party
       na Zimbabwe se onafhanklikwording;
  (3) erken  dat  die  land  'n  spesiale  samewerkingsmodel  op  die  drie
       regeringsvlakke benodig om goeie regering te bevorder;


  (4) van mening is dat die volgende beginsels in die proses ingebou word:


       (a)  elke deelnemende party se identiteit  en  outonomie  moet  erken
           word;
       (b)  die vertrekpunt moet wees om 'n  ooreenkoms  te  bereik  oor  'n
           bindende beleidsraamwerk;


       (c)  deelnemende partye het die reg om in die openbaar te verskil oor
           sake waaroor konsensus nie bereik kon word nie; en


       (d)  enige samewerkingsmodel moet so inklusief as moontlik wees; en


  (5) 'n beroep op alle Suid-Afrikaners doen om hulle ondersteuning aan die
       nuwe inisiatief van Marthinus van Schalkwyk te gee.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr S SIMMONS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes a statement by Nobel Prize winner F W de  Klerk  welcoming  the
       initiatives by Marthinus van Schalkwyk towards the establishment of a
       more inclusive model of government;
  (2) further notes that the DA is destined to become a shrinking  minority
       party devoid of  influence,  such  as  Mr  Ian  Smith's  party  after
       Zimbabwe's independence;


  (3) acknowledges that the country needs a special model  of  co-operation
       in all three tiers of government in order to promote good governance;


  (4)  is  op  the  opinion  that  the  following  principles   should   be
       incorporated in this process:


       (a)  the identity and autonomy of each participating  party  must  be
           recognised;


       (b)  the point of departure should be to reach consensus on a binding
           policy framework;


       (c)  participating parties have the right  to  differ  in  public  on
           matters regarding which consensus could not be reached; and


       (d)  any model of co-operation should be as  inclusive  as  possible;
           and


  (5) appeals to all South Africans  to  lend  their  support  to  the  new
       initiative by Marthinus van Schalkwyk.]

                       DEPLOYMENT OF TROOPS TO BURUNDI

                             (Draft Resolution)

The ACTING CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that SANDF troops have been deployed to Burundi  to  assist  in
       the securing of the transitional government;


  (2) recognises the contribution these troops will make in the  transition
       to peace and stability in the region; and


  (3) wishes the troops every success in their mission and a safe return on
       completion of their duties.

Agreed to.
Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, on a point of  order:  Given  the  explanation
with regard to Burundi, would you afford the hon Mr  Green  the  opportunity
to withdraw his confusing motion?

The SPEAKER: Order! If Mr Green wishes to  say  anything  he  will  indicate
that to me. He does not need someone else to indicate it. [Interjections.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, may I address you on that point?

The SPEAKER: Order! On which point, the one made by Mr Goniwe?

Mr L M GREEN: Yes, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: Order! No, because I have  just  told  him  it  is  irrelevant.
[Interjections.]

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, to the extent that Mr Green implied  that  either
the President or the Deputy President misled the House,  do  you  not  think
that it might be in order that he withdraws his motion.
The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I will look at the motion. I read from  the
ATC. I do not wish to enter into a debate about what notices of motion  say.
I simply wanted to clarify, in the interests of informing the  public,  what
was actually published, which is the correct record of the information  sent
by the President to the House.

The House adjourned at 18:48.
