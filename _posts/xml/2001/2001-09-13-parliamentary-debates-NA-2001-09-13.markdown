                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D J SITHOLE: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  the United Nations held a conference on racism,  xenophobia  and
           related intolerances in South Africa; and


       (b)  racism remains a challenge which humanity must overcome  in  the
           21st century;


  (2) believes that this conference has adopted important resolutions which
       will restore nations and people who have been  affected  by  slavery,
       colonialism and racism; and


  (3)  hails  this  conference  as   groundbreaking   and   historic,   and
       acknowledges the positive role played by the South African Government
       in hosting this conference.

[Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House ...
Mr K M ANDREW: Madam Speaker on a point of order: I know it is considered  a
great amusement to many members of the Government to be insulting to  female
members of the opposition. But, having  been  warned  previously,  again  at
least two or three members of the governing  party  started  making  catlike
sounds shortly after ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr K M ANDREW: I know that among the sexists and racists on that side it  is
very amusing. I think it is outrageous and I would ask you,  Madam  Speaker,
to ask them to own up and withdraw their remarks. In  future,  I  think  you
are going to have to introduce a penalty, because  this  is  not  the  first
time that this has happened. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, in making his point, the hon Ken Andrew ...

The SPEAKER: Are you speaking on the point of order?

Mr M T GONIWE: Yes.

The SPEAKER: Let me rule on it before you speak.

Mr M T GONIWE: OK. I will come back after the ruling.

The SPEAKER:  Order!  Complaints  have  been  made  about  this  and  it  is
unacceptable that one should deal in that way with any member. I  will  deal
with that and declare it out of order as soon as I hear it from any  member,
and I would ask all Whips to help me with this. We have to treat each  other
with respect and we do not do so by making fun  of  voices,  of  styles,  of
clothing, or of any such thing. [Applause.]

We will now proceed. Mr Goniwe, are you raising a point of order?

Mr M T GONIWE: I was saying that in making his  point  he  further  made  an
allegation in which he said: ``I know they in those benches are racists  and
sexists.'' He said so.

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Mr Goniwe. Mr Andrew, did you use  either  of  those
words?

Mr K M ANDREW: I used both of those words, Madam Speaker, and the  reason  I
did ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr K M ANDREW: May I just address you briefly, Madam Speaker, please?

The SPEAKER: The reason is irrelevant.

Mr K M ANDREW: May I just address you briefly - 20 seconds?

Simply, the moment I raised the point of order, and the moment  I  indicated
the nature of the problem, there were guffaws  and  laughter  on  that  side
which could only be ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Mr Andrew, would you please withdraw those words?

Mr K M ANDREW: They do not do it to the white women on this side.

The SPEAKER: Hon Mr Andrew, would you please withdraw  those  words,  racist
and sexist? You have given your reasons for using  them,  but,  nonetheless,
those are not words we accept.

Mr K M ANDREW: I withdraw, Madam Speaker, and we realise  why  R100  million
was wasted in Durban. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: The timer will be turned back for the DP. Mrs Kalyan, will  you
now put your notice of motion.

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes President Mbeki's request for a re-evaluation  of  spending  on
       social services on the basis of the 1995 death statistics;


  (2) recognises that while figures cited by the President show 2 653  Aids
       deaths in 1995, UNAID's figures show that  in  1999,  250  000  South
       Africans died from Aids;


  (3) acknowledges that HIV/Aids is South Africa's biggest health crisis;


  (4) therefore, calls on President Mbeki to spend less time in  cyberspace
       and more time amongst real people who are dying in increasing numbers
       as a result of Aids; and


  (5) urges the Government to substantially increase the  amount  of  money
       spent on combating HIV/Aids.

[Applause.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the contemplation of the new  social  security  system  that
       will process applications within two days instead of six months;


  (2) believes that social  security  recipients  will  benefit  from  this
       innovation  and  poverty  amongst  the  poor  people  will  thus   be
       eradicated; and


  (3) commends the Minister and the Department of  Social  Development  for
       this innovation which will enhance the Government's delivery system.

Ms X C MAKASI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Cape Fish Processors plan to build a factory to process fish
           in the Phillipi/Mitchells Plain poverty zone; and
       (b)  this project will create 12 000 jobs for local communities;


  (2) believes that the implementation of this project will  contribute  to
       job creation and the eradication of poverty; and


  (3) welcomes this project.

[Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the detrimental effect  SA's  policy  of  ``silent  diplomacy''
       toward Zimbabwe had on the SA economy, in the light of the following:


       (a)  the loss of investment could be as high  as  R8  billion,  as  a
           result of damage to the region's image;


       (b)  among the ripple effects caused by the crisis is a looming  food
           shortage, with Zimbabwe expected to need 600  000  tons  of  the
           staple grain, maize, to make it to the next harvest; and


       (c)  if Zimbabwe's crisis is  not  resolved,  neighbouring  countries
           could face a massive flow of refugees across their borders; and


  (2) calls on President Mbeki, in the interest of  all  SADC  members,  to
       make  it  clear  that  SA  expects  Zimbabwe  to  honour  its  recent
       undertakings to the international community.

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) urges the ANC to kindly sharpen their maths skills, since it made  an
       obvious mistake when it stated that 45 of their ``comrades are coming
       home'' from the UDM; and


  (2) notes -


       (a)  the fact that only two persons joined the ANC's ranks at  Nyanga
           (Western Cape);


       (b)   that  the  UDM  warmly  welcomes  the  approximately  500   ANC
           supporters who, on  2  September  2001  in  Vredenburg  (Western
           Cape), joined the true political home of all South Africans, the
           UDM; and


       (c)  that the ANC is woefully mistaken if it thinks that the  UDM  is
           on the demise - the true figures as quoted by  the  UDM  clearly
           indicate that the ANC's confidence is severely misplaced.

Mr D V BLOEM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the SA Post Office has declared war on corruption; and


       (b)  the Post Office  has  fired  250  managers  and  called  in  the
           Scorpions Unit and the National  Intelligence  Agency  to  fight
           crime;


  (2) believes  that  this  demonstrates  the  commitment  of  the  ANC-led
       Government to fight corruption, and work towards  a  transparent  and
       clean corporate governance policy for parastatals; and


  (3) commends the steps taken by the Post Office to  get  rid  of  corrupt
       officials.

[Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with shock  and  sadness  the  barbaric,  devastating  and  co-
       ordinated terrorist attacks on the nerve centres of American  defence
       and finance in Washington and New York;


  (2) believes that South Africa, as a peace-loving country, must denounce,
       reject and condemn terrorism,  especially  in  the  form  of  suicide
       attacks;


  (3) condemns those countries who harbour, train, sponsor and  flirt  with
       international terrorists; and


  (4) therefore encourages the US administration to leave no stone unturned
       to punish the perpetrators and bring an end to global terrorism.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op  die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy weersin uitspreek teenoor die voorval in Brits  wat  tans  in  die
       Pretoriase hooggeregshof verhoor word waar 'n plaaswerker gesterf het
       nadat  hy  met  'n  sambok  aangerand  is  asook  teenoor  die   twee
       gewelddadige plaasaanvalle gister in die  Paarl,  waar  'n  50-jarige
       plaasvrou verwurg is en andere ernstig beseer is;


  (2) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die aanvalle, moord en aanrandings op plase  steeds  voorkom  en
           skynbaar besig is om toe te neem; en


       (b)  hierdie gebeure rasseverhoudings vertroebel; en


  (3) alle LP's maan om alles in hulle vermoë te doen om hierdie  vorm  van
       terreur teen te werk en nie die geleenthede te misbruik vir politieke
       voordeel of rassehaatspraak nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its revulsion at an incident in  Brits  that  is  currently
       being tried in the Pretoria Supreme Court, in which a  farm  labourer
       died after he was assaulted with  a  sjambok,  as  well  as  the  two
       violent farm attacks at  Paarl  yesterday,  in  which  a  50-year-old
       farmer's wife was strangled and others were seriously injured;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  attacks, murders and assaults are still taking  place  on  farms
           and are apparently on the increase; and
       (b)  these incidents are marring race relations; and


  (3) urges all MPs to do everything in their power to thwart this type  of
       terrorism and not to abuse these  incidents  for  political  gain  or
       racial hate speech.]

Mr N B FIHLA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

  (1) notes with concern the recent escapes of prisoners  from  St  Alban's
       Prison in Port Elizabeth and from the prison in Witbank, Mpumalanga;


  (2) commends the police  for  their  prompt  action  in  recapturing  the
       prisoner who escaped from St Alban's Prison;


  (3) welcomes the action taken against three  prison  officials  who  have
       been suspended pending an investigation into the escapes; and


  (4) anxiously awaits  the  Minister's  reports  upon  completion  of  the
       investigations into these two escapes.

Mr R J HEINE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the shocking state of South Africa's restructuring programme in
       the light of -


       (a)  the postponement of the listing of SAA  following  the  unsolved
           controversy surrounding the breach of  corporate  governance  at
           SAA;


       (b)  the postponement of the  listing  of  Telkom  and  the  Airports
           Company of South Africa;


       (c)  the serious implications this has for South Africa's  asset  and
           liability programme; and


       (d)  the misguided actions of Cosatu in taking its  antiprivatisation
           campaign to the international stage; and


  (2) calls on the Government to -


       (a)  reprimand its alliance partner for its uninformed actions  which
           are costing the SA economy billions of rands; and


       (b)  tackle the restructuring programme  of  State  assets  with  the
           seriousness it deserves.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:
  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the publication of the manifesto on  values,  education  and
       democracy by the Department of Education;


  (2) commends the department for giving the African philosophy  of  ubuntu
       the prominence and importance it deserves and  the  recognition  that
       such a philosophy is important in the restoration of  human  dignity;
       and


  (3) urges all stakeholders to embrace the concept of ubuntu in an  effort
       to make our schools centres  of  tolerance  and  acceptance  of  each
       other's humanity.

Mr J H NASH: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Department of Land Affairs has  recently  approved  an
       application  by  the  Gariep  Municipality  to  purchase  a  farm  in
       Venterstad to increase commonage land and  thereby  the  capacity  to
       support and assist emerging small farmers; and


  (2) commends the Minister and the department and  acknowledges  the  role
       played by the MEC of Agriculture, Comrade Kwinti, and his  department
       in ensuring that this application was approved.

Mr F BEUKMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy skok uitspreek oor die voortgesette, onwettige aanhouding  van  'n
       RSA-burger, mnr Stone Stemmet, in Mali wat reeds meer as 90 dae  lank
       sy RSA-paspoort ontneem is;


  (2) die optrede van die Mali-regering betreur en versoek dat mnr  Stemmet
       se wettige reisdokumente onmiddellik aan hom terugbesorg word;


  (3) 'n beroep doen op die Minister van Buitelandse Sake om -


       (a)  'n statusverslag aan die Parlement voor te lê oor die stappe wat
           die  departement  onderneem  om  mnr  Stemmet  se  vrylating  te
           bewerkstellig; en


       (b)  die Hoë  Kommissaris  van  Mali  in  Suid-Afrika  vir  dringende
           konsultasie te  ontbied  en  'n  verduideliking  van  die  Mali-
           regering te eis; en


  (4) vertrou dat mnr Stemmet se persoonlike veiligheid en  gesondheid  nie
       deur sy voortgesette aanhouding in gevaar gestel word nie.

day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -

               PRISON FELLOWSHIP INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL MEETING

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, I move without notice on behalf of the ACDP:

   That the House -


   (1)      notes that -


        (a)       Prison  Fellowship  International,  an   association   of
              independent  national  Christian  organisations  involved  in
              criminal justice ministry worldwide, and having  consultative
              status with the United Nations Economic and  Social  Council,
              will be holding its annual international council  meeting  in
              Krugersdorp, starting this coming Sunday; and


        (b)      since 1976 Prison Fellowship International  has  grown  to
              encompass  national  Prison  Fellowship  ministries   in   88
              countries with around 100 000 volunteers worldwide, making it
              the most extensive network of Christian criminal justice  and
              prison ministries in the world;


   (2)       commends  the  organisation  for  its  positive   contributions
        worldwide to criminal justice and prison reform,  particularly  its
        emphasis on the promotion of restorative justice, as  well  as  its
        work in  South  Africa  where  it  has  taken  a  leading  role  in
        mobilising  and  training  community  volunteers  and  implementing
        victim-offender reconciliation projects; and


   (3)      prays for the Lord's blessings upon its deliberations during its
        international council meeting next week which will be  attended  by
        delegates representing 95 countries.

Agreed to.

           SECOND READING DEBATE ON PROVINCIAL TAX REGULATION BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr F BHENGU: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the  Chief  Whip  of  the  Majority
Party, I hereby move without notice:


    That, notwithstanding Rule  253,  the  Second  Reading  debate  on  the

    76) be conducted on Tuesday, 18 September 2001.

              TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

                             (Draft resolution)

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Chief Whip  of  the  Majority
Party, I hereby move without notice:

     That the House -


     (1)    notes that -


         (a)     at 08:45, Eastern Standard Time, on 11 September  2001,  an
              unprecedented act of terrorism brought death  and  destruction
              to the financial heartland of the United States of America;


         (b)     within the next hour, the Pentagon, headquarters of the  US
              Department of Defence, was also attacked; and


         (c)      a  fourth  hijacked  aeroplane  crashed  near  Pittsburgh,
              Pennsylvania;
     (2)    believes that these acts of terror, carried  out  with  ruthless
         and fanatical precision, not only  constitute  an  assault  on  the
         United States, its government and  its  people,  but  also  pose  a
         challenge to all humanity to act jointly to rid the world  of  this
         scourge; and


     (3)    as the National Assembly of the Parliament of  the  Republic  of
         South Africa -


         (a)     unreservedly condemns these wanton acts of terrorism  which
              it is estimated will cost thousands of human lives;


         (b)     urges the Government of the Republic  of  South  Africa  to
              extend whatever assistance is required by the United States of
              America  in  this  dire  time  of  need  to  ensure  that  the
              perpetrators are brought to justice; and


         (c)     in this hour of bereavement and profound sorrow, on  behalf
              of the people of South  Africa,  assures  the  people  of  the
              United States that they are  in  our  thoughts  and  that  our
              hearts go out to all those who have lost loved ones, relatives
              and friends as a result of this brutal crime.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, scenes which a transfixed  world  viewed  on
its television screens last Tuesday, piling horror upon horror, will not  be
forgotten by any of us.  No  Hollywood  blockbuster,  no  best  seller  ever
envisaged the  extent  of  the  devastation  which  played  out  before  the
fascinated and horrified gaze of the world.

This was the cold-blooded execution of a  terrorist  plot  by  fanatics  who
were prepared to give their lives for God knows  what  cause,  ignoring  the
fate of many thousands of innocent victims.

There are some in South Africa who have flirted with  terrorists  and  still
do so. Whether they will admit it or not, there  were  people  who  secretly
were gleeful and who celebrated the attack on the heart of America.

The world changed last Tuesday, and we  must  recognise  this.  We  need  to
respond positively to Prime Minister  Blair's  call.  We  need  to  join  an
international alliance aimed at ending  terrorism.  Whether  in  the  Middle
East, Northern Ireland, America or Cape Town, it is not acceptable to  be  a
terrorist or to support terrorism. [Interjections.]

It is not respectable to harbour terrorists or to lend them aid or  comfort.
Terrorism must become  unacceptable  anywhere  in  the  world.  All  of  the
democracies, including South Africa and our democratic  friends  and  allies
around the world, must resolve not to tolerate those  who  choose  violence.
Those countries which foster terrorism or provide safe  havens,  even  those
that understand  the  terrorists,  must  pay  a  price.  There  must  be  no
equivocation or ambivalence.

The  initial  inadequate  response  of  our  Government  gave  way   to   an
appropriate  and  full-hearted  response  from  President  Mbeki,  which  we
applaud. The President heads  the  Nonaligned  Movement.  Let  us  use  that
instrument, at the next meeting of the NAM,  to  start  the  process.  South
Africa is a shining light in the world. We managed, together  as  a  people,
to defeat  apartheid.  Let  us  now  take  a  lead  in  fighting  terrorism.
[Interjections.]

I would urge the Government to listen again to the call  made  yesterday  by
the hon Ms Smuts, and that was to ask the Government to follow  the  example
of many other countries and fly our flag at half mast, both as a gesture  of
sympathy and concern for our American friends, and as a sign of our  resolve
to defeat terrorism wherever it shows its head in the world. [Applause.]

Mr E J LUCAS: Madam Speaker, the IFP joins all  members  of  this  House  in
expressing our solidarity with the American people in their dark  hour.  Our
profoundest condolences and prayers are with the  American  people.  We  are
all violated by this tragedy, for we all share inviolable bonds, values  and
decency by the essential virtue of our humanity.

Terrorism and violence are not and never  will  be  an  accepted  method  to
resolve conflicts or to advance political objectives.  The  message  of  the
international community is clear to the terrorists who have committed  these
barbaric acts: We will give you no haven, and there is nowhere you can  hide
to escape the justice and retribution that will come.

The new global order is vulnerable to terrorist attacks, such  as  the  ones
perpetrated against the United States on 11  September  2001.  South  Africa
must join the international community  in  redoubling  its  efforts  to  co-
ordinate its intelligence community and  capabilities  to  protect  citizens
from the threat of international terrorism. This  was  more  than  a  strike
against the United States; it was a calculated and ruthless  attack  against
the democratic and civilised world. These  forces  of  evil,  extremism  and
tyranny will not prevail.

Today, may God comfort and direct the leaders of America,  and  its  people,
in making the difficult decisions that lie ahead. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the New NP and DP I  want  to
convey our sincere condolences to the  government  and  the  people  of  the
United States of America, who have  experienced  their  darkest  hour  since
Pearl Harbour.

As was the case with Pearl Harbour, the attacks on the  World  Trade  Centre
in New York and on the Pentagon  in  Washington  mark  a  turning  point  in
history and herald the beginning of a new world order - a  world  order  not
so much based on ideological grounds, but based on a divide between  nations
that support international terrorism and nations that  reject  international
terrorism in whatever form it may occur, be it a car bomb in  Belfast  or  a
suicide bomber in Jerusalem. In this new  world  order,  terrorism  will  no
longer be allowed to masquerade as a lawful act in a so-called holy or  just
war.

It will be a world order where a nonaligned position will become  untenable,
a world order in which  diplomatic  relations  or  even  friendship  with  a
country that harbours terrorists or exports terrorism will  be  suicidal  in
the economic, diplomatic and military senses. Hopefully  South  Africa  will
end up on the right side of the fence, even if it means that  we  will  have
to say goodbye to many of the  rogue  states  we  are  currently  embracing.

Ons steun die konsepbesluit op die tafel ten volle en  het  genoeg  vertroue
in  die  vermoë  van  Amerika  om  spoedig  en  doeltreffend  teen   hierdie
gewetenlose  moordenaars  en  hulle  handlangers  op  te  tree  sonder   dat
onskuldige mense in die proses  omkom.  [Applous.]  [We  fully  support  the
draft resolution before us and we have sufficient  confidence  in  America's
ability  to  act  promptly  and  effectively  against   these   unscrupulous
murderers and their supporters without innocent people having to die in  the
process. [Applause.]]

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, the terrorist attacks on America in  the  last
two days have been described as horrific, barbaric and cruel.  One  academic
in America, Prof Samuel Huntington, of the  Harvard  school  of  government,
has gone so far as to characterise  these  painful  events  as  a  clash  of
cultures.

The UDM strongly condemns these  insanely  calculated  actions,  which  have
already claimed thousands of innocent lives. We agree with the  widely  held
view that this is not an attack on America alone, but  an  open  declaration
of war on the very principles of democracy, human rights  and  international
law.

Experience  tells  us  that  terrorists  often  take  the  initiative,   and
therefore the US must act with resolve and  caution  and  speedily  identify
the perpetrators and their supporters. Whatever  their  objectives  may  be,
they need to be identified so that a decision can be made on what action  to
take against them.

We must not lose sight of the fact  that  historically,  in  all  conflicts,
round-table discussions lead to enduring solutions. Should the US choose  to
track down the perpetrators and their  sponsors,  our  Government  would  do
well to ascertain that  none  of  the  arms  used  originate  from  our  own
country, lest we be plunged into a  conflict  that  hardly  serves  our  own
interests or the legitimate interests of the international  community,  such
as  a  common  security  for  one  and  all  in  an  atmosphere  of   mutual
understanding and co-operation.

It is indeed sad that these terrorist acts against  America  happened  at  a
time  when  the  international  community  of  states  and   nongovernmental
organisations are characterised by an increasing sense of consensus and  co-
operation on all issues and areas. This growing consensus amongst  different
people for mutual understanding and co-operation on a wide range of  issues,
such as the fight against poverty  and  the  search  for  peaceful  conflict
resolution in  different  regions  of  the  world,  should  be  an  adequate
universal guarantee against all forms of terrorism.
Seven centuries ago a great eastern philosopher said:  ``Beyond  the  issues
of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field.'' So let us meet  there  and
discuss humanity, and common security for one and for all. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, all decent human beings with morals  and  a
conscience around the world have been touched, saddened and even angered  by
the barbaric, devastating and co-ordinated terrorist attacks  on  the  nerve
centres of American defence and finance. What was done to  the  World  Trade
Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington DC is a sad reminder  that
none of us is immune from or can be  insulated  against  terrorist  attacks.
That is why all peace-loving people of the world must denounce,  reject  and
condemn terrorism, especially in the form of suicide attacks.

Those who harbour, sponsor and flirt with international terrorists  must  be
hunted down, isolated and dealt with most severely. To the  American  people
we say: We love you, grieve with you and share your  pain.  We  express  our
heartfelt sympathies and condolences, especially to the many  thousands  who
have lost their loved ones. Our prayers are also with the injured and  their
families and we wish them all a speedy recovery.

Their fellow Christians in the ACDP want to encourage them to be strong  and
not to doubt the  love  of  Christ  during  this  painful  period  of  their
history. The Apostle Paul once asked the Roman Christians a  very  pertinent
question. He asked: Who shall separate  us  from  the  love  of  God?  Shall
tribulation or distress, persecution or peril, sword or even  terrorism?  He
later answered his own question by saying: No, in all these things,  painful
as they may be, we are more than conquerers through Him that loved us.

I would encourage my Americans friends to be strong in the Lord and  in  the
power of His might. They should not give up,  for  all  is  not  lost.  They
should pick up the broken pieces with dignity and resolve and rebuild  their
great country.  We  know  they  can  do  it.  May  this  sad,  unprecedented
experience bring them closer to God in whom they trust. May  God  bless  and
keep our American friends. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker,  after  Tuesday  11  September,  the  United
States will never be the same again. I want to predict that the  world  will
never be the same again. We have become  used  to  airplane  hijackings  and
international terrorism. Sadly,  however,  international  terrorism  reached
its peak in the attacks on Tuesday on the United States of America.  The  FF
condemns these actions in the strongest terms and has already sent a  letter
of condolence to the US government and all  the  innocent  people  who  have
been affected.

One can only guess what the results would have been if these terrorists  had
had access  to  nuclear  weapons.  May  this  never  happen.  This  type  of
terrorism can only be eradicated through a combined  effort  of  all  states
worldwide, including South Africa, as we have already done in  the  case  of
the embassy bombings in Africa.

Die skrywer Shaw se boek Genetic Seeds of Warfare bereken  dat  vrede  slegs
8% van die totale geskrewe geskiedenis  van  die  mensdom  uitmaak.  In  die
afgelope 5 600 jaar was daar 14 500 oorloë. Die mensdom het  daarin  geslaag
om slegs 268 jaar sonder  oorlog  te  wees  in  die  afgelope  3  400  eeue.
Voorwaar 'n slegte rekord. 'n Sinikus het  gesê:  ``War  is  like  love.  It
always finds a way.'' Mag ons dit behoed word in ons leeftyd. Die  VF  steun
die VSA in  hulle  stappe  om  hierdie  terrorisme  en  die  lande  wat  die
terroriste beskerm het, met enige maatreël nodig, so  hard  as  moontlik  te
straf. Ons vra dat dit wel so gedoen mag word, dat dit  nie  sommer  tot  'n
oorlog in die Midde-Ooste kan lei.

Hitler het in die Tweede Wêreldoorlog vir  etlike  maande  lank  vir  Londen
gebombardeer om die Britse moraal te breek. Presies die  teenoorgesteld  het
gebeur. Hy het dit sterker gemaak in pleks daarvan om dit af te  breek.  Dit
is dikwels wat gebeur in gevalle  soos  hierdie  soos  wat  nou  in  Amerika
gesien word. Ekstremistiese politiek het nog  nooit  probleme  opgelos  nie,
maar dit eerder erger gemaak. Mag ons in Suid-Afrika nooit in so 'n  posisie
kom dat eskalerende geweld as die enigste oplossing vir ons probleme  gesien
word nie. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The book Genetic Seeds of Warfare by the writer Shaw calculates that  peace
comprises only 8% of the total written  history  of  humankind.  During  the
past 5 600 years there were 14 500 wars.  Humankind  has  succeeded  in  not
being at war for only 268 years during the past 3 400  centuries.  Indeed  a
poor record. A cynic once said: ``War  is  like  love.  It  always  finds  a
way.'' May we be spared this in our lifetime. The FF  supports  the  USA  in
the steps they are taking to punish this terrorism and  the  countries  that
protected the terrorists as severely as possible by any means necessary.  We
ask that it may in fact be done in this way, so  that  it  cannot  summarily
lead to war in the Middle East.

In World War II Hitler  bombarded  London  for  many  months  to  break  the
British morale. Exactly the opposite happened. He made it  stronger  instead
of breaking it down. This is often what happens in cases such  as  have  now
been seen in America. Extremist politics have  never  solved  problems,  but
rather aggravated them. May we in South Africa never  find  ourselves  in  a
position where escalating violence is regarded as the only solution  to  our
problems. [Applause.]]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, in reaction to the terrorist  attack  in
America, I am obliged to state the following: Some  reports  have  estimated
that about 5 000 to 10 000 have died in the World Trade Centre  attacks.  It
is estimated that 10 000 people worked in each tower and a large  number  of
people were probably at their desks at 8:45.

Preliminary investigations have identified more than a  dozen  hijackers  of
Middle Eastern origin in Tuesday's bombing and gathered evidence links  them
to Osama bin Laden and other networks.

We notice with pride the position our Government has  taken,  together  with
other  local   role-players,   including   the   religious   community,   in
unequivocally condemning such an act of terrorism. I further  urge  them  to
offer comfort and prayer to those affected, recognising that New York is  an
international city made up of people from all over the world  including  the
Middle  East,  Latin  America  and  Africa.   This   type   of   attack   is
indiscriminate and affects people of all nationalities.  I  call  on  people
from around the world to take a stand against the use  of  violence  against
civilians.

Setlhogo se batho ba bolailweng ka sona ga se ise se ke se diragale gope  mo
lefatsheng, mo e reng le fa  batho  ba  ikuela  gore  ba  tlhomogelwe  pelo,

A  Modimo  o  ba  utlwele  botlhoko.  (Translation  of  Setswana  paragraphs
follows.)

[The cruelty  with  which  those  people  were  killed  has  never  happened
anywhere in the world, to the extent that even if the victims were to  plead
for mercy, such a plea would have fallen on deaf ears.

To the Americans we say, everything will be fine. God is great,  and  loving
and will heal them. Even at a time like this, His mercy is upon them.

God will have mercy on them.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the attack on the USA on Tuesday was  possibly
the most vicious  and  heartless  that  the  world  has  seen.  The  age  of
electronic media brings horrific pictures  into  our  homes  to  enable  the
global village to share the pain and trauma inflicted on innocent people  in
their places of work and in their homes.

War is an ugly business that no group can claim  justification  for.  It  is
also savage, primitive, wasteful, expensive and senseless.  We  express  our
condolences to families  on  whom  the  savagery  of  violence  and  war  is
inflicted.

To ensure that more people do not suffer in the same way, we  must  call  on
the leaders of the countries to seriously  challenge  us  to  find  out  why
there are injustices, oppression, racism and selfishness in  our  world.  We
must challenge the United Nations and other forums  such  as  the  OAU,  the
Nonaligned Movement, the Commonwealth  Conference  and  Nato  to  use  their
platforms seriously for  serious  dialogue.  War  is  an  admission  of  the
failure of dialogue.  War  is  unwinnable;  even  the  victor  cannot  claim
victory when thousands of people have died and cannot  be  brought  back  to
life. They have been robbed of their lives forever.

Human  beings  are  basically  sinners.  They  are  not  angels  or  perfect
creatures. The religious leaders must be those who teach us to  repent,  and
to return to God. In the hands of sinful men and women, this world would  be
reduced to ashes, with victims of  violence  being  reduced  to  statistics.
Jeremiah says: ``If we do not repent we will  be  uprooted,  torn  down  and
destroyed, but if we repent we will be saved.''

Martin Luther King Jr wrote, amongst other things:


  To meet hate with retaliatory hate would do  nothing  but  intensify  the
  existence of evil in the universe.  Hate  begets  hate,  violence  begets
  violence, toughness begets even greater violence. We must meet the forces
  of hate with the power of love. We must meet  physical  force  with  soul
  force.

Again, he wrote:

  The choice is no longer between violence and nonviolence. It  is  between
  nonviolence and nonexistence.

The PAC supports this motion.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, the FA has learned with shock and  horror
of the terrorist attacks aimed  at  the  people  of  the  United  States  of
America, the leader of the free world. The barbaric acts  committed  against
innocent civilians, including women and children, must be condemned  in  the
strongest possible terms. It is our fervent wish that these terrorists  will
be apprehended, wherever they might be hiding, and that swift  and  decisive
action will follow against those harbouring these villains.

Our deepest sympathy is extended to the American people, and  especially  to
those who have lost loved ones. We pray that God  will  grant  the  American
leaders the necessary wisdom to  guide  their  people  and  the  free  world
through this difficult time.

Ons moet daarvan kennis neem dat die terreurdade deur individue gepleeg  is,
en dat ons dit nie koppel aan die individu se ras, geloof  of  herkoms  nie,
omdat dit baie maklik die aandag aftrek van die dade van terreur,  wat  deur
alle gelowe en mense verdoem behoort te word.  [Applous.]  [We  should  take
note that the acts of terror were committed by individuals and  that  we  do
not link it to the individual's race, religion  or  ethnic  origin,  because
this could easily distract attention from the acts of terror,  which  should
be condemned by all religions and people. [Applause.]]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, on 11 September 2001 the US  saw  its  worst
day in history. What should have been a normal day in the US began as a  day
of terror. As four planes were hijacked, those innocently headed  for  their
destinations, who were on business, returning home or whatever, fell  victim
to a suicidal statement. As they were flown to their deaths,  as  an  attack
on targeted state buildings, it seems that this  barbarism  was  not  enough
for the perpetrators. The aircraft were  flown  into  state  buildings,  the
World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. Thousands of lives have been taken  and
so many lives destroyed.

The MF grieves at the loss these horrors caused. How many more lives are  to
be taken as a tool to achieve an end?  Does  the  world  only  know  how  to
compromise with the ink of blood, the pain of  pointing  a  finger  and  the
solution of trigger-happy killing? Do we honestly  believe  that  with  such
barbarism we are reaching a solution, or is a veil thrown over  the  reality
that such acts result only in more and more warfare?

The MF shares the determination that these perpetrators should  be  uprooted
and brought to justice with no mercy. The MF sees no justifiable reason  for
their action. The MF believes that a plan of action has to be enforced  now.
Could this mean war? Could this mean the beginning of what has for  so  long
been avoided, or will this matter be dealt with in a circumspect manner?

Many questions plague our minds, but the loss is  a  great  sorrow.  The  MF
shares in the sorrow of the mother who received a phone call  from  her  son
to say that the plane in which he was travelling had been hijacked and  that
he loved her. Is she lucky to have had the chance to speak  to  him  minutes
before he was flown to his death, or was she,  like  many  others  who  fell
victim to this scene of savagery, robbed of her humanity and right to life?

The MF is devastated and expresses its sincere condolences to  the  bereaved
families,  friends  and  loved  ones  of  the  victims  of   this   tragedy.
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, na 11 September 2001 sal die wêreld  nooit
weer dieselfde wees nie; nie net in Amerika nie, maar ook hier in ons land.

Vergun my om vier kort perspektiewe met agb  lede  te  deel.  Die  magtigste
land ter wêreld, 'n land  wat  met  fyn  presisie  'n  missielskild  in  die
buitenste ruim om hom kan bou, word in sy hart geruk deur 'n paar mense  wat
gewapen met knipmesse, 'n gewone passasiersvliegtuig omskep in  'n  dodelike
missiel. 'n Land wat sy vlag op die maan geplant het,  word  gedwing  om  in
die betonstof van Manhattan sy lyke  by  die  duisende  uit  te  grawe.  Die
gebeure van 11 September laat my met die vraag van Psalm  8:  ``Wat  is  die
mens ...?'' Kom ons word klein by hierdie gebeure.

Gister het Adjunkpresident Zuma, na  aanleiding  van  die  Durbankonferensie
gesê  dat  die  wêreld  in  twee  verdeel  is  tussen  die  ontwikkelde   en
ontwikkelende lande. 'n Veel meer wesenlike verdeling is met die gebeure  in
New York voltrek: 'n skeiding tussen die lande van die Vrye  Wêreld  en  die
lande van terrorisme en selfmoordbendes. Dit is  die  verdeling  tussen  die
lig van die beskawing en die duisternis van  die  onderwêreld.  Die  komende
wêreldgebeure gaan hierdie skeidslyn voltrek, net soos Pearl Harbour in  die
veertigs.  Die  kritieke  vraag  is:  Waar  gaan  Suid-Afrika   hom   skaar?
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, after 11 September 2001 the  world  will  never
be the same again; not just in America, but also here in our country.

Allow me to share  four  brief  perspectives  with  hon  members.  The  most
powerful country in the world, a  country  that  has  been  able  with  fine
precision to build a shield of  missiles  around  it  in  outer  space,  was
shaken to the core by a few people armed with pen  knives,  who  transformed
an ordinary passenger  aircraft  into  a  deadly  missile.  A  country  that
planted its flag on the moon is being forced to  dig  thousands  of  corpses
out of the rubble in Manhattan. The events of 11  September  inspire  me  to
ask the question of Psalm 8: ``What is man ... ?'' Let us  humble  ourselves
before these events.

Yesterday  Deputy  President  Zuma  said,  with  reference  to  the   Durban
conference, that the  world  was  divided  into  two  parts,  developed  and
developing countries. A much greater essential division took place with  the
events in New York: a division between the countries of the Free  World  and
the countries of terrorism and suicide gangs. This is the  division  between
the light of civilisation and the darkness of  the  underworld.  The  coming
world events are going to complete this division, just as Pearl Harbour  did
in the forties. The critical question is: On  which  side  is  South  Africa
going to be in?]

Here is my third perspective. The devastation of  Tuesday  was  executed  by
kamikazes, suicide pilots. People are  driven  to  these  extremes  only  by
religious fanaticism. Let the catastrophe of 11 September signal  a  message
to all religious leaders all over the world that there  is  a  delicate  but
vital line between devotion and fanaticism. God definitely does not ask  for
the latter.

'n Laaste flits: skielik lyk Suid-Afrika se probleme nie meer so groot  nie.
Aan ons mense wat so maklik sê: Londen, New York, daar lê  my  toekoms,  wil
ek sê dat hulle weer moet dink, want miskien is daar in die tye wat kom  nie
'n beter plek om te bly as juis Suid-Afrika nie. So baie  hang  af  van  wat
ons  in  hierdie  hoogste  Raadsaal  van  die  land   daarmee   gaan   maak.
Terselfdertyd, terwyl die vliegtuie van verwoesting na die WTC op  pad  was,
het ons in hierdie huis vanuit teenoorgestelde  kante  van  'n  verlede  van
stryd, saam meegevoel betoon met die dood van Govan Mbeki.  Miskien  is  dit
simbolies dat ons uit twee wêrelde op pad is na begrip  en  verdraagsaamheid
en 'n goeie toekoms.

Ons harte en gebede gaan uit na hulle wat so diep getref is. Ons  ondersteun
die mosie ten volle. Mag God ook die volk van  Amerika  ryklik  onderskraag.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[A final thought: Suddenly South Africa's problems do not look so  vast  any
longer. To those of our people who so readily say: London,  New  York,  that
is where my future lies, I  want  to  say  that  they  should  think  again,
because perhaps there is no better place to be  in  the  foreseeable  future
than South Africa. So much depends on what we in  this  highest  Chamber  of
the country are  going  to  do  about  this.  At  the  same  time  that  the
aeroplanes of destruction were on their way to the WTC, we  in  this  House,
from opposite sides of the struggle in the past, were  united  in  conveying
sympathy on the death of Govan Mbeki. Perhaps it is symbolic that  we,  from
two different worlds, are on the way to understanding and  tolerance  and  a
good future.

Our hearts and prayers go out to those who have been affected so deeply.  We
support the motion fully. May  God  also  comfort  the  people  of  America.
[Applause.]]

Mr E I EBRAHIM: Madam Speaker, I was really taken aback by the  DP  and  the
NP, who chose to use  this  tragic  event  to  score  some  cheap  political
points. [Interjections.] They have no  sense  of  occasion  or  nobility  of
spirit. [Interjections.] We wish to apologise to our  American  friends  for
the small-mindedness of the opposition. [Interjections.] The  country  today
should be speaking with one voice on this very tragic event.

The world witnessed a horrific tragedy unfold on  Tuesday,  as  plane  after
plane crashed into very strategic buildings in  the  United  States.  It  is
still not known how many  lives  these  acts  of  terror  claimed,  but  the
estimates speak of thousands. The  devastation  to  a  number  of  important
buildings  in  America's   two   leading   cities   is   unprecedented.   No
compassionate human being could feel anything but abhorrence and disdain  at
those who found it in themselves to commit such a brutal crime.

We join the world, north, south, east and west, in  unreserved  condemnation
of this unprecedented horror attack. In the same vein, we join  the  leaders
of the world, from the United Kingdom and Germany to China and  Japan,  from
Pakistan and Palestine to Jordan and Syria, in extending our most  heartfelt
condolences to the bereaved families of the American people and government.

We all appreciate the assurance, by President Mbeki, that  South  Africa  is
prepared and ready to provide whatever humanitarian aid is requested to  the
American people. We are  assured  that  the  intelligence  agencies  in  the
United States will get to the bottom of the attack, and the perpetrators  of
this heinous crime will be found and will meet with the full  force  of  the
law.

This monstrous event illustrates the interconnectedness  of  the  world.  No
nation can remain isolated or act in a unilateral manner in  world  affairs.
What we need now, is a new world order where no  power,  country  or  people
assumes for itself the authority to dictate, oppress and  exploit,  bomb  or
boycott, invade or discriminate against any other  country  or  people.  The
principle of equality of nations is one we all need to share.

The tragic atrocity committed against the United States must  reaffirm,  for
all of us, the importance of the sanctity of human  life,  whether  this  is
reflected in the senseless and criminal act of murder in the United  States,
or the horrible genocide in Rwanda  which  claimed  the  lives  of  800  000
people, the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, the  cry  of  the  Palestinians
for freedom and justice or  the  violence  in  Sudan,  Algeria,  Angola  and
elsewhere in the world. We must, as world leaders, in our  collective  fight
against the inhuman scourge of  global  terrorism,  open  up  the  doors  of
dialogue and place much greater emphasis on negotiation, political  dialogue
and peaceful  resolution  of  conflict.  The  alternative  is  violence  and
hatred, which beget only more violence and hatred. This is a vicious  circle
that humanity pays for, not in dollars, pounds, francs, yen  or  rands,  but
in precious and innocent lives.

In this period of crisis, grief and anger, we must not be tempted to act  in
an indiscriminate manner. If we do, we run  the  risk  of  stooping  to  the
level of or even lower than, those who, like animals in the wild,  wittingly
slaughter, maim and destroy human life.  We  must,  in  dealing  with  this,
ensure the presumption of innocence until proof of guilt.

Finally, we must implore the United States and Nato to avoid the same  level
of indiscriminate action when meeting out punishment to  the  guilty  party.
The world has certainly seen enough violence against innocent  people,  pain
and suffering among civilians, death and  destruction,  and  enough  is  too
much. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I will convey the contents of the motion to  the  United
States Congress and the people of  the  United  States  on  behalf  of  this
Parliament.

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to.

   TO ACHIEVE A BETTER LIFE FOR ALL, DELIVERY HAS TO IMPROVE AT ALL LEVELS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr P F SMITH: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and  colleagues,  the  IFP
have called for this debate because we  feel  that  the  issue  of  delivery
needs greater exposure in the House, and  also  because  we  feel  there  is
value in  Parliament  expressing  itself  on  the  extent  to  which  it  is
satisfied or otherwise with delivery to date.

As a preliminary comment, I want to say that we view the issue  of  delivery
under three headings, policy, systems and capacity, and all these lie  on  a
single delivery continuum. It is the way they mesh together that  determines
the effectiveness or otherwise of policy.

Policy, of course, is a starting  point,  because  it  determines  in  broad
terms what the Government wants to see in terms of outcomes and outputs.  By
systems we mean the processes and instruments within the  administration  of
Government that are geared towards implementing the policy.  Finally,  there
is the  issue  of  capacity  by  which  we  refer  to  the  ability  of  the
institutions concerned to take the policy through the delivery systems.

Let me start with policy. There is an old computer acronym GIGO which  means
``garbage in, garbage out''. In other words,  the  computer  just  processes
information and if one feeds it the wrong data in the  beginning,  one  will
get the wrong data out at the other side. Much the same,  in  fact,  applies
in respect of policy. Now for each party in this House  the  issue  will  be
different, but certainly there are many  areas  concerning  which  we  as  a
party are dissatisfied with policy at present. I just want to highlight  one
or two of these to indicate the problems that we have with outputs.

The first of these is poverty alleviation, and I am not  referring  here  to
poverty reduction, which is a longer-term  issue.  We  are  alarmed  by  the
extent and intensity of poverty in this  country,  and  we  are  not  really
convinced that the Government has done sufficient or is doing sufficient  to
adopt remedial strategies that are working.

Treasury statistics show, for example, that all the social expenditure -  on
health, education and housing - it is social  assistance,  that  is  grants,
that target the poorest of the poor the best. This strongly suggests  to  us
that a special grant system may well produce far better deliverable  outputs
in respect of poverty alleviation than some of  the  other  well-intentioned
but longer-term programmes intended to reduce poverty.

If one looks at unemployment, our economic growth regularly falls  short  of
the 6% targeted - we have a situation of  jobless  growth,  this  is  deeply
worrying to all of us. And despite every  endeavour  made,  the  problem  is
just simply not improving. Greater boldness, in our view,  is  required.  We
really want to ask whether the Government has a job  creation  strategy,  or
is job creation seen more as a by-product of other  programmes?  We  believe
more attention needs to be paid to options such as public  works  programmes
and to incentivising job creation.

I now come to revenue over-runs. This is Pravin  Gordhan's  tax  collection.
Here again, we really need to have a thorough  debate  because  the  figures
involved are very significant and they could have  a  meaningful  impact  on
deliverable outcomes. Should we use the funds simply to redeem public  debt,
or could we not find a more productive use for some  of  this  money?  Given
our healthy debt ratios, we are of the view that we have  sufficient  leeway
to consider further social investments, and also that a strong case  can  be
made for funding programmes  in  the  line  Ministries  that  are  currently
underfunded, such as Justice and Home Affairs.

The second issue is that of systems. We know  that  Government  initiated  a
massive transformation exercise in 1994. There was  wholesale  rewriting  of
the Statute Book, re-engineering of the  machinery  of  Government  and,  of
course, simply taking over the reins of Government. Along the  way  it  grew
increasingly clear that there was a mismatch between  policy  and  delivery,
and  focus  gradually  shifted  towards  greater  pragmatism   and   greater
implementation.

From a Government perspective, we want  to  say  that  we  acknowledge  that
there have been significant developments in this field over  the  last  year
or two in particular, and that the Public Finance  Management  Act  and  the
public service regulations of 1999 are particularly  crucial  to  this.  The
idea is very simple. For any given line function, the department prepares  a
strategic  plan,  looking  at  outcomes,  outputs   and   service   delivery
indicators. That strategic  plan  feeds  into  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure
Framework, year one of which, of course, is the Budget. The  PFMA  dovetails
a reporting system into this, and one gets  reports,  of  course,  annually,
quarterly and monthly.

Linked to this entire matter is the redesigning of our management  structure
in the  Public  Service.  And  this  traditional  hierarchical  rules-driven
approach is being replaced with the notion of greater  decentralisation  and
greater flexibility  and  embodies  the  slogan:  ``Let  managers  manage.''
Performance contracts for senior managers are all part  of  this,  which  is
intended to result in both greater productivity and accountability  and,  of
course,  delivery.  International  experience  suggests  that  this  is   an
appropriate way to go in terms of improving delivery.
So we do want to acknowledge that much is being done here,  even  though  to
date that is restricted largely to the national and  provincial  spheres  of
Government. Local government is being addressed  separately,  but  we  think
there is progress here and we are on the right track.

The third  issue  is  capacity,  which  is  very  problematic.  There  is  a
widespread perception that there is a severe skills shortage in  the  public
sector - of course this is so in the private sector as well - and that  this
has a direct bearing on the Government's ability to deliver.  In  fact,  the
Minister of Labour back in 1998 expressly said that the  lack  of  skills  -
and I am quoting him - was a more severe problem for service provision  than
was limited finances.

The problem is very acute, of course, in  provincial  administrations,  more
so than in the national administration. This  is  particularly  problematic,
because it is the  provinces  which  are  responsible  for  the  Schedule  4
functions in particular, which are some of the key delivery issues.
The  Auditor-General  has  pointed   out   many   problems   in   provincial
administrations, and, of course,  the  President  himself  has  acknowledged
that the problem is severe. In  fact,  he  talked  about  the  ``failure  of
provincial delivery institutions''.  I  think  this  is  a  problem  we  all
recognise.

It was so bad for him that back in 1999  he  called  for  a  review  of  the
provincial system, and the Premier of the Eastern Cape  has  done  likewise.
But, fortunately, I think it  is  fair  to  say  that  the  worst  of  these
problems are over. The situation has stabilised.  But  capacity  constraints
still remain, and one must add that the ethos and the principles of the  new
management system that is being introduced are simply going to compound  the
problems, because if we lack  capacity  to  operate  in  terms  of  the  old
hierarchical rules-driven approach, the new approach is far more  demanding,
and the capacity constraints are a real concern.

But of the three spheres of government,  clearly  local  government  is  the
most  problematic  here,  largely  because,  of  course,  there   are   vast
disparities in the capacities of municipalities. Some of them, as  we  know,
have budgets far larger than provinces and capacity which is equivalent.

The past decade has seen local government having to  grapple  with  constant
change - a constantly changing political, legislative environment. If  there
is any lesson that we have learnt from this, I think it is fair to say  that
while local government can deliver, it has been very easy in the past -  and
we must caution ourselves against it now - to build  up  false  expectations
of what is possible and what can be  delivered,  especially  in  respect  of
parts of the country where municipal governance, per se, is fairly new.

In respect of these three issues, I want to emphasise that  of  those  three
components - policy, capacity and the  systems  -  we  have  made  the  best
progress in the systems. The systems are there and we can  build  on  those,
and that is going to help immeasurably.

We have severe capacity  constraints,  however,  and  if  we  are  going  to
improve delivery, we really need to expend a lot more  energy  in  improving
capacity. As for policy, well, of course, one can  hardly  expect  unanimity
when it comes to policy issues. We are going to have to beg to  differ  with
one another. But if one looks at the outcomes of a  whole  range  of  policy
issues - we could go way beyond the issues  I  have  raised  here,  that  is
trade and industry, Aids, traditional leadership,  privatisation  -  we  are
not satisfied that the outputs are adequate,  and  thus  the  policy  itself
needs to be reviewed. We would like to feed into a process  to  review  some
of these policy issues.

Finally, I think it is important to stress that  Parliament  itself  has  an
important role to play in  improving  delivery.  For  example,  we  need  to
ensure that  we  pass  legislation  which  is  implementable.  And  part  of
implementation, of course, is the demand on our part that  adequate  funding
goes for these Bills. There is actually no point in us passing Bills  which,
once promulgated, sit on the shelf, or do not even get  promulgated  because
there is no funding. That is a fruitless exercise,  and  we  should  assert,
strongly, a view that adequate funding must go with whatever legislation  we
pass in this House.

Also, I think the committees can play a  far  more  important  role  in  the
strategic  planning  process.  We  always  talk  about  committees   getting
involved in the budget process. But, in a sense, that  is  actually  putting
the cart before the horse. It is far more important, in  some  respects,  to
get involved in the strategic planning process, because that  is  where  one
is looking at the outcomes, that is where one is looking at the outputs  and
the service delivery indicators. Let us get involved in  that  process,  and
the budget will come right by itself.

Also, in scrutinising budgets  in  this  House,  we  need  to  be  far  more
rigorous in scrutinising the linkages between policy and delivery.  We  tend
to view the things separately, instead of seeing the whole thing as a  cycle
and getting involved in scrutinising the cycle per se.
Finally, may I say that in our oversight role we should really be  far  more
involved in monitoring  delivery  expressly.  If  one  takes,  for  example,
simple things like accounting officers' performance contracts, those  should
be  tabled  in  committees.  We  should  be  discussing  those   performance
contracts, because they are meant to be linked to delivery targets.  Let  us
have sight of those. Let us get involved in them. Let  us  get  involved  in
the process, for example by which those contracts  are  evaluated,  because,
in a sense, that is the  top  of  the  delivery  pyramid  -  the  accounting
officers.

I think there is much that we can do as MPs in this House as well. There  is
much that needs to be done to improve delivery. We do not want to  say  that
there has been failure across the board. Of  course,  there  has  not.  That
would be ridiculous. There has been much success. We do want to be  fair  in
acknowledging where we have been  successful,  and  to  hope  that  in  this
debate people can point constructively to  areas  in  which  Government  can
focus greater retention. I think capacity, certainly, is one  of  them,  and
refinement of policies would be another. [Applause.]

Adv S P HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, hon members, the ANC  has  as  its  primary
objective the achievement of a better  life  for  all  South  Africans.  The
successful fight for  freedom  from  racial  oppression  and  for  political
liberation was a means to an end  -  the  attainment  of  true  and  genuine
equality amongst all of our people irrespective of  race.  The  Constitution
itself embodies many of the aspirations which are espoused  by  the  Freedom
Charter.

The Constitution contains within it the instruments which are to be used  to
achieve the goal  of  a  better  life  for  all.  The  major  instrument  is
government itself with its constituent spheres,  departments,  state  organs
and the three levels of governance, namely, national, provincial and  local.
Each of these components must deliver the services required of it for us  to
achieve the goal of a better life for all.

Accordingly, as the ANC we cannot but agree with the suggested  topic:  ``To
achieve a better life for all, delivery has to improve at all  levels.''  As
I have indicated, however, this imperative applies not only to  the  various
levels of government but also to all organs of state, to civil society  and,
importantly, to the economic role-players of our society.

It is an elementary fact that local government is  the  tier  of  government
which is best suited to bring about service delivery compared to  the  other
tiers. Local government is close to  the  people.  National  and  provincial
governments deal more with  policy  formulation  and  law  enactment.  Local
government gives practical meaning to those policies and laws  by  providing
the people with essential services such as water,  electricity,  houses  and
so on.

Another accepted fact is that policies  of  previous  governments  neglected
and marginalised black rural communities.  While  blacks  were  regarded  as
temporary sojourners in the urban areas, and allowed to  stay  only  for  as
long as they served a useful purpose  for  white  South  Africa,  no  decent
systems of governance were devised for effective service delivery  to  rural
black South Africans. Even the indigenous systems of governance in the  form
of traditional authorities were  manipulated  in  a  way  that  came  to  be
increasingly perceived as forcing traditional  leaders  to  serve  apartheid
South Africa more than they did their people.

Fortunately, the damage caused has not been such as  to  completely  destroy
the credibility of the institution of traditional leadership in the eyes  of
the majority of our people. Its roots run too deep into the soil  of  Africa
for anyone to destroy it. The White Paper on traditional  leadership,  whose
formulation is still under way, has no choice but to  give  due  recognition
to the historical fact that effective service delivery to  the  majority  of
our people  requires  the  active  involvement  of  traditional  leaders  in
matters of governance.

Already, partnerships are being established between traditional leaders  and
various state departments such as  Health,  Education,  Social  Development,
Public Works, Safety and Security, Minerals and Energy Affairs  and  so  on.
Provincial governments and local councils actively solicit the support,  co-
operation  and  participation  of  traditional  leaders  as  they  plan  and
implement their programmes for service delivery.

Accordingly, when the law  defining  the  role  of  traditional  leaders  is
finally considered and passed by this Parliament  it  will  be  informed  by
these  practical  life  experiences.  Hon  members  need  to  remember  that
indigenous African constitutions do  not  depend  on  written  documents  to
survive, but are to be found in the spiritual life of the people.  Since  we
are a constitutional state, however, the upcoming law will  be  informed  by
this fact.

Members will also remember that at its last national conference in  Mafikeng
in 1997, the ANC adopted a resolution which entrenched  the  institution  of
traditional  leadership.  The  President   himself   has   repeatedly   told
traditional leaders in the past year that far  from  any  desire  to  weaken
traditional leadership his Government is committed to giving it more  powers
in order to ensure that traditional leaders continue to play the role  which
African history expects of them. The champion  of  the  African  Renaissance
is, after all, the President of our country.

Kaloku mawethu i-ANC ngumbutho wesizwe; yinkundla yomz'  ontsundu  ikakhulu.
Ayikwazi ke ngoko ukuqhuba imicimbi yesizwe ngaphandle kweenkosi.

Abantwana begazi mabangoyiki; mabomelele baqhubele phambili nomsebenzi  wabo
wokuphuhlisa izizwe zabo.  URhulumente  uyazi  ukuba  ulwakhiwo  lweendlela,
ukombelwa  kwemibhobho  yamanzi,  ukumiliselwa  kweepali  zogesi,  ukwakhiwa
kweekliniki  nezikolo,  ukuphuhliswa  kwezolimo,   ukulondolozwa   kwendalo,
ukombiwa kwamatye exabiso, zonke ezi zinto  zidinga  umhlaba,  ezingabagcini
bawo iinkosi.

I-ANC yasekwa ziinkosi namafanankosi.  Phakathi  koomongameli  bayo  kubekho
uMafukuzela Dube,  uAlbert  Luthuli,  uRholihlahla  Mandela,  iZizi,  uThabo
Mbeki. Bonke aba ngabantwana  bakomkhulu.  Abakwazi  ke  ngoko  ukufulathela
iminyanya yabo ngokuthi benze  izinto  ezichasa  ubukhosi.  (Translation  of
Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Hon members, we should remember that the ANC is  a  national  organisation;
it is mainly the black  people's  organisation.  It,  therefore,  could  not
possibly conduct the nation's duties without traditional leaders.

Traditional leaders should not be afraid;  they  should  continue  with  the
task  of  developing  the  people.  The  Government  knows  that  road   the
construction of roads, the installation of  water  pipes,  the  erection  of
electricity  poles,  building   of   clinics   and   schools,   agricultural
development, environmental care and mining, are  all  activities  that  need
the soil which traditional leaders are looking after.

The ANC was established by traditional leaders  and  their  subjects.  Among
their presidents there  was  Mr  Mafukuzela  Dube,  Mr  Albert  Luthuli,  Mr
Rholihlahla Mandela and the man from the Zizi clan, Mr Thabo Mbeki.  All  of
them are from the royal house. They  could  not,  therefore,  abandon  their
ancestors and do things that are in opposition to the royalty.]

We agree, therefore, as the ANC, that for a better life  to  be  enjoyed  by
all, delivery has to take place at all levels, and one of  these  levels  is
the  area  of  operation  of  traditional   authorities.   Parliament   must
accordingly make the necessary resources available to all organs  of  state,
including traditional authorities, for this noble goal to be attained.

Elokugqibela, sele eqalisile amalungiselelo obalo lwabantu. Nalo  olu  balo,
nokuba luqhutywa leliphi na isebe  likaRhulumente,  ukuze  lube  yimpumelelo
phaya emaphandleni kufuneka kubekho intsebenziswano neenkosi.  Abantu  abaza
kusebenza lo msebenzi mabakhe ubudlelwane  nabantwana  abahle,  khon'  ukuze
uRhulumente akwazi ukucwangcisa kakuhle xa elungiselela ukusondeza  iinkonzo
zakhe eluntwini. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Furthermore, preparations for the census are underway. For  the  census  to
be successful, no matter which  Government  department  is  responsible  for
carrying out the  task,  there  has  to  be  co-operation  with  traditional
leaders in the rural areas. People that are going to  do  this  work  should
establish relationships with traditional leaders,  so  that  the  Government
could be able to plan accordingly for effective delivery  and  accessibility
of services.]

As all hon members should know, this is the era  for  unity  in  action  for
change to a better life for all. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I rise to speak  in  support  of  the  motion
before the House. In 1994 the ANC promised a better life  for  all.  What  a
sad failure the succeeding  seven  years  have  become!  What  a  litany  of
mistakes, botch-ups, delays and disasters we have had to  witness!  And  the
only people who have a better life are the  pocket-filling  political  elite
and their pals.

Sometime in the 1960s a small group of hikers was exploring  a  tiny  remote
island in the South Pacific. One day they came across a strange man  sitting
outside a cave high up on the mountainside. He was not one  of  the  locals,
but was a Japanese. He was dressed in military uniform. His rifle was  clean
and at the ready. It turned out that he was part of a Japanese platoon  that
had occupied the island in World War II. When  the  Americans  came  to  the
island, they had killed or captured the whole platoon except  this  one  man
who had fled to the hills. There he had lived off the land, all by  himself,
for 20 years, still faithfully at his post, not knowing  that  the  war  was
long since over.

The ANC remind me of that soldier. They spend most of their time fighting  a
war that finished years ago and which they won. Every time they  speak  they
whinge about apartheid, carp about colonialism and blame the  racists.  They
tinker with the transformer when they should be  tuning  up  the  engine  of
delivery and fulfilling their promises.  And  every  time  they  whinge  and
whine about apartheid they fall into  the  trap  of  perpetuating  the  very
racism they complain about.

The whinging  campaign  they  are  so  bent  on,  however,  has  an  obvious
motivation. It serves as a smokescreen to conceal their  lack  of  delivery.
In fact, a recent survey conducted by the SA Institute  for  Race  Relations
proves that the issue of racism has been grossly hyped up by the  Government
and the media. Most South Africans are more worried about  unemployment  and
crime. Racism is, in fact, only ninth on their list of unresolved problems.

Mr Mbeki, speaking at the opening of Parliament in February,  told  us  that
1,1 million new jobs had been created during the period 1997-1999. Whom  did
he think he was kidding by  quoting  these  selective  statistics  from  the
Statistics SA survey? Surely not the 5,8 million unemployed people.

It is  this  sort  of  head-in-the-sand  denial  that  is  causing  so  much
confusion and lack of direction and delivery in our public life.  With  this
sort of leadership it is hardly surprising that the  Government  has  failed
to deliver on its promise of jobs. In fact, there is so much confusion  that
the letters A, N and C could well be  taken  to  denote  ``African  National
Confusion''. [Interjections.]

The R900 million Umsobomvu Fund, set up three years ago  with  the  proceeds
of Sanlam's and Old Mutual's demutualisation, which was supposed  to  create
jobs for unemployed youth, has not yet been spent. Responding  to  criticism
about the unspent funds,  the  CEO,  Molose  Kekana,  said  that  a  lot  of
confusion had been created because people did not  understand  how  long  it
had taken to get things going. It took a year to appoint him as the CEO.  He
also said that if we do not take baby steps and  put  sound  foundations  in
place, we will have a colossal failure. I suggest he moves a little  quicker
or some of today's babies will be  old  people  before  they  benefit.  Once
again, the plans are in place and so is the money, but so are  the  millions
of unemployed people.

Much has already been said about the escalation of crime since the ANC  took
charge of our safety and security.

Mr B M SOLO: Madam Speaker, is the hon member prepared to take a question?

Mrs G M BORMAN: No, Madam Speaker. Much has  already  been  said  about  the
escalation of crime since the ANC took charge of our  safety  and  security.
We have never been more unsafe and more insecure. We  have  a  Minister  for
this department who huffs and puffs around  like  Thomas  the  Tank  Engine.
[Laughter.]

He finds plots against  the  President  and  thunders  threats  against  the
Portuguese, but he does not catch the criminals. If he  does,  they  are  in
one prison door and out the other. Because of  his  ineffectual  department,
people are emigrating in fear of their lives, tourists are staying away  and
foreign investment is being discouraged from coming  to  South  Africa.  The
result is that our citizens have to pay their taxes for a police  force  and
on top of that they have to pay again for private  security  protection  and
then again for increased insurance premiums. When our  President  was  asked
about the situation in a radio interview, he could only say:  Look  how  bad
things are in Colombia.

Finally, we have the ongoing Aids debacle.  Four  million  people  in  South
Africa are waiting and hoping for some help from  the  Government  that  has
promised so much to them. To Aids sufferers, this  Government  delivers  one
gaffe after another. Recently the Brazilian  government  decided  to  ignore
the  patent  rights  of  the  Roche  drug  company  in  Switzerland  to   an
antiretroviral drug which was being  used  to  combat  Aids.  The  Brazilian
ambassador to Britain, speaking on the BBC, said that out of  200  000  Aids
sufferers in Brazil, 100 000 had been helped by the use of this drug.

By contrast, President Mbeki  has  been  surfing  the  Internet  again,  and
heaven help us! The sad part of all this is that the people  who  hoped  for
so much have had those hopes dashed time and again. Instead  of  action,  we
have had to  listen  to  promises  and  plans,  whinging  and  whining.  The
whinging about race  should  stop  and  be  replaced  with  strong  decisive
actions on jobs, crime and Aids. Let us have delivery. South Africa needs  a
government of winners, not whingers. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, the ANC,  in  its  election  campaign,  promised
houses, jobs and a better life for all. I said  that  that  was  what  South
Africans deserved. Every South African deserves a house, a  job,  access  to
proper health care, good education and a safe environment.

Government has failed dismally in its effort to  deliver  on  its  promises.
What we have seen is job losses; small and inadequate  houses;  lowering  of
health standards; and hospitals becoming  unsafe  places,  where  rats  bite
children and elderly patients are assaulted and neglected.

Thakgalang village would not normally make the  news.  There  are  no  major
tourist attractions and the thousand or so people who  live  there  are  not
famous or influential. In fact they  are  barely  surviving.  Just  ask  Mrs
Elizabeth Monyela, her husband and their  four  children.  They  live  in  a
shack of wood and corrugated iron, cannot find employment  and,  like  other
members of their village, have been without  basic  services  like  drinking
water for more than  two  years.  The  perception  is  that  Government  has
stopped caring about real people and decent South  Africans  are  having  to
turn to extraordinary measures to support  their  own  lives  and  those  of
their families.

Our schools have become centres of frustration  and  not  of  learning.  The
joint  international  Unesco  and  Unicef  Monitoring  Learning  Achievement
Project revealed that six years after  liberation,  25%  of  primary  school
teachers are underqualified and that South African children performed  worst
in Africa in as far as numeracy, literacy and life  skills  were  concerned.
The doors of learning shall be opened for all.

The value of the rand has dropped by 142%  since  the  ANC  came  to  power.
South Africa is only expected to  achieve  a  domestic  economic  growth  of
about 2,5%, when we need at least 7% to address our 40%  unemployment  rate.
We need to grow the economy. The ANC has failed dismally in  addressing  the
needs of the people.

The dismissal by the Minister in the Presidency, Essop Pahad, of the  above-
mentioned survey by the SA Institute of Race Relations is foolish.  This  is
yet another indication of the fact that the ANC Government has totally  lost
touch with reality and the needs of ordinary South Africans.

The recent study by Statistics SA, ``South  African  in  transition'',  also
found that the number of the unemployed  had  increased  by  more  than  77%
during the period 1995 to 1999. This is further proof of  the  magnitude  of
our unemployment problem.

As early as 1998, the Government promised to amend legislation  that  had  a
negative effect on job creation.  Yet  something  significant  is  still  to
materialise, for the structure of South Africa's rigid and overly  regulated
labour environment is left  substantially  intact  by  the  latest  proposed
amendments. What South Africa needs most is bold steps to relax  the  overly
regulated labour environment. This sends a clear message to  investors  that
the South African Government and its alliance  partners  are  serious  about
job creation and making the South African economy succeed.

Instead it is becoming increasingly clear that neither  the  Government  nor
Cosatu have the interest of the unemployed at  heart.  Evidence  to  support
this is overwhelming.  The  economy  has  seen  provincial  actions  against
Government's privatisition early this month and the national  stayaway  that
took place on 29 and 30 August 2001. Ironically,  that  stayaway,  two  days
before the World Conference against Racism in Durban, has  shown  the  world
that South Africa's trade unions are still stuck  in  socialist  ideologies,
although they themselves have taken advantage of  privatisation  to  acquire
stakes in privatised enterprises.

One of the key constraints on growth in the South African economy, as  cited
by most research studies, has been the  lack  of  skills  among  the  labour
force. Yet the disbursement machines  of  the  national  skills  development
strategy or sector education and training authorities,  only  paid  out  R47
million last year, or 3,7% of the R1,25 billion collected for that  purpose.
This is a significant indictment  of  the  lack  of  responsibility  of  the
Department of Labour, for the Setas were touted as important instruments  in
providing  skills  to  the  South  African  workforce  in  order  to  combat
unemployment and the concomitant social problems of South Africa.

Government should take the  lead  in  implementing  a  long-term  vision  of
wealth creation for South Africa and set the example by following  a  strict
fiscal policy, for the persistent rate of unemployment will  only  serve  to
worsen the serious social problems faced in South  African  society,  which,
in turn,  will  further  serve  as  a  disincentive  to  foreign  investors.
[Applause.]

[Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, the UDM supports the sentiments of the  IFP
that are reflected in this motion. We are in agreement with the view of  the
IFP that the renewal and improvement of the quality of life  of  the  people
will only take place through  service  delivery,  from  central  Government,
from the provincial governments, right down to  local  governments,  ie  the
municipalities.]

At national level the ANC-led Government has made some  strides,  especially
in the land reform programmes, electrification of rural  areas  and  passage
of several pieces of legislation mandated by the Constitution.  The  rolling
over  of  funds  not  spent  by  various  Government  departments  from  one
financial year to the other  remains,  however,  a  problem  and  cause  for
concern. The UDM is particularly alarmed at the poor  delivery  and/or  lack
of delivery of services at provincial and local  levels  of  governance.  We
wish to  use  a  statistical  barometer  as  a  performance  measurement  or
assessment.

It is alarming to note, according to Statistics SA, that of the  11  million
households in South Africa in 1999, not less than 61% did not  have  running
tap water. Some 12% of African household relied on flowing  water,  streams,
wells and springs as their water sources. Not  less  than  42%  of  Africans
travelled long distances  of  between  100m  and  2km  to  fetch  water  for
domestic consumption.

Old border industries which created thousands of jobs for  people  who  live
in poverty stricken areas at the periphery are now white elephants,  because
the Government  has  withdrawn  the  industrial  incentives  that  attracted
investors  to  relocate  to  these  isolated   areas.   Municipalities   and
provincial  governments  have   abandoned   the   tarring   of   roads   and
rehabilitation  programmes  in  rural  areas.  It  is  irreconcilable   that
priority  has  been  given  to  urban  areas  which  were   not   previously
disadvantaged by the apartheid regime.

In September 1999 the Minister of Transport said  that  the  Government  was
formulating plans to  develop  better  roads  in  rural  areas  as  part  of
Government's  overall  strategy  of  integrated   rural   development.   The
department has thus far not provided any indication on  how  it  planned  to
make roads better. The nation is waiting for  delivery.  In  September  1999
the department ... [Time expired.]

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN:  Madam  Speaker,  comrades,  hon  members,  the  dream  of
millions and millions of our people was the creation of a  better  life  for
all. That dream stopped being a dream and became a living  reality  for  our
people in 1994 when the ANC was voted into power.  It  was  the  first  step
towards the creation of a better life for all.  In  the  seven  years  since
then, great strides have been made by the ANC-led Government,  and  we  have
seen the lives of millions of our people change, nothing like the stories  I
have just heard now. A solid foundation has been laid  consisting  of  sound
policies and laws. This has, in  turn,  resulted  in  Government  programmes
that have been implemented throughout our land, directly  impacting  on  the
daily lives of our people.

Some sitting here today and others who  may  be  watching  on  TV  say  that
nothing has changed. They complain about a pothole in the road or  a  street
light that does not work. And based on that they do not understand  when  we
as the ANC say that there has been progress and that  the  lives  of  people
have changed or are changing, and will continue to change.

I would like to suggest to the hon Mrs Borman and the  hon  Mr  Durand  that
perhaps they should get up from their desks and  go  out  of  the  gates  of
Parliament into the real world and see what is happening, and speak  to  the
people of this land, and they will tell them. [Applause.]

In just seven short years, millions of people have gained access to  running
water, housing, electricity, health care, land, education and tarred  roads,
amongst other things.

One of the key areas in  creating  a  better  life  for  all  has  been  the
provision of adequate shelter. Over 5 million  people  have  benefited  from
the housing subsidy programme. They live in secure homes on land which  they
own and for which they have received  title  deeds.  Over  300  000  housing
units have been transferred  to  those  who  live  in  them  and  they  have
received title deeds. They own them and this programme is continuing.

Inner-city renewal programmes are taking place  in  which  unused  buildings
are being converted into housing units  and  new  housing  units  are  being
built. The People's Housing Process enables communities to  become  actively
involved in the building and planning of their own homes, resulting  in  the
reduction of  building  costs  and  the  provision  of  bigger  homes.  Many
communities are involved in this programme, including, most notably, women.

The urban renewal programme announced by the President  earlier  this  year,
and which has been started in Alexandra, is intended  to  totally  transform
the area and to improve and, in many cases, provide new  infrastructure.  If
one drives past Alexandra today, one will see this work in progress.

All of the programmes which I have mentioned result in the achievement of  a
better  life  for  all  and  the  visible  delivery  of  infrastructure  and
services. We see new roads, electricity being  supplied  to  homes,  schools
and clinics being built, and water and sewerage facilities  being  supplied,
amongst  other  things.  The  ANC-led  Government   has   also   implemented
programmes to help  communities  become  actively  involved  in  small-scale
businesses such as the growing of vegetables and  the  production  of  eggs.
These programmes are meant to help communities in achieving  a  better  life
for themselves.

The programmes of delivery taking place are in line  with  the  policies  of
the ANC as outlined in its various documents. These are not just  documents,
but are transformed into living reality  which  changes  the  lives  of  our
people. I want in particular to  refer  to  the  Freedom  Charter.  I  would
suggest to members of the opposition that they should  read  this  document.
If they do so, they will notice that we are  putting  in  practice  what  we
have said. It is not only on paper.

The provision of a certain amount of free water and electricity  is  an  ANC
policy. Some in this House seem to think that they came up with the idea  of
providing a certain amount of free water. I  want  to  inform  those  people
that if they think that the ANC-led Government has good policies, then  they
should say they support the Government and will do all they can  to  support
its  successful  implementation.  They  should  not  come  up  with  stories
afterwards of what they thought they have tried to do.

Whilst we have made remarkable achievements, and we  also  acknowledge  that
we need to do more, we also face challenges in  this  nation  as  well:  the
availability of land and  the  cost  of  land.  The  ANC-led  Government  is
committed to finding solutions and implementing policies which will  address
this. Programmes such as the Rapid Land  Release  Programme  are  in  place.
Informal settlements are a reality and we  need  to  continue  to  implement
programmes aimed at the upgrading and eradication  of  informal  settlements
where possible.

We appeal to communities in our country to  work  with  the  Government  and
together help change their areas and their lives in a sustainable manner.  A
critical challenge which has arisen is the issue  of  shack  farming,  which
many landowners have embarked on. They see this as a means of  making  money
quickly without taking into consideration  the  long-term  negative  effects
this will have. They create areas which do not have any basic  services  and
use land which may not be suited for housing. We  appeal  to  landowners  to
think further than their own pockets and  to  help  find  lasting  solutions
rather than creating serious local, social and economic problems.

Landowners often object to housing developments  taking  place.  This  often
leads to delays and causes communities  to  become  frustrated.  Instead,  I
would appeal to landowners to ask how they can  help.  They  should  further
ask what they can do to ensure that this development is sustainable  and  it
takes place.

As public representatives and public servants in this land,  we  should  see
ourselves as servants of the people, with our  primary  objective  being  to
improve the lives of all our people. This should be our driving  motivation.
While the Government has its role to play, which  it  must  play,  there  is
also a role for communities and civil society to play. As a  united  nation,
we must help each person to achieve a better life. As one  people,  we  must
respond to the President's call for unity in action. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, the world is an  imperfect  place,  so  we
must expect South Africa to be an imperfect  society.  This  then  begs  the
question:  How  should  we  then  govern  in  an  imperfect  society?   Good
governance is the remedy to an imperfect society.

This  Government  must  show  commitment  to  get  rid  of  corruption   and
incompetent officials. In order to improve the basic service  needs  of  the
people, Government must demand first-rate quality management from  officials
at the different levels of government, such  as  municipalities,  hospitals,
police and other primary government  functions.  Good  governance  is  about
implementation and, of course, finance is always the major problem  we  face
to implement idealistic policies.

The new local government system has yet to prove that it is able  to  render
effective and efficient service delivery when  most  municipalities  do  not
even have the financial capacity to exist. The underdevelopment  of  health,
safety, housing, security services and  socioeconomic  delivery  initiatives
is a sign of weak  managements  and  weak  systems  that  are  not  able  to
eradicate poverty.

Although there are sound fiscal policies, somehow these are  not  adequately
trickling down to raise the average person's  lifestyle  quality  above  the
poverty line, and this does not set the stage for a stable economy. We  have
an HIV/Aids pandemic that could see the death rate rise  by  20%  per  annum
over the next 10 to 20 years, and yet Government is uncertain  of  its  duty
in this regard.

In order to improve the lives of people Government  must  commit  itself  to
developing the capacities at the various levels of Government and embark  on
a strategic plan to educate people in becoming self-reliant  rather  than  a
total dependency on the state. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Government  has  a  long
way to go if it is to achieve a better life for all, and  this  they  cannot
do all by themselves. They are fortunate that they have willing partners  on
this route in the form of the combined opposition.

Many pieces of legislation passed by  Parliament  are  not  being  enforced,
simply because the planning  was  not  done  well.  Rolls  Royce  pieces  of
legislation like the equality Act are not being enforced because of lack  of
funds. It is surprising that consultants were engaged  to  see  to  it  that
such legislation was passed, because that was demanded by the  Constitution.
Further than that, delivery of the content is not visible.

In October last year the Deputy President  was  at  pains  to  call  on  the
nation to review and revert to acceptable moral behaviour.  But  since  then
we have come across shocking incidents  within  Government.  Large  sums  of
money have been paid to the likes of Coleman Andrews,  yet  people  live  in
abject poverty. When challenged on this Government could only say  that  was
a mistake never to be repeated.

In most parastatals trustees of Government who  have  been  hand-picked  are
sitting with their backs against the wall, struggling to account  for  funds
they misused. Government has to  learn  that  enriching  or  capacitating  a
chosen few does not assist in improving the quality of life of citizens.

There are many measured introduced by Government that  place  people  in  an
invidious  position.  Departments  of  social  welfare  in  almost  all  the
provinces, in their efforts to get rid of ghost pensioners, remove names  of
people from pension rolls, and it takes an eternity to  reinstate  deserving
and legitimate cases. Provincial education departments  advise  teachers  to
retire, and it takes up to six months before  such  teachers  receive  their
monthly pensions. The failure to pay  pensions  to  deserving  people  is  a
failure to deliver, and that cannot make anybody's life better.

The current stand-off between Government and the public servants is  another
case in point. It borders on insensitivity on the  part  of  a  Minister  of
state to go on television and say public servants can resign  and  go  where
they will find jobs. What exacerbates the whole issue is  when  a  court  of
law vindicates the strikers.
Government should expect that if they pay peanuts  they  will  have  monkeys
who delight in playing in the streets with no delivery whatsoever.  As  much
as the Government wants to  give  a  better  life  to  people,  they  should
deliver better services. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC  supports  the  IFP's  timely  motion
which reads:


  To achieve a better life for all, delivery has to improve at all levels.

Failing to deliver is to achieve a bitter life. It is to perpetuate the  two
nations of haves and have-nots.

The PAC holds that the provision of  social  services  in  this  country  is
unequal. The Government must seek to distribute social  services  equitably.
It must use the distribution of social  services  as  part  of  the  broader
strategy  to  share  resources  and  social  services  in  a  just   manner.
[Interjections.] Without this, there can be no talk of delivery.
The African population in South Africa constitutes 77,6%. Over  ten  million
of this section live in filthy shacks fit for pigs. Forty-four per  cent  of
this population is unemployed. This population has fewer  opportunities  for
education and the acquisition of technical skills. It is a population  which
is landless, poor and victim to diseases. It is a population which  has  the
highest infant mortality rate and the shortest life expectancy.

Ironically, this is the population that was being  liberated.  It  bore  the
brunt of the struggle against colonialism and  apartheid.  It  is  now  fast
becoming a population of third-class citizens, who do not even have a  place
to sleep and are threatened  with  arrest  if  they  demand  to  be  put  in
possession  of  the  land  of  their  ancestors,   seized   through   brutal
colonialism. [Interjections.]

In many parts of this country, especially in  the  rural  areas,  roads  are
atrocious and health institutions have no medicines and  ambulances.  School
children are very deprived. Many schools have no laboratories or  libraries.
Many rural areas are still without  clean  water.  They  are  infected  with
cholera. [Interjections.] The laws of the country protect  the  rich  rather
than the poor, and worship the demigod of eurocentricity. [Time expired.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ:  Madam  Speaker,  for  a  party  which  is  serious  about
delivery,  I  want  you  to  look  at  the   empty   seats   of   the   ANC.
[Interjections.] What I find  interesting  about  the  motion  is  that  IFP
member Smith is itchy about service delivery by the Government of  which  he
is a coalition partner. [Interjections.] However, I find  myself  supporting
Madam Speaker, who is reported in Rapport of 26  August  as  saying,  and  I
quote:


  Die Parlement het sedert 1999 agteruitgegaan, en  is  ná  1994  nie  meer
  dieselfde  plek  as  voor  daardie  tyd  nie.  Die   swak   bywoning   is
  kommerwekkend.

Is member Madikizela-Mandela in the House? [Interjections.] Is member  Smith
here?  This  means  a  deterioration  since  Mr  Mandela   and   a   further
deterioration since Mr Mbeki.  [Interjections.]  If  member  Smith  and  the
Speaker have doubts about their ruling parties, who am I to argue  with  the
two of them? I have only been back for six months. I was  here  before  1994
and I agree with both of them - it has deteriorated.

But, unlike the Speaker, I am more concerned  about  the  Government's  poor
service delivery than Parliament's performance. Let  me  quote  one  example
from the Department of Safety and  Security,  seeing  that  we  are  talking
about a better life. [Interjections.]

The front page of the Boksburg Advertiser of 31 August shows the  bodies  of
three people burnt to death, and states ``seven  murdered  in  one  week  in
Boksburg'', with a full-page photograph of the burnt  bodies  of  the  three
security  guards  who  were  abducted  and  shot  dead.   Turnkey   Facility
Management employed them. Aluminium valued at R100,000  and  a  Toyota  were
stolen. That is the price of the three lives.  The  other  deaths  are  also
robbery related and involve shop owners and  security  guards.  Because  the
Government cannot deliver, South Africans have  to  employ  security  guards
who lose their lives. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the Constitution of the  Republic  of  South
Africa, 1996, reigns supreme. Its preamble advocates a mission to  institute
a better life for all.

We have united in this task. Positions, tools and plans  are  all  in  place
and the engines are running. We have  come  a  long  way  since  1994.  Many
efforts and long hours of work have resulted  in  success,  and  sadly  some
efforts have not, but the road does not end here. Planning,  reparation  and
determination push us forward to achieve our ends.

A  rainbow  nation  we  are  called,  and  among  all  our  diversities  are
encapsulated an abundance of talent and strength.  The  MF  finds  that  our
success is rich in this. The MF feels that however rich we may be  in  these
abilities and our ability to enforce our plans and deliver the outcome,  the
end is crucial. To achieve this better life for all it is not our  potential
ability to attain these ends that leads to success, but  rather  our  actual
ability  to  utilise  that  potential,  and  utilise  it   efficiently   and
effectively.

The MF also realises that  this  effectiveness  and  efficiency  are  hardly
attained as an individual effort  but  through  working  together.  Renowned
success as a united group effort is the key. We have embarked upon a  better
life for all in our Constitution. We have  drawn  up  plans  and  instituted
some of them to achieve a successful delivery, and regarding those that  are
not so successful the MF suggests that we put our heads together to  achieve
a means to overcome our problems.

The MF agrees that a cleanup has to be done at all  levels  to  improve  our
output, to assure our success at delivery and,  even  more  importantly,  to
ensure that we uphold our Constitution in its ambition to  ensure  a  better
life for all. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, there are two crucial phrases in  our  topic  of
discussion which must be described a little bit more. The first one  is  the
word ``delivery''. When speaking about delivery one  might  be  intended  to
visualise Father Christmas with his bag full of presents  and  sliding  down
the chimney to deliver those presents. When asked about how  he  filled  his
bag, one may think about Robin Hood taking from the rich and giving  to  the
poor. And, who is Father Christmas - of  course,  President  Mbeki.  Who  is
Robin Hood - Minister Trevor Manuel.

That is not what delivery means, at least, not  sustainable  delivery.  When
it comes to the function of Government,  it  is  not  about  hand-outs,  but
policies that create an environment for growth, and facilitating  the  human
and material resources of South Africa in such a  way  that  they  create  a
better life for all.

That brings us to the second phrase, `` a better  life  for  all''.  Surely,
this includes every South African, community, and group. And a better  life,
yes, relates to material things such as houses, jobs  and  health  services.
Members should make no mistake, the AEB supports every sound and  reasonable
measure to uplift the material situation of the poor, irrespective of  race,
colour or creed. Poverty must be combated seriously.

However, this better life also includes things like  values,  real  freedom,
safety, relations, uplifting of the moral  fibre  of  our  people,  and  not
being marginalised as an individual or  as  a  community.  It  includes  the
protection and promotion of what is  dear  to  a  person  in  the  field  of
culture,  language  and  religion;  combating  the   perception   of   being
disenfranchised as a community; and being allowed to  deliver  one's  speech
without being interrupted.

Lastly, this better life and delivery is  not  the  sole  responsibility  of
Government alone. It is a state of mind of a whole population.  It  involves
the  responsibility  of  community   leaders,   educators,   employers   and
employees. It implies an open hand and heart for the poor. South Africa  has
enough resources. The name of the game is not the redistribution  of  wealth
but the creation of wealth. [Time expired.]

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Madam Speaker, hon  members  and  distinguished  guests,  I
would like to invite the opposition to listen or hearken  to  the  words  of
wisdom.

It is opportune for me to join in the debate on behalf of the ANC, the  only
agent for change. The subject matter, today, should  be  understood  in  the
context of the ANC manifesto which talks about  accelerating  change  for  a
better life for all.

For us, in the ANC, it is about the  mandate  that  the  majority  of  South
Africans gave us in the 1994, 1999 and 2000 elections - ``together  fighting
for change''. The subject matter should also be understood  in  the  context
of Chapter  3  of  the  Constitution,  which  deals  with  intergovernmental
relations. Our present ANC Government is faced  with  backlogs  that  are  a
result of the apartheid  legacy.  Government  programmes  on  infrastructure
service delivery are hampered by bad planning and poor  infrastructure  that
is expensive to replace.

To  remedy  the  problem  created  by  the  apartheid  system,  the  ANC-led
Government has clustered the departments in order to  maximise  the  outputs
in service delivery. This integrated approach, which  focuses  on  delivery,
is also reflected in the financial budgeting and accountability  systems  in
the legislative framework,  especially  at  local  government  level,  where
service delivery is most practical and can be measured.

The integrated development planning approach to development is  one  measure
that best demonstrates  the  commitment  of  this  Government  to  improving
delivery at all levels and spheres of Government. The IDP processes are,  in
essence, instruments whereby the people shape and inform  delivery  policies
and budgets from below.

The IDP process  itself  has  been  structured  to  facilitate  co-operative
governance.  The  process  requires  provinces  to  provide  frameworks  for
municipalities to draw up their plans for  a  better  co-ordinated  planning
process. The Department of Provincial  and  Local  Government  is  currently
studying the IDP of different  communities  with  a  view  to  advising  the
Treasury about issues that come  from  communities  in  order  to  give  the
budget a meaning from below.

I must say that it has never happened in  the  history  of  mankind  that  a
government which is led by victims of oppression,  humiliation,  degradation
and discrimination, let alone marginalisation, can, within a short space  of
time and with limited resources,  progressively  deliver  so  much  to  many
millions of its population. The achievements by  this  Government,  so  far,
include: the realignment of municipal wards aimed at consolidating the  fair
distribution  of  resources  in  the  country;  institutionalising,  through
legislation, community participation in the planning, budgeting and  service
delivery processes; and putting in place robust measures  of  accountability
to fight corruption in the public sector. All these are in the  interest  of
improving service delivery at all levels of Government.

As said before, the delivery sphere is that  of  local  government.  It  has
undoubtedly been a remarkable achievement to put in place the new system  of
local government. The implementation of the new system of  local  government
is also a big challenge to Government at  all  levels  as  well  as  to  the
entire civil  society.  For  Government,  the  challenge  is  to  build  the
capacity and allocate adequate resources to the sphere of sound delivery  at
all levels of Government and society. The challenge for this  civil  society
is to participate actively in the process that affects their lives.

We are challenged, as politicians  from  the  national  Government  down  to
councillor level, to monitor the capacity and progress at this  level.  This
should be in the core of our constituency work. As  members  of  Parliament,
jointly with councillors and provincial governments, we need  to  facilitate
the emulation by municipalities of  what  other  municipalities  are  doing,
like the Sedibeng  District  Municipality  in  Gauteng  South,  where  I  am
deployed, towards assessing the progress with the new system  for  improving
service delivery at all levels of Government.

This is the approach that  can  give  guidance  on  how  we  facilitate  the
implementation of the integrated development planning  strategies  that  the
President outlined in  this  House  at  the  beginning  of  this  year.  The
Department of Provincial and Local Government has so far trained  more  than
7 000 councillors for the effective implementation  of  the  new  system  of
local government. Community members are also taken on  board  to  facilitate
community-municipality partnerships during the service delivery process.  It
would be advisable for all politicians at different levels of government  to
be exposed to some of the training around the new system.

Could the opposition please take note that it  is  through  the  progressive
policies of the  ANC  that  the  majority  of  the  people  in  our  country
experience and are willing to contribute to the process  of  change.  It  is
through the ANC's policies that people unite in action for change. It is  as
a result of the ANC's position as agents for change that the  lives  of  the
people should change for the better. It is  not  by  being  agents  for  the
media that one would contribute to a better life for all.

It is through the ANC's  pursuit  of  qualitative,  sustainable  change  and
development that the issue of the institution of traditional  leadership  is
being addressed in a holistic approach. We all hope that as the  Government,
we are nearing the finalisation of the process of defining the role  of  the
institution of traditional leaders in relation to the new  system  of  local
government,  without   undermining   their   current   obligations   towards
development and co-operative governance.

In conclusion, the census scheduled for October is critical to  facilitating
the efficient provision of service delivery.

Ndiza kulandela emva kwenkosi, uZanemvula. URhulumente wenza isicelo  sokuba
abantu  beze  ngaphambili  kolu  balo  lwabantu  luzayo.  Oku  kubalulekile,
ngakumbi kuhlahlo lwabiwo-mali kunye nokuziswa kweenkonzo kuluntu luphela.

Olu balo lwabantu  lufika  ngexesha  elibalulekileyo  lokusekwa  koomasipala
abatsha.  SinguRhulumente  silungiselela   ukuba   oomasipala   babe   nakho
ukufikelela nokufikeleleka kuluntu lonke. Ngoko ke iza kunceda  into  yokuba
sisebenzisane namagosa ukuncedisana noRhulumente kolu  balo.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[I will add to what was said by the  chief,  Zanemvula.  The  Government  is
calling on all the people to come forward so that they can be counted.  This
is important for the budget and service delivery to all the people.

This census has come at a  very  critical  time,  that  of  formulating  new
municipalities. We, as the Government, are preparing for the  municipalities
to be accessible to everybody. Therefore, it will be  important  for  us  to
work together with the officials and assist the Government with the  census.
[Applause.]]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE:  Madam  Speaker,  on  the  whole,  the  debate  has  been
focused, except, of course, for a few hysterical voices.  Of  course,  there
are some people with whom one should never argue  because,  as  the  warning
goes, they might not see the difference.

Service delivery, as my colleague hon  member  Peter  Smith  has  indicated,
goes beyond just providing statistics, which are  often  used  either  as  a
stick with which  to  beat  the  Government  for  the  perceived  or  actual
nondelivery of services - I think this is what some parties  have  attempted
to do - or as a defensive weapon by the Government to prove its delivery  of
services.

A closer look at and beyond the figures raises a number  of  questions  that
are central to service delivery. Firstly, to what extent will  the  services
be sustained? Will  the  poor  be  able  to  pay  for  services  in  future?
Secondly, who are the  beneficiaries  of  the  services  and  how  are  they
selected? Thirdly, to what extent do the  delivery  mechanisms  empower  the
poor?

To  be  meaningful  at  all,  service  delivery  must  bring  together  both
qualitative and quantitative analyses. We are now nearing  the  end  of  the
second quarter of the fiscal year. One therefore  has  to  ask  whether  the
Government, at all levels, is managing to deliver. The release  of  spending
figures for the first quarter of the fiscal year does in fact show that  the
Government is spending its budget very slowly. The most familiar reason  for
this low spending and nondelivery is capacity constraints, as  my  colleague
has pointed out.

We are aware of the Government's intentions to draw  in  skilled  people  by
paying them well, but what programmes are in place to empower the  poor  and
the previously disadvantaged? Some roll-overs in provincial  departments  of
education, for instance, have been as a result of the incapacity  of  school
governing bodies in budgeting  processes.  These  school  governing  bodies,
especially those from  the  previously  disadvantaged  areas,  are  expected
through funding norms and standard requirements to administer a  variety  of
privileges for which they have no skills.

We want to argue, therefore, that some of Government's  delivery  mechanisms
are of a questionable nature. They may  be  suitable  for  the  First  World
environment, but are definitely out of step with undeveloped  or  developing
communities,  such  as  our  rural  communities.  It   is   important   that
development, in the form of service delivery, is tailored  to  the  existing
bloc of our society; in other words, features of the existing communities  -
their defining characteristics - must be respected.

We sincerely believe that progress in service delivery can  be  achieved  in
rural areas through the evolution of existing structures.  Why  is  it  that
sometimes we appear very eager to bypass,  and  even  to  transform  out  of
existence, the existing structures? Each time we do this,  delivery  to  the
poorest of the poor suffers tremendously. A better life for all? Yes, we  do
not doubt the Government's commitment to  this  objective  which  has  given
hope  to  millions  of  our  people.  We,  however,  wish  to  question  the
missionary zeal which has manifested itself in some departments and  certain
individuals.

Service delivery has  sometimes  been  muddied  by  the  desire  of  certain
departments and individuals  to  want,  simultaneously,  to  make  political
proselytes out of the recipients of  delivery  projects.  In  the  classical
missionary type of delivery one either converts to the  missionary's  church
and one gets help, or gets nothing. In this sense, service delivery  can  be
very dehumanising, indeed, to the recipient of  that  delivery  project.  Is
this what we want? I hope not. When we call for transformation, we  are  not
calling for structural transformation only, but  we  are  also  calling  for
attitudinal transformation.

One may well imagine that somewhere there is a huge  pile  of  projects  and
plans gathering dust, while the bureaucrats drag their feet.  We  must  know
that our civil service is a mixed bag. In that bag are those  officials  who
are already suffering from professional burnout and they are in a  rut.  One
cannot expect any service delivery from that lot. Also  in  that  mixed  bag
are those officials who have never developed any work ethic. Sheer  laziness
is their lot. The third type in the  bag  are  the  dedicated  officials  on
whose shoulders effective delivery rests.  Of  course,  we,  as  members  of
Parliament, belong in one of these mixes.

I remember very vividly the words which my leader,  Dr  Buthelezi,  used  to
exhort members of the party to  change  their  attitudes  towards  work.  He
said, and I quote:


  Work is not work when you knock off at  a  predetermined  time.  That  is
  entertainment. Work is work when you go on working until it hurts.

Work contains in it an element  of  sacrifice.  Evidently,  some  have  been
entertaining  themselves  for  most  of   their   lives.   [Time   expired.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker,  hon  members,
ladies and gentlemen, before I start I think it is important to  share  with
you one of the brief stories by a member of the parliament  of  Uganda,  the
hon Grace. During a conference held in Bonn, Germany last  week  to  discuss
food security and how we should deal with issues of hunger  and  poverty  in
the world, she said something very interesting. As part of that debate,  the
trends and scenarios were looking at what is going to happen in  sub-Saharan
Africa, East Asia and South America as well as  in  Europe  and  the  United
States of America in the coming years. Clearly, the  picture  portrayed  was
one of gloom and pessimism because there  is  difficulty  as  to  what  will
happen in sub-Saharan Africa in the coming years. But what was puzzling  was
the fact that when we asked what the basis was of the  analysis  which  came
up with such results we could not find an answer.

Grace then made a very interesting observation. She asked us all to  imagine
a triangle, which, as we know, is very thin at the top and  broader  at  the
base, and imagine the few who are at the top and are rich  and  comfortable,
the majority who are poor and are at the base, and those who are trying  and
are in between and living comfortably. She said if one  remained  with  that
bulk growing, those at the bottom would try to go  up  so  that  they  could
become the rich. If they were blocked, on  the  one  hand,  they  would  try
another route to go up to the apex of the triangle. She said at the  end  if
nothing happened, they would find ways and means to go and live at the top.

For me this was a lesson that indeed if we are not able to  deal  with  some
of the challenges of our past we will not be able to  change  the  situation
or the lot of our poor. But clearly again, it reminded me that  while  there
may have been the few in the past apartheid society who  lived  comfortably,
those of us who are in the majority, who were poor, have  actually  come  to
their world, and that is why the situation has changed.  What  it  means  is
that all of us in the middle are trying to move  up  from  the  bottom,  but
definitely very few are remaining at the top. If  nothing  further  changes,
those who are at the top will come down.

I am saying this because of  the  intervention  made  by  some  of  the  hon
members, particularly the hon member Borman of  the  DP.  In  my  view,  her
response clearly showed that indeed the situation has changed for the  worse
for her because she has never known the bad. A number of us  here  who  have
known the challenges of poverty are seeing the difference.

I would like to thank hon Smith very much for  bringing  this  topic  before
the House today. The way in which he and the hon  Mpontshane  in  particular
have participated in the debate has shown that he did  not  just  bring  the
debate for the sake of debate  but  he  wanted  to  highlight  some  of  the
challenges that face all of us as Government. I would  also  like  to  thank
hon Aucamp for the way in which he highlighted  the  fact  that  indeed  any
sustainable development will not need a Father Christmas or  a  Robin  Hood,
but will need all of us.

One of the things that other members in the debate, particularly those  from
the opposition, missed was the last part of the topic, which  says  delivery
must happen at all levels. It did not say ``at National government  level''.
Interestingly, three parties that sit in  this  House,  even  those  in  the
minority, but who wish  a  responsibility  either  at  local  or  provincial
government level, are all in it. I had hoped that in the  way  in  which  we
examine and assess where we are we  would  take  collective  responsibility,
because it is not just the ANC-led Government, but all of us  who  have  the
responsibility  of  governing  either  at  provincial  or  at  local  level.
[Interjections.]

Dr A S NKOMO: Go jwalo! [That is true!]

The MINISTER: It is this spirit from the  IFP  that  was  very  interesting,
because as they were examining the debate they were not  apportioning  blame
unnecessarily, but they were saying there is a need to  refine  and  retune;
there is a need to do more than we have done. I also want to  thank  members
of the ANC very much indeed for  also  participating  in  the  debate  in  a
manner that does not seek to defend, but states the facts  and  acknowledges
that more still needs to be done.

Following the last speaker on this debate it is very clear that  indeed  all
of us in this Assembly need to remind ourselves of where we come from  as  a
country and as a nation.  Clearly,  today's  discussion  should  be  located
within  the  proper  political  context  with  regard  to  the  history   of
development in South Africa. For many years we were a  country  divided  not
only by race or class, but also on the basis of when development would  come
to whom.

Uma  wawungesiyo  ingxenye  yalabo  bantu  ababebaliwe,   bekhethiwe   futhi
beyidlanzana elimhlophe, kwakungasho ukuthi uyingxenye yomphakathi.  Kwakuya
nokuthi labo abaphethe  uma  becabanga  ukuthi  bazokusiza  ngabe  ubaluleke
kangakanani kubona. Ngakho kwakungasho ukuthi unesidingo esingakanani  ukuze
ukwazi ukulekelelwa kodwa kwakuya ngokwebala nangezinga okulo.  (Translation
of Zulu paragraph follows.)
[If you were not part of  the  few  white  people  who  were  mentioned  and
elected, it meant that you were not part of the community. It also  depended
on how important you were to those who could help you.  To  get  assistance,
it all depended on a person's colour and social status,  not  on  how  needy
that person was.]

In essence, poverty itself was  institutionalised.  Through  policy,  social
spending  was  divided  according  to  the  social  stratification  of   the
apartheid system. Therefore, in our discussion and  in  the  measurement  of
the miles we have travelled, we  should  not  forget  the  enormity  of  the
problem we have had to deal with.

Some of us started to feel human and have dignity only in  1994.  So  it  is
not surprising that to some this change was just a change of format and  was
not very drastic, and therefore for them it was  still  business  as  usual.
For some of us it has not been like that, but has been the beginning  and  a
tough challenge.

In adopting the Reconstruction and Development Programme we, as the ANC,  as
well as this august House, were conscious that ours would not be easy  task,
but one  that  needed  to  be  done  nonetheless.  Former  President  Nelson
Mandela, in his inaugural address to this House, in May  1994,  captured  it
very correctly when he said, and I quote:


  My Government's commitment to create a people-centred society of  liberty
  binds us to the pursuit of the goals of freedom from want,  freedom  from
  hunger, freedom from deprivation, freedom from  ignorance,  freedom  from
  suppression and freedom from fear. These freedoms are fundamental to  the
  guarantee of human dignity. They will therefore constitute  part  of  the
  centrepiece of what this Government will seek to achieve, the focal point
  on which our attention will continuously be focused.

The Reconstruction and Development Programme,  therefore,  was  a  framework
according to which this Government had to build a new society.  I  am  happy
to say that the journey we have travelled so far confirms that this  ANC-led
Government has lived up to its challenge, conscious,  of  course,  that  the
journey has not come to an end.

In meeting the basic needs of our people, we have  given  shelter  to  those
who were homeless and hope to those that are still waiting, that their  turn
will come. We have given land back to  those  people  who  were  victims  of
forced removals and the betterment scheme of the  apartheid  government.  We
have given water and health  to  the  rural  communities.  We  have  brought
access to health to many who never dreamt that one day their  village  would
have a clinic.

We have also understood that in  order  to  deal  with  the  legacy  of  our
painful past, more had to  be  done,  not  just  in  terms  of  delivery  of
services, transformation and building of the economy, but also in  terms  of
democratising the state  and  society.  The  transformation  of  our  public
institutions and the building of a public service corps  that  is  conscious
of its role are some of the deliverables that we have had to undertake.
I must say that the intervention of the  IFP  around  this  matter  is  very
correct. Because unless we  have  capacity  at  that  level,  whatever  good
legislation or policies we pass in this  Parliament  will  come  to  nought.
Delivery has  to  occur  at  all  levels.  The  principle  of  participatory
democracy that we  have  created  in  part  acknowledges  the  role  of  co-
operative  governance.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  devolution  of
responsibility to the various spheres  was  done  in  such  a  way  that  it
allowed for independence and  interdependence  in  implementing  policy  and
programmes. However, we continue to have a challenge in this area, which  we
will continue to have to work at, not just as the ANC, but  as  all  parties
in this House.

It is clear that the task of fundamental transformation of  our  society  at
all levels is an enormous challenge. It will require that at  a  given  time
we deal with issues of  development  as  a  collective,  not  as  individual
parties, relevant  to  our  call  as  the  ANC,  for  unity  in  action.  In
attempting to deal with the challenges that we still  continue  to  face,  I
must say that the challenge of nation-building, eradication of  poverty  and
hunger, building a nonracial and nonsexist society, as well as dealing  with
issues of illiteracy and building our economy, are matters which we  as  the
ANC will continue with until all of our people have achieved a better  life.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 16:17.
