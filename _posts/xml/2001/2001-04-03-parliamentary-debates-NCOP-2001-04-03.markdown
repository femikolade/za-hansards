                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Legislature ended the current
         financial year with savings of R270 million, thus making the
         kingdom province debt-free;


  (2) further notes with satisfaction and approbation that such a healthy
         financial state was possible as a result of the Ministry of
         Finance, under the able stewardship of MEC Peter Miller, having
         complied with the Public Finance Management Act;


  (3) conveys the plaudits of the National Council of Provinces to the
         Minister and his erstwhile team of Treasury officials; and


  (4) challenges other provinces who may be in the red to follow suit.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, at the next sitting of the Council I will move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  all major political parties in the Sudan have committed
           themselves, in writing, through the Declaration of Principles
           and other declarations and instruments, to resolution of the
           conflict between north and south, by self-determination for the
           people of southern Sudan, exercised through a referendum;


       (b)  the Sudanese churches have set out their position in various
           fora;


       (c)  the Sudanese churches fully endorse the right of the southern
           Sudanese to decide their own future; and


       (d)  the referendum must be preceded by a comprehensive ceasefire,
           must be free and fair, must be totally transparent with
           international supervision and must include all options (which
           currently include unity, separation, federation and
           confederation);


  (2) therefore calls on the ecumenical movement, the Sudanese parties and
       all peace-loving peoples and nations to -


       (a)  support self-determination for the people of southern Sudan;


       (b)  thereby bring just and lasting peace to the conflict which has
           continued for nearly 50 years; and


       (c)  in the same way allow the other marginalised groups to exercise
           their right of self-determination; and


  (3) further calls on the South African Government to support the position
       of the Sudanese churches and all the political parties to give force
       and effect to their undertakings on self-determination for the
       Southern Sudan.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek by die
volgende sitting van die Raad gaan voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met skok en afgryse kennis neem van die vermelde omstandighede waarin
         baie bejaardes van die Noord-Kaap verkeer;


  (2) se besorgdheid spruit uit ondersoeke wat verlede jaar in Kimberley en
         Upington gedoen is, waarin bevind is dat -


         (a)     ongeveer 60% van pensioenarisse geld aan mikro-leners
                skuld en tussen 30% en 40% rente per maand moet betaal;


         (b)     talle uitbetaalpunte nie water, toilette, beskutting of
                stoele het vir die bejaardes wat ure lank in lang toue moet
                staan nie;


         (c)     omstandighede by veral Warrenton, Barkly-Wes, haglik is;


         (d)     finansiële misbruik plaasvind deurdat kinders hulle ouers
                forseer om afstand te doen van hulle pensioen en
                pensioenarisse selfs aangerand is deur familielede;


         (e)     Katowa Coetzee (85) van Upington haar gereeld in
                familiegevegte bevind waar sy geviktimiseer word om vir
                hulle drank met haar pensioengeld te koop; en


         (f)     talle bejaarde mense in die Upington-gebied verwaarloos
                word - 'n dame van 72 jaar is gevind nadat sy vir drie dae
                alleen gelaat is; sy was gedehidreer en vuil;


  (3) daarvan kennis neem dat ek self besoek by die Raaswater-nedersetting
       naby Upington afgelê het waar die woord ``godverlate'' vir die eerste
       keer werklik betekenis gekry het; en


  (4) versoek dat hierdie saak ernstig benader word om 'n verskil te help
       maak in die lewens van hierdie vaders en moeders van ons.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock and abhorrence the reported conditions in which many
       of the elderly in the Northern Cape find themselves;


  (2) has misgivings arising out of investigations conducted in Kimberley
       and Upington last year in which it was found that -


       (a)  approximately 60% of pensioners owe money to micro lenders and
           are having to pay between 30% and 40% interest per month;


       (b)  many payout points have no water, toilets, shelter or chairs for
           the elderly, who have to stand for hours in long queues;


       (c)  conditions at Warrenton, Barkly West, are particularly critical;


       (d)  financial abuse is taking place as children are forcing their
           parents to part with their pensions and pensioners even have
           been assaulted by family members;


       (e)  Katowa Coetzee (85) regularly finds herself in family fights
           when she is victimised into buying them liquor with her pension
           money; and


       (f)  many of the elderly in the Upington area are neglected - a lady
           of 72 was found after she had been left alone for three days;
           she was dehydrated and dirty;


  (3) notes that I myself visited the Raaswater settlement near Upington,
       where the word "godforsaken" for the first time truly took on
       meaning; and


  (4) requests that this issue be dealt with in all seriousness so as to
       help make a difference in the lives of these fathers and mothers of
       ours.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the House:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes with appreciation that there is a substantial decline in the
       number of reported cholera cases in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) calls on the health sector to keep ensuring the closer monitoring,
       supervision and training of health personnel at peripheral level, in
       order to increase community awareness and minimise errors related to
       case diagnosis and reporting; and


  (3) congratulates the Joint Crisis Committee in its efforts to raise
       consciousness about the risks related to cholera during the outbreak.

                         EXECUTION OF MARIETTE BOSCH

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel hiermee sonder kennis voor:


  Dat die Raad -
  (1) sonder om 'n mening uit te spreek oor die skuld of onskuld van
       Mariette Bosch aan die misdaad waarvan sy beskuldig en waarvoor sy
       veroordeel is, sy diepe ontsteltenis en weersin uitspreek daaroor dat
       die owerhede van die Republiek van Botswana -


       (a)  dit goed gedink het om die Suid-Afrikaanse burger verlede
           Saterdag, 31 Maart, in totale geheimhouding tereg te stel sonder
           om haar die basiese mensereg te gun van 'n laaste geleentheid om
           finaal van haar geliefdes en naasbestaandes afskeid te neem; en


       (b)  haar naasbestaandes eers gister, op 2 April, daarvan in kennis
           gestel het; en


   (2)      van mening is dat die feit dat haar familie klaarblyklik op 'n
       leuenagtige wyse die dag voor haar teregstelling van haar af
       weggehou is deur hulle toegang tot die korrektiewe fasiliteit te
       weier op grond van 'n sogenaamde inspeksie van die fasiliteit wat in
       daardie stadium aan die gang was, hierdie miskenning van 'n finale
       mensereg nog soveel meer onmenslik, afstootlik en weersinwekkend
       maak.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) without expressing an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Mariette
       Bosch with regard to the crime of which she was accused and for which
       she was sentenced, expresses its deep dismay at and aversion to the
       fact that the authorities of the Republic of Botswana -


       (a)  deemed it fit to execute this South African citizen in total
           secrecy last Saturday, 31 March, without granting her the basic
           human right of a last opportunity finally to take leave of her
           loved ones  and family; and


       (b)  informed her family about it only yesterday, 2 April; and


  (2) is of the opinion that the fact that her family was apparently kept
       from her the day before her execution in an untruthful manner      in
       that they were denied access to the correctional facility on the
       grounds of a so-called inspection of the facility that was taking
       place at the time, makes this denial of a final human right so much
       more inhumane, abhorrent and disgusting.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?
There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes notice of a motion.

                     DEATHS IN CENTRAL JOHANNESBURG FIRE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock the death of four people, when a fire swept through
         a double-storey building in central Johannesburg early this
         morning;


  (2) further notes that police expect to find more bodies inside the
         building;


  (3) expresses its deepest sympathy with the relatives and friends of the
         victims; and


  (4) wishes the injured a speedy recovery.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     MURDERS OF FARMERS AND THE ELDERLY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the ongoing murders on farmers and other elderly people,
           especially the three murders on elderly people in the Peninsula;
       (b)  the shock and anger experienced by those attending funerals and
           standing at the open graves of murdered people, to which the
           proposer, who attended the funeral of the 70-year old lady in
           Patensie, can testify; and


       (c)  that innocent people are being murdered;


  (2) expresses its concern about the apparent inability of the Government
       to prevent these murders and even to apprehend the murderers; and


  (3) calls upon the President to intervene with drastic steps.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               SOUTH AFRICAN BID TO HOST 2010 SOCCER WORLD CUP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that football's world governing body, Fifa, has finally put the
         controversy of the 2010 World Cup to rest, confirming that the
         prestigious event would go to Africa for the first time;


  (2) further notes that South Africa has, meanwhile, become the first
         African country to announce a bid to host the finals, come 2010;
         and


  (3) believes that justice will be done if South Africa's bid succeeds
         because South Africa, which was the clear favourite to host the
         2006 World Cup, lost to Germany by one vote after Oceania delegate
         Charles Dempsey defied his confederation and abstained from
         casting his ballot.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

          WORKING CONDITIONS IN DURBAN MAGISTRATES' COURT BUILDING

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the unsatisfactory working conditions in the Durban
         Magistrates' Court Building caused by the lack of proper
         ventilation and air-conditioning as a result of the frequent
         malfunctioning and breakdown of the air-conditioning plant in the
         building as well as the frequent malfunctioning and breakdown of
         lifts;


  (2) believes that the main cause of the aforesaid problems is a lack of
         proper maintenance of the said air-conditioning plant and lifts;


  (3) acknowledges that the aforesaid problems result in unacceptable
         discomfort levels, especially on hot days, for the people working
         in the said building, including magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers,
         interpreters, social workers, administrative staff, police
         members, witnesses and other members of the public having to
         attend the courts, and prisoners who are kept in the court cells;
  (4) notes that the aforesaid unacceptable discomfort levels -


         (a)     pose a potential health risk to the said people;


         (b)     result in extreme frustration and lower productivity;


         (c)     result in more cases being remanded and fewer cases being
                finalised;


         (d)     result in the early closure of courts on certain days,
                which of course all result in increasing the already
                unacceptably high number of awaiting-trial prisoners, the
                unnecessary wastage of taxpayers' money, and the unnecessary
                wastage of legal fees for lawyers; and


         (e)     affect the dignity of the courts negatively in that in
                some courts the magistrates, prosecutors and attorneys out
                of necessity attend court sessions without legal gowns; and


  (5) calls upon the Ministers for Justice and Constitutional Development
         and of Public Works to furnish the Council with a full report in
         respect of the aforesaid situation as soon as possible.

Mr J L MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I would recommend that we adopt the following
amendment:


  That the following paragraph be added after paragraph (5):


  (6) recommends that the relevant portfolio and select committees that
         will be visiting KwaZulu-Natal visit this particular court, and
         that the select committee report to the Council thereon.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Matthee, that is a proposed amendment to
the motion. Is it acceptable?

Mr P A MATTHEE: Yes, Chairperson, it is acceptable for that to be added.
Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, I have a further amendment to propose. The
maintenance of our court buildings is in the hands of the Department of
Public Works. The Department of Justice merely uses the facilities. I
therefore move as an amendment:


  That, in paragraph (5), ``Ministers for Justice and Constitutional
  Development and'' be substituted by ``Minister''.

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as amended, agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the
Constitution, namely:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the unsatisfactory working conditions in the Durban
         Magistrates' Court Building caused by the lack of proper
         ventilation and air-conditioning as a result of the frequent
         malfunctioning and breakdown of the air-conditioning plant in the
         building as well as the frequent malfunctioning and breakdown of
         lifts;


  (2) believes that the main cause of the aforesaid problems is a lack of
         proper maintenance of the said air-conditioning plant and lifts;


  (3) acknowledges that the aforesaid problems result in unacceptable
         discomfort levels, especially on hot days, for the people working
         in the said building, including magistrates, prosecutors, lawyers,
         interpreters, social workers, administrative staff, police
         members, witnesses and other members of the public having to
         attend the courts, and prisoners who are kept in the court cells;


  (4) notes that the aforesaid unacceptable discomfort levels -


         (a)     pose a potential health risk to the said people;
         (b)     result in extreme frustration and lower productivity;


         (c)     result in more cases being remanded and fewer cases being
                finalised;


         (d)     result in the early closure of courts on certain days,
                which of course all result in increasing the already
                unacceptably high number of awaiting-trial prisoners, the
                unnecessary wastage of taxpayers' money, and the unnecessary
                wastage of legal fees for lawyers; and


         (e)     affect the dignity of the courts negatively in that in
                some courts the magistrates, prosecutors and attorneys out
                of necessity attend court sessions without legal gowns;


  (5) calls upon the Minister of Public Works to furnish the Council with a
         full report in respect of the aforesaid situation as soon as
         possible; and


  (6) recommends that the relevant portfolio and select committees that
         will be visiting KwaZulu-Natal visit this particular court, and
         that the select committee report to the Council thereon.

          REPORTED DISREGARD OF ORDERS OF COURT BY STATE OFFICIALS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the report in last Sunday's Sunday Times that state officials
         regularly disregard Orders of Court;


  (2) reiterates that the rule of law is one of the foundation stones on
         which our democracy rests; and


  (3) therefore requests the hon Minister for Justice and Constitutional
         Development to investigate this phenomenon, take measures to
         ensure that state officials show due respect for orders of court
         and inform this Council of both his findings and the remedial
         steps he has taken to correct such disgraceful conduct on the part
         of certain state officials.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?
There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes notice of a motion.

                       RACIST MURDER OF TSHEPO MATLOGA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with anger the brutal and callous murder in the Northern
           Province of Tshepo Matloga, whose body was subsequently thrown
           into a crocodile-infested river;
       (b)  that other sections of our society are not given to honest
           admissions that racism still exists in society, and that it
           seems that the more loudly they deny it, the more racism rears
           its ugly head;


       (c)  that no doubt exists that Tshepo's murder was a racist and
           barbaric act by people who see ``black'' as a euphemism for
           ``lower class'' or even ``subhuman'';


       (d)  that South Africa will take a quantum leap the day we begin to
           learn to accept one another for who we are and what we can
           become;


       (e)  that the day will come when the likes of the rugby players
           involved in this callous, heinous and atrocious act of murder
           face the full wrath of the law;


       (f)  that the day will come that we learn that we can be more than
           bigots and create a responsible society; and
       (g)  that this incident and many others of this nature ...

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order: The assumptions that
the hon member is making are only assumptions. The case is still in
progress, and I have a feeling that the subject matter of his motion might
be sub judice and that his motion is therefore not in order.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I believe that there has been an appearance in
court. I am not sure. A charge has been put. I am therefore not sure that
the sub judice rule applies at this time. If it does, we will review the
matter of the motion. For now, Mr Taabe should proceed.

Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chair, my motion continues:


  ... should galvanise us into a strong resolve to eliminate the remaining
  vestiges of racism in this country; and


  (2) commends the SAPS for their swift action in rounding up the scum of
       society.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to the motion?
There is an objection. [Interjections.] The motion will therefore become
notice of a motion. [Interjections.]

Order, hon members! I hope that the time will come in the NCOP when we can
move motions on all such occurrences in our country in one. I am concerned,
as a presiding officer, at the apparent development in our House of the
practice of moving motions on brutal acts of a similar nature relating to
particular groupings in our society. I believe members of the House of all
provinces and parties need to become aware of this practice and to desist.
It does not accord well with the role we should play in our society.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

We have now come to the end of the time available for motions. We therefore
move on. The time has ended, hon members. I do not know whether you wish to
dispute my ruling. Mrs Vilakazi, is that a point of order?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: No, Chairperson, it is not a point of order. I raised my
hand because I still have a motion without notice.
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I have indicated that the time for motions has
ended.

   EXTENSION OF PERIOD OF OPERATION OF SECTIONS 51 AND 52 OF CRIMINAL LAW
                             AMENDMENT ACT, 1997

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Madam Chairperson, I move the draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the Council gives its consent that the President by proclamation in
  the Gazette extend the period of operation of sections 51 and 52 of the
  Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1997 (Act No 105 of 1997), in terms of
  section 53(2) of the said Act for a further period of two years, with
  effect from 1 May 2001.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       PRECEDENCE TO ORDER OF THE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Madam Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That precedence be given to Order No 3 on the Order Paper.

I have consulted with the Whips of the political parties, and there is no
objection to the request.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

      SPECIAL INVESTIGATING UNITS AND SPECIAL TRIBUNALS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Chairperson,
the purpose of the Bill before the House is to bring the provisions of
section 3(1) of the principal Act into line with the Constitution of the
Republic.

It will be remembered that the Constitutional Court, in the matter of the
South African Insurance Association of Personal Injury Lawyers v Heath and
others last year, ruled that the said provisions of the principal Act were
unconstitutional because they flouted a basic principle of our
constitutional system, namely a separation of powers.

It will also be remembered that the Constitutional Court quite correctly
observed that there was need for the legislature and the executive to be
given ample opportunity to deal with the element of unconstitutionality
that had been identified in the principal Act.

However, it will also be remembered that the Constitutional Court, though
giving us a period not exceeding 12 calendar months, also said that we
would have to deal with this particular issue without any undue delay,
whilst, at the same time, of course, allowing us enough time to deal with
other areas of potential unconstitutionality such as were identified not
only by the Constitutional Court, but by the other courts as well in the
process of dealing with numerous matters deriving from the utilisation of
powers extended to the executive in the principal Act.

As I have said, that is the principal aim: to bring this Act into line with
the Constitution. There are, of course, other consequential amendments that
the Bill also deals with.

I want to take this opportunity to thank the judge who is the current head
of the current Special Investigating Unit for the work that he and his unit
have done hitherto.

I am aware that there have indeed been quite a number of problems and
tensions relating to that Act, some of which problems and tensions, as I
have already indicated before this House, came before our courts, including
the Constitutional Court. But overall it cannot be denied that a very
important effort was mounted by Judge Willem Heath and his special
investigating unit to combat the scourge of corruption in our society.

This is the point that I personally made in my affidavit that was submitted
to the Constitutional Court.  It would be useful to remember again that the
Constitutional Court remarked on this point by saying that the fact that
all of us did whatever we did with the best of intentions would not make
that which was unconstitutional and illegal, constitutional and legal. As
is well known we accepted the ruling of the Constitutional Court in this
regard and, indeed, we are now embarking on this process of regularising
the state of affairs. [Applause.]

Mr J L MAHLANGU: Chairperson, we, indeed, support this amendment. Hon
members will be aware that the DP and the New NP, under the banner of the
DA, actually opposed this Bill. It has become a very bad habit within this
formation to oppose everything that the ANC puts forward, whether it is a
piece of fundamental transformation legislation or a hand stretched out in
reconciliation.

In most instances the objection to legislation is not based on principle,
but is merely done to set them apart from the ANC. This blindness can only
be characterised as an ambition to present an alternative to the ANC, and
their failure to see that they are merely opposing legislation for the sake
of not being seen to be associating with anything that the ANC proposes. It
is unfortunate that the New NP has joined this alliance. I know that it
would have supported this piece of legislation.

The same is true with regard to the Special Investigating Units and Special
Tribunals Amendment Bill. The DA's main problem with this Bill stems from
their wrong perception that the proposed amendments remove the aura of
independence that characterises this unit, because the President can now
appoint or remove the head of a unit. My question to them is whether they
would have preferred us to ignore the Constitutional Court and continue
with the judge as head of the unit to satisfy their whining about the
independence of the unit. I raised that in the committee and the Minister
has actually alluded to that.

The reason that I opposed the motion moved earlier by my colleague Mr Lever
is that, especially with regard to the whole question of the rule of law, I
wanted to send the message that we need to adapt and that we need to
respect the rule of law, and I think all of us should do that.

I am sure that they would have preferred us to follow this route because,
despite their lip service to the Constitution and the decision of the
Constitutional Court, they have shown blatant disrespect for the
Constitution and the Constitutional Court. This is proved by their support
for the restoration of the death penalty despite the fact that it was
declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court. We know of the
recent calls by their mayor here in Cape Town that people should ignore the
Constitution, and they have never expressed themselves against this
position.

I have a number of other problems as well with the arguments they have
raised over the proposed amendments. Underlying their contention that the
special investigating unit will no longer be independent because of the
powers of the President is a dangerous assumption - that is what they are
saying - that the President of the country may use his powers to cover up
corruption. The assumption smacks of the racist stereotype that African
heads of state and government cannot be trusted. This is the response to
the issue.

I want to challenge the DA today to state categorically whether or not it
adheres to such racist stereotyping. I also want to remind the DA that it
was the ANC that proposed the Special Investigating Units and Special
Tribunals Act. The ANC insisted on the independence of the unit by
appointing a judge as its head. How on earth can they themselves again turn
against their own decisions? Why would we have appointed such a unit in the
first place if we were not serious about fighting corruption? The DA has,
indeed, stubbornly persisted with its argument despite the assurance given
by the department that the whole Act is under review.

A number of proposals have been made and are being looked at by by the
department, including the proposal that the unit should be disbanded and
that its resources should be used to bolster Chapter 9 institutions, such
as the Auditor-General and the Public Protector. This is a lengthy process
that may even require amendments to the Constitution. In the meantime, we
still need to deal with the order from the Constitutional Court to replace
the head of the unit with a nonjudicial officer within one year.

The proposed amendments are a logical response to the order from the
Constitutional Court. They are a mere shortcut to satisfying the
requirements of the court, while the longer-term process of reviewing the
whole Act is taking its course. That process will continue. We support this
piece of legislation, and I am sure the House will listen to the arguments
that will be presented by my colleagues. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, all I want to say to my hon colleague is that
the accusation of racism is really not worthy of him. I do not think he
should do that, it is not worthy of him.

In the first instance, I wish to pay tribute to Judge Heath and thank him
for the excellent work that he and his special investigating unit have done
in recovering millions of rands lost through corruption.

We agree with the judgment of the Constitutional Court, in the case of the
SA Association of Personal Injury Lawyers v Heath and others, delivered on
28 November 2000 and we applaud the fact that the Constitutional Court
stressed the importance of the separation of the judiciary from the other
branches of the government.

There is a need for courts to be and to be seen to be independent of the
legislature and the executive so that they discharge their duty of ensuring
that the limits to the exercise of public power are not transgressed. This
separation of powers prevents the legislature and the executive from
requiring judges to perform nonjudicial functions that are incompatible
with the judicial office and which are not appropriate to the central
mission of the judiciary and therefore prohibits judges from undertaking
such functions.

It is now clear that this was not sufficiently taken into account when the
original Bill was debated and accepted in Parliament during 1996. It is
very important to note that the Constitutional Court suspended its
declaration of invalidity of the provisions of the existing Act which
require that a judge be appointed as the head of the investigating unit and
the proclamation appointing Judge Heath as the head of the special
investigating unit for one year. Parliament therefore has until 27 November
to rectify the situation.

Die huidige wet, ook met die wysigings in die wetsontwerp voor ons, maak
nie voorsiening vir 'n instrument om korrupsie te beveg wat inherente
jurisdiksie het nie. Die Konstitusionele Hof het beklemtoon dat 'n
ondersoekeenheid sy jurisdiksie ontleen aan, en geheel en al afhanklik is
van, die proklamasie wat deur die President uitgereik word.

Die proklamasie van die President stel in iedere en elke geval  die grense
van die ondersoek van die ondersoekeenheid vas. Dit is belangrik om daarop
te let dat die Konstitusionele Hof beklemtoon het dat die President die
jurisdiksie van die ondersoekeenheid, soos gedefinieer in die proklamasie,
te enige tyd kan verander voordat 'n ondersoek voltooi is.

Die Konstitusionele Hof het die ondersoekeenhede heeltemal korrek beoordeel
as instrumente van die uitvoerende gesag om staatsbates te herwin. Ons kan
nie anders as om tot die noodwendige gevolgtrekking te kom dat die huidige
Wet, vir die redes genoem, inherent so defektief is dat 'n werklike
verbetering daarvan nie teweeggebring kan word deur wysigings nie.

Die huidige voorgestelde wetgewing voldoen slegs tegnies aan die uitspraak
van die hof, maar pak nie die fundamentele tekortkominge aan wat ons nou so
duidelik in die gesig staar nie. Om dié rede kan ons die wetsontwerp nie
steun nie.

Ons sal die inisiatief neem om nuwe wetgewing voor te stel wat voorsiening
sal maak vir die stigting van 'n permanente teenkorrupsie-eenheid waaraan
inherente jurisdiksie toegeken kan word om gevalle van korrupsie te
ondersoek. Dit sal dit vir die eenheid moontlik maak om alle klagte van
korrupsie te ondersoek en sal hom verplig om gevalle van korrupsie te
ondersoek wat deur sekere spesifiek vermelde instansies daarheen verwys
word, soos byvoorbeeld deur die ouditeur-generaal. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The current legislation, also with its amendments in the Bill before us,
does not make provision for an instrument to fight corruption which has
inherent jurisdiction.

The Constitutional Court emphasised that an investigating unit derives its
jurisdiction from, and is entirely dependent on, the proclamation which is
issued by the President.

The proclamation of the President determines the boundaries of the
investigation of the investigating unit in each and every case. It is
important to note that the Constitutional Court emphasised that the
President can change the jurisdiction of the investigating unit at any
time, as defined in the proclamation, before an investigation is completed.

The Constitutional Court correctly evaluated the investigating units as
being instruments of the executive authority to reclaim state assets. We
cannot but come to the inevitable conclusion that the current Act, for the
reasons mentioned, is inherently so defective that an actual improvement
thereof cannot be brought about by amendments.

The currently proposed legislation only complies with the technical
judgment of the court, but does not tackle the fundamental shortcomings
which are now so clearly facing us.  For this reason we cannot support this
Bill.

We will take the initiative to propose new legislation which will make
provision for the establishment of a permanent counter-corruption unit to
which inherent jurisdiction will be granted to investigate cases of
corruption. This will make it possible for the unit to investigate all
charges of corruption and will compel it to investigate cases of corruption
which have been referred to it by certain specifically mentioned
institutions, such as, for example, by the Auditor General.]

As was pointed out by Senator Radue on 30 October 1996 in the then Senate,
the fact that investigating units had to have impartial and independent
judges as heads thereof engendered the confidence of the people of South
Africa and softened the inherent flaws of the legislation.

Now that the Constitutional Court has correctly pointed out the problems
therewith and afforded us a full year to rectify the situation, we should
now make use of this opportunity. [Time expired.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I will leave it to the hon member Matthee to
go the right people to get an answer. [Laughter.]

The ANC Government is being battered by unfounded and opportunistic
utterances like a punch-drunk boxer. This has been the impression portrayed
by the media over the past three months. It is a pity that they are not
here.

I am not surprised that the New NP and the DA oppose this Bill. This, I may
infer, is sickening, symptomatic unreasonableness which, in their view, is
genuine concern.

I would like to make it clear that we are not passing this Bill because we
have to prove our credentials to anybody, but rather because the people of
our country and the region fought a hard and protracted battle so that they
could enjoy peace, stability, democracy and social progress without being
intimidated by parties which can merge like companies, without due regard
to their policies and background, for the simple reason of outvoting the
ANC Government, which they did not succeed in doing. I am talking about the
DP and New NP which equal the DA.

The ANC Government is determined to protect all communities and will use
every device and weapon possible in the legal system to prevent,
discourage, interdict and control those who want to destroy the sound
values and integrity that all of us hold dear.

I thought that I would read members a quote that will make up my entire
contribution to this debate on the issues surrounding the appointment of a
judge as the head of the special investigating unit into the arms deal. In
his response to the debate on his speech during the opening of the
legislature of the Northern Province, Premier Ngoako Ramathlodi stated:
  On the arms deal, the DA had announced that it is strengthening its
  representation on Scopa by replacing some members with more senior ones.
  Public opinion is apparently very happy about this turn of events.


  However, a few days later, the ANC fills the vacant positions in Scopa
  with senior members who, on account of seniority, take over the
  chairpersonship of the ANC study group, and all hell broke out.

[Laughter.] All of a sudden public opinion suspects that the ANC has
something to hide and, at worst, the ANC is undermining Parliament and
reducing it to a rubber stamp. Obviously, for a while, we have been quite
interested in this person called public opinion. Having observed public
opinion, we have come to a very sad conclusion, which is that his views
always coincide with the views of the minority opposition in our country.

The ANC really does take great pleasure in wholeheartedly supporting this
Bill. It is not the ANC which challenged the constitutionality of the
appointment of a judge as head of the special investigating unit, but the
SA Association of Personal Injury Lawyers.
We are therefore trying to obviate any further uncertainty about the head
of the SIU once and for all. If we allow the judge to continue as the head
for the period until 27 November 2001, our Constitutional Court will be
faced with a backlog of cases.

The unit, without the judge, will attend to all its business as stated in
the principal Act. The ANC is trying to rectify the aspect highlighted by
the Constitutional Court. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the amendment to the Special Investigating Units
and Special Tribunals Act is a response to the judgment of the
Constitutional Court in the matter of the South African Association of
Personal Injury Lawyers vs Judge Heath and Others.

At the outset I must emphasise that the DA respects the judgments of the
Constitutional Court and supports the principles set out in the
aforementioned case. In particular, we recognise the need for the
separation of powers between the different organs of state. What needs to
be debated is whether the amending Bill before us serves the needs of the
public.
The Heath Unit, as the Special Investigating Unit has become known, has
been dogged by undeserved controversy. We must not allow the controversy,
undeserved as it is, to deflect our focus from the real issue. The real
issue is that our Constitution enjoins all spheres of Government and organs
of state to provide effective, transparent, accountable and coherent
government for the Republic as a whole, and to be loyal to the
Constitution, the Republic and its people. It is the view of the DA that an
independent, permanent anticorruption unit, with its own inherent powers to
seek out and investigate corruption in Government and organs of state, is
an important tool in achieving this constitutional imperative.

This anticorruption unit should be established by an Act of Parliament and
should be answerable to Parliament. In other words, the anticorruption unit
should be a tool to assist Parliament to carry out its duty to maintain
oversight of the national executive authority and organs of state.

In the Act as it stands, and as amended in terms of the present Bill, the
Special Investigating Unit is a tool in the hands of the President. It
would better serve the needs of accountability and transparency if the
Special Investigating Unit was answerable to Parliament rather than the
executive. [Interjections.]

Further, in terms of the present setup, as amended by this Bill, the
President can constitute one or a number of special investigating units to
investigate corruption in terms of specified terms of reference, which can
be altered or terminated at any time by the President.

The DA believes that this is undesirable for a number of reasons. Firstly,
an anticorruption unit, in whatever form it ultimately takes, should be a
permanent unit in order to build up a pool of expertise and experience in
investigating corruption and recovering the proceeds of corruption.

Secondly, the President should not be exposed to allegations of
interference if he were to alter the terms of reference of a special
investigating unit or terminate its mandate.

Thirdly, it would be preferable if the Special Investigating Unit was
independent and had a mandate to investigate corruption wherever it was
found. This would promote transparency and accountability in Government.

There are a number of ways to achieve these goals. Certain of the Chapter 9
institutions, such as the Public Protector or Auditor-General, could be
equipped both with resources and an appropriate mandate to deal with
corruption. Alternatively, an independent institution could be set up with
the appropriate mandate and resources to tackle the pervasive corruption
currently hindering the delivery of transparent and accountable government
in all spheres of Government.

The Constitutional Court held that a judge could not head these special
investigating units as this was contrary to the doctrine of the splitting
of powers implicit in the Constitution; and the court gave Parliament one
year to correct the situation. The DA believes that a better alternative
could have been found and implemented within the timeframe allowed by the
Constitutional Court.

To sum up, the DA believes that an anticorruption unit should be
established that is permanent, has a mandate to investigate corruption and
recover the proceeds of corruption wherever corruption is to be found, and
is independent. In view of the fact that the principal Act, as amended by
this Bill, would not fulfil these requirements, the DA will be opposing the
Bill.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I would like the hon member to note
that in this House we do not have the DA.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, on a point of order, the Minister of Health, Mr
Mahlangu and Ma Lubidla used the term.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I have made a ruling that in
this House we do not have a DA. It was not a question requiring an answer.

Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chair, the Minister of Justice Comrade Penuell Maduna
and hon members of this august House, as much as I would have liked not to
refer to some of the issues raised by certain members of this House and
some of the nonsensical arguments put forward by the hon Lever ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, please withdraw the word
``nonsensical''.
Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chair, as far as I know, there is nothing to suggest
that what I have said is unparliamentary.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I have made a ruling for you to
withdraw the word ``nonsensical'' for now.

Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chair, I shall do just that so that I can begin to deal
with very important matters that I want to put across in this Chamber this
afternoon.

As I pointed out earlier on, I would not really want to refer to the other
matters. They are somewhat unintelligible issues which hon members of this
House have raised this afternoon. But I think we have got to state the
facts clearly for the benefit of the South African public.

As members of the House will recall, on 18 November ... [Interjections.]
... that is typical of the response one would obviously get from a member
of this House who is so unintelligible. On 18 November 2000 the
Constitutional Court turned down the judgment in the case brought before it
- as was pointed out by other members in this House - by the SA Association
of Personal Injury Lawyers versus the President and the Special
Investigating Unit headed by Judge Heath.

In this case, the lawyers successfully challenged the constitutionality of
the Special Investigating Unit. The President, despite trying very hard to
defend the decision to set up the unit, lost this case. This decision
effectively outlawed any SIU headed by a judge. The court said further that
Judge Heath's position, as head of the SIU, must be regularised without
undue delay, which is precisely what we have done and are seeking to do
this afternoon. These are the facts.

The court gave Government and Parliament a year within which to correct
other problems identified in some of the powers of the SIU. In granting
this one-year period, the court stated quite clearly that there were many
problems with the Act that established the SIU. So it was quite clear that
the court wanted Heath to be replaced without delay as his continued
participation in the work of the SIU would compromise the independence of
the judiciary; and that certain elements, obviously, of the principal Act
as they stood then with respect to the SIU, were basically inconsistent
with the Constitution. This is precisely what the Constitutional Court
judgment says.

But there are other equally important issues which, I feel, we would be
failing in our duty, as members of the ANC in this committee, if we did not
raise sharply in this debate this afternoon. They relate to the cheap and
often myopic arguments raised by members of the opposition. They naively
argue that these amendments, as proposed, must be delayed and that they
should rather be looked at broadly in the principal Act because in their
current form they remove the aura of independence that characterises the
Special Investigating Unit. What a lot of poppycock and balderdash from
these parties! They should rather come out openly and state in this House
...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, as you continue please
use language which we understand. [Interjections.]

Mr T B TAABE: Those words were simply meant to express what nonsense comes
from the opposition. [Interjections.]

They should rather come out openly and state in this House this afternoon
that their concern, largely, is about the very stupid obsession with the
inclusion of a particular judge in the investigation into the strategic
defence procurement deal, which is part of their quest to undermine the
President and the Government of our people in this country. If they have
found a political ally in people who persistently argue for their inclusion
in such units, they must say so openly. It is clear that these are but part
of a broader and sinister political campaign to undermine this Government,
which we cannot allow as the ANC.

The point should be made again that the interaction, as all of us will
recall, between the judge and the President regarding this matter, showed
all of us beyond any reasonable doubt that the President, indeed, co-
operated with Judge Heath on this matter. Otherwise, the President would
not have shared the kind of information which he shared with the judge,
particularly on the deal, if he did not want him to know anything about it.
So what exactly is the opposition's objection basically to the proposed
amendments?

Of course, they have again found willing partners in the media who go out
of their way to unearth any negative story about the ANC and Government.
Those in the media who do those things are referred to as independent
journos with a bright future in the profession if they continue to rubbish
the ANC and its leaders. [Interjections.] Fine. Let them do it, and we wish
them well. [Interjections.]

The opposition to the Bill is nothing but a clear political attempt to get
back at the President for his refusal, on the basis of facts before him, to
include Judge Heath in the arms deal investigation. The media, a central
pillar of our democracy, must not be used by faceless people to hide the
agenda of wanting to keep our people under perpetual tutelage in this
country. If the Public Protector, for instance, had been part of the
investigation at Government's insistence, despite the Constitutional Court
ruling, the media houses would be baying about the sanctity of our courts.
They would have said that the decision of the court must be respected. The
opposition find it ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! You reminded us of how debating
societies at high schools play with the English language.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, this is a tiny amendment but it has large-scale
consequences. As the hon Matthee and the hon Lever have said, it does not
fulfil the need or the gap left by the changing status of the Special
Investigating Unit. We have made no secret of the fact that we would like
to have the SIU investigate the arms industry deal.

From the early attacks by the Minister of Finance on Mr Justice Heath, it
has been clear that this appointment by President Mandela did not serve the
perceived interests of the Mbeki Government. He was, as we know, getting
too close for comfort. The Government grabbed at the chance, like manna
from heaven, offered by the Constitutional Court to exclude Heath and his
unit. There can be no other reason.

The SIU has shown that they have the experience - the ``conscientiousness
and integrity'' - the amendment now calls for. Judge Heath also has the
degree of ``independence'' and integrity alluded to in the judgment, which
has made him so admired in South Africa and abroad. It was those very
qualities and his effective fight against corruption that caused his
downfall by some of his detractors, the personal injury lawyers, who
themselves were the object of his scrutiny.

The ACDP chairperson considered the description ``impartial'' that we
suggested in the Other Place be added in the amendment to describe a
qualified person to lead the SIU. It might have assisted the public
perception of what was required, but it was not to be.

The absence of Heath is going to put additional pressure on the remaining
investigating authorities, at least as far as the arms industry
investigation is concerned. Their integrity, independence and effectiveness
will be put under the spotlight. They and Parliament are going to be tested
as never before.

The defence inquiry will be a watershed and landmark investigation that
will either secure Parliament's relevance in these matters or forfeit
Parliament's relevance in these matters perhaps for ever.

Anyhow, Heath is a judge and we have the Constitutional Court judgment. On
technical grounds, we recognise that the deed is done and we must move on.
On technical grounds therefore, we support the legislation, but the gap has
not been filled, which is a gap we need to have filled in South Africa.
When I listen to the hon member Taabe, my heart sinks. Heaven help South
Africa if his views ever become the predominant views in this country.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.]

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, perhaps I should start with the input by Mr
Durr. He seems to forget that the basis of the Constitutional Court
judgment was not whether, in fact, Heath was a competent or incompetent
judge. The judgment was on the basis of the separation of powers. I think
it is not a technical argument, but rather based on principle. In fact, the
separation of powers forms the core of our Constitution, and Mr Durr has
time and time again raised this issue of the separation of powers. Now to
suggest that a ruling by the highest court of this country, the
Constitutional Court, is merely a technical issue really deflects from the
truth. I think one should look at the approach more carefully. However, I
am not going to spend much time on that.
I would like to consider more carefully the responses of both Mr Matthee
and Mr Lever. Mr Lever suggests that they are opposing this Bill on the
basis that there should be an institution created which is quite
independent of the President or the executive, and that it must be a
permanent institution. He suggests further that such an institution could
be located within one of our Chapter 9 institutions. If it is indeed the
case that such an institution and anticorruption unit could be attached to
the Office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions, to the Auditor-
General's office or even to the Oseo unit, then, certainly, that would
ostensibly give the DP no basis for opposing this legislation because a
remedy could be found in terms of a permanent measure.

What he fails to do is to tell this House the reason why a period of one
year was given by the Constitutional Court. Both Mr Matthee and Mr Lever
are guilty of doing this. I would like to read from the judgment itself.
These were the words of Judge President Chaskalson, who said:


  ... and to appoint a functionary other than a judge to head the SIU.
  These are the only declarations that are to be suspended. Although there
  may be reasons for allowing sufficient time for all matters to be dealt
  with simultaneously, there are good reasons for the first respondent's
  position as the head of the SIU to be regularised without undue delay.

I emphasise "without undue delay".


  Time will however be required for the various committees of Parliament to
  consider what is to be done and for appropriate legislation to be
  drafted. Time must also be allowed ...

This is important -


  ... for a new appointment to be made, and for the first respondent to
  transfer his responsibilities to the new head of the SIU in an orderly
  fashion.

We are aware that there are thousands of cases that are outstanding, and
the suggestion of the DP and the New NP that we are opposing is
preposterous and ludicrous. Let us assume that one is in the majority,
which those parties will never be in this House or in the other House and
has thousands of cases pending. Now, because of some weird idea that one
has concocted that there has to be an independent unit located somewhere in
a Chapter 9 institution or in some mythical homeland of these parties here
one decides to abandon these 30 000 or so cases and not to deal with those
prosecutions.

We have a dream, a dream which we can quite easily realise through the
existing units. I think fundamental to this argument is one thing - a lack
of understanding of what the SIU is all about. Why was it created and where
does it come from? It was previously a commission of inquiry. It was always
an instrument of the executive. The SIU had to be established by the
President. The parameters and the mandate had to be conferred by the
President. The mandate could be altered by the President, and this has
always been the case. Nothing has changed or been altered.

There was never any voice of opposition. At no time did the New NP or the
DP say, ``Look, the SIU is an instrument of the executive and, certainly,
should not be tolerated. We require a permanent structure''. Why now, why
now with the removal of Judge Heath is this being aired for the first time,
as Mr Durr airs it, which is understandable? We have never questioned the
integrity of Judge Heath and neither has the Minister. In fact, the
Minister has commended Judge Heath for the wonderful work he has done. But
why now, with the removal of Heath, is the unit somehow superfluous,
redundant and unimportant? Why now, for the first time after more than four
years, is there a cry for a permanent structure? [Interjection.]

I think the attempt here is to mislead the public, regrettably. The public
must be told and informed, and it is important that they are told that
there are Chapter 9 institutions. These are constitutional structures
established by virtue of provisions in the Constitution. The Special
Investigating Unit was never a Chapter 9 institution. It was always an
instrument of the executive, to be used by the executive against corruption
and other nefarious activities that may occur at any level of government.
In fact, that instrument has been used quite well and effectively and
efficiently, and it has a lot of outstanding work to do. By merely
suggesting that they are opposing this Bill on the basis of the fact that
there is no permanent structure for the first time, after four years,
smacks of deceit and an intention to mislead. I say that with a deep sense
of regret.

I would also like to say that even when we come to Chapter 9 institutions -
and we talking about institutions like the Human Rights Commission, the
Gender Commission and the Auditor-General - independence was never a
requirement and is not a requirement in the Constitution or in legislation.
What is required is a person who is suitably qualified, a suitable and
proper person. The amendment goes beyond that. It says that it should be a
person of integrity. Judge Chaskalson says in his judgment that not only
judges are people of integrity.

People of integrity are found not only in the judiciary, but also elsewhere
and one must recognise that fact. The amendment itself says that it has to
be a person who is fit and proper, and a person who is conscientious and
who has integrity.

These are the five requirements that are put into this legislation in order
to ensure that in the course of the appointment, the person would need a
high threshold in terms of fulfilling a particular task.

To suggest that independence, something which has never been raised when
constitutional structures, ie Chapter 9 institutions, were established, now
becomes a question when we are talking about an instrument of the executive
- not a judicial organ, but an instrument of the executive - in order to
fulfil a particular task. I find it quite ridiculous to raise this at this
point in time.

As I said earlier, and I repeat it, I think the opposition here is merely
attempting to politic and mislead the public in formulating a perception
that this institution is not an institution of the President or the
executive with which to fight corruption, that it was an institution that
was quite independent, and that what the ANC is now trying to do is limit
its powers to the extent that it becomes a poodle that can do nothing at
all.

I think one should be honest by saying that the SIU has carried out
responsible, efficient and effective work, and can continue to do so. By
merely opposing the legislation on the basis of an alternative which Mr
Lever has not even formulated in order to canvass possibilities and even
state what some of those possibilities are, they are now trying to say that
we must stop the process of Special Investigating Units and take away this
instrument of fighting corruption until we have developed an alternative
permanent structure. Really, this does not take the interests of the people
of South Africa into account.

I say that we should support the Bill unquestionably. It is an old piece of
legislation that is not being fundamentally changed, but merely being made
to fall within the ambit of the ruling of the Constitutional Court.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, I
must say I have enjoyed the debate. I must thank the members who have
supported the Bill and those who have opposed it for such a good debate.

Let me start with the remarks by hon member Kent Durr. It is alleged by the
hon member that the President - and, may I say, perhaps I as well, without
being mentioned in any specific way - opportunistically jumped - or is it
gyrated - as the Constitutional Court ruled the way it did in this matter.

Before one makes any such remarks, one has to go back to the judgment and
read it carefully. It is in good English and very simple and one should
take time to read it. It does not use any complex language or words, and if
one looks at it carefully, it tells one who the four respondents were. The
four respondents were, in this order: Willem Hendrik Heath, the Special
Investigating Unit, the President of the Republic of South Africa and the
Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development.

Part of paragraph 9 of the judgment says that the first and second
respondents, ie Heath and the so-called Heath unit, indicated in the High
Court that they took a neutral stand in the matter and that they would
abide by the decision of that court. They have made no representations to
that court.

The third and fourth respondents, opposed the appeal. The third and fourth
respondents, as I have said, are none other than the President of the
Republic and this Minister. It is because we believed that having this unit
headed by a judge was a correct thing to do. In my own affidavit I actually
said that a judge was selected because we were looking for a person of
integrity, and this is the answer that the judge gives.

Paragraph 38 says that people of integrity are not found only among judges;
that is what it says. This paragraph also says a bit more, and that brings
me to the remarks by both hon members Matthee and Lever. This paragraph is
very useful to bear in mind and one might want to do that long after this
Bill has indeed been enacted. Paragraph 38 says that the functions that the
head of the SIU has to perform are executive functions, which, under our
system of Government are ordinarily performed by the police, members of
staff of the national prosecution authority or the State Attorney. I would
like to stop there. If one looks carefully at this Act, it never was the
intention of the two Houses to create a new permanent entity to deal with
the problem of corruption in this country. It was indeed intended, as the
Act itself says, and I quote from the preamble to the Act:


  To provide for the establishment of Special Investigating Units for the
  purpose of investigating serious malpractices or maladministration in
  connection with the administration of state institutions, state assets
  and public money as well as any conduct which may seriously harm the
  interests of the public ...

That is the part of the preamble to the Act.

Again, if one looks carefully at section 3 of the principal Act, there is
no suggestion that this should be a redeployment of a judge of the High
Court. Such a judge would be appointed for the duration of that particular
investigation into serious malpractices or maladministration such as would
have been adequately defined. For that purpose, one would then issue a
proper proclamation which would be an instrument by means of which one
would outline the parameters of the investigation and the powers of the
investigating unit and its head.

If it is the view of these institutions that one needs to discard that,
then we need a totally separate discussion. At the same time I am not
saying that it is inappropriate to raise the question - far from it. I am
saying that we should deal with this Bill, the basic purport of which, as I
said in my introductory remarks, is to bring the principal Act, as it
stands, in line with our Constitution, pursuant to the decision of the
Constitutional Court, and stop there.

There are many areas of unconstitutionality which have been identified by
numerous seats of the High Court which we have to grapple with. But
fortunately, in that regard we do not have any constraints of time. In this
regard, we have only a year to deal with this issue, and we have chosen
that we should not wait for the whole year because there is no reason for
dealing with this issue right at the tale end of the one-year period. We
thought it is right to deal with it now. But we will be bringing back to
both Houses of Parliament a Bill seeking to address these other areas of
unconstitutionality, and, for that purpose my department has already been
appropriately instructed. Therefore there will be this sort of debate.

I do not think that anyone of us should fear that at the level of the
executive there are people who fear transparency. I was flabbergasted when
I read statements purporting to be coming from the DA. I know, Chairperson
that you have ruled that there is no DA here, so I am not talking about
people who may regard themselves as the DA here. What I am saying is that
statements purporting to be coming from the DA were suggesting that though
they believe in transparency, when it comes to the investigation of
allegations that have been thrown around with regard to the so-called R43
billion armaments deal they would prefer that the intense light of
transparency should not be shone here.

We in the executive and, may I say, we in the ANC, want everyone who has
any evidence to come forward and give it as esidlangalaleni, or in public,
and be cross-examined in public, such as does happen in our courts of law.
[Interjections.]

Open public hearings are a matter of basic principle. Hearings in-camera
are a mere exception to the general rule. There must be particular reasons
why a matter should not be heard in public. We are not certain why those
who have said all sorts of things, including Patricia de Lille, would want
to hide behind in camera hearings. We want them to repeat the statements
that they have been so brazen as to make all along, and be cross-examined.
[Interjections.] This is how one will get to the bottom of this. There is
no other way. Humanity has not invented any better way than thorough cross-
examination. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, will the hon the Minister take a question?

The MINISTER: Chairperson, I certainly will, because there is still a
minute or two left.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, can the Minister distinguish for me between an
investigation and a court hearing? Investigations are generally not open to
the public, while court hearings are.

The MINISTER: Chairperson, there is indeed a basic difference. One is not
the other. Does that satisfy you? [Laughter.] What is it a person fears if
she is armed with critical evidence that would enable her to name certain
people? She wants them carted off to jail for long periods by saying that a
certain person bribed so-and-so by means of certain things, and that
somebody committed a certain offence under our law. What is it that such a
witness fears after she has been throwing around all sorts of dollops of
glossolalia about this? [Interjections.]

Such a person then says she would want to speak in camera on what she has
always said she knew. That is where I have a problem. In other words, the
Public Protector should be entitled to say that a certain person has made
all the statements. We want to hear that person. Nothing should prevent the
Public Protector from calling upon anyone of us who participated at any
level whatsoever in the making of decisions, including members of Cabinet.
We know the answers, and we do not want to be protected from public
hearings. We will give the answers, and we will submit to thorough cross-
examination, so that the truth gets told once and for all. We shall not
answer for and on behalf of people involved in subcontracts, because we
were not involved in those. At no point was a subcontract submitted to us
for evaluation, but we shall answer in respect of the primary contracts,
publicly. We say, our accusers must also come forward and declare their
evidence publicly. [Interjections.]

Nothing shall be hidden from the people of South Africa. That is our motto
in this regard. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution
(Democratic Party and New National Party dissenting).

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
                   AFFAIRS - RSA/CANADA EXTRADITION TREATY

Mr J L MAHLANGU: Chairperson, the concept of co-operation in criminal
matters by way of extradition is very old. It had its origin in the ancient
practice of rendition, which was the handing over of persons by one
sovereign to another.

Over the years the principles of extradition were refined, until by the end
of the 19th century a coherent body of legal rules governing extradition
had developed. The major principles of these rules still apply to
contemporary extradition law. The Extradition Treaty between South Africa
and Canada has been made possible through a very amicable and stable
political relationship between the two countries.

Canada, as hon members may know, was for many years a strong supporter of
the struggle against apartheid. The Canadians supported and funded numerous
South African nongovernmental organisations which challenged the apartheid
system through the courts, through support for educational upgrading and
other programmes to promote a more equitable society.

During the period 1990 to 1994, Canada provided extensive support to the
peaceful transition to democracy, including the development of an interim
constitution and preparations for the nonracial elections in April 1994.
Since the elections of 1994, Canada has supported South African re-entry
into the broader range of multilateral organisations, and the two countries
have worked closely on important multilateral issues, such as the renewal
of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

The extradition treaty further cements this co-operation, and highlights
the strengthening relationship between the two countries. Its main aim is
to provide a procedure which will facilitate the surrender on a reciprocal
basis of persons accused or convicted of the commission of what is called
extraditable offences within the jurisdiction of South Africa and Canada.
This House, towards the end of last year, passed a similar treaty between
South Africa and the USA.

In terms of this procedure, requests for extradition must be made by the
respective ministers of justice and should also be accompanied by certain
documents, such as a certified copy of the warrant of arrest where a person
sought to be extradited is an accused, or a copy of the documents that
records the conviction where the person is already convicted.

What is important to know is that the extradition treaty makes it mandatory
for both countries to refuse extradition where the offence is of a
political nature, and provides both countries with discretion to refuse a
request for extradition under certain circumstances. This is an important
provision, because it allows South Africa to refuse to hand over a person
if there is a possibility that the death penalty may be imposed on such a
person. This is in line with our own constitutional obligation to uphold
the right to life.

The real importance of this treaty lies in the fact that it will establish
a higher degree of co-operation between our justice system and that of
Canada.

The higher degree of co-operation is necessitated by the threat posed by
the fast-evolving and dynamic criminal environment, which feeds on
globalisation and on the latest technological developments. This is a new
and dynamic criminal environment that does not show any respect for
national boundaries. That is why countries such as South Africa and Canada
must co-operate and show these criminals that neither country will be a
safe haven for them.

I can indicate that all parties have supported the treaty. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
             AFFAIRS - RSA/CANADA MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY

Mr J L MAHLANGU: Chairperson, the treaty before us stems from a meeting of
international experts held by the United Nations in order to develop and
promote international mutual assistance practices.

The mutual legal assistance in criminal matters treaty is a relatively
recent development. The treaty seeks to improve the effectiveness of
judicial assistance and to regulate and facilitate procedures. Each country
designates a central authority, generally the two justice departments, for
direct communication. The treaties include the power to summon witnesses,
to compel the production of documents and other real evidence, to issue
search warrants, and to serve processes.

The Government of the Republic of South Africa and the government of Canada
undertook to enter into a treaty on mutual legal assistance in criminal
matters, in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of
South Africa. This was followed by the approval of the President of South
Africa on 11 November 1999 that the treaty be entered into.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and her Canadian
counterpart signed the treaty on 12 November 1999 in Durban during the
Commonwealth Heads of State meeting.

Today marks the final stage of the ratification process as provided for by
section 231(2) of the Constitution, which is as follows:


  An international agreement binds the Republic only after it has been
  approved by resolution in both the National Assembly and the National
  Council of Provinces, unless it is an agreement referred to in subsection
  (3).

Section 231(3) does not require the approval of both the Houses.

In the South African context, assistance in criminal matters means
assistance both in statutory and common law offences, and for Canada it
means investigations and proceedings relating to any offence created by
parliament, in other words, the parliament of Canada, or by the legislature
of any province in Canada. These include investigations, prosecutions and
proceedings relating to offences concerning taxation, duties, customs and
foreign exchange.

The treaty also deals with important legal safeguards as it provides that
assistance shall be provided without regard to whether the conduct, which
is the subject of the investigation, prosecution or proceedings in the
requesting state, would constitute an offence under the laws of the
requested state.
The form of assistance that will be required will include locating and
identifying persons and objects; serving documents, including documents
seeking the attendance of persons; search and seizure; taking evidence and
obtaining statements; authorising the presence of persons from the
requesting state at the execution of requests; making detained persons
available to give evidence or assist in investigations; facilitating the
appearance of witnesses or the assistance of persons in investigations;
taking measures to locate, restrain or forfeit the proceeds of crime; and,
lastly, any other form of assistance not prohibited by the law of the
requested state.

In addition, article 2 provides that the requested state shall not refuse
to execute a request on the grounds of bank secrecy. Article 4 provides
that assistance may be refused if, in the opinion of the requested state,
the execution of the request would impair its sovereignty, security, public
order, essential public interest, or prejudice the safety of any person.
Assistance may also be postponed by the requested state if execution of the
request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution in the
requested state.

Article 18 provides for the limitation of use or disclosure of information
or evidence furnished for purposes other than those stated in the request
without the prior consent of the central authority. In South Africa the
central authority is the Director-General of the Department of Justice and
Constitutional Development or a person designated by him or her. In terms
of the treaty, the central authority in Canada is the Minister of Justice
or any other official designated by that Minister.

Lastly, article 24 provides for entry into force, amendment and
termination. This article provides that the treaty shall enter into force
on the date on which the contracting parties notify each other in writing
that their respective legal requirements have been met, and that the date
of entry into force will be the date of the last notification.

The treaty also states that it may be amended by mutual consent, and the
parties may also, by mutual consent, terminate this treaty on such terms
and conditions as may be agreed to between the two parties. In addition to
this, either contracting party may terminate the treaty. The termination
shall take effect six months from the date on which it was notified to the
other contracting party.
I can also indicate with regard to this treaty that it has the support of
all parties. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

         NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson,
information is a resource that is as essential for a nation's economic
development as are land, labour and enterprise. The libraries and
information services sector is one of the stakeholders in the development
of an information society. An information infrastructure and system of
information dissemination is one of the infrastructures needed by society
to support economic prosperity.

For those reasons, the objective for the submission of the Bill is to
establish a council that will advise me and the Minister of Education on
matters related to library and information services.

Libraries are one of the building blocks of the local information and
knowledge infastructure which is necessary to support knowledge-based
economic development. They are also vital for community development and
information dissemination to communities.

With regard to the constitutional framework for the provision of library
services, a new legislative framework has existed since 1996. The
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996, provides the
constitutional framework for the provision of library and information
services in South Africa. Part A of Schedule 5 of the Constitution lists
``libraries other than national libraries'' as one of the functional areas
of exclusive provincial legislative competence.

Although all libraries, except the national libraries, are therefore a
provincial responsibility as a functional area of exclusive provincial
legislative competence, my department is the focal point for handling
matters related to library and information services at national level.
My colleague the Minister of Education is likewise responsible for matters
relating specifically to educational libraries. We work in partnership
dealing with matters that have an impact an on the total library and
information services system in the country. Within this system, community
libraries have a particular important role to provide access to all
communities. As decisions have to be taken after consultation of the
library and information services sector, there is a need for a mechanism
such as an appropriately structured council which can provide this link and
provide us, the Minister of Education and I, with professional advice.

The need for such a council was pointed out in previous investigations by
my department, namely the White Paper on Arts, Culture and Heritage of
1996, which recommended that such a council be established to assist in the
formulation of library and information service policy, to provide co-
ordinating networks and mechanisms, and to set priorities for extending
national library and information services. The council was to provide a
vehicle for co-ordination at the national level and advise on linkages
between the national and provincial governments.

Secondly, the report of the interministerial working group into the library
and information service sector's function at the national level, published
in 1997, was the result of an investigation by an interministerial working
group appointed by the Minister of Education and I into good governance of
the library and information services sector. The working group also
recommended that a council be established.

Other reports on policy development initiatives in the library and
information services sector during the 1990s also indicated a strong need
for a council. Although it was felt that this should be a co-ordinating
body, constitutional constraints necessitate that it only be an advisory
body. Advice rendered on matters that affect provincial library services
will have to be tabled at the appropriate mechanisms, namely the Minmecs,
for decision-making in partnerships and in consultation with provinces.

The objective of the National Council for Library and Information Services
Bill, 2001, is to establish a council to advise the Minister of Education
and the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology on matters
relating to library and information services in order to facilitate access
to information for all communities.

The functions of the council have been formulated broadly in order to
create a proper operational framework for the council and to ensure the
maximum benefit of its activities for all users of libraries and
information in our country.

The Minister of Education and I will be advised on various aspects of
library and information services, including development co-ordination and
legislation. Of importance will also be policy formulation regarding the
allocation of public funds, training of library staff, and the promotion of
literacy, a culture of reading and information.

It will be expected of the proposed council to make sensible but innovative
and practical recommendations, within the framework of realistic funding
possibilities, on transforming South African library and information
services to the advantage of all users of information and in so doing to
strengthen our national system of innovation.

The council will consists of 12 members to be appointed by me with the
concurrence of the Minister of Education, and after a process of public
nomination. One of the members will be the national librarian of South
Africa. Liasa, the Library and Information Association of South Africa,
will also be represented on the council in order to facilitate co-operation
between the council and the professional association of the library
information sector. The criteria for appointment of members, their tenure
and nomination procedures are also included. Procedures to ensure the
smooth functioning of the council and its committees are also provided for.

Library and information services in South Africa need transformation to
answer the needs of all citizens. This sector faces a number of challenges
and the council will have to look at such issues as libraries which are
overstretched and burdened with severe financial constraints, disparities
in services in urban and rural communities, the shortage of books
appropriate to the needs of the majority of the population, the low levels
of literacy, the low awareness of the value of reading, the lack of a
culture of lifelong learning, and, of course, many other incidental
matters.

The council will have to investigate and advise on appropriate and cost-
effective ways and new initiatives to optimise limited resources. Change
must be effected, and library services that will make a meaningful impact
and lead to improved access to information for all communities should be
developed. This will require co-operation and the forging of partnerships
between all spheres of government, nongovernmental organisations, business
and civil society.

We must bring together everybody that deals with libraries and education,
as well as the publishing sectors, booksellers, authors, teachers and
parents. Services will have to be adapted and extended to ensure the
involvement of communities and to make libraries instruments of change.

My colleague the Minister of Education has declared 2001 the Year of the
Reader, and I believe that this could be the watershed year when we will
begin the process of building a nation of readers. These readers must,
eventually, all have access to libraries that will be able to play their
core role as instruments of civilisation.

This is a serious matter, indeed, because we will not make headway with the
adult education programme if we do not provide a viable and effective
library and information services. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, this Bill has
been a very interesting one at committee level. I realised that when we
dealt with it members were actually discussing and making their inputs in
all earnestness. It was very good that they showed a lot of interest and
participation.

However, there are a few things that one would like to mention at the end.
Library and information services in South Africa, as the Minister has
already stated, are characterised by a variety of forms of information
provision. This Bill makes provision for fundamental change in form,
function and practice. It has been clearly stated and we know that we have
not been dealing with it very much. I am referring now to most of our
members who are not members of the committee. It is vital that we instil
interest in library services. The impact of the global information society
and the developmental challenges that it raises necessitate a change in the
strategic approach in order to integrate library and information services
policy into broader information based on society policy.
Research has proved that provision needs to be made for library and
information services and for the sustainability of these services in order
for the optimum use of modern information technology - I repeat, the
optimum use of modern information technology - to be accomplished.

Reports that resulted from the policy investigation outlined that the need
for a national advisory council for library and information services still
exists to serve as a mechanism to achieve co-ordination of the national
strategy within the library and information services system.

I would like to say that, because of these important things we had seen, we
wholeheartedly supported the approval of the Bill, although there was a
feeling amongst the members that some amendments should be made for the
sake of provincial representation. There was a very intense debate around
that issue. Members felt that it would be of help if the Ministers could
look at it and also become involved in the provinces for the sake of
representivity.

On the question of representation, our proposed amendments highlight the
provincial representation on such a council and further ensure that the
NCOP is in a position to call upon this council to report from time to
time. That applies to the question of accountability and oversight as well.
These are the feelings.

The amendments are there and only affect clauses 5, 9 and 14. With all
these amendments, we propose and accept the Bill with amendments.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance with section
75 of the Constitution.
The Council adjourned at 17:26.
