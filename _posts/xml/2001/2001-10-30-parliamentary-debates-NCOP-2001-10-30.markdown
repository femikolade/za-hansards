                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, at the next sitting of this House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) in the light of the new circumstances and realities, views with alarm
       the developments in and around the Coega Bay development project;


  (2) notes that, in spite of the fact that the required  impact  study  is
       apparently   not   as   yet   completed,   large-scale   irreversible
       infrastructure developments are taking place;


  (3) further notes with alarm that this is taking place in  spite  of  the
       withdrawal from the project of the major core tenant, Billiton,  with
       their stainless steel plant cancelled; and


  (4) calls upon the Government to put the project on hold until such  time
       as the viability and the need and desirability of  the  project  have
       been properly evaluated and considered against the background also of
       the environmental impact study and the new economic realities.

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I shall move at the next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern the apparent lenience granted  by  Nedbank  to  the
           Democratic Alliance for not honouring its overdraft  obligations
           for an outstanding debt totalling R5 million;


       (b)  that small and  medium  enterprises  struggle  to  get  start-up
           funding for their businesses and yet it is easy for  the  DA  to
           get funds;


       (c)  that this lenience is not afforded to small,  medium  and  micro
           enterprises,  which  are  a  crucial  and   central   plank   of
           Government's economic development strategy; and


       (d)  Nedbank and the major commercial banks' negligible  contribution
           to  small,  medium  and  micro  enterprises  which  provide   an
           essential vehicle for poverty alleviation and  job  creation  in
           previously disadvantaged communities; and


  (2) calls on the financial and banking sector to  demonstrate  commitment
       to small business development and black empowerment by  relaxing  its
       strict criteria that prevent this vital sector from gaining access to
       financial, managerial and professional assistance.

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chair, I would like to move at the next sitting of  the
House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with  glee  the  swift  and  much  anticipated  demise  of  the
       Democratic Alliance;


  (2) notes that the demise is in the main  the  result  of  the  bully-boy
       actions of its arrogant leader Mr Tony  Leon,  who  seems  to  derive
       extreme delight in thumbing his nose at the values and principles  of
       democracy and who seems to have an  overinflated  estimation  of  his
       self-importance;


  (3) also notes that the DP is on a road to nowhere and  with  them  their
       racist ``Fight Back'' and ``Keep Blacks Out'' campaigns; and


  (4) believes that they will assume their rightful place as minnows in the
       greater order of politics in South Africa.

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I wish to give notice of the following motion:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern and appreciation the statement by the  hon  Mr  Van
           Schalkwyk on SAfm yesterday morning in which he exposed what the
           Democratic Alliance with the DP component really stands for; and


       (b)  that in the SAfm interview, Mr Van Schalkwyk insinuated  that  a
           senior DA member said that whenever the South African Government
           is faced with problems, the DA must rejoice as this would be  in
           its favour;


  (2) believes that democracy can only  be  achieved  through  constructive
       dialogue and opposition; and


  (3) therefore calls upon the DA to desist from this destructive behaviour
       and embrace the principles of democracy.

                              BREAST-MILK BANK

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pleasure the launching of Africa's  first  community-based
       "breast-milk bank" for Aids orphans  and  babies  abandoned  by  HIV-
       positive mothers;


  (2) acknowledges that scores of children die of opportunistic diseases in
       their first year of life because of weak immune systems;


  (3) supports the action taken by  20  volunteer  mothers  who  donate  40
       litres of breast milk a month, which is stored in  aseptic  bags  and
       pasteurised before fed to the babies; and


  (4) hopes that more preventive measures would be taken to assist children
       born of HIV-positive  mothers  as  a  means  of  curbing  this  life-
       threatening disease.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                ECONOMIC GESTURE BY SASOL IN SECUNDA COMPLEX

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with appreciation the R10  billion  economic  boom  Sasol  will
       inject into the Secunda Complex;


  (2)  notes  that  this  economic  gesture  demonstrates   Sasol's   total
       commitment to the creation of sustained job  opportunities  in  South
       Africa; and


  (3) calls upon big companies like Old Mutual and Anglo Billiton to follow
       suit.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      SOUTH AFRICAN SPORTING SUCCESSES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council, noting some remarkable successes achieved  recently  by
  South African sportsmen and teams, congratulates -


  (1) Retief Goosen, the first South African in almost 20  years  to  reach
       top spot in the European Order of Merit - no mean achievement  for  a
       golfer  who  has  been  playing  his  golf  internationally  in   the
       formidable shadow of the  other  South  African  world-class  golfer,
       ``Big Easy'' Ernie Els;


  (2)  Lindani  Ndwandwe,  former  caddie  and  now  Durban  Country   Club
       professional, who became the first black golfer in the last 10  years
       to win the Sunshine Tour when he captured the R200 000  Western  Cape
       Classic played at Rondebosch Golf Club two weeks ago; and


  (3) the Amakhosi (Kaizer Chiefs) for reaching the finals of  the  Mandela
       Cup when they emerged victorious against Club Africain of Tunisia 3-0
       (aggregate) during the weekend.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to that motion?

Mr M V MOOSA: Madam Chair, I do not support the last  part  of  the  motion.
[Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Moosa, do you honestly object?

Mr M V  MOOSA:  Yes,  Chairperson.  I  am  a  Bucks  supporter.  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Order!  We  have  to  follow  the  Rules,  hon
members. There is an objection, and  the  motion  will  therefore  become  a
notice of motion. [Interjections.]

               NEW NP'S COMMITMENT TO CO-OPERATIVE GOVERNANCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) saamstem dat 'n herrangskikking  van  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  politieke
       landskap ná die demokratiese verskiesing van 1994 onafwendbaar was;


  (2) daarvan kennis neem dat die Nuwe NP in die lig van die  voorafgaande,
       hom  opnuut  verbind  tot  samewerkende  inklusiewe   regering   soos
       uiteengesit in sy verkiesingsmanifes van 1999; en


  (3) voorts daarvan kennis neem dat dié samewerkende  gees  reeds  geruime
       tyd in die NRP gevestig is en weerspieël word in die styl en vlak van
       debatvoering in die Raad, en die vertroue  uitspreek  dat  alle  lede
       hierop sal voortbou.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) agrees that a rearrangement of the South African political  landscape
       after the 1994 democratic elections was unavoidable;


  (2) notes that, in the light of the aforementioned, the New NP once again
       commits itself to co-operative, inclusive governance, as set  out  in
       its 1999 election manifesto; and


  (3) further notes that for a considerable time already this  co-operative
       spirit has been established in the NCOP and is reflected in the style
       and level of debate in the Council, and expresses the hope  that  all
       members will build on this.]

[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection  to  the  motion?
[Interjections.]

Mr L G LEVER: Madam Chair, I propose the following amendment:


  That we, based on our past experience, wish the ANC the best of luck  and
  the greatest joy, because we know they will experience the same in  their
  upcoming engagement and marriage with the New NP.

[Interjections.] [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I take it that that is an  objection  to
that motion, and the motion will therefore become notice of a motion.

         CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AMENDMENT BILL

   (Debate on particulars of proposed constitutional amendments on Bill in
               terms of section 74(5)(c) of the Constitution)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam  Chairperson,
I am indeed honoured to have been invited to participate in this  debate  on
the proposed constitutional amendments that were published  in  the  Gazette
dated 13 July 2001, particularly since it is the first legislation  of  this
kind that I am introducing in my constitutional development portfolio.

As is always to be expected, the draft  Bill  which  was  published  in  the
Gazette differs slightly from the Bill as introduced, which is  the  subject
of this debate. The reason for this difference is that,  on  the  advice  of
the Chief State Law Adviser, a proposed amendment  of  section  155  of  the
Constitution was transferred to the Constitution of the  Republic  of  South
Africa  Second  Amendment  Bill  which  is  required,  in   terms   of   the
Constitution, to be passed by this House as well.

We should also not be ignorant  of  the  fact  that  the  Bill  forming  the
subject of this  debate  is  currently  being  considered  by  the  National
Assembly and that certain amendments thereto are being contemplated.

The Bill amends the Constitution in respect to the  following  three  areas:
the judiciary, the  appointment  of  Deputy  Ministers,  and  the  borrowing
powers of local governments.

With regard to the judiciary, provision  is  made  for  the  office  of  the
President of the Constitutional Court to become that of  the  Chief  Justice
of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa.  This   necessitates   a   number   of
consequential amendments, including the conversion of  the  offices  of  the
Deputy President of the Constitutional Court to Deputy Chief Justice;  Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of Appeal to President of the Supreme Court  of
Appeal; and Deputy Chief Justice to Deputy President of  the  Supreme  Court
of Appeal.

Secondly, Section 176 of the Constitution is amended in order to enable  the
legislature to extend the term of office of the Constitutional Court  judges
by means of an Act of Parliament.  At  present  section  176  provides  that
Constitutional Court judges hold office for a nonrenewable term of 12  years
and must retire at the age of 70, whereas other  judges  hold  office  until
they are discharged from active service in terms of an Act of Parliament.

The background regarding the changing of the office of the President of  the
Constitutional Court to Chief Justice can briefly be summarised as  follows.
Since  the  advent  of  the  new   constitutional   dispensation   and   the
establishment of the Constitutional Court, there has been uncertainty as  to
which court is the highest or apex court  in  the  Republic,  and  likewise,
which office is the highest judicial office.

The  present  office  of  the  Chief  Justice  stems   from   the   pre-1994
dispensation  when  the  Republic  had  a  Supreme  Court  of  South  Africa
comprising  an  appellate  division,  and  various  provincial   and   local
divisions with the Chief Justice heading the appellate division and  clearly
being the most senior judicial officer in the country.

In terms of the new Constitution, the Constitutional Court  is  the  highest
court in all constitutional matters, and the  Constitution  is  the  supreme
law of the Republic. The Chief Justice at present is  neither  a  member  of
the Constitutional Court nor does he or she exercise any  jurisdiction  over
the judges of that court.

The Constitution also assigned most of the functions which, in the  previous
dispensations, would have  been  performed  by  the  Chief  Justice  to  the
President of the Constitutional Court,  such  as  the  swearing  in  of  the
President of the Republic, Deputy President, Ministers and premiers.

In terms of section 178(1), the Chief Justice  is  the  chairperson  of  the
Judicial Service Commission. It is therefore understandable that  there  has
been a growing unease within the legal fraternity  around  the  question  of
which office constitutes the head of the judiciary of the Republic.

During October 2000, I hosted a  legal  colloquium  which  was  attended  by
participants from all  branches  of  the  legal  fraternity.  The  following
issues were discussed at that colloquium: one, the strengths and  weaknesses
of the  judicial  system;  two,  challenges  facing  the  administration  of
justice; three, the structures and hierarchy of the courts; and four,  other
relevant issues which affect service delivery and impact on the  functioning
of the courts.

During the colloquium certain strong views  emerged,  the  most  notable  of
which were that there should be a head  of  all  judicial  officers  in  the
Republic who should be the Chief Justice of South Africa,  and  that  he  or
she should be the head of the Constitutional Court.

On 2 April 2001, I met with the President of the  Constitutional  Court  and
the heads of all the other superior courts in  Cape  Town.  The  purpose  of
this meeting was to seek  consensus  on  certain  of  the  principal  issues
arising from the said colloquium, as well as to determine  the  way  forward
in respect of the promotion  of  certain  broader  legislative  reforms  and
other required steps.

All persons attending this meeting were in agreement that  the  Constitution
should be amended so as to make provision for the Chief Justice  to  be  the
head of the Constitutional Court,  and  for  the  present  office  of  Chief
Justice, that is, the head of the Supreme Court of  Appeal,  to  become  the
President of the Supreme Court of Appeal.

Permit me to make a few remarks regarding amendments to section 176  of  the
Constitution. Unlike Constitutional Court  judges,  judges  of  the  Supreme
Court of Appeal  and  the  High  Courts  are  appointed  for  life,  as  the
principle of ``once a judge always a judge''  applies  here.  Although  they
never officially retire, they can be discharged from  active  service  in  a
number of ways which are determined by means of factors such as their  years
of active service, age, health, etc. Once a judge is discharged from  active
service, he or she receives  a  tax-free  gratuity  and  also  continues  to
receive a salary for life, and upon his or her death, the  surviving  spouse
of such a judge receives a percentage of such salary for life.

However, on the vacation of a Constitutional Court judge  from  his  or  her
office, he or she receives a once-off tax-free gratuity.  In  the  event  of
his or her death while  in  office,  the  surviving  spouse  concerned  will
receive a gratuity equal to the amount  which  the  judge  would  have  been
entitled to if he or she had vacated his or her office.

During discussions held with me earlier this  year,  the  President  of  the
Constitutional  Court,  Justice  Arthur  Chaskalson,  made  it  clear   that
Constitutional Court judges,  excluding  those  who  were  also  High  Court
judges, were experiencing this perceived lack of security  of  tenure  as  a
distinct disadvantage when compared to the  dispensation  of  other  judges.
Moreover, it makes it difficult to attract the most suitable  candidates  to
serve as Constitutional Court judges as those persons are unwilling to  give
up prosperous careers in order to serve as a judge for a fixed  term  of  12
years.

The  amendment  to  section  176  will  enable  Parliament  to   bring   the
dispensation relating to judges of the  Constitutional  Court  on  par  with
those of other judges, and will allow us to attract and retain the  services
of the foremost constitutional jurists to preside in the court that  is  the
ultimate guardian of our Constitution.

I said that we are going to deal  with  the  issue  of  the  appointment  of
Deputy Ministers as well. In terms of section  91(3)  of  the  Constitution,
the President of the Republic may select any  number  Ministers  from  among
the members of the National  Assembly  and  may  select  no  more  than  two
Ministers from outside it. In terms of  section  93,  Deputy  Ministers  may
however be appointed from among the members of the National Assembly only.

The effect of the requirement in section 93 that Deputy  Ministers  must  be
appointed from amongst the members of the National Assembly is that  if  the
President appoints a Deputy Minister from a party that has very few  members
of  Parliament,  that  party's  effective  participation  in  the   ordinary
business of Parliament might be compromised severely.

Clause 5 of the Bill is consequently aimed at bringing section 93 into  line
with section 91(3) by making provision for the appointment of not more  than
two Deputy Ministers from outside  the  National  Assembly.  The  amendments
being contemplated by the National Assembly to sections 54  and  58  of  the
Constitution are consequential to clause 5,  and  relate  to  accountability
and privileges of non-National Assembly Deputy Ministers.

I also said that we would then deal  with  the  borrowing  powers  of  local
governments. As originally introduced, this Bill  contained  two  provisions
originally sponsored by the  National  Treasury  and  endorsed  by  Cabinet,
namely the Financial Emergency Amendment in the original clause  9  and  the
``fettering'' amendment in the original clause 10.

As approved by the National Assembly portfolio committee, the Bill  includes
only the  fettering  amendment.  With  the  agreement  of  the  Minister  of
Finance, the financial emergency amendment  has  been  delayed  for  further
consultation on the question of how this clause relates  to  the  provincial
and proposed national authority to intervene in the municipalities  pursuant
to section 139 and, may I say, section 100 as well of the Constitution.

The Bill originally  added  subsection  155(8)  to  the  Constitution.  This
section envisioned an authority, to be created by legislation,  which  could
exercise budgetary and related powers in order to restore a municipality  in
financial crisis to health. As a result of the comments received during  the
National  Assembly  portfolio  committee  hearings,  it  became  clear  that
further consultation was needed, especially  in  relation  to  four  clauses
originally contained in the  second  amending  Bill  relating  to  municipal
interventions. This matter will therefore be taken up again  as  part  of  a
separate Bill at the start of the next legislative term.

With regard to the fettering clause, the Bill also originally  added  a  new
section 156(6) to  the  Constitution.  The  aim  was  to  empower  municipal
councils to  bind  themselves  and  successor  councils  in  order  to  give
security to investors.  This  should  allow  municipalities  to  borrow  for
longer terms and at a lower cost.  After  the  National  Assembly  portfolio
committee's hearings, it was agreed to accomplish  this  same  objective  by
adding a new section 230A to the Constitution.

The new 230A, and the amendments to the existing section 230 in  the  second
amending Bill, accomplish the following: municipal  borrowing  is  separated
from provincial borrowing; councils are empowered to bind their  successors'
legislative  and  executive  authority  in  order  to   secure   loans   and
investments; and an ambiguity between bridging ``during a fiscal year''  and
allowing ``12 months'' to repay, in the case  of  short-term  borrowing,  is
eliminated. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, we had an agreement with the Minister  that
I would not touch on any of what he said, but I  will  emphasise  everything
that he said. [Laughter.] There are times when people are  obliged  to  make
some changes that are  in  line  with  current  trends  or  current  events.
Therefore, there is no wisdom for any government to stick like glue to  laws
that are becoming irrelevant to current events.

It was therefore not surprising when this  proactive  Minister  for  Justice
and  Constitutional  Development  made  it  possible  for  some   of   these
amendments to our Constitution to be made. By his conduct, one can  now  see
that there is a big difference between getting ready to act and starting  to
act. Many people are forever getting ready to act, but not starting to  act.
I say thanks to the Minister.

As the Minister said, let me touch on some amendments under  the  judiciary.
Many of us will recall that at a justice  colloquium,  referred  to  by  the
Minister, which was held in October last year, the  South  African  judicial
system came under intense scrutiny.  A  number  of  decisions  were  reached
which needed to be implemented to bring our judicial  system  in  line  with
the needs of our Constitution.

One of the proposals made was that we should have a single judiciary with  a
single head. This constitutional amending Bill seeks to give effect to  that
decision. It proposes that our judiciary be headed by a Chief  Justice,  who
should also be the head of the Constitutional Court.

This, in turn, necessitated a number  of  consequential  amendments  to  the
Constitution, such as the conversion of the  office  of  the  President  and
Deputy President of the Constitutional Court to that of  Chief  Justice  and
Deputy Chief Justice respectively. The Chief Justice of  the  Supreme  Court
of Appeal will now be known  as  the  President  of  the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal, and so forth.

It means, therefore, that all references to the  above  offices  had  to  be
changed wherever they occurred in the  Constitution.  One  of  the  problems
which arose as a result of the decision to create  a  single  judiciary  was
the difference in tenure of judges  of  the  Constitutional  Court  and  the
judges of our lower courts.

The amendment proposed under section 176(1)  of  our  Constitution,  as  the
Minister said, is simply to harmonise  or  remove  the  uncertainty  of  the
tenure or terms  of  office  of  Constitutional  Court  judges.  Unlike  the
original proposal, section 176(1) now proposes that a  Constitutional  Court
judge hold office for a nonrenewable term of 12 years or  until  he  or  she
attains the age of 70, whichever  occurs  first,  except  where  an  Act  of
Parliament extends the term of office  for  that  particular  Constitutional
Court judge.
A balance, therefore, needed to be found to bring about  uniformity  without
creating an opportunity for the kind of unintended consequences which  would
have flowed from the original amendment. As I said, the Bill  now  makes  it
possible for a  term  to  be  extended  through  an  Act  of  Parliament  if
necessary.

There are some people who are glued to old ideas. For one  to  unglue  them,
one has to use an iron hammer. Let us face it, there is a galaxy  of  talent
or brains which are wasted out  there.  What  if  that  particular  somebody
could make a valuable contribution to this Government,  but,  unfortunately,
he or she is not in the National Assembly?

We have dedicated and committed South Africans outside Parliament.  What  is
wrong if the President could, if he so wished, appoint any person  to  serve
as a Deputy Minister even if that person was not a member  of  the  National
Assembly? There is nothing wrong with that. It is, therefore, proposed  that
the President be able to appoint any person to serve as a  Deputy  Minister,
even if that person is not a member of the National Assembly.  However,  the
President may not appoint  more  that  two  Deputy  Ministers  who  are  not
members of the National Assembly.

These kinds of amendments can only be brought about by  people  who  do  not
only think of themselves, but who have  the  interests  of  the  country  at
heart. These amendments will allow the President to cast his net as wide  as
he can. The same arrangement is  made  with  regard  to  Ministers,  as  hon
members are aware, under section 93 of our  Constitution.  Therefore,  there
is nothing new about this proposal.

No investor  will  invest  in  an  institution  which  is  not  stable.  Our
municipalities need support from national Government. With the insertion  of
this new section 230(A) in Act 108 of 1996,  we  are  giving  municipalities
power to raise loans if there is a need. In this proposal we  want  to  make
it possible for the municipalities to  bind  themselves  and  even  to  bind
future councils.

This will give confidence to  investors  or  financial  institutions,  which
might be willing to provide such loans to municipalities. As we are, we  all
need strong, stable, capable and reliable municipalities. I  would  like  to
thank my colleagues, hon members who serve  on  the  select  committee,  for
their tireless efforts. We are where we are today because of their  support.
[Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa
Amendment Bill comes before this House in terms of Rule 85 of the  rules  of
the National Council of Province. That means  that  the  amendments  to  the
Constitution do not directly affect the powers of the  National  Council  of
Provinces or the provinces themselves, and that whilst we debate  the  Bill,
we do not vote on it.

The Bill went through a  lengthy  and  detailed  process  in  the  portfolio
committee of the National Assembly. Public  hearings  were  held,  and  many
people who had an interest in the proposed changes to the Constitution  made
written and oral submissions. I attended many of these public  hearings  and
can testify to the fact that the process was inclusive and that all  parties
strove to reach consensus.

It is fitting  that  proposed  amendments  to  the  Constitution  should  go
through  such  a  painstaking  process,  as  it  is  no  ordinary  piece  of
legislation. It should not be amended on a whim. Members of this  House  and
members of the public may be surprised to see a second  Bill  with  proposed
amendments to the Constitution coming before us shortly. The reason for  the
two separate Bills lies in the Constitution itself, and  the  practices  and
Rules of Parliament.

The Bill now before this House, in  its  present  form,  does  not  directly
affect the powers of this House or any other powers or matters  referred  to
in  section  74(3)(b)  of  the  Constitution.  In  essence,   the   proposed
amendments to the Constitution have been divided into two groups. In  short,
the Bill presently before us does not require this House to vote on it,  but
merely to debate it. The Bill that will shortly come before this House  will
require both a debate and a vote.
If one compares the Bill now before this House with the form and content  of
the Bill as it was originally introduced in the  National  Assembly,  it  is
quite clear that we are dealing  with  a  very  different  Bill  today.  The
proposed amendments currently before this House provide that  the  President
may appoint  two  Deputy  Ministers  from  outside  the  National  Assembly.
Previously the Constitution provided that the  President  may  only  appoint
Ministers from outside the National Assembly.  The  current  amendment  goes
further to say  that  such  Deputy  Ministers  appointed  from  outside  the
Assembly will in fact be responsible and accountable to Parliament as well.

The proposed amendments also allow  for  certain  changes  to  the  term  of
office of Constitutional Court judges.  The  principle  that  Constitutional
Court judges should hold their office for a fixed term or until  such  judge
reaches the age of 70 is a sound one. The present changes  would  allow  for
individual changes where an Act of Parliament would be found appropriate  to
effect such a change.

Finally, the proposed amendments provide for  municipal  councils  to  raise
loans in accordance with national legislation, and in fact  to  bind  future
councils to honour those debts. In essence, there is no vote  on  this,  but
in the present form, the DP will support these amendments. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, soos  reeds  aangetoon  deur  die  Minister  en
vorige sprekers, handel hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp tot  die  Grondwet  oor
drie   aangeleenthede,   naamlik   die   regbank,   die   aanstelling    van
adjunkministers en plaaslike regering.

Die Nuwe NP steun hierdie  wetsontwerp  ten  opsigte  van  al  drie  hierdie
aspekte. Daar is egter een  aangeleentheid  waarna  die  agb  Mr  Lever  ook
sydelings verwys het, wat ek tog net graag 'n oomblik by wil  stilstaan,  en
dit is die hele kwessie  van  die  prosedure  van  hoe  hierdie  wetsontwerp
vandag deur die NRP gaan, in  die  opsig  dat  ons  nie  daaroor  stem  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, as the Minister  and  previous  speakers  have
already indicated,  this  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa
Amendment  Bill  deals  with  three  matters,  namely  the  judiciary,   the
appointment of Deputy Ministers and local government.

The New NP supports this Bill in respect of  all  three  of  these  aspects.
However, there is one matter which the hon Mr  Lever  also  referred  to  in
passing, upon which I would like to dwell for a  moment,  and  that  is  the
whole question of the procedure to be followed in the passing of  this  Bill
through the NCOP today, in the sense that we shall not be voting on it.]

We do not vote on it, and in fact, therefore, the provinces as such have  no
say as far as this specific amendment is concerned. Hon  members  will  note
that on page 10, at the end of the memorandum, it says that this  Bill  will
be dealt with in accordance  with  the  procedures  established  by  section
74(3)(a) of the Constitution since it contains no  amendment  which  relates
to a matter that affects the National Council  of  Provinces.  That  is  the
first point. Point two is not really relevant, and the third one  refers  to
amendments to provisions that deal specifically with a provincial matter.

It is so that this National Council of Provinces, this House,  actually  has
the interests of provinces  at  heart.  If  one  looks  at  Schedule  5  and
Schedule 4, one sees that there are very pertinent local government  matters
dealt with by provinces. If one looks at  specifically  section  155(6)  and
(7) for instance, one sees that each provincial  government  must  establish
municipalities in its province in a manner consistent with  the  legislation
in the relevant Act, and must provide for  the  monitoring  and  support  of
local government  in  the  province.  Subsection  4  also  talks  about  the
provincial government having the legislative and executive authority to  see
to the  effective  performance  by  municipalities  of  their  functions  in
respect of certain matters listed.

This amendment to the Constitution, specifically as far as local  government
is  concerned,  is  there  to  actually  assist  municipalities  that   have
financial  problems  and  to  make  it  possible  for  them,  under  certain
circumstances, where there would be national legislation, to get  loans  and
investments, etc, as it is dealt with, and specifically as far  as  the  new
section 230A, which will now be included in the Constitution, is concerned.

I raised this at a committee level, and the answer  given  to  me  was  that
there is no certainty as far as  this  is  concerned,  and  that  there  are
different interpretations by different lawyers, or it is open  to  different
interpretations. I would plead that where there is any doubt, and  there  is
a case to be made  out  for  whether  this  House  should  be  involved  and
therefore the provinces should be involved,  the  interpretation  should  be
given so that this House can be involved and we can  get  our  mandate  from
our provinces as well, because this House certainly plays a  very  important
role as far as local government is concerned and more specifically  because,
even though it does not have a vote,  Salga  is  also  represented  in  this
House.

I am very sorry that this Bill is not being dealt with in  a  way  in  which
this House and  the  provinces  could  be  more  involved,  and  could  have
mandates and a vote on it. I wonder whether the Minister  could  maybe  just
touch on that in his reply. We support the rest of the Bill. [Applause.]

paragraphs follows.)

[Prince B Z ZULU: Hon Minister of Justice, Deputy Minister  of  Defence  and
the Council, the Constitution of the country is  there  to  look  after  the
needs of its people. It is the backbone of welfare and  the  improvement  of
their  lives.  A  country  with  a  constitution  that  is  built  upon  the
foundation of democracy is governed through justice.

Many different clauses of the Constitution were published after  a  thorough
consultation between party representatives and those who  were  representing
the citizens of this country. Therefore, amending  a  particular  clause  in
the Constitution is not something that one can think about and just  do.  It
is done only if there is a serious need for it in the country.

A developing country like South Africa is forced to sit down  and  negotiate
amending certain clauses in the Constitution so  that  it  will  be  aligned
with the development of the country.]

The constitutional amendments  proposed  by  this  Bill  are  based  on  the
distinctive  view  of  the  relationship  which  should  exist  between  the
judiciary pertaining to their  term  of  office  as  well  as  consequential
amendments. The Bill also provides for the substitution of  section  230  of
the Constitution, in that a municipal council may raise  loans  for  capital
expenditure of the municipality, and loans for current  expenditure  may  be
raised also, when it is necessary, for bridging  purposes  during  a  fiscal
year.

This means that municipalities may continue functioning  while  experiencing
serious financial problems, as they restructure to  resolve  such  problems.
This Bill enables Parliament to enact legislation to allow for the  exercise
of executive and legislative authority  on  behalf  of  a  municipality,  in
circumstances in which this is necessary in order  to  resolve  a  financial
emergency in the municipality.

The clause empowers the local  government  to  borrow  long-term  funds.  It
empowers the municipality to bind itself in future in the  exercise  of  its
executive and legislative powers, in order to borrow funds for capital at  a
cheaper rate and over a long period. These amendments are necessary as  they
provide a missing piece  in  the  Government's  strategy  for  dealing  with
municipal financial problems.

The policy framework  for  municipal  borrowing  and  financial  emergencies
envisions the creation of a municipal financial emergency  authority,  which
could direct the financial structuring of a municipality when  there  is  no
alternative.

The restructuring process  envisioned  in  the  policy  framework  could  be
resolved by the municipality itself if it  seeks  relief  from  unmanageable
debt by an MEC, or Minister  if  necessary,  to  supplement  a  national  or
provincial intervention in terms of section 100, section 139, or by a  party
to a  contract  if  the  municipality  is  in  default  of  its  contractual
obligation.

The underlying purpose of the policies outlined in the policy  framework  is
to restore the municipality to financial health  as  soon  as  possible.  We
therefore support this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  I
must thank you and this House for this very  quick  debate  indeed  in  this
regard.

The only issue, really, that warrants a response is the issue raised by  hon
member Matthee. I would readily  concede  that  a  careful  reading  of  the
relevant section, namely section 74(3)(a), especially when  one  is  reading
it  in  relation  to  a  Bill  such  as  this  one,  is   capable   of   two
interpretations.  I  must  say  that,  nonetheless,  as  the  department  we
accepted the one interpretation, because we thought that if we were  to  err
at all we should err on the side of caution.

I am certain that as we all gather the  necessary  experience,  we  will  be
able to interpret this clause better. So no slight was intended  at  all  as
far as the debate in this House was concerned. It is just that when we  were
looking at these interpretations and there was  this  uncertainty,  this  is
how we reacted.

May I say, initially, that we were not thinking of section 74(3)(a) at  all.
The issue arose when the Chief State Law Adviser raised it  and  said  there
was this issue. That is  why,  as  hon  member  Mr  Lever  indicated,  quite
correctly so, we then had to separate the  issues  into  two  constitutional
amending Bills, because there was this debate about whether or not  the  one
part required both a debate and a vote in  this  House  or  just  a  debate.
Eventually we settled for this debate. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!  We  thank  the
hon the Minister for agreeing to come to  debate  the  particulars  of  this
particular amendment.

                       POSTAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson and  hon  members,  this  Bill  is  essential  to
ensuring the provision of universal and affordable postal  services  to  all
the people  of  South  Africa.  Access  to  reliable  and  efficient  postal
services contributes to the success of development programmes  and  policies
and to the dignity and respect of South African citizens.

The postal service is the most used  source  of  communication  amongst  the
people, especially in rural areas. It therefore deserves to be  complete  in
its development.  This  Bill  ensures  universal  service,  establishes  the
definition and composition of the  postal  regulator,  and  strengthens  the
enforcement of crime prevention.

Clause  1  of  this  Bill  changes  the  definition  of  ``Regulator''  from
``Directorate: Postal Regulation''  to  ``Postal  Regulator''.  It  proposes
that the regulator consist of a chairperson, who will be  appointed  by  the
Minister of Communications for a period of no  more  than  five  years.  The
chairperson will no longer be required to be the most senior person  in  the
postal policy division of the department.

This Bill also amends the job description of the postal regulator  in  order
to create a clear separation between roles in  policy  and  regulation.  The
new regulator will consist of  three  individuals:  a  chairperson  and  two
officers of  the  Department  of  Communications,  also  designated  by  the
Minister.

This Bill includes a number  of  other  elements,  which  I  would  like  to
mention briefly. Clause 6 inserts section 30A  into  the  principal  Act  in
order to empower the SA Post Office to provide insurance of mail  and  other
postal articles. This ensures that South Africa  is  in  line  and  able  to
comply with the same standards for mail delivery and  postal  administration
as other countries. The maximum amount for which one can ensure will  be  R2
000.

Clause 7 amends section 35 of the principal Act.  It  does  this  by  making
provision for more than one  office  to  be  able  to  handle  undeliverable
articles  that  must  be  returned.  Clause  12  lays  out  a   transitional
provision,  which  empowers  the  Minister  to   appropriately   appoint   a
substitute to  the  position  for  the  period  between  the  terms  of  the
incumbent and the new appointee with regard to the  amended  composition  of
the regulator.

The Bill also provides for  checks  and  balances  in  that  the  department
controls the  allocation  of  all  finances  and,  therefore,  it  would  be
impossible for the regulator to exercise excessive autonomy.

This Bill ratifies  the  identified  ambiguities  and  shortcomings  of  the
Postal Services Act  of  1998  and  seeks  to  align  South  African  postal
delivery with global standards.

The Bill strengthens the principles laid down in the Postal Services Act  of
1998, in that it encourages the development of human resources and capacity-
building within the postal industry, which takes into account  the  training
of, among others,  women  and  people  with  different  abilities  who  were
grossly neglected or ignored by  the  previous  dispensation.  These  people
yearn for empowerment; they want to live like all other people.

It is our view that this Bill will go a  long  way  towards  establishing  a
framework for efficient and  viable  postal  services  in  our  country.  We
therefore support this Bill and the policy that underpins it. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:
Dr   P   J   C   NEL:   Voorsitter,   ten   spyte   daarvan   dat    hierdie
wysigingswetsontwerp oënskynlik net 'n paar geringe  amendemente  aanspreek,
beskou my party dit as noodsaaklike wysigings wat daartoe kan bydra dat  die
posdiens in ons land baie beter sal kan funksioneer.

Dit is baie belangrik dat die Poskantoor weer op 'n gesonde  en  winsgewende
basis opereer. Dit is baie ontstellend om te verneem van die  Poskantoor  se
pensioenskema wat met R2 miljard in die rooi is.  Die  skema  se  aktuariële
verpligtinge word met 227% oorskry.

Die onreëlmatighede en korrupsie wat na bewering deur die personeel van  die
Poskantoor gepleeg word, is ewe ontstellend. My party spreek  die  hoop  uit
dat die daarstelling van  die  Reguleerder  bestaande  uit  drie  lede,  wat
hierdie wetsontwerp ten doel het, daarin sal slaag om die  nuwe  bestuurder,
Mnr Manyatshe, se taak  te  vergemaklik  en  dat  hy  daarin  sal  slaag  om
bogenoemde onreëlmatighede  doeltreffend  uit  te  roei.  Sodoende  sal  die
standaard van die dienste wat die Poskantoor lewer, tot so 'n mate  verbeter
dat dit goed vergelyk met die beste in die wêreld. Die  Nuwe  NP  steun  die
wetsontwerp. (Translation of Afrikaans declaration of vote follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL:  Chairperson,  despite  the  fact  that  this  amending  Bill
apparently deals with only a few minor amendments, my party regards them  as
essential amendments that could contribute to  the  postal  service  in  our
country functioning much better.

It is very important that the Post Office should once  again  operate  on  a
sound and profitable basis. It is very disturbing to hear that  the  pension
scheme of the Post Office is R2 billion in the red. The  scheme's  actuarial
obligations are exceeded by 227%.

The irregularities and corruption that are allegedly committed by the  staff
of the Post Office are equally alarming. My party wants to convey  the  hope
that the introduction of the Regulator,  consisting  of  three  members,  as
envisaged by this Bill, will also succeed in facilitating the  task  of  the
new  manager,  Mr  Manyatshe,  and  that  he  will  succeed  in  effectively
eradicating the aforementioned irregularities. In so doing the  standard  of
the services rendered by the Post Office will improve to such a degree  that
it would compare favourably with the best in the world. The New NP  supports
the Bill.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
                AFFAIRS - CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS PROTOCOL

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, the Constitution of South Africa,  Act  108
of 1996, makes provision for the establishment of independent and  impartial
human rights institutions  to  strengthen  constitutional  democracy.  These
institutions, which are subject only to the Constitution and  the  law,  are
the Public Protector, the Human Rights Commission  and  the  Commission  for
Gender Equality, and promote  and  protect  human  rights  at  the  national
level.

This protocol aims to enable the  Human  Rights  Committee  to  receive  and
consider  communications  from  individuals  claiming  that   their   rights
contained in the covenant have been violated by the  states  party  to  this
protocol and the covenant. This means that the Human Rights  Committee  will
promote and protect human rights at international level, whereas  our  Human
Rights Commission does this at  national  level.  South  Africa  signed  the
covenant on 31 October 1994 and  ratified  it  on  10  December  1998.  This
protocol now needs to be acceded to.

After the Human Rights Committee has received any considered  communications
from individuals claiming that  their  rights  have  been  violated  by  the
parties  who  are  signatories  to  this  protocol  and  the  covenant,  the
committee will refer this communication to the accused  state  party,  which
must, within six months, submit a written  explanation  that  clarifies  the
matter and a remedy, if any.  Only  then  can  the  committee  consider  the
communications in the light of all written information made available to  it
by both parties and forward it for review.

Despite the fact that the committee has no  judicial  powers,  South  Africa
will, if it accedes to this protocol, have both a moral and  legal  duty  to
allow submissions, to respond timeously and positively when required in  any
way and to adhere to the recommendations of the committee. Articles 1 and  2
provide that only individuals subject to the jurisdiction of a  state  party
to both the covenant and this protocol can submit  a  written  communication
claiming  that  that  state  has  violated  their  rights  provided  in  the
covenant.

Article 4 provides that the communication will be referred  to  the  accused
state party by the committee,  which  state  party  must  submit  a  written
explanation to clarify the matter and a remedy therefore within six  months.
The committee can then consider the communication referred  to  it  by  that
particular individual.
I therefore make the following humble submission. Article  8  provides  that
any state that ratifies or  accedes  to  the  covenant  can  accede  to  the
protocol through  the  deposit  of  an  instrument  of  accession  with  the
Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the protocol  will  enter  into
force three months thereafter. I therefore,  on  behalf  of  the  committee,
humbly submit this protocol for endorsement by the NCOP. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
            AFFAIRS - CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS SECOND PROTOCOL

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, the death penalty cannot  be  separated  from  the
issue of human rights. It is a violation of fundamental human rights.

A central aspect of fundamental human rights  is  the  fact  that  they  are
inalienable. They may not be taken away even if a person has  committed  the
most heinous of crimes. Fundamental human rights apply to the worst  of  us,
as well as to the best of us, which is why they protect us all.

It is natural for everybody to seek protection from crime. Far from being  a
solution, the death penalty gives the impression  that  tough  measures  are
being taken against crime.  It  diverts  attention  from  the  more  complex
measures that are really needed to eradicate crime, such as the  elimination
of poverty, inequality and racial discrimination.

The continued use of  capital  punishment  also  poses  a  serious  risk  to
innocent people being sentenced to death. We recently  almost  had  such  an
example where three young men faced the death penalty for a crime which,  it
later turned out, they had not committed.

Evidence has shown that there is  a  significant  movement  to  abolish  the
death penalty altogether. Both public opinion  and  state  practice  reflect
this  development.  According  to  Amnesty  International,  54  states  have
abolished the death penalty for all offences, while 15 states have  done  so
for all offences with the exception of war crimes.

In our country I have noticed a persistent call for  the  reintroduction  of
the death penalty. I no longer see those cars  with  a  cross  on  the  back
windscreen asking for the reinstatement of the death penalty.  It  means  we
are getting somewhere. This call is mostly  coming  from  those  people  who
have been shielded from crime because of  their  advantaged  position  under
apartheid.

What is becoming increasingly clear also is  that  their  argument  for  its
reintroduction lies not so much in  the  fact  that  they  think  the  death
penalty is a deterrent to crime, but is rather  motivated  by  a  hatred  of
criminals of a  particular  colour.  They  are  swimming  against  the  tide
because the international trend is not  to  reintroduce  capital  punishment
but to abolish it in its entirety.

The second optional protocol is a major step  forward  in  our  struggle  to
completely eliminate capital punishment from  the  face  of  the  earth.  It
provides for the abolishment of the death penalty by  states  party  to  the
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights so as to promote  and  protect  human
rights and enhance human dignity.

The protocol obliges  state  parties  not  to  permit  executions  in  their
jurisdiction and to take the necessary steps to abolish the  death  penalty.
South Africa has already  taken  steps.  Our  Constitutional  Court  already
ruled in 1995 that capital punishment was unconstitutional.  Since  then  we
have made a number of changes to our Criminal Procedure Act to regulate  the
setting  aside  of  death  sentences  and  to  replace  it  with   competent
sentences.

A very important aspect of this protocol is the fact  that  once  a  country
accedes to it, the country will be bound by it. The country cannot  renounce
the second optional protocol except with  the  consent  of  all  contracting
parties. In practice this means that once South Africa  accedes  to  it  she
will be bound and under no circumstances will she  be  able  to  reintroduce
the death penalty.

Nowhere has capital punishment shown that the use thereof  has  any  special
power to reduce crime. Instead, in many countries it has been shown to be  a
desire for vengeance masked as a principle of justice.

The second protocol is also submitted to this House to be endorsed.

Debate concluded.

Report adopted in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:14.
