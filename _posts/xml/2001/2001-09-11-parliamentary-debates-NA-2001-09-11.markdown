                            WELCOMING OF MEMBERS

The SPEAKER: Order! I wish to welcome hon members back to  this  House.  The
consolation  is  that  this  is  the  last  session  before  the   Christmas
festivities break, so this is something to look forward to. But  I  think  I
should remind members that we have a hard slog ahead of us.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1)  notes  with  grave  concern  the  ongoing  revelations  of   alleged
       corruption by DA councillors in the Cape Town City Council such as -


       (a)  the vote-rigging by the DA on the street name fiasco;


       (b)  the DA's houses for friends and family policy;


       (c)  selling of housing application forms for R20 to R30;


       (d)  the illegal selling of houses by DA councillors; and


       (e)  theft under false pretences by a DA organiser;


  (2) believes that these allegations reflect that the DA is unable to deal
       effectively with corrupt members in its own ranks; and


  (3) calls on the DA to act decisively with regard to its members who have
       been involved in municipal corruption.

[Applause.]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  the shortsighted decision by the  South  African  Government  to
           delay the  process  allowing  the  US  Navy  flagship,  the  USS
           Enterprise, docking rights in Cape Town;


       (b)  that this delay could deny the South African Navy exposure to  a
           foreign vessel of this nature and importance and has compromised
           further visits by similar ships to the country; and


       (c)  that the country could lose an input of about R20  million  into
           the local economy and the possibility of promoting  the  country
           as a future tourist destination to  the  crew  of  about  6  000
           members;


  (2) further notes that this  visit  is  of  great  strategic,  political,
       economic and symbolic importance to South  Africa  and  the  Southern
       African region; and


  (3) urges the Government to make every effort to accommodate  the  United
       States government before 3 o'clock this afternoon, which  is  the  US
       Navy's deadline for a decision.
[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) appreciates the macroeconomic training given to Members of Parliament
       on 3 to 5 September 2001;


  (2) further appreciates the USAID programme for sponsoring the course  in
       order for members to understand the complex nature of macroeconomics;


  (3) applauds the quality of teaching by the lecturers from the University
       of the Western Cape; and
  (4) because of the globalising effects of the world  economies,  supports
       the proposed one-year diploma course in Macroeconomics for Members of
       Parliament next year.

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Umsobomvu Fund has opened its office  and  will  begin
       disbursing funds for youth development from early next year;


  (2) recognises that the fund has three broad programmes which consist  of
       -


       (a)  a youth information service to  provide  information  on  skills
           development, career guidance, entrepreneurship through  existing
           community facilities;
       (b)  a  skills  development  and  transfer  programme  that  includes
           community service; and


       (c)  a youth entrepreneurship programme to fund young  entrepreneurs;
           and


  (3) welcomes the progress made with regard  to  this  fund  and  commends
       Government for the painstaking groundwork it has  done  in  order  to
       ensure that this fund fulfils its mandate of  youth  development  and
       job creation.

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the distressing state of  the  economy  in  the  light  of  the
       following:


       (a)  the value of the rand against the US dollar has dropped by  more
           than 142% since the ANC came to power;


       (b)  South Africa is  only  expected  to  achieve  domestic  economic
           growth of about 2,5% compared to countries  such  as  China  and
           India, which expect growth rates of 7,8% and 5,7%; and


       (c)  Government still chooses to blame the decline  of  the  rand  on
           external forces and other questionable theories; and


  (2) calls on Government to take proactive fiscal measures and to  set  an
       example of overall efficiency, in order to rid itself of an image  of
       being a government  conducting  silent  diplomacy  and  resorting  to
       crisis management.

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its dismay at the comments by President Mbeki regarding the
       spending priorities of Government in relation to HIV/Aids;


  (2) acknowledges that HIV/Aids is one of the  single  biggest  challenges
       facing South Africa, with the projected costs of  dealing  with  Aids
       orphans alone estimated to run into billions in the near future;


  (3) unequivocally distances  itself  from  any  argument  that  seeks  to
       dismiss or obscure the magnitude of this challenge; and


  (4) recognises the urgent need for Parliament to have an  active  say  in
       the allocation of budgetary  resources,  especially  with  regard  to
       social spending which  must  be  aimed  at  turning  constitutionally
       guaranteed social rights into reality.

Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  45 members of the UDM have defected to the ANC  in  the  Western
           Cape; and


       (b)  these members have seen beyond the facade of  the  UDM  and  its
           lack of policies; and


  (2) welcomes the comrades back home to the ANC which is the only  vehicle
       for change and a better life for all the people.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -
  (1) commends the leaders of SADC for publicly chastising  the  Zimbabwean
       President for the way in which he  has  handled  his  country's  land
       crisis;


  (2) endorses the contention of the SADC chairperson,  Malawian  President
       Bakili Muluzi, that the rule of law was being thwarted in Mr Mugabe's
       land reform drive;


  (3) notes that the leaders of SADC have acknowledged that state-sponsored
       land invasions and violence were to blame for the  current  political
       and economic woes in that country;


  (4) appeals to these leaders, especially our own President Mbeki, not  to
       let the Zimbabwean President off the hook until he restores the  rule
       of law in his country; and


  (5) calls on Mr Mugabe and his  cabinet  to  observe  and  implement  the
       Nigerian-brokered deal to end their controversial land seizure drive,
       in exchange for funds to  implement  a  fair  and  just  land  reform
       programme.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem -


       (a)  van die korrupsie en wanadministrasie wat  na  bewering  by  die
           Poskantoor plaasgevind het; en


       (b)  dat die Poskantoor geruime tyd gelede al hierdie saak onder  die
           aandag van die verantwoordelike Minister, me Casaburri,  gebring
           het;


  (2) sy misnoeë uitspreek dat die Minister  met  die  inligting  tot  haar
       beskikking nie reeds vroeër 'n ondersoek na hierdie  bewerings  gelas
       het nie; en
  (3) verder daarvan kennis neem dat die VF gister in  'n  skrywe  aan  die
       Openbare  Beskermer  gevra  het  dat  die   beweerde   korrupsie   en
       wanadministrasie by die Poskantoor volledig ondersoek word  aangesien
       dit die enigste wyse is  waarop  die  onduidelikhede  rondom  hierdie
       bewerings oor die Poskantoor tot bevrediging van almal opgeklaar  kan
       word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the corruption and maladministration which have allegedly  taken
           place at the Post Office; and


       (b)  that considerable time has elapsed since the Post Office brought
           this matter to the attention of  the  responsible  Minister,  Ms
           Casaburri;


  (2) expresses its displeasure that the Minister, with the information  at
       her disposal, failed to  order  an  early  investigation  into  these
       allegations at an earlier date; and


  (3) further notes that  yesterday,  in  correspondence  with  the  Public
       Protector,  the  FF  requested  that  the  alleged   corruption   and
       maladministration at the  Post  Office  be  thoroughly  investigated,
       since that is the only way in which  the  uncertainties  about  these
       allegations regarding the Post Office can be cleared up to everyone's
       satisfaction.]

Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the crude attempts by the PAC  to  gain  political  support  by
       undermining  the  Government's  land   redistribution   and   housing
       policies;


  (2) deplores the actions of  the  PAC,  which  seeks  to  make  political
       capital out of the aspirations of the poor by undermining the rule of
       law at the expense of democratic and social transformation; and


  (3) condemns such misleading promises by PAC Members to provide land, the
       encouraging of landless people to occupy land and threats to  support
       violent means of obtaining land which are the pitiful last resort  of
       a party that has failed  in  the  last   two  elections  to  win  any
       meaningful support from the electorate.

[Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, I  hereby  give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the Commonwealth task group led by Nigeria on its  firm
       stance taken on the lawlessness in Zimbabwe;


  (2) commends SADC under the chairmanship of the president of  Malawi  for
       initiating a  face-to-face  meeting  with  President  Mugabe  on  the
       serious situation in his country and the grave implications this  has
       for the region; and


  (3) urges President Mbeki, as a member of the SADC Group  of  Presidents,
       to do all he can to get President Mugabe not only to accept the Abuja
       Agreement in principle, but  to  implement  it  in  practice  without
       delay, so as to ensure that -


       (a)   land  settlement  takes  place  in  an  orderly,   lawful   and
           sustainable manner;


       (b)  the illegal invasions of property cease;


       (c)  the rule of law is restored;


       (d)  political intimidation ...

[Time expired.]

Mr V B NDLOVU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next  sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) sadly notes that statistics on child abuse are  soaring  despite  the
       fact that most cases are not reported;


  (2) further notes with sadness that such  abuse  does  not  only  involve
       assault but also the rape of young children; and
  (3) calls upon the criminal justice system to enforce the full  might  of
       the law to allay public fears  and  stall  the  criminals'  malicious
       activity.

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the month of September began with our national  celebration
           of Arbor Week, with the theme ``Trees are Life''; and


       (b)  with great satisfaction the  timely  launch  of  Singala  Trust,
           which marks the first time in South Africa's history that  rural
           communities gain a stake in the forestry industry; and


  (2) commends -


       (a)  communities throughout the country who participated by  planting
           trees at schools, parks and their homes; and


       (b)  the Government for continuing to deliver on its promise to  make
           restructuring work for all South Africans.

[Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the  next  sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the widespread financial irregularities and serious allegations
       of corruption in the South African Post Office;


  (2)  therefore  welcomes  the  media  briefing   by   the   Minister   of
       Communications, although certain questions still remain unanswered;
  (3) once again call on the Minister to make the details  known  regarding
       aspects such as -


       (a)  the R1 billion borrowed from the Post Bank;


       (b)  why the parastatal degenerated to the point of  needing  such  a
           large loan;


       (c)  negotiations between the Post Office  and  Cabinet  regarding  a
           financial recovery package;


       (d)  the possible relocation of its head office to Johannesburg; and


       (e)  the findings of the forensic auditing firm concerning  financial
           irregularities in South African post offices; and


  (4) believes that it is a  pity  that  the  Minister  did  not  use  this
       opportunity to dispel the cloud  of  speculation  hovering  over  the
       parastatal.
                   WELCOMING OF DELEGATION FROM STATE DUMA

The SPEAKER: Order! I wish to recognise and acknowledge the presence in  the
House of a delegation led by the Speaker and Chairperson of the  State  Duma
of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. [Applause.]

We welcome this delegation and hope that  it  marks  the  beginning  of  the
relation between this Parliament and the  State  Duma.  We  now  proceed  to
motions without notice.

       (a)  van die besondere  atletiekseisoen  wat  Hestrie  Cloete,  Suid-
           Afrika     se     hoogspring-wêreldkampioen     en     Olimpiese

           Welwillendheidspele en by die Wêreldbyeenkoms verower het; en


       (c)  dat sy hierdie absoluut briljante vertonings opgevolg  het  deur
           die hoogspringkompetisie van die IAAF see Grand Prix-reeks in te
           palm; en


  (2) van mening is dat Hestrie Cloete inderdaad 'n atletiekster in eie reg
       is en 'n rolmodel waarop alle Suid-Afrikaners opreg trots kan wees.

Goedgekeur. (Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -
  (1) notes with pride -


       (a)  the exceptional athletics  season  that  Hestrie  Cloete,  South
           Africa's world high jump champion and Olympic silver  medallist,
           has had;


       (b)  that, amongst others, Hestrie won a gold medal at  the  Goodwill
           Games and at the World Championships; and


       (c)  that she followed these  absolutely  brilliant  performances  by
           winning the high jump  competition  of  the  IAAF's  Grand  Prix
           Series; and


  (2) is of the opinion that Hestrie Cloete is, indeed, an  athletics  star
       in her own right and a role model of whom all South Africans  can  be
       truly proud.

Agreed to.]

     COMPLETION OF TASK OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON POWERS AND PRIVILEGES OF

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, with reference to the resolution adopted by the House  on  5  April
  2001, the Ad Hoc Committee on Powers and Privileges of Parliament  is  to
  complete its task by no later than 2 November 2001.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                          (The late Mr G A M Mbeki)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  draft
resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:
  That the House -


  (1) notes the passing on of Comrade Govan "Oom Gov" Mbeki, a stalwart  of
       the struggle for the liberation of the people of South Africa;


  (2) recognises the valuable contribution he made -


       (a)  as an educator, publicist and revolutionary intellectual;


       (b)  as a freedom fighter and champion of the cause of the poor;


       (c)  as Deputy President of the  then  Senate  in  strengthening  our
           democracy; and


       (d)  in the selfless sacrifices in  the  struggle  for  the  freedom,
           democracy and building of a united nation in South Africa;


     (3)    believes that he served the nation with dedication and  will  be
         an inspiration to future generations; and


     (4)    expresses its condolences to his wife, his  son  the  President,
         and the entire Mbeki family, knowing that the whole  nation  mourns
         the loss of this noble son of Africa.

I request that members observe a moment of silence at the end of the  debate
in honour of Mr  Govan  Mbeki,  as  he  was  a  presiding  officer  of  this
Parliament.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I would suggest that we  observe  a  moment
of silence now, rather than at the end of the debate when we would  have  to
move a new motion. So, would hon members please rise and  observe  a  moment
of silence.

Thank you, hon members. Please be seated.  The  motion  and  the  sentiments
therein will be conveyed to the President and to the Mbeki family.
Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, the DP associates itself fully with the  motion
of  tribute  to  the  late  Govan  Mbeki.  We,  too,  wish  to  express  our
condolences and sympathy with the members  of  the  Mbeki  family  on  their
great personal loss. We mourn his passing, and yet, at  the  same  time,  we
give thanks for the tremendous contribution he made to the cause of  freedom
and democracy in our country.

Govan Mbeki is rightly hailed today as one of the giants of  the  liberation
struggle. He was a man of many talents and many parts; at  times  he  was  a
teacher, a trader, an author, an  editor.  He  was  one  of  the  liberation
movement's foremost intellectuals. He was a detainee, a political  prisoner,
a political activist, a party organiser. He  was  a  compelling  leader  who
never lost the common touch, nor contact with the people.

As a young man, Govan was deeply moved by the  deprivations  and  injustices
suffered by black South Africans. These things lit inside  of  him  a  flame
that  no  amount  of  detention,  imprisonment,   victimisation,   bullying,
harassment by the state, or,  indeed,  setbacks  or  disappointments,  could
extinguish, for Govan devoted his energy and skills, indeed his whole  life,
to the liberation of his people from the prison  of  poverty  and  from  the
bondage of racism and apartheid.

In recent years, when he served in the Senate  and  the  NCOP,  Govan  Mbeki
became known by his  colleagues  for  his  courtesy,  his  dignity  and  his
mildness of manner. But behind these gentle attributes was  a  toughness  of
mind, a strength of will,  a  fierce  determination  to  ensure  that  these
ideals in which he believed would become realities in South Africa.

I believe that his life contains in  it  a  lesson  for  every  young  South
African. It is this: ``Hang in there. Don't give  up.  Don't  stop  fighting
for the ideals in which you believe. Never lose faith  in  your  ability  to
succeed.''

And so we say to a great son of South Africa  today:  ``We  salute  you.  We
honour you for the sacrifices you made so that we today and generations  yet
to come can enjoy freedom and dignity. We thank  you  for  the  example  you
set. Rest in peace, Oom Gov, your legacy lives on in  your  beloved  land.''
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND  SECURITY:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,
regrettably we have been allowed only two minutes each to say what we  would
like to say about the late Govan Mbeki. I think there is a great  deal  that
could have been said  and  placed  on  record  in  Hansard  so  that  future
generations should have the opportunity to understand what kind of a man  we
were dealing with.

The first thing I would like to say is that a  characteristic  of  the  late
Govan Mbeki was the way in which  he  was  able  to  make  very  strong  and
devoted friends. Those friends of his who have hardly been mentioned in  all
that has been written about him - a few have been mentioned - were  faithful
friends to whom he was faithful for most of his life. I will mention a few.

There was the botanist and academic Eddie Roux, who  is  well-known  as  the
author of a book on the liberation movement called Time  Longer  Than  Rope.
He was responsible for that book, and a lot of us learnt a lot from him.

There was also Dr Sader, a member of the Natal Indian Congress,  who  was  a
great friend of the late Mbeki. They worked together in Ladysmith  for  many
years and I am sure he would have  liked  people  to  know  about  his  true
friendship with Dr Sader.

He was a great friend of Tolley  Bennun,  who  was  an  industrialist;  some
people would say a capitalist. And I see these days  it  is  said  that  one
cannot have capitalists in the Communist Party. I would remind  people  that
one of the founders of  communism  was  Engels,  and  Friedrich  Engels  was
undoubtedly a capitalist. [Laughter.]

I also wish to mention Christopher Gell, who was struck down with polio.  He
came from India and ended up in Port Elizabeth - a prolific writer  who  was
a very great friend of Govan Mbeki. He spoke of him endlessly all his  life.
Christopher Gell was a liberal, he was not a communist, and he was  a  great
friend of Govan Mbeki  the  communist.  That  is  another  lesson  that  hon
members need to learn.

Govan Mbeki was also an admirer of the Rev J A Calata,  an  Anglican  priest
from Cradock, who was one of his greatest friends. Because  I  do  not  have
more time, I will mention a lifelong friend of his, the teacher Mjamba,  who
was a teacher in King Williams Town. The two of them shared something  which
has not been mentioned in all that has been spoken  and  written  about  Oom
Gov in the last few weeks, namely his love  of  the  Xhosa  language.  Govan
Mbeki was a Xhosa linguist. He loved the language. He loved the  great  poet
Mqhayi and often referred to Mqhayi's wheel of fortune, which  Mbeki  called
Ivili lika, Mqhayi. Oom Gov would  warn  us  about  the  way  the  wheel  of
fortune can determine people's lives, and he would say something like:


  Ivili likaMqhayi.
  Golokoqo, goqo, goqo.
  Ath' obe phezulu, abe sezantsi.
  Ath' obe sezantsi abe phezulu.
  Golokoqo, goqo, goqo.
  Cingcilili!
  (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)


  [Mqhayi's wheel of fortune.
  Turning and turning.
  With one going up and down, while the other goes down and up again.
  Turning and turning.]
[Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHYS: Madam Speaker, according to a Sunday newspaper,  the  late
Govan Mbeki, when still a young man, gave up his pipe so  that  if  arrested
and jailed, he would not be forced into tobacco dependency.  Hopefully,  our
hon President will turn out to be a chip off the old block.

Allen Drury was correct when he described South Africa in the sixties  as  a
very strange society. It still is. Imagine  a  lifelong  revolutionary,  who
fought against the predominantly Afrikaner-led government, ending  up  being
called ``Oom Gov'' by everyone. It gives me hope for the future, because  we
lived in different worlds at the time.

Many of us knew Govan Mbeki only as  accused  number  four  in  the  Rivonia
trial. It was only after his release in 1987 that  a  different  picture  of
him emerged, namely that of a remarkable and great leader of his people.

Woodrow Wilson, former US President, once said that he would rather fail  in
the service of a cause he knew would ultimately succeed than succeed in  the
service of a cause he knew would  ultimately  fail.  The  late  Govan  Mbeki
should be honoured for having done just that.

On behalf of the New NP, I want to convey our  sincere  condolences  to  the
ANC, who lost a great leader, to the bereaved family who lost  someone  dear
to them and to the hon the President, who lost a beloved father. We  support
the motion. [Applause.]

Njing L  M  MBADI:  Mhlalingaphambili,  thina  siyi-UDM  siphakamisa  ilizwi
lovelwano kukuwa komthi omkhulu u``Oom Gov''.  Mongameli,  Sekela-Mongameli,
baphathiswa noogxa bam, ndivumeleni  nam,  egameni  le-UDM,  ndithi  tutwini
kumaZizi eli lizwe,  ngakumbi  kwindlu  yakwaMbeki  enkulu  yabo  enguThabo,
uMongameli wethu.

Iinkqwithela, izivuthuvuthu zomoya, izichotho nazo zonke  iintshaba  zemithi
aziwenzanga nto lo  mthi  ungu  ``Oom  Gov''.  UZizi  yena  uwiswe  kukuguga
komzimba, ukulandela nokuvumela ibango lendalo.  Umhlaba  emhlabeni,  uthuli
eluthulini, uthuthu eluthuthwini. Leyo yindlela athabathe ngayo  okukokwakhe
uThixo emntwini, umphefumlo.

Kukhulu    esikufunde    kweli    qhawe    lasemaZizini,    inkcubabuchopho,
isitatanyiswa, ititshala esasaze  ulwazi  ngeendlela  ngeendlela:  Sifundile
apha kuye ukuba ubunkokeli asikokuma  entabeni  ukhwebe  abantu.  Yihla  uye
kubo, uhlale nabo, wabelane nabo kwintlalo abayihleliyo khona  ukuze  ukwazi
ukunyusa nokuphakamisa umgangatho wentlalo yabo.

Sikwafunde nokuba ukunconywa kude kudaleke isifombo asibo  bunkokeli  bububo
obo.  Makuqaqambe  imisebenzi  phakathi  kwabantu.  UZizi  wancama   ukufuya
iinkomo ezilalini; endaweni yoko wafuya  umntu.  Sizivile  iintetho  zabantu
zisiwa  ngokuwa  zincoma  eli  gorha  lamagorha.  Asizanga  kuthunuka   mntu
ngokuphinda esekuthethiwe. Masifunde  kwakule  yokuzikhethela  ukuya  kulala
phakathi  kwabantu  abahluphekileyo.  Usibonisa   nzulu   ukuba   engcwabeni
kuyalinganwa, akukho sityebi nahlwempu.

Kukho, bethu, phakathi kwamalungu apha endithe ndakubona ngasonye  ngorhatya
lwemivundla ngoMgqibelo umhla we-8  kuSeptemba  walo  nyaka.  Bonke  abalele
ukufa kumangcwaba aseZwide bavuke bathontelana phezu kwengcwaba  lika  ``Oom
Gov'', bamamkela  besithi,  ngazwinye:  ``Ubunathi  ekuhlaleni;  usekwanathi
ekufeni''.

Yamkeleni maZizi nani malungu e-ANC noluntu ngokubanzi into  yokuhamba  kuka
`Oom Gov'. Sithi abaya kuya kuye. Yena uphumle ngoxolo  unaphakade.  Inkonzo
ka`Oom Gov' ibe nembeko, isidima, isihomo nesithozela. Iculo: Menze  aphumle
ngonaphakade, umkhanyisele ngokhanyiso olungacimiyo.
(Translation of Xhosa speech follows.)

[Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, we as the UDM wish to convey  our  condolences
to the Mbeki family for the loss they are suffering because of the  fall  of
this big and honourable  person,  ``Oom  Gov''.  Mr  President,  hon  Deputy
President, hon Ministers and my colleagues,  please  allow  me  to  say,  on
behalf of the UDM, that we are deeply  touched  and  are  feeling  the  pain
together with all the people from the Zizi (Dlamini) clan, particularly  the
Mbeki family from which our hon President comes.

``Oom Gov'' endured all kinds of discrimination  and  bad  incidents  during
his lifetime; his enemies never succeeded in all their efforts to  persecute
him. Zizi died from old age; he let nature take its course. Earth to  earth,
dust to dust and ashes to ashes. That is how  God  determined  the  fate  of
man, taking what is His, the soul.

There is a lot that we learnt from this great man from  the  Zizi  clan,  an
intelligent man, a honourable man and a teacher who  disseminated  knowledge
and shared information in many different  ways.  From  him  we  learnt  that
leadership is not about standing on top of a  mountain  and  shouting  empty
promises to people. We learnt that one should come down, live  with  people,
and share with them their daily experiences so  as  to  uplift  and  develop
their standard of living.

We also learnt that too much praise does not create good leaders. It is  the
works of an individual that must shine among people.  Zizi  gave  up  cattle
farming in the villages and decided to look  after  people.  We  have  heard
speeches delivered by different people praising this hero. We have not  come
to open up healing wounds by repeating what had been  said.  His  choice  of
wanting to be buried among the poor is a lesson on its own. He is trying  to
show us that in the grave, everybody is equal; there is neither a  rich  nor
a poor person.

On Saturday evening, 8 September 2001 I had a vision. I saw  all  those  who
are lying dead in the graves at Zwide surrounding the grave of  ``Oom  Gov''
and uttering words of welcome: ``You were with us when we were still  alive;
you are still with us in death.''

Please accept this loss of ``Oom Gov'' and  suffer  silently  you  from  the
Zizi clan, members of the ANC and people in general. It is us  who  will  go
to him. He is resting  in  peace  where  he  is.  His  funeral  service  was
conducted with all the dignity it required.

Hymn: Let him rest in peace forever,
       And may the light never cease.]]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, I rise to support the motion as it  appears
on the Order Paper. On behalf of the ACDP, I want to echo the sentiments  of
many of my colleagues and convey  our  condolences  to  the  President,  his
wife, his mother and members of the Mbeki  family  on  the  death  of  their
loved one, who was one of the great inspiring leaders that this country  has
produced.

The late Govan ``Oom Gov'' Mbeki was a hero to the  majority  of  people  in
this country and an inspiring leader to  those  who  had  the  privilege  of
being under his influence. May his family and friends take  comfort  in  the
words of Jesus Christ who said:


  I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even
  though he dies ...

The ACDP extends its gratitude to the late Govan ``Oom Gov'' Mbeki  for  his
selflessness in the struggle for freedom, justice and democracy. His  family
paid dearly because of his involvement in the fight for change. We wish  his
family long life and the blessings of God. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, there is a saying that peace is better  than
war because in wartime fathers bury their sons and in  peacetime  sons  bury
their fathers. Mr Govan Mbeki lived in turbulent times but was lucky  to  be
buried by his sons in peacetime.

Mr Govan Mbeki was a teacher, a mentor and a role model for  South  Africa's
President, Mr Thabo Mbeki. I think I understand President  Mbeki's  loss  as
my father was also a teacher, a mentor and a role model for  me.  My  father
died only a few weeks before I was elected to  Parliament.  Mr  Govan  Mbeki
was privileged to be present when his son became President of South  Africa.


A previous speaker compared Mr Mbeki to a tree.  There  is  an  old  proverb
known to woodsmen working in the forest that says a tree  is  best  measured
when it is down. The reaction here today confirms that.

On behalf of the FF I convey our condolences  and  sympathy  to  Mrs  Mbeki,
President Mbeki, his brother Moeletsi, his sister Linda and the rest of  the
family.

The English word ``uncle'' is not the same as the  Afrikaans  word  ``oom''.
In English, the word ``uncle'' is used to describe  a  family  relative;  in
Afrikaans the word ``oom'' is used to show respect to  someone,  whether  he
is a relative or not. The FF says: Hamba kahle, Oom Gov. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, the  UCDP  would  like  to  express  its
sincere condolences to the family of Mr Govan Mbeki. Our  hearts  and  minds
are with them during this trying time.

To President Thabo Mbeki, we understand how painful it is to lose  a  person
he clearly loved so much. Mr Govan Mbeki was a role model, a teacher  and  a
political mentor to many children, with whom his children  and  wife  shared
him. It is common knowledge that the ANC was his  family  and  the  struggle
his life.

The feeling of loss is also  felt  by  many  South  Africans  and  non-South
Africans alike, who came into contact with Govan Mbeki or  ``Oom  Gov'',  as
he was affectionately known. He loved his country to such an extent that  he
was always prepared to fight for his entire life to liberate it.

Mr Govan Mbeki played an important role in  the  history  of  South  African
politics since his early days and during the  democratisation  process,  and
continued to play an active role until God retired him.
Mr Mbeki was an achiever of repute. As such, we  should  mourn  his  passing
away with dignity, that  befits  his  status  as  a  humble  but  determined
freedom fighter. He, with other leaders who are no longer with  us,  laid  a
solid foundation for a new and equal society for  our  children  and  future
generations. For that we salute him.

However, we take solace in the fact  that  throughout  his  life,  Mr  Mbeki
sought to find peace where there was none. He  strove  to  ensure  that  all
have freedom of movement and association. Surely, all  South  Africans  will
treasure the fact that we rubbed shoulders and breathed the same  air  as  a
great man like ``Oom Gov''.

The UCDP extends its condolences to the head of state, the  family,  members
of the ANC and all South Africans for the loss of a life so well  spent.  We
say: ``Lala ngoxolo'' [rest in peace] to the son of the soil. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, I express condolences on behalf of the PAC  of
Azania to the Mbeki family, the ANC and the nation.  Mr  Mbeki's  leadership
of the ANC in the Eastern Cape and his  influence  on  generations  of  Fort
Hare students started a career that  was  to  lead  to  Rivonia  and  Robben
Island.

When he was released from Robben Island a little before the  others,  mainly
because of failing health, I visited him  in  Port  Elizabeth.  And  here  I
found a dignified leader  looking  remarkably  well,  and  still  with  very
impressive ideas. It was a pleasure to reminiscence about Robben Island.  Mr
Mbeki was clearly one of the outstanding  intellectuals  of  the  liberation
struggle.

I also remember an incident which happened at Tuynhuys just next door  here.
A delegation of church leaders came to see the former Prime Minister,  Mr  P
W Botha, about the political situation in the  country.  The  interview  was
very rough, as usual.  Mr  Botha  was  particularly  angry  with  Mr  Mbeki,
because on his release he said that he had not changed his  political  ideas
and was still a communist. Mr Botha wagged his finger at us and  said:  ``Go
and tell that Mbeki of yours that I will crush him.''

This level of anger was puzzling to us because,  amongst  other  things,  we
had congratulated him on  the  release  of  Mr  Mbeki  and  other  political
prisoners. But in that anger lay a compliment to Mr Mbeki, that he  had  not
changed his political convictions. That in itself is a compliment.

I also want to recall that Medunsa conferred an  honorary  doctorate  on  Mr
Mbeki, and as a Chancellor, I  had  the  unique  honour  of  conferring  the
degree upon him. I am very proud to speak on  this  occasion  as  Parliament
pays tribute to him.

We thank the Mbeki family for their great contribution to South  Africa  and
we thank God for the life of Govan Mbeki. [Applause.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Agb mev die Speaker, die  kenmerk  van  Govan  Mbeki  se
lewe is die toewyding aan 'n  ideaal  wat  hy  nagestreef  het.  Hy  het  'n
belangrike rol in die ANC se geskiedenis vervul en is  deur  partygenote  en
deur almal daarvoor geeëer. Ek het die voorreg gehad om in 1994  in  die  ou
Senaat saam met hom te dien. Hy was  leier  van  die  Raad  en  ek  was  die
adjunkleier. Hy was 'n aangename mens  om  mee  saam  te  werk.  Hy  kon  sy
standpunt duidelik en bedaard stel en het geluister na  andere  se  sienings
en menings - 'n eienskap wat ek dink ons almal vandag kan toepas.

As leier van die Raad en veral die Senaat het hy in die begin baie  duidelik
rigting gegee en beslag gegee aan 'n doeltreffende funksionering  en  status
van die Raad en interaksie tussen mense bevorder  om  mekaar  te  leer  ken.
Graag betuig ek namens die  FA  ons  innige  meegevoel  aan  sy  familie  en
naasbestaandes. Hy  laat  aldaar  'n  groot  leemte  na,  wat  net  deur  sy
voorbeeld  en  sy  nagedagtenis  gevul  kan  word.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, a characteristic of Govan  Mbeki's  life
was his dedication to the ideal that he  pursued.  He  played  an  important
role in the history of the ANC and was  honoured  for  that  by  his  fellow
party members and by everyone else. In 1994 I had  the  privilege  to  serve
with him in the old Senate. He was the leader of the House  and  I  was  the
deputy leader. He was a pleasant person to  work  with.  He  could  put  his
point of view clearly and calmly and listened to the views and  opinions  of
others - a characteristic I think all of us may well apply today.

As leader of the House, and the Senate in particular, he  provided  a  great
deal of direction in the beginning  and  gave  substance  to  the  effective
functioning and status of the House and promoted  interaction  among  people
so as to facilitate their getting to know one another. On behalf of the  FA,
I would like to convey our sincere condolences to his  family  and  next-of-
kin. He leaves a huge void, which can only be filled by his example and  his
memory. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the loss of Govan Mbeki marks, as  the  Mail
& Guardian put it, the end of one of the longest and most  heroic  lives  in
liberation politics. Being one of the liberation's  foremost  intellectuals,
he was one of the leading figures in the  ANC  and  the  SACP.  Having  been
sentenced to life imprisonment in 1963, the late Govan Mbeki  dedicated  his
life to the liberation of South Africa and  has  seen  us  through  to  such
liberation. He gave us his  son,  Thabo  Mbeki,  as  the  President  of  our
country. The MF expresses its heartfelt  condolences  to  the  ANC  and  the
bereaved family, and grieves the departure of such an admirable soul.

May I at this point in time  take  this  opportunity  also  to  express  our
condolences to Dr Christian Barnard's family  on  the  loss  of  the  world-
renowned cardiac surgeon. Dr Christian Barnard is also mourned. Having  been
the first to successfully perform a heart transplant at  the  Groote  Schuur
hospital 30 years ago, his cardiac work has served  as  an  inspiration  and
hope to many. He passed away whilst he was  on  business  connected  to  the
Christian Barnard foundation. Thus, he may be laid to  rest,  but  his  work
and teachings will go on. The MF expresses its sincere  condolences  to  the
bereaved family and friends. The loss of this great man has left a huge  gap
in our society. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, miskien is dit  ironies,  maar  persoonlik
het ek meer gehoor en gelees van wyle Govan Mbeki in die week na sy dood  as
in 'n leeftyd daarvoor. Miskien sê dit vir ons iets van die lewe  van  Govan
Mbeki. Alhoewel hy 'n belangrike leier was, was  hy  tog  bestem  om  in  'n
sekere sin 'n agtergrondsfiguur te wees. Hy  was  een  van  die  driemanskap
saam met Mandela en Sisulu. Hy is erken as die  denker,  die  intellektueel,
die een wat miskien die meeste werk agter die skerms gedoen het. Hy  het  'n
lewe van stryd gehad, tog  was  leierskap  in  die  hoogste  poste  hom  nie
beskore nie en daarom moes dit vir hom 'n groot vervulling gewees  het,  toe
sy seun President van die land geword het.

Uiteraard kyk ek vanuit die ander kant van die stryd na sy lewe. Ek  verskil
van sy filosofie, die Marxisme, wat hy tot aan die end aangehang  het,  maar
ek is tog daarvan oortuig dat in die realiteite van daaglikse  regering,  hy
ook met groter realisme na die  daaglikse  probleme  sou  kyk.  Hy  was  die
stigter van Umkhonto we Sizwe  en  dus  'n  voorstander  van  die  gewapende
stryd. Tog was hy 'n sterk voorstander van vreedsame onderhandelinge  en  'n
vreedsame oplossing. 'n Paar aspekte was vir hom belangrik. Die  belang  van
Afrikaans  en  ander  inheemse  tale  was  vir  hom  'n  groot   prioriteit.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, maybe it is  ironic,  but  personally,  I  have
heard and read more about the late Govan Mbeki in  the  week  following  his
death than in a lifetime preceding his death. Maybe that tells us  something
about the life of Govan Mbeki. Although he was an important leader,  he  was
still destined, in  a  certain  sense,  to  remain  one  of  the  peripheral
figures. He was one of the triumvirate alongside Mandela and Sisulu. He  was
acknowledged as the thinker, the intellectual, maybe the one  who  did  most
of the work behind the scenes. He had  a  life  of  struggle,  and  yet  the
highest positions did not come his way and therefore it  must  have  been  a
huge fulfilment when his son became President of the country.

Naturally, I am viewing his life from the other  side  of  the  struggle.  I
disagree with his philosophy, Marxism, which he clung to right to  the  end,
but I am convinced that in the realities of day to day governance, he  would
also have viewed daily problems with greater realism. He was the founder  of
Umkhonto we Sizwe and thus a champion of the armed struggle. Yet  he  was  a
strong supporter of peaceful negotiations and a  peaceful  solution.  A  few
aspects  were  important  to  him.  The  interest  of  Afrikaans  and  other
indigenous languages was a great priority to him.]

It is said that he liked to play and sing songs like  ``Jan  Pierewiet''  on
his guitar.
Hy was 'n  man  vir  versoening  en  was  gekant  teen  polarisasie  in  die
politiek. Die deel van die African Charter wat sê dat Suid-Afrika aan al  sy
mense behoort, was vir hom 'n werklikheid.

[He was a  man  for  reconciliation  and  was  opposed  to  polarisation  in
politics. The part of the African Charter  that  states  that  South  Africa
belongs to all its people was a reality to him.]

Oom Gov also had a good sense of humour. When asked  on  his  90th  birthday
about the secret of his good health and long life, he said that it  was  the
absence of rich food, wine and women during the 23 years that  he  spent  in
prison. [Laughter.] This is a statement with which the  late  Chris  Barnard
definitely did not agree. Most importantly, Mr Mbeki sacrificed a long  life
for the cause in which he believed.  This  conveys  a  message  to  so  many
people with a mere consumer approach to life: of what can I get  from  life,
instead of what can I give to life. The AEB supports the motion.  We  convey
our condolences to the whole family, in particular to  hon  President  Thabo
Mbeki, who lost a respected father. [Applause.]

Mr  A  MLANGENI:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Deputy  President  in  his  absence,
comrades,  the  death  of  ``Oom  Gov''  occasioned  the  sad  loss  of   an
intellectual giant who radiated an unfailing commitment and devotion to  the
struggle for freedom.

He was known as a thinker who could easily  speak  in  simple  language  and
socialise with ordinary people. He was a true compatriot and a democrat  par
excellence. He was an embodiment of what the ANC stands for. He was a  great
statesman who harboured the noble qualities  of  dedication,  sacrifice  and
discipline. He was a person who showed immense empathy for  human  suffering
and compassion for the poor and the oppressed.

Govan  Mbeki  personified  humility,  dignity  and  sophistication.  In  his
honour, former President Mandela said:


  Throughout the years he continued to inspire all of us inside and outside
  prison with the certainty that we would triumph in the end. South  Africa
  mourns the passing of one of Africa's great sons. We salute a comrade,  a
  friend, a leader in  the  struggle,  one  of  the  intellectuals  of  our
  movement and a fellow member of a generation that has given  so  much  to
  the shaping of our country.

In memory of ``Oom Gov'', former Archbishop Desmond Tutu said:


  Our country has been blessed with some quite outstanding  persons,  Govan
  Mbeki was one such. We give thanks  to  God  for  his  quite  substantial
  contribution to our struggle and to the transformation that has  happened
  and is happening in our country.

The General Secretary of Cosatu, Zwelinzima Vavi, paid homage to Oom Gov  by
saying:


  People can be consoled by the fact  that  we  are  a  free  nation  today
  because of his contribution. Oom Gov, one of our country's  most  heroic,
  steadfast and thoughtful  fighters  against  racism,  discrimination  and
  class exploitation ...

The SACP, from which he drew much inspiration,  remembered  him  as  someone
who -


  ... in all his work, distinguished himself as a  scholar,  a  disciplined
  cadre, a builder and a teacher. He built and  sustained  a  tradition  of
  excellent political journalism and theoretical writing.

Bishop Mvume H Dandala reminded the nation:


  A great African hero has died. Govan Mbeki will go down in the annals  of
  history as a man of immense integrity, intellectual capacity; unrelenting
  in his  determination  to  follow  his  own  destiny  on  behalf  of  the
  voiceless, but always a gentleman of stature.

Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,  told  the  world,
and I quote:


  Govan Mbeki's death reminds  us  of  his  enormous  contribution  to  the
  struggle against racism and oppression in South Africa. His memory should
  make us redouble our efforts to achieve a life of dignity free of bigotry
  and intolerance for people around the world.

Our own Deputy President, Jacob Zuma,  in  paying  tribute  to  this  fallen
hero, said:


  The country has, indeed, lost a fine revolutionary intellectual. He could
  easily have led a life of comfort, but  instead  he  chose  to  sacrifice
  everything and fight for the freedom of his people.

The death of Govan Archibald Mvuyelwa Mbeki is a national loss. We  are  all
indebted to him for leading us in a way that is most  worthy  of  emulation.
His life and times were a celebration of a life lived  to  the  fullest.  As
the whole nation mourns,  we  remember  those  closest  to  him,  his  wife,
Epainette; his sons, Moeketsi, our President  Thabo;  and  the  entire  Zizi
clan.

Sitwalandwe, hamba kakuhle! [Rest in peace, hon Mbeki!]

Tsamaya hantle, re a ho lokolla Zizi! [Rest in peace, hon Zizi!]

Long live the spirit of Comrade Mbeki, long live! [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, as I indicated previously,  the  sentiments
will be conveyed to the family.

              MARKETING OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The SPEAKER: Order! The hon the Minister for  Agriculture.  [Interjections.]
Deputy Minister!

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, it  can
be confusing  because  I  sometimes  look  more  beautiful  than  she  does!
[Laughter.]

An HON MEMBER: What a sexist comment!

The DEPUTY MINISTER: No, it is not, man!

What we have in this amending Bill - and I  will  just  focus  on  the  main
points - is that at the moment the Marketing of  Agricultural  Products  Act
has a very  interesting  and  central  operational  role  for  the  relevant
portfolio committee and the NCOP committee with regard  to  the  appointment
of members of the marketing council and the approval  of  certain  marketing
interventions.  This  situation  causes  some  administrative  problems.  It
confuses the roles of the legislature and the executive, which  are  clearly
distinguished in the Constitution, and it also causes lengthy delays.
The Bill aims to streamline these roles in the present Act. I think  we  can
safely say that what we have in this Bill - and this is how I would like  to
typify it - takes us to some position of  maturity.  Maturity,  in  essence,
means taking some responsibility.  I  think  the  responsibilities  are  now
placed where they  should  be,  which  means  that  the  executive  and  the
parliamentary committees can now do what they should do.

The old marketing Act was a complete control system  for  the  marketing  of
agricultural  products.  It  was  possible  to  regulate  the  marketing  of
agricultural products by declaring them controlled  products,  and  a  whole
system was in place. With the introduction of the amendments  in  1996,  the
whole profile of the marketing  of  agricultural  products  was  drastically
done away with. We abolished the elaborate control measures  and  introduced
a free-market system.

It was really a revolution. A new  order  was  put  in  place  and  in  that
process the parliamentary committees were given a significant role  to  play
in the implementation of the Act. It should also be seen within the  context
of the Government of National Unity, which was in place at that stage.

However, that transition has been largely completed and the handing down  of
the  Constitutional  Court  decision  in  the  Heath  matter  has  made   it
imperative for us to distinguish between the functions of  the  legislature,
judiciary and executive. The Act is mainly being amended  now  in  order  to
provide for that.

I was saying  that  we  are  moving  into  maturity.  Maturity  consists  in
clarifying the form that social organisations take  in  a  given  epoch.  It
judges the adequacy of our institutions,  as  we  are  doing  now  with  the
marketing  council,  for  promoting  human  community   and   for   assuming
responsibility both for the way these institutions are and for  making  them
more adequate.

What should an executive do? An executive  puts  into  effect  and  executes
laws. It gives practical expression to what should be done in  the  national
interest. The practical necessities  of  parliamentary  government  make  it
necessary for Parliament to trust the executive to govern.  But,  Parliament
retains the right of ultimate control over the  executive.  It  retains  the
right to amend, criticise, question and, in the last resort, defeat.

What I am saying is that what we are doing in this Bill  is  exactly  giving
substance  to  those  objectives.  On  the  one  hand,   the   parliamentary
committees' role in appointing  the  council  and  market  interventions  is
given to the executive, while on the other provision is made  for  reporting
to parliamentary committees when the executive has done  something  in  this
regard and when they have appointed members of the council. In that way  the
accountability of the executive to Parliament is given expression.

There is a wider dimension to what we are  doing  here  today.  Agricultural
marketing is of primary importance  in  this  wave  of  globalisation  which
marks our epoch. There is a major shift of historical dimensions which  give
us our modernity. These simple amendments that we are  effecting  today  are
very much part of this challenge. It is needless to mention the data on  the
social and economic situation of Africa where entire countries  and  regions
are at risk as  a  result  of  complex  combinations  of  economic  factors,
excruciating poverty and grave diseases. The major cause of this  is  global
marketing conditions, the huge  and  unpayable  debts,  disparate  terms  of
trade, ruinous prices of basic commodities and  climatic  changes.  This  is
our modernity to which we must answer also in respect of the development  of
our agricultural marketing.

Those are the challenges that we have  to  face.  Sometimes  we  think  that
there is a breakdown pending. But what we  should  do,  which  is  something
that our agricultural marketers have already proved since 1996, is  to  have
an attitude of facing up to the new  order,  and  historically  and  lucidly
facing up to the collapse of the old order. That is what it  means  to  take
responsibility. That is our reaching maturity. I think  that  that  is  what
our task is with regard to the modern marketing order in the world and  that
is my message to the agricultural community in this regard. [Applause.]

Adv S P HOLOMISA: Madam Speaker, hon members, at the initial stages  of  the
transition from apartheid South Africa to the  constitutional  democracy  of
our  day,  it  was  inevitable  that  some  of  the  fundamental  principles
underpinning normal democracies would be somewhat compromised  or  confused.
One such principle  was  that  of  the  separation  of  powers  between  the
legislature, the executive and the judiciary.

Constituted as it was with elements of the democratic forces  and  those  of
the apartheid era, the Government  of  National  Unity  had  to  be  closely
guarded  and  monitored  by  Parliament.  Thus  it  became  necessary,   nay
imperative, that parastatals such as  the  National  Agricultural  Marketing
Council, the Agricultural Research Council and others were constituted  with
the active involvement of the relevant parliamentary  committees.  The  Acts
setting them up and regulating their activities also had to be  administered
jointly by the executive and  Parliament.  After  all,  these  councils  had
previously been intended to serve only a tiny minority of our society.
The gradual maturing and development of our democracy, as  well  as  various
pronouncements by the courts on the constitutionality or otherwise  of  some
of the activities of the various arms  of  Government  in  relation  to  the
principle of separation of powers, require that we begin to give  effect  to
the requirements of the Constitution in this regard.

The Marketing of Agricultural Products Amendment Bill,  as  amended  by  the
portfolio committee,  is  a  shining  example  of  how  Parliament  and  the
executive can complement each other in such a way that  none  interferes  in
the area of operation of the other. The Minister is  allowed  to  carry  out
her tasks with regard to the administration of the  Act  in  a  manner  that
allows Parliament to assess and monitor the  proper  implementation  of  the
law. Where previously the parliamentary committees dealing with  agriculture
were involved in the selection and appointment of members  of  the  NAMC  to
the extent of vetoing the decision  of  the  Minister;  this  amending  Bill
merely requires  that  these  committees,  together  with  other  interested
stakeholders,  be  invited  to  submit  names,  if   they   so   wish,   for
consideration by a selection committee set up by the Minister.

The Minister is now required to inform the parliamentary committees  of  the
appointments made, within 30 days of such appointments. Though her  decision
is  final,  this  provision  is  intended  to  afford  the   committees   an
opportunity to establish whether or  not  the  persons  appointed  meet  the
requirements laid down in the law.

In addition to the usual criteria laid down to determine the suitability  of
candidates for public  office,  the  Bill,  as  amended  by  the  committee,
prohibits the appointment of persons who have been found to  be  racist,  in
terms of section 7 of the Promotion of Equality  and  Prevention  of  Unfair
Discrimination Act, No 4 of 2000. We want to ensure that the relics  of  the
past are not part of our present.

Owing to the misunderstanding of the true  intentions  of  the  Ministry  of
Agriculture with regard to  the  Minister's  right  to  prohibit  import  or
export  of  certain  agricultural  products,  some  of   the   organisations
representing the fruit industry thought that the  amending  Bill  sought  to
reintroduce the discredited single-channel practice, which controlled  trade
within the industry to the detriment of free trade.

As  a  result  of  representations  made  to  the  portfolio  committee  and
subsequent explanations, the Bill has been amended to provide for  the  NAMC
to  invite  directly  affected  groups  to  express  their  views  or  lodge
objections  before  the  Minister  can  exercise  her  power  to  impose   a
prohibition on the import or export of certain  agricultural  products  into
or from South Africa.

The Amending Bill further provides for  the  liquidation  of  the  marketing
boards which were set up in the previous era. Moneys that were collected  by
such boards will be transferred to the custody of a body to be decided  upon
by the Minister. The financial affairs of such a body  will  be  subject  to
auditing by the Auditor-General.
The parliamentary committees dealing with agriculture will  continue  to  be
informed of new statutory levies to  be  imposed  on  particular  industrial
groups, even though their approval will no longer be required.

I am happy to report  that,  as  amended,  the  Bill  enjoys  the  full  and
unanimous support of all the parties that play an active role  in  the  work
of the committee. [Applause.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Madam Speaker, the purpose of this amendment, as  also  stated
by the  Deputy  Minister  of  Agriculture,  is  to  improve  the  cumbersome
requirements of bad legislation so that the Department  of  Agriculture  can
function more efficiently, and the DA fully supports that. However,  instead
of doing that,  we  are,  once  again,  being  asked  to  enact  even  worse
legislation that drives  another  nail  into  the  coffin  of  parliamentary
oversight.

As with the amendment  to  the  appointment  of  the  Agricultural  Research
Council, the hon  members  of  the  ANC,  once  again,  demanded  the  total
exclusion of Parliament in the  appointment  of  the  National  Agricultural
Marketing Council. This justifies point 3 of the memorandum on  the  objects
of the Bill, which says in part:


  The amendments would result in a reduction of the  cost  to  appoint  the
  members of the NAMC, especially with regard to  the  involvement  of  the
  relevant parliamentary committees.

Hon members on that side of  the  House  clearly  did  not  value  the  wise
counsel of a great son of Africa, Mr Kofi Annan, who said:


  Over and over again, we have learned, especially  in  Africa,  that  poor
  people's  stomachs  are  not  filled  by  rulers  who  refuse  to  submit
  themselves to the people's judgement.

The portfolio committee  was  promised  that  there  would  be  full  public
participation before this Bill was enacted. Instead, and at  the  behest  of
some fast-driving whips, this amendment has been rammed  through  Parliament
at supersonic speed  in  just  two  weeks.  For  how  long  do  hon  members
responsible for this ghastly sham think they can get away with it?

As we speak, President Mbeki, the leader  of  the  ANC,  is  holding  secret
talks with President Mugabe, the undertaker of Southern African  hopes.  The
talks are secret, because neither the ANC caucus nor the rest of  the  House
was consulted beforehand; nor will there be any report  afterwards,  because
we are told that diplomacy has to  be  silent.  This  apparently  suits  hon
members on that side of the House, because they heed  the  call  to  see  no
evil and hear no evil. On 28 August,  they  rejected  a  proposal  that  the
portfolio committee to investigates the agricultural productive capacity  of
Zimbabwe for the coming season. It does not require a  rocket  scientist  to
realise that the anarchy in that country will severely impact on  the  South
African commodity markets in the coming  season  and  for  some  seasons  to
come.

A  serious  attempt  at  parliamentary  assessment  of  the  food   security
situation in Southern Africa was shot down, by the members on that  side  of
the House, as being party-political posturing. The awful truth is  that  far
too much ANC activity in Parliament is based on  party-political  posturing.
This has resulted in the Auditor-General signing the following report, on  9
July 2001. I quote as follows:


  Since the previous year, the Agricultural  Research  Council's  financial
  position has deteriorated from a cash-flow perspective. It is clear  that
  the current infrastructure and operations cannot be continued in the long
  term with the available funds, and if actions are  not  taken  timeously,
  the Agricultural Research Council might not be a  going  concern  in  the
  near future.


If we should allow that to come to pass, we will  be  called  upon  to  make
another amendment to this Bill soon. That amendment will be  to  rename  the
marketing council the ``import council'', because there will be  nothing  to
market.

Thankfully that day will never  come  to  pass,  because  the  country  will
reject this nonsense of the ANC,  as  we  in  the  DA  proudly  reject  this
nonsense asked of us today. I repeat  that  the  DA  actively  supports  any
improvement  in  legislation,  but  does  not  support  this  amendment,  as
proposed,  because  it  seriously  undermines  the  powers  of   Parliament.
[Applause.]

Mr G B BHENGU: Madam Speaker and honourable  House,  the  IFP  supports  the
amending  Bill  and  has  no  reservations  at  all.  We  believe  that  the
injunction of the Constitution must  never  be  tampered  with,  but  rather
treated with deference.

Parliament has a mandate to promulgated laws and must see to it  that  those
laws are honoured. In this case, Parliament becomes the referee,  seeing  to
it  that  the  rules  of  the  game  are  obeyed.   Therefore,   it   cannot
simultaneously be a player.

The executive, as represented by the Minister,  has  a  mandate  to  execute
what has been legislated by this House. Therefore, it is incumbent upon  the
Minister for Agriculture to appoint members  of  the  National  Agricultural
Marketing Council, because such council will have the duty  to  advise  her,
and not the portfolio committee.

It is therefore administratively unfair to  the  members  of  the  portfolio
committee to recommend names of candidates who should serve on the  advisory
marketing council. We believe that the representivity  of  stakeholders  and
interest groups will be catered for by the Act, and  that  this  process  is
going to be transparent. We also believe that the nominations  from  and  by
such interest groups and stakeholders will not be disallowed in  respect  of
the council just because they do not  have  official  credentials  to  prove
that they have knowledge of or expertise in the  marketing  of  agricultural
products.

We hope that Government's commitment to recognise prior learning  experience
will  count  in  such  interest  groups'  favour.  Previous   sociopolitical
conditions in the country denied other racial  groups  access  to  effective
agricultural marketing.
I would also like to deny what has  been  alleged,  and  that  is  that  the
committee did not unanimously support this Bill, but that it  was  supported
by only one  party.  In  fact,  currently  we  have  a  problem  within  the
marketing  council.  Instead  of  the  Minister  appointing  the   marketing
council, the committee recommended some of the people who are  now  creating
a problem for the department.

When it suites us, we speak of the division  of  power.  But  it  becomes  a
problem when we parliamentarians turn around  and  hold  the  department  to
ransom by saying that we are going to appoint a council to advise us,  where
that council is not going to advise us, but the Minister.

This Bill further says that after the Minister has  appointed  the  council,
she will report to the committee, so that the committee can interrogate  her
and be satisfied that the criteria set in the Bill have been met.  The  Bill
also makes sure that the Minister will see to it that  the  funds  that  are
collected are used for the good of  the  people  in  general.  Most  of  the
agricultural levies must be used in such a way that they are able  to  level
the playing fields, so  that  those  farmers  who  come  from  disadvantaged
groups are enabled to compete on an equal basis with  those  who  have  been
advantaged in the past.

Therefore the IFP supports the amending Bill.

Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, the basic objective of this Bill  is  to  provide
for regulatory measures, and therefore the UDM will support it.

However, I wish to highlight one or two points. Firstly, I have  taken  note
of the arguments advanced by the hon Mr Botha with regard to  the  oversight
function of the Portfolio Committee  on  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs.  I
believe that the task of the executive is to see to it that it  governs  and
that the task of  Parliament,  and  therefore  the  parliamentary  portfolio
committee, is to see that the Government  is  kept  in  check  and  that  it
governs well. And wherever Government fails, then,  of  course,  it  is  the
task of the portfolio committee to take the issue up.
Therefore we are of the view that when  a  body  such  as  the  agricultural
marketing council is appointed, there is a need  for  experts  to  serve  on
that body. I do not think I personally am adequately qualified  to  identify
experts to serve on such a body.

I need to highlight one or two amendments which  are  interesting.  Firstly,
there is an addition in respect of the issue of a person  nominated  to  the
council who is an unrehabilitated insolvent. The provision now provides  for
the trustee of this person's insolvent estate to certify that the  insolvent
is a fit and proper person to serve as a member of the council.

In these unfortunate times, where we have many good people who, as a  result
of financial circumstances, go under, the object should  be  to  see  to  it
that the services of such people are not lost  to  society.  Therefore  such
people should be accommodated.

Another interesting feature  to  which  the  chairperson  of  the  portfolio
committee referred is that if the Minister wishes to impose  a  ban  on  the
importation  of  any  agricultural  product,  she   has   to   consult   the
parliamentary  portfolio  committee.  In  this  particular   instance,   the
amendment provides for the  Minister  to  be  advised  by  the  Agricultural
Marketing Council. Therefore, there  are  some  interesting  features  built
into this amending Bill and we therefore support it.

In view of the shortage of time, I cannot embark  on  discussing  any  other
provisions of this amending Bill. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, whilst the stated intention  of  the  Government
is deregulation, it appears that we are simply moving  from  self-regulation
of the industry to Government regulation. The structure provided for in  the
Bill should in fact  be  a  temporary  one.  But  without  a  sunset  clause
stipulating a five-year expiry date or a five-year  deadline  to  accomplish
its intended goals, it looks set to be  permanent.  In  this  case  we  will
simply be building a new bureaucracy and incurring unnecessary expenses.
The reality is that deregulation of the agricultural  industry  has  so  far
thrown the industry into disarray,  with  research  stations  closing  down,
farmers having to pay for advice or simply not getting any  if  they  cannot
afford it, and animals such as dairy herds  not  being  innoculated  against
tuberculosis. All of these impact negatively on  society,  as  it  pays  the
price of lower quality and higher prices.

What is needed is not deregulation, but self regulation. The ACDP is of  the
opinion  that  the  agricultural  industry  should   regulate   itself   and
Government should seek representation  on  these  structures  to  facilitate
strategic planning and co-operation.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Speaker, having considered  the  Bill  throughout
the committee session  and  the  consultation  processes  with  stakeholders
affected  by  the  proposed  amendment  of  the  Marketing  of  Agricultural
Products Act of 1996, the UCDP viewed the Act in its  current  state  as  in
conflict with the principles of separation of powers  as  contained  in  the
new Constitution of the country in that the Act  does  not  distinguish  the
role of Parliament's committees with the  executive's  implementing  agency.
We therefore support an amendment  aimed  at  streamlining  the  process  to
bring it in line with the Constitution.

We also note the concerns lodged by members of the deciduous fruit  industry
with regard to the Minister's decision to impose any form of prohibition  in
as far as the import and export of agricultural products is  concerned.  The
UCDP is satisfied that adequate provisions  have  been  made  to  allay  and
address  the  fears  of  the  industry  and  stakeholders,  as  it   becomes
compulsory for the  Minister  to  consult  with  the  National  Agricultural
Marketing Council before he or she institutes any  prohibition  with  regard
to the import of products. The UCDP  proposes  that  the  amendment  to  the
Marketing of Agricultural Products Act of 1996 be accepted and  voted  upon.
However, the challenge would lie in the  monitoring  and  implementation  of
the Bill to  ensure  that  its  objectives  are  carried  out  in  the  best
interests of the country and the industry.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Mev die Speaker, die bemarking  van  landbouprodukte  in
Suid-Afrika vind onder die sanksionering van die wet  plaas  en  wel  in  'n
vryemarkomgewing. Die wetwysigings wat ons vandag bespreek, het te doen  met
die bemarking van landbouprodukte, asook  om  die  Minister  van  advies  te
bedien.

Die wysigings is goedgekeur deur die portefeuljekomitee, alhoewel die FA  en
ander opposisiepartye verder sou wou gegaan het en  meer  inspraak  van  die
portefeuljekomitee wou bewerkstellig; nie om die Minister aan  bande  te  lê
in haar keuse nie, maar om te sorg  dat  daar  'n  verteenwoordigende  groep
mense beskikbaar is vir die Minister om te kan aanstel.

Die sukses van die vryemarkstelsel word bepaal, enersyds, dat  daar  so  min
as moontlik ingrepe  gemaak  moet  word  vanaf  owerheidsweë  en  andersyds,
wanneer daar ingrepe gemaak word, dit net beperk  word  tot  maatreëls.  Die
taak en rol van 'n portefeuljekomitee van die  Parlement  om  daarna  om  te
sien dat daar 'n goed verteenwoordigende groep mense op  die  bemarkingsraad
aangestel word, is noodsaaklik. Dit word aansienlik bemoeilik aangesien  die
seleksie en aanstelling van persone feitlik geheel en al binne die  mag  van
die Minister vir Landbou deur die hierdie wetswysigings geplaas word.

Ons ondersteun dus basies die  wetsontwerp,  maar  maak  beswaar  omdat  ons
uitgestem is in die komitee. Die totstandkoming van  'n  vryemark  in  Suid-
Afrika het nie maklik plaasgevind nie. (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, the marketing of  agricultural  products
in South Africa takes place under the sanction of the law and in fact  in  a
free-market environment. The amendments to the Act that  we  are  discussing
today deal with the marketing of agricultural products, as well as  advising
the Minister.

The amendments were approved by the portfolio  committee,  although  the  FA
and other opposition parties would have wanted to go further and  procure  a
greater say by the portfolio committee; not to restrict the Minister in  her
selection, but to ensure that a representative group of people is  available
to the Minister for appointment.

The success of the free-market system is determined, on  the  one  hand,  by
limiting  interventions  by  the  authorities  to  the  minimum  and,   when
intervention takes place, on the other, limiting it  to  essential  measures
only. The task and role of a portfolio committee  of  Parliament  to  ensure
that a well-representative group of people is  appointed  to  the  marketing
council is essential. This is being hampered considerably as  the  selection
and appointment of persons fall virtually entirely under the powers  of  the
Minister for Agriculture owing to these amendments.

We therefore basically support the Bill, but we object to being outvoted  in
the committee. The establishment of a free market in South  Africa  did  not
come about easily.]

We started in South Africa without  any  agricultural  industry  really.  It
developed over time, with interventions by Government, using  schemes  which
helped farmers to such an extent that in the end we could produce much  more
than we needed.

Eventually, infrastructure was developed through the marketing  Acts,  which
were  amended  over  time.  I  think  we  have,  in  the  end,  a   sensible
agricultural policy which functions well in the free market.

However, that is  free-market  entrepreneurship.  The  free  market,  within
which we operate, creates a lot  of  infrastructure  in  which  we  can  now
accommodate landless people, develop new farmers and new industries.

Dit is  moontlik.  Ons  kan  dit  doen,  maar  die  hele  omgewing  wat  die
Wysigingswetsontwerp op Landboubemarking skep,  is  'n  vryemarkomgewing  en
binne hierdie omgewing is dit  net  die  gevestigde  boer  wat  kan  en  sal
oorleef. Die groot probleem binne die Suid-Afrikaanse  landbou  is  dat  die
vryemark, wat op vraag en aanbod reageer,  in  siklusse  begin  beweeg.  Die
arme boer  wat  in  'n  lae  siklus  inkom,  het  nie  'n  kans  as  hy  nie
infrastruktuur of geld het  om  te  kan  oorleef  nie.  Bo  en  behalwe  die
wispelturigheid van die vryemark, sit ons ook nog  met  die  wispelturigheid
van die klimaat. Op watter manier gaan ons dit hanteer?

In die vryemark, wat ons tot ons beskikking het om nuwe boere te  help,  sit
ons met 'n dilemma dat die staat tog een of ander tyd sal moet ingryp om  te
help dat hierdie nuwe toetreders tot die landbou  oorleef.  Alle  hulpskemas
word verwelkom. Die staat help nie eintlik meer die landbou nie, behalwe  in
gevalle van uiterste nood. Iewers sal ons dus in die sisteem  van  bemarking
hiervoor voorsiening moet maak. Ek  wil  'n  ernstige  beroep  doen  op  die
Minister, om te kyk na maniere waarop ons die boere  kan  help  om  hul  eie
fondse op te bou om te gebruik in tye van nood.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[It is possible. We can do this, but the whole environment  created  by  the
Marketing  of  Agricultural  Products  Amendment  Bill  is   a   free-market
environment and it is only the established farmer who can and  will  survive
in this environment. The big problem in South African  agriculture  is  that
the free market, which reacts to demand and supply, has  started  moving  in
cycles. The poor farmer who gets in when the cycle is low does not  stand  a
chance if he does not have the infrastructure or  money  to  survive.  Apart
from the variable nature of the free  market,  we  also  have  the  variable
nature of the climate. In what way are we going to deal with this?

In the free market, which we have at our disposal to help  new  farmers,  we
have the dilemma that the state would have to intervene  at  some  stage  or
other to help these new entrants to agriculture to survive. All aid  schemes
are welcome. The state no longer really aids agriculture,  except  in  cases
of extreme need. We will therefore have to provide  for  this  somewhere  in
the marketing system. I want to appeal seriously to the Minister to look  at
ways in which we could help farmers to build up and use their own  funds  in
times of need.]

There is only one aid scheme which still remains. When  drought  comes  some
farmers sell their livestock, if they have any, then ...

... wat is dit nou weer in Engels?  Hulle  belê  dit  by  die  Landbank  met
rente, maar belastingvry, sodat dit weer aangewend kan  word.  Hierdeur  kan
ons in goeie jare 'n basis opbou waar boere in  swakker  jare  kan  oorleef.
Wanneer hulle dus daardie geld onttrek, kan dit vir belasting in  aanmerking
kom. Dit is 'n belangrike faset wat ons sal moet inbring vir beide  groot-en
kleinboere om sodoende in die nuwe Suid-Afrika met sy  wispelturige  klimaat
en wisselende ekonomie te kan oorleef.

Wat betref die ontwikkeling van kleinboere onder hierdie  wet,  wat  eintlik
tot stand gekom het om kleinboere te help en nou van die tafel  af  verdwyn,
voorsien ek dat daar in die volgende vier jaar weer teruggekeer sal word  na
die gedeeltes van die hulpskemas binne die ou Bemarkingswet.  Die  doel  met
hierdie hulpskemas was nog altyd om krediet te  voorsien,  om  oorlewing  te
voorsien en wat die vele kleinboere wat ontstaan, te help  vestig.  Sou  ons
dit nie doen nie, dan sal hierdie kleinboere vir 'n dag,  'n  jaar  of  twee
jaar oorleef en wanneer die eerste finansiële  of  klimaatskrisis  ontstaan,
sal hulle net verdwyn en sal ons die prys daarvoor betaal.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[... how does one put that in English? They invest it with  the  Land  Bank,
with interest, but tax free, so that it could be used again. In this way  we
could build up a basis in good years, which would enable farmers to  survive
the poorer years. When they therefore  withdraw  that  money,  it  could  be
taken into consideration for tax purposes. This is an important  facet  that
we would have to introduce in respect of both large and  small  farmers,  in
order to survive in the new South  Africa  with  its  variable  climate  and
changing economy.

As regards the development of small farmers under this  law,  which  was  in
fact drafted to help small farmers, but is now disappearing from the  table,
I foresee that within four years there will  be  a  move  back  towards  the
sections of the aid schemes under the old  Marketing  Act.  The  purpose  of
these aid schemes has always been to provide credit, to ensure survival  and
to help establish the many emerging small farmers. If we did  not  do  this,
then these small farmers would survive for a day, a year or  two  years  and
when the  first  financial  or  climatic  crisis  arose  they  would  simply
disappear and we would pay the price.]

It is essential that the Minister gives attention to the  fact  that,  under
the marketing scheme, we provide some form of assistance  to  small  farmers
so that they can survive the difficult  and  harsh  conditions  under  which
South African farming takes place. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the MF compliments  the  department  on  the
amending Bill that brings the Act into line with both the  Constitution  and
the Public Finance Management Act. Further, the  clarification,  enhancement
and elaboration concerning levies have been correctly composed,  as  needed.
The requirement that the National  Agricultural  Marketing  Council  ensures
representation of all affected groups is necessary.

The  MF  acknowledges  the  efforts  that  will  culminate  in  calling  for
nominations  by  the  publication  of  an  invitation  in  the  Gazette  and
departmental  newsletters.  The  MF  suggests  that   further   methods   of
publication should take place made to ensure that this  is  brought  to  the
notice  of  all  parties  concerned.  The  MF  supports  the  Marketing   of
Agricultural Products Amendment Bill.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mev die Speaker, ek glo die agb mnr Botha het  seker  vir  die
Vrystaat senter gespeel, want hy kan  'n  ``gap''  vat.  Ons  is  besig  met
wetgewing  oor  bemarking,  en  dan  maak   hy   'n   draai   in   Zimbabwe.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Die AEB steun die vaartbelyning van prosedure.  Ons  is  nie  'n  party  vir
omslagtige prosedure wat effektiwiteit vertraag  nie.  Ons  het  ook  begrip
daarvoor dat 'n parlementêre portefeuljekomitee  nie  noodwendig  die  beste
instrument is om as 'n keurkomitee in spesialissake te dien nie.  Ons  besef
ook dat die Regering nie 'n kritieke saak soos  landboubemarking  bloot  aan
markkragte kan oorlaat nie. Kos is en bly 'n strategiese middel,  en  daarom
moet daarna gekyk word.

Ons wil wel ons kommer uitspreek dat ons glo, waar  die  taak  nou  aan  die
Minister gegee is, dat daar te min kontrolepunte ingebou is, ook  omdat  die
raad nie verteenwoordigend hoef te wees van sekere belangegroepe  nie,  maar
gewoon spesialiste moet insluit. En, alhoewel dit nie oor 'n  baie  kritieke
saak gaan nie en  ons  die  wetsontwerp  nie  sal  teenstaan  nie,  wil  ons
daarteen waarsku dat prosedure vergemaklik word  deur  bloot  alles  in  die
hande van die Minister te laat. Ons kan nie sentraliseer nie, maar ons  moet
wel spesialiseer. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I believe the hon Mr Botha probably  played  at
centre for the Free State, because he knows  how  to  take  a  gap.  We  are
dealing with legislation  on  marketing,  and  he  paid  a  quick  visit  to
Zimbabwe. [Interjections.]

The AEB supports the streamlining of  procedure.  We  are  not  a  party  in
favour of cumbersome procedure  which  can  hamper  effectiveness.  We  also
understand that a parliamentary portfolio committee is not  necessarily  the
best instrument to serve as a selection committee in specialist  issues.  We
also realise that the Government cannot simply leave a critical matter  like
agricultural marketing to market forces. Food is  and  remains  a  strategic
instrument and for that reason it must be looked at.

We would like to express our concern that we believe that, whereas the  task
has now been given to the Minister, too few control points have  been  built
in, also because the council does not have to be representative  of  certain
interest groups, but simply has to include specialists. And,  although  this
does not concern a very critical issue and we are not going  to  oppose  the
Bill, we would like to warn against procedure being  facilitated  by  simply
leaving everything in the Minister's hands. We  cannot  centralise,  but  we
must specialise.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker,  hon  members,
firstly, I would like to thank  the  chairperson  of  the  committee,  Nkosi
Holomisa, for the way in which he handled the debate  on  the  Marketing  of
Agricultural Products Amendment Bill in the portfolio  committee.  I  was  a
participant in that committee several times and the debate was very  robust.
At some stage I was not sure whether he was still  my  comrade,  because  he
was very, very clear that he would give everybody a chance and  even  debate
with me on some of the matters.

I think the way in which the chairperson and the members, all of them,  have
participated in this debate ensured that indeed the outcome of  the  process
was such that all of us as  South  African  public  representatives  can  be
comfortable  that  indeed  it  represents  the  interests  of  the   various
constituencies. Clearly, as has been said, also by members participating  in
this debate, there is no debate on the need for the separation of powers.

However,  the  concern  has  been  raised,  and  in  my  view  it  has  been
accommodated in the Bill, of how, even if the executive plays its  role,  it
would be possible for Parliament to play its oversight role in a  fair  way.
I think that has been  covered  in  the  Bill,  particularly  to  allow  for
criteria to be set on how the selection panel has to  be  formed,  and  also
creating an  opportunity  for  interested  parties  to  participate  in  the
nomination process which the selection committee will  deal  with.  It  also
allows for an opportunity, as soon as possible after the decision  has  been
made by the Minister, to come and inform Parliament  on  the  decision  that
has been taken. I think that this has helped to improve the way in which  we
are able to undertake our task both as the executive and the legislature.

Concerning the matter that was raised by hon A J Botha, I must say that,  in
the meetings in which I participated,  the  chairperson,  in  receiving  the
inputs  from  one  of  the  stakeholders,  did  indicate  to  the  portfolio
committee that if there were other people who  knew  some  of  the  interest
groups or other parties who may have wanted to  come  before  the  committee
and make presentations  they  should  have  done  so.  He  even  called  the
department to find out if it knew of  such  other  parties  from  whom  they
could get  some  information.  He  also  indicated  that  if  those  parties
preferred to approach the chairperson directly, they were welcome to do  so.
So, in my view, regarding the way in which the chairperson dealt  with  this
matter, the issues of  the  public  hearings  or  having  other  views  were
accommodated. I hope hon A J Botha will remember that such an  instance  did
happen in the committee. So, I think that, regarding the  way  in  which  we
debate, we should be able to give  an  honest  view  of  what  has  happened
regardless of what some of the differences may be.

I also want to indicate that, in respect of the matter that  was  raised  by
hon C Dudley, I do not think that what we are proposing here is  going  back
to regulation. But we are actually  enhancing  the  deregulated  environment
that we have taken into  consideration.  Clearly,  many  other  members  who
participated in this debate raised issues but the fact is  that  the  issues
are not about the Bill at hand but whether or not we feel the road  that  we
have travelled, since 1996, has had any benefits  or  disadvantages.  In  my
view, even where we can mention  self-regulation,  the  decision,  in  1996,
particularly allowed for a free market, where the industry  can  participate
without any authority from Government dictating what they should do.

But, clearly, there would still be some room for the Government to  consider
the needs of all interested parties. Therefore, whatever free  market  there
is in the world, one still has some limitation that allows the state to  see
to it that the needs of all parties are taken into  consideration.  I  think
that is a healthy debate.

However, on issues that have been raised by the hon Van  Niekerk  and  other
members, I would agree that maybe  the  portfolio  committee,  when  it  has
time, should  debate  some  of  these  matters.  I  raised  these  with  the
portfolio  committee  this  morning,  and  said  that,  indeed,  given   the
international environment and some of the effects of deregulation, there  is
room for looking at our marketing legislation again in order to see  whether
or not there is any need for adjustment or change?

With regard  to  the  issue  about  the  Agricultural  Research  Centre  and
research funding, hon members would know that we discussed  this  matter  in
the debate of the agriculture Vote. We have also, as a department, taken  it
a step further by interacting with the Minister of  Arts,  Culture,  Science
and Technology so that, indeed, we can improve the  funding  levels  of  the
Research Council of South Africa.

We also have had a strategy meeting with all interested  parties,  including
farmers and the industry, to find a way in which we can improve the  funding
capability of the ARC. We have also taken  into  consideration  that  we  do
need to improve  the  management  capacity  of  that  institution  so  that,
indeed, what Parliament votes for does happen. This would  facilitate  where
the money has to go for the public good. I think it is  these  measures,  in
our view, that would also help us to utilise the amounts that  we  have  and
also to be able to look further into where we can obtain other amounts.

I would like to thank all the members of the committee for the way in  which
they participated, both in the committee and in today's  debate,  regardless
of the fact that there were still  some  of  the  members  who  raised  some
concerns. As members know we have and will continue to accommodate  some  of
these views where it is possible to do so. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                          COMPANIES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Madam  Speaker,  this  amendment  is  a
relatively  small  one,   but   has   quite   important   implications   for
implementation.

The basic thrust of the Bill is to make amendments which will allow for  the
electronic processing of documentation  which  did  not  exist  in  the  Act
previously. The South African Companies and Close Corporations  Registration
Offices, Sacro,  had  already  embarked  some  years  ago  on  a  completely
electronic and computerised system for the incorporation  of  companies  and
close corporations. This new process will include registration of  corporate
documentation and other information in respect of  these  entities  and,  in
effect, means that another of the primary  functions  of  the  registrations
office, which is the disclosure of the corporate information, will  also  be
able to be performed electronically.

This system is in addition to the existing functions and  will  not  replace
the paper-based structures. In time, however, it may become the main way  of
dealing with the registration office. The new system was developed in  close
co-operation with Sars, various departments of state, other  regulators  and
interested parties from the private sector.

The development phase has been finalised and the registration office is  now
ready to further implement the new system. It is basically the aim to  amend
the Companies Act of 1973 to legally enable the lodgement of  documents  and
disclosure  of  information  in  respect  of  the  companies  by  means   of
electronic processes. This will allow  for  the  phasing  in  of  electronic
lodgement of corporate forms, electronic payment with  prescribed  fees  and
electronic disclosure of corporate information.

For those interested, there are approximately 9 000 documents per  day  that
are being recorded  in  the  companies  office.  They  are  recorded  on  an
electronic tracking system and information is now freely  available  on  the
various websites of the Department of Trade and Industry. One  of  the  main
advantages of the new system is that it will  allow  people  to  lodge  from
many different places as opposed to the current  situation,  where  we  have
only one office in Pretoria.

The main objective of this amendment, as  I  said,  is  to  create  a  legal
environment for electronic lodgement and we  have  made  one  or  two  small
amendments to eliminate obsolete provisions and provide  for  correction  of
incorrect cross-references. We would urge support of what  is  an  important
technical change to the Companies Act. [Applause.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Madam Speaker, I am not sure why we  are  debating  this  Bill
this afternoon. I asked, because  I  cannot  remember  that  there  was  any
disagreement when the matter was discussed  in  the  committee.  However,  I
have been told by the Whips that the Speaker insisted  that  the  matter  be
debated and far be it from me to deprive the Speaker  of  her  afternoon  of
amusement.

May I say that this Bill is a practical acknowledgement  that  this  country
is adapting to the  information  revolution  which  is  the  powerful  motor
behind the widespread  acceptance  of  free  trade  as  being  of  universal
advantage.  The  Official  Opposition  supports  the  Bill  and  urges   the
Ministers of Trade and Industry and of Foreign  Affairs  to  foster  similar
practical legislative adjustments in the jurisdictions of all SADC members.

Indeed, there is substantial need  for  enlightened  policy  convergence  in
many critical areas if this trade bloc is to be of economic  consequence  in
the modern world. If progress  can  be  made  on  convergence  of  technical
matters such as these, it stands to reason that a platform  of  co-operation
will be established when more controversial policy issues are addressed.

There need be no more graphic examples of the need for confluence  than  the
influence on the value of the rand of the morbid  economic  consequences  of
the abrogation of the  rule  of  law  in  Zimbabwe,  SADC's  second  largest
economy, although still a very small one. Within any trade bloc,  deviations
from the rule of law are  likely  to  be  seen  by  investors  in  developed
countries as highly contagious among other members of that trade bloc.

Last month I spent 10 days visiting financial institutions  in  London  that
direct  international  investment  flows.  Some  have  a  long  history   of
involvement in this country and I have visited them regularly over the  past
20 years. I was asked only one question: How many steps is  President  Mbeki
behind Bob Mugabe? I was left with no  doubt  that  Argentina,  despite  its
financial crisis, was in the mind  of  the  international  investor  a  more
likely future prospect for investment than a Southern African bloc  tolerant
of aberrations reminiscent of Idi Amin.

President Mbeki should realise that foreign investors  are  as  important  a
part of his constituency as those who vote  in  elections  once  every  five
years. For investors vote daily with their investment dollars and they  felt
their  interest  was  neglected,  maybe   even   abandoned,   by   what   is
euphemistically called his ``quiet diplomacy''.
Markets, of course, do not always  reflect  economic  fundamentals  and  are
unlikely to do so when other flaws are detected in  the  political  economy,
and we have our share of those. We have lost one  privatisation  opportunity
after another. Now SA Airways listing is to be delayed  by  two  years.  The
arms scandal, the lottery delays, our leadership in violent crime  and  what
appears to be an unawareness of  the  economic  consequences  of  Aids,  all
these are flaws that cumulatively discourage investments.

Do hon members know what capital market opinion expects of  us  now  abroad?
It is that instead of supporting free trade  and  the  globalising  economy,
South Africa will move progressively to the lunatic  fringes  of  the  World
Trade Organisation where prosperity is sacrificed  to  keep  politicians  in
power. At the Geneva headquarters  of  the  World  Trade  Organisation  last
month, delegations from two other countries, one of them  a  member  of  the
Cairns group, expressed the view that the South African delegation  was  not
up to the tough negotiating task at hand.

The official opposition supports the Government's  policies  of  negotiating
greater access to the markets of the  developed  countries.  It  is  acutely
aware, therefore, of the need for negotiators with  ability  and  integrity,
chosen on merit and for no other reason. While some of our embassies can  be
counted on to provide refuge and rewards to  struggle  graduates  and  inept
politicians or both, it is always done at a cost and never more so  than  if
it is done in Brussels or in Geneva.

Globalisation is no panacea, but any country ignores it at great  cost.  The
significant change it has brought  is  that  while  governments  could  once
decide which investors to allow into their economies,  today  they  have  to
persuade investors that their country has  something  significant  to  offer
them. Today investors have to be nurtured. So when a Minister  scheduled  to
meet 25 visiting industrialists ducks out at 48 hours' notice,  they  cannot
be depended upon to be sanguine. One can  guess  how  they  will  vote  with
their Deutschmarks. [Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES:  Madam  Speaker,  I  think  that  you  have  been  enormously
tolerant. I do not think that  the  previous  Speaker  said  much  that  was
relevant to this Bill. The Bill is in fact similar in content to  the  Close
Corporations Amendment Bill, which we passed in the last  session,  and  the
Bill passed through the committee unanimously and without amendments.

It is clearly important that we do allow for the application of  information
and communications technology to  administrative  processes  and  amend  our
laws where necessary to allow this. It is to be hoped that  the  passage  of
this  Bill  will  assist  in  the  ongoing  project  of  promoting   greater
efficiency  in  South  African   companies   and   the   close   corporation
registration office.

The committee, as it often does, looked at this Bill from the point of  view
of a small business located in a rural area. We said that we  could  clearly
see  the  benefits  of  this  Bill  for  large  companies  with  their   own
sophisticated ICT systems in  place.  But  we  asked  how  this  Bill  would
benefit a small company located in an outlying area.

The answer we received was that it could  potentially  benefit  such  firms,
precisely because they would now be able to  lodge  their  applications  and
obtain information from a distant location, instead of having to be  present
in Pretoria or rely on the couriering of documents.  In  effect  this  means
they  could  gain  the  advantages  which  the  informations  communications
technology has of cutting down distance in time.

This, of course, depends on such firms actually having access to ICT and  to
the Internet. I know that a number  of  local  small  business  centres  are
already providing such services to small, medium or micro  enterprises  that
might not have their own facilities. It is to be hoped that such  facilities
will be extended in other ways throughout the country in  due  course.  With
these few words, and given that this Bill was unanimously  agreed  upon,  it
is a pleasure to commend it to the House. [Applause.]
Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, the Minister and previous speakers  have  made
out a solid case for supporting this amending Bill. Electronic  transactions
are something that countries must simply live with in the future.  Questions
such as this one have indeed been asked: But what  about  the  rural  people
who do not have access to electronic media?  I  think  the  chairperson  has
made quite a good case for saying that although one  is  far  away,  one  is
actually  much  closer  to  the  rural  or  regional  trade  and   industry,
intelligence or other office where one can communicate.

However, apart from this, nobody has prohibited the old system, and one  can
still continue with it, that is one can still complete the  blue  forms  for
registration as it was  done  in  the  past.  This  will  thus  even  be  an
additional benefit for rural and far-away people, as it is not  taking  away
any of their existing rights.

I am, however, baffled by  how  the  hon  Bruce  could  link  this  Bill  on
electronic communications or close corporation registration with Mugabe  and
the World Trade Organisation. But before I become engrossed in that, let  me
say that, with these few words, the IFP definitely supports this Bill.

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker and hon members, the objectives  of  the  Bill
have been clearly articulated by the hon the Minister.  The  new  Bill  will
not only  provide  for  the  phasing  in  of  the  electronic  lodgement  of
corporate forms, electronic payment of fees  and  electronic  disclosure  of
corporate information, but will ultimately provide entrepreneurs with a one-
stop facility to access the  system  in  an  uncomplicated  way  within  the
shortest possible time.

During the presentation to the portfolio committee, as  was  highlighted  by
the chairperson, the department described one  of  the  main  attributes  of
this  new  system  as  its  potential  to  take  Sacro's  registration   and
disclosure services to the masses and all remote areas in South Africa.

It is also  the  department's  intention  to  make  the  majority  of  these
services readily available on the  Internet  and  at  various  other  public
offices throughout the country. While these intentions are  noble,  we  must
take into account the vast  disparities  in  infrastructure  and  facilities
between urban and rural areas. Too often the level of  service  delivery  in
rural areas is poor or  nonexistent,  thus  placing  fellow  South  Africans
living in these areas at a major disadvantage. The  department  must  ensure
that the implementation of this amendment does not perpetuate this  anomaly.
The UDM supports the Bill.

Ms  C  DUDLEY:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  the  ACDP  would  like   to
congratulate the director in charge of the Company's Office on  a  job  well
done. We realise that the provisions contained in the Bill simply  reinforce
what  has  already  been  accomplished  and  is  being  implemented.  Online
registering of companies speeds up the process, reduces  costs  and  ensures
that all information is readily available in all parts of the country.

One area that is still lacking, though, is that not everyone has  access  to
computers. Therefore, local centres, as mentioned by  the  chairman,  should
be set up where members  of  the  public  can  be  assisted  with  accessing
information and registering. These centres would need to be  advertised,  so
that the excellent service being offered is truly brought to the people.

Lastly, the million dollar question is, since these services are  now  cost-
effective,  quicker  and  better,  are  we  going  to  reduce  the  cost  of
registration  and  consultation  with  this  Office  and   demonstrate   the
democracy?

The ACDP will vote in favour of this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, being in the new age of technology,  the  MF
welcomes  this  computerised  system  embarked  upon  by  the  SA  Companies
Registration Office and the SA Revenue  Service.  The  MF  compliments  this
initiative that visibly advocates an ordered and planned system.

Currently an office in Pretoria provides information that this  system  will
make  available  to  the  entire  Republic.  The  MF  notes  that  this  new
electronic system would now lessen the burden placed on this office  by  not
only making this information and service readily accessible  throughout  the
country, but also facilitating access in  the  most  remote  areas.  The  MF
welcomes  this  advancement,  but  stresses   the   importance   of   safety
precautions to maintain confidentiality and ensure that it is  supported  by
a back-up system. There should  also  be  precautions  against  viruses  and
hackers that commonly destroy and intrude into electronic systems like  this
one.

With the escalating unemployment rate, the MF hopes  that  this  new  system
will somehow accommodate those previously  employed  manually  to  do  these
tasks.

The MF supports the Companies Amendment Bill.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, may I thank  all  parties
for their support. The hon Hennie Bekker was puzzled as  to  how  one  could
link the Companies Amendment Bill to Zimbabwe. I am not so puzzled. I  think
the software is a bit muddled and anything could be linked to anything!

However, I thank hon members very much for supporting  the  Bill.  Even  the
hon Mr Bruce supported the Bill. He has got some sense, I can see.

I do think that this could be quite an important  breakthrough.  Later  this
year we will announce further developments in the Department  of  Trade  and
Industry to provide greater access through electronic  communication  across
the country, and into rural and township areas. I  think  we  can  use  this
very effectively.

I am also pleased with the progress we are beginning  to  make  in  the  new
combined Companies and Intellectual  Property  Rights  Office,  where  I  am
pleased to say that Advocate Felix Malunga has been appointed as its  acting
head. We are also getting support from the private sector  to  make  further
changes  in  the  combined  offices  of  the  Companies   Office   and   the
Intellectual Property Rights Office. Later this year we  will  make  further
announcements in this regard.

We have begun the process for a comprehensive reform of the  Companies  Act,
and we will be appointing a task team to deal with this.  We  will  announce
workshops for all those who are interested in the process of  reforming  the
Companies Act. I thank  hon  members  for  supporting  this  amending  Bill.
[Applause.]

         CONSUMER AFFAIRS (UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES) AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Madam  Speaker,  the  Consumer  Affairs
(Unfair Business Practices) Amendment Bill deals with  the  specific  matter
that arose during one of the court challenges on this Bill. I just  want  to
briefly remind colleagues in the House what this Bill deals with.  It  deals
with unfair business practices. This is defined  as  any  business  practice
which directly or indirectly has  or  is  likely  to  have  the  effect  of,
firstly harming the relations  between  business  and  consumers;  secondly,
unreasonably prejudicing any consumer; and thirdly, deceiving  any  consumer
or unfairly affecting any consumer.

Hon members may recall that this House passed an amendment to  the  previous
Consumer Affairs Act that was designed to deal  with  the  proliferation  of
practices that we now see in the commercial terrain  which  are  prejudicial
to consumers, particularly poor consumers.  So,  for  us,  the  Bill  is  an
important instrument to try and protect consumers from a very wide range  of
unfair practices.

The Consumer Affairs Committee, which is established in terms of  section  2
of the Act, consists of nine members appointed by me. I  believe  they  have
done a very good job, although there is a great deal more we can try and  do
in this area.
What happened was that in a challenge against an action or  a  group  called
Omega Trust, the Constitutional Court wisely ruled that  the  subsection  in
the  previous  Act  that  dealt  with  the  powers  of  the   Minister   was
unconstitutional. However, the Constitutional Court, and we thank  them  for
this, also determined that it would not be in the public interest simply  to
strike  this  provision  down  because  this   may   allow   persons   under
investigation for unfair business practices to  continue  with  them  or  to
hide assets. We were therefore given 12 months to correct the defect in  the
Bill, and now this amending Bill tries to do that.

In essence, what  it  does  is  to  cater  for  provisions  of  questioning,
guidance to the Minister as to how power  should  be  exercised,  and  under
what circumstances the Minister should take  action.  This  will  bring  the
Bill into line with the Constitution, and we  welcome  the  intervention  of
the Constitutional Court in this matter,  both  by  pointing  out  that  the
provisions were unconstitutional and, secondly,  exercising  their  judgment
and wisdom to allow us time to  make  adjustments  without  allowing  unfair
practices to proliferate.

We urge all parties to support the Bill.

Mr N S BRUCE: Madam Speaker, it is sometimes difficult to balance  the  need
to protect the gullible  and  the  equally  important  need  not  to  stifle
enterprise. There is no doubt that without this  Bill  the  balance  of  our
legislation tilted too much towards the former.

The Official Opposition not only supports this Bill, but urges the  Minister
concerned to keep under constant surveillance all legislation that could  be
considered unbalanced and increases the costs through  regulation  of  small
businesses. And if he does not do it, we will do it for him.

The prevalence of what are known as pyramid marketing schemes  informed  the
original motivation for the Unfair Business Practices Act. And while  public
dismay at some of  the  consequences  of  these  schemes  was  extreme,  the
consequent legislation was not a  model  of  democratic  jurisprudence.  Had
more attention been paid to the work of the economist Prof  Patrick  Minford
of Manchester University on pyramid schemes  by  Prof  Louise  Tager,  there
would have been no need for the extremities to which  this  legislation  was
pushed.

Be that as it may, the need to encourage small business entrepreneurs  is  a
patent one. And so perhaps instead of blaming the bankers for not  providing
succour to aspirant entrepreneurs with an idea and  little  else,  the  main
thrust of attempts to nurture small business  should  centre  on  two  other
areas.

The first is the onerous legislation and  regulatory  environment  in  which
they have to operate. Deregulation is good for small  business.  Yet,  since
1994, the trend has been the other way, especially in so far as labour  laws
are concerned.

The second is to review macroeconomic and monetary policies  which  clearly,
are not performing.  The high cost of capital is  as  much  a  deterrent  to
small businesses as the availability of seed capital.

The ultimate cost of allowing the value of the rand consistently to  decline
will in the end  be  the  diminishing  of  the  productive  assets  of  this
country, while other  policy  adjustments  need  to  be  made  if  business,
especially small business, is to flourish and the erosion of jobs is  to  be
reversed. [Applause.]

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Speaker, the origin  of  this  Bill,  as  the  Minister
explained, was a ruling of the Constitutional Court  on  29  September  last
year, which found that  section  8(5)  of  the  Consumer  Affairs  Bill  was
unconstitutional.

An example of the kind of case that section 8(5) was intended  to  apply  to
would be that of a pyramid scheme or some  other  fraudulent  or  misleading
investment scheme. And the court clearly recognised that  it  would  not  be
good governance to say that while an investigation is going on into the  way
in which a certain group  of  consumers  were  detrimentally  treated  by  a
scheme, it would be okay for that  scheme  to  carry  on  and  entice  other
members of the public into its lair.

The constitutional court ruled that it was desirable  and  necessary  indeed
to have a procedure in place  that  would  allow  the  suspension  of  these
activities that  are  under  investigation,  pending  the  outcome  of  that
investigation. The problem that the Constitutional Court  had  with  section
85 was that it felt that the provisions were  too  wide,  in  terms  of  the
discretion of the Minister and that there was inadequate guidance as to  how
the Minister should exercise these powers. The Court also  ruled  that  this
matter should be remedied before the end of September 2001.

The present Bill is a section 76 Bill that was introduced in and has  passed
through the NCOP. In the committee stage the NA committee  worked  extremely
closely with its  counterpart  in  the  NCOP.  The  original  amending  Bill
provided for the Minister to apply to the High Court  for  an  interdict  to
exercise this power. After considerable deliberation and  discussion  within
the committees and interaction with the law advisers, we felt that this  was
not the most appropriate solution. The Minister - or indeed any other  party
- can in any case apply for a court interdict  to  stop  any  practice,  but
prescribing this as the only  remedy  runs  the  risk  of  turning  what  is
intended to be a rapidly implemented interim remedy into a  long  drawn  out
affair. It would also tend to displace the responsibility of  the  executive
onto the judiciary.

The Bill now before the House provides that the Minister may still issue  an
order prohibiting the continuation  of  certain  unfair  business  practices
pending an investigation of the committee,  but  prescribes  and  constrains
procedures in a way which we believe address the  central  concerns  of  the
Constitutional Court. The Minister has to act on the recommendation  of  the
Consumer Affairs Committee. He or she has to  make  his  or  her  intentions
known in the Gazette. The committee has to inform the party  concerned  that
it intends making a recommendation to  the  Minister  in  this  regard.  The
party concerned must be given an opportunity  to  make  its  point  of  view
known. The Minister must take this into account and be  satisfied  that  the
practice is, indeed,  unfair  that  there  is  no  alternative  remedy.  The
Minister must make his or her reasons  known  and  may  also,  incidentally,
approach the court for an interdict.

After deliberations and discussions in the committee, unanimity was  reached
and I have pleasure in commending this Bill to the House. [Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER: Madam Speaker, today we are  debating  an  amendment  to  the
Consumer Affairs Act.  This Act has previously  been  known  as  the  Unfair
Business Practises Bill and members should remember that  we  have  accepted
and approved this Bill in the past.

In terms of the previous amendment, the  Minister  had  the  power,  on  the
recommendation of the Consumer Affair Committee, to halt a suspected  unfair
or harmful business practice in its tracks.  The  moneys  or  properties  of
this harmful practice could then be confiscated and held in trust for  later
distribution to the clients or gullible customers of this harmful scheme.

In September 2000, however, the Constitutional Court found section  8(5)  of
the Consumer Affairs Act, empowering  the  Minister  to  prevent  an  unfair
practice under investigation and attach moneys or properties of that  unfair
business practice, to be unconstitutional. The reason  given  by  the  Court
for the invalidity of the  provisions  is  that  while  it  confers  a  wide
discretion on the Minister, the  provision  does  not  provide  guidance  of
those powers or the applicable administrative procedures.

The Constitutional Court, however, also determined that it would not  be  in
the public interest to simply strike  these  provisions  and  allow  persons
under investigation to continue their alleged+  unfair  business  practices.
This Bill will now enable the Minister to apply ex parte to a magistrate  or
a judge for an order that that particular  unfair  practice  be  prohibited,
pending the final outcome  of  an  investigation  by  the  Consumer  Affairs
Committee and the decision to prohibit such a harmful practice.

This amendment will now conform with the  Constitutional  Court's  judgment,
so that the application of this Act should no longer be  frustrated.  It  is
now  also  possible  to  expand  the  powers  of  the  curator  through  the
assistance of legal representatives, to  ensure  quicker  results.  The  IFP
previously supported this Bill  as  a  whole.  These  amendments  are  of  a
technical nature to accommodate the judgment of  the  Constitutional  Court,
and we would therefore again support this Bill.

May I also remind hon members about the perils  that  have  been  caused  by
pyramid schemes, and the power that these people - who have  lots  and  lots
of money - exercises. It is alleged that in one of these  cases  they  spent
between R4 million and R5 million in court actions against the  Minister  to
be allowed to continue with their practices.  They  were  obviously  wasting
their gullible clients' money to fight those cases.

The IFP supports this amendment and will vote for the Bill.

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam Speaker and hon members, while the  amendment  to  the
Consumer  Affairs  Amendment  Bill  is  necessary  to   conform   with   the
Constitutional Court judgment, it will  also  assist  the  Consumer  Affairs
Committee to comply properly with the functions and duties  imposed  by  the
Act. It will also enable the Minister to apply to a magistrate or judge  for
interim measures pending a final report.

The  departmental  consultation  process  was  wide  and  varied,  eliciting
interesting  comments  and  proposals.  Most   of   these   proposals   were
constructive and have been accommodated in the Bill.  The  issue  raised  by
the law review project was firm in logic and argument. However, as has  been
highlighted in the briefings to the committee and earlier  in  this  debate,
it was previously challenged in court and the challenge was upheld.

Clause 1 is an improvement as it  opens  a  door  to  judicial  transparency
through a complete and thorough investigation. It also allows the court  the
opportunity to request most of the relevant details to be placed before it.

Although certain concerns have been raised about the powers of the  Minister
in clause 8 of the Bill, the UDM is of the  opinion  that  these  amendments
are necessary to give the Minister the powers to give effect to the  purpose
of  the  Act.  Too  often  the  vulnerable  in  society  are  subjected   to
unscrupulous businesspeople  who  lure  them  to  invest  in  get-rich-quick
schemes,  and  these  business  practices  rob  them  of  their  hard-earned
savings. Such practices usually result in  undesired  consequences  for  the
business, and for the investors.

Clause 8(a) will enable the Minister to act very  quickly  even  before  the
committee has commenced with an application. Ultimately  this  is  not  only
the Minister's decision, but might also be subject to  a  judicial  process.
The appointment of a curator in terms of the Act will, hopefully, limit  the
consumers' losses where they have been treated unfairly.

The UDM supports the Bill.

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, this Bill gives more teeth to the  Minister  and
the Consumer Affairs Committee to deal with unfair business  practices  and,
therefore, it is the ACDP's opinion that it improves the current  situation.
There is, however, still an additional need in that while justice  is  still
available to all, we could say, as Lord  Birkenhead  once  said:  ``Justice,
like the Ritz Hotel, is available to all''.

For ordinary people to access swift and easy recourse, small matters  should
be heard in special courts conveniently placed throughout the country,  like
traffic courts and small claims courts, and the ACDP congratulates the  Free
State on having taken initiative as a result of the suggestion made  by  the
hon Kent Durr in the NCOP. We welcome the fact  that  the  provincial  court
has been appointed in the Free State, and we call on the  Minister  to  work
with provinces to multiply these courts  throughout  the  country.  Consumer
affairs committees should also be devolved. The ACDP will vote in favour  of
this Bill.

CNN has just announced that a plane has crashed into the World Trade  Centre
and there is chaos in New York City. We pray  that  God  will  intervene  in
that situation.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam  Speaker,  unfair  business  practices  are  sadly  a
reality in our business community, and  where  such  unjust  activities  are
concerned it is vital  that  the  culprits  are  apprehended.  However,  the
Constitution of the Republic governs procedures for attaining  justice,  and
legislation to clamp down on unfair business practices has  to  comply  with
these procedures.

The  MF  notes  the  clarity  that  the  amendment  has  brought  about   by
accommodating an equipped interrogation  system  which  will  professionally
sift  through  the  innocent  and  the  guilty.  The  MF  agrees  that   the
requirement for interim intervention would require  the  installation  of  a
system and procedure to guide the Minister in the use of his or her powers.

The MF finds the repeal of certain absolute  provisions,  the  expansion  of
powers and the discretion of the curator to be in order, but  requests  that
these powers be guided by procedures and a degree  of  limitation  as  well.
The MF supports the Consumer Affairs (Unfair Business  Practices)  Amendment
Bill.

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker and hon members,  the  awkward  times  that  the
present Government faces call for wisdom - wisdom in stewardship.  The  ship
is huge and the tide is wild. Signals of the tide are rampant  unemployment,
crime, grievous social ills, the list is endless.

Microeconomic policies, also known  as  structural  policies,  are  just  as
important in influencing overall  economic  performance.  Superior  economic
performance, surely, depends on microeconomic advantages.

To build the country out of its present quagmire, the productive sector  has
to be encouraged and capacity utilisation improved. Laws  sensitive  to  the
needs of small businesses are vital. The focus of this Bill is in  the  name
of a dignified search for practical programmes. It will surely pay off.

The DA's support for the  Bill  is  also  based  on  the  premise  that  the
Consumer Affairs Committee can approach the  Minister  to  declare  a  small
business a consumer, for purposes of speedy access to just administration.

It is much trickier to measure policies that make markets for goods,  labour
and the consumer better. It is  easier  to  judge  the  stance  of  monetary
policies or the size of a budget deficit. This Bill makes a useful start  in
developing a method to that effect.

The DP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, my thanks to the  parties
for supporting this Bill. Many thanks also to the committee, in  particular,
for the work they did and,  I  think,  for  improving  the  quality  of  the
amendment.

If I may just conclude with  an  appeal  to  all  MPs:  I  think  that  they
themselves can provide a service to their constituencies by  helping  people
gain access to the Consumer Affairs Committee.

I hope there was no implication in what the hon member Bruce said  that,  in
some way, pyramid schemes can be condoned or are useful. They  are  not,  in
any way, useful. They are extremely dangerous for ordinary consumers, and  I
hope that each and every party in this  House  and  each  and  every  member
would act decisively and clearly against such schemes. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 16:24.

                           WEDNESDAY, 27 JUNE 2001

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     Message from National Council of Provinces to National Assembly:


     Bill passed by National Council  of  Provinces  on  27  June  2001  and
     transmitted for concurrence:


     (i)    Consumer Affairs (Unfair Business Practices) Amendment  Bill  [B
         28B - 2001] (National Council of Provinces - sec 76).
         The Bill has been referred to the Portfolio Committee on Trade  and
         Industry of the National Assembly.


COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Public Works  on  Study  Tour  to
     London, dated 30 May 2001:


     The Portfolio Committee on Public Works, having undertaken a study tour
     to London from 18 to 28 April 2001, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The Committee embarked on the study tour to  London  to  learn  and
         exchange views on the maintenance of state  property,  legislation,
         landscape and urban design, the role of the private sector  in  the
         rehabilitation of  state  property  and  state  land,  leasing  and
         disposal of state property and project management.


         The delegation was led by the chairperson, Inkosi MW  Hlengwa,  and
         included Committee members Mr M M Chikane, Mr B A Radebe,  Ms  P  S
         Sekgobela, Ms A N Sigcau, Mr S E  Opperman  and  Mr  A  S  van  der
         Merwe, as well as the Committee Secretary, Mr J Leburu.


         The Committee met with the following persons and institutions:  The
         South  African  High  Commission  in   London;   English   Heritage
         Officers; the Department of Trade and Industry;  officials  of  the
         House of Commons; and the  Agency  responsible  for  Crown  Estates
         (CE).


     B.     South African High Commission


         The Committee met with the  South  African  High  Commissioner  and
         Deputy High Commissioner, as well as the staff of the Commission.
         The Commissioner briefed the Committee on the types of leases  they
         had in London, and said that South Africa House, residence  of  the
         High Commissioner, is a freehold title on the land  of  the  Crown,
         while most other buildings are  leaseholders.  There  are  five  SA
         properties in London, which serve as residences  for  senior  staff
         of the High Commission. Most of the leases of residents need to  be
         renewed. There is one rented flat that will be for sale within  the
         next two years.


         South Africa House  was  designed  to  provide  for  a  variety  of
         functions with suitable spaces. A large part of  the  building  was
         devoted to the propaganda of  the  dominion,  including  space  for
         exhibitions, a cinema, an information and travel bureau as well  as
         the library, which is open for the public. The upper  floors  house
         staff rooms and offices and a small space of special  architectural
         significance.


         The  High  Commissioner  also  briefed   the   Committee   on   the
         refurbishment of South Africa House. She  said  that  South  Africa
         House is built on Crown land and is a  free-holder.  She  indicated
         that  a  special  levy  is  paid  to  the  English   Heritage   for
         refurbishment of the building. The Commission is preparing for  the
         celebration of South Africa, and part of the refurbishment  is  for
         this celebration. There are laws in London that govern some of  the
         buildings and areas declared as listed areas. One should  negotiate
         with the English Heritage to effect  changes  to  these  buildings,
         and South Africa House is one of those listed.


         SA  companies  in  London  fund  the  refurbishment;  there  is  no
         government funding. South Africa House is  used  for  a  number  of
         purposes, such as the hosting of charity functions,  as  a  cinema,
         and for library and other activities.


         The decision to refurbish South Africa House was taken  during  the
         time of former President Mandela. The  previous  High  Commissioner
         had a committee to  kick-start  this  process,  but  it  could  not
         function because its members were redeployed to different areas.


         This process took some time to take off because  of  statutory  and
         tendering procedures that had to be followed, as well as  the  fact
         that funds had to be raised. Research was done, the designing  team
         was set up, and  the  Department  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
         Technology was approached  to  provide  some  of  the  design.  The
         refurbishment will be completed in mid-October 2001.


         A listed building means that proposed changes  inside  and  outside
         the building should be negotiated with the  English  Heritage,  the
         Crown and the Westminster Council. These areas  are  of  historical
         and  cultural  importance  and  belong  to  the  Crown.  The   High
         Commission was able to agree with the English Heritage to change  a
         number of things in South Africa House.


         It is expected that the outside walls of  the  building  be  washed
         every five years, with a view to maintenance and restoration.


         The High Commissioner felt that some of  the  artworks  in  certain
         rooms had to be replaced, such as those in the Zulu  Room.  It  was
         felt that these artworks were offensive to the  new  black  African
         government, and also that it was not representative  of  the  South
         African population. Some of it will be moved to  a  different  part
         of the building.


         The Commission also proposes to take back  some  of  the  works  to
         South Africa, including the artwork depicting  panoramic  views  of
         Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
         The Minister of Administration in London indicated that there is  a
         lot that  needs  to  be  changed  in  the  building,  such  as  the
         Democracy Hall. There is a need to create an opportunity for  South
         African artists to come and do their drawings in the building.  The
         Minister indicated that there were  some  constraints,  such  as  a
         lack of financial and human resources. The process of  consultation
         with the Crown as well as the  process  of  consulting  with  other
         structures took a lot of time.


         The permission to refurbish  comes  from  the  Westminster  Council
         through approval by the Planning Commission. Many compromises  were
         made by the English Heritage.

         6. Response of Committee on refurbishment


              The Committee was pleased by what was taking  place  in  South
              Africa House. It also acknowledges that there is  a  lot  that
              need to be  researched  and  done  in  order  to  reflect  the
              complete picture of South African society.


              The Zulu Room depicts the history of people of  South  Africa,
              although it is only a part of  society.  The  Committee  feels
              that there is nothing offensive about this room. It only needs
              to be made representative of the population of  South  Africa.
              The Committee will discuss what needs  to  be  done  with  the
              Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.


     D.     Meeting with English Heritage Officers


         The English  Heritage  (EH)  was  established  under  the  National
         Heritage Act, 1983. Its role and powers in London were enhanced  by
         the Local Government Act, 1985. They merged in 1999 with the  Royal
         Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. Its  purpose  is
         to preserve and look after cultural and  historical  buildings  and
         monuments on behalf of the Crown and  the  population.  The  EH  is
         responsible to the Department of Culture and Media.  It  identifies
         historical monuments and lists them.


         The EH gives grants to owners of  listed  buildings  to  refurbish,
         renovate  and  repair.  It  provides  advice  on  maintenance   for
         buildings,  and  remains  the  main  custodian  of   these   listed
         buildings. Listed buildings include medieval  buildings,  churches,
         museums, embassies, parks and other historically important places.


         The EH has a statutory role of monitoring changes effected  to  the
         buildings. When listed, no changes can be made,  either  inside  or
         outside the  building,  without  approval  of  the  EH.  They  will
         inspect the building and give it a certain grading status,  ranging
         between grade 1, grade 2 and grade 2a. There  are  500  000  listed
         buildings in London alone.
         The idea of listing of buildings came from William Morris, when  he
         saw that old buildings were decaying and that  they  needed  to  be
         protected  for  future  generations.  The  reason  for  listing   a
         building is to help  preserve  the  cultural  heritage  for  future
         generations, and to enhance tourism and economic development.


         The EH  adheres  to  strict  rules  when  granting  funds  for  the
         upgrading of listed buildings. It also tries  to  encourage  people
         to practice their trades, including the old  trades,  and  as  such
         would like South Africans to come  and  do  the  artwork  in  South
         Africa House.


         South Africa House has been upgraded to grade  2  status,  because,
         apart from  its  architectural  importance  (a  Sir  Herbert  Baker
         building),  it  has  expensive  and  beautiful  artworks.  The   EH
         indicated that it is possible to give grants  for  preservation  of
         the mural in the Zulu Room. The EH also  expects  South  Africa  to
         come up with proposals on what should be exhibited.


         Response of Committee


         The Committee was pleased  by  the  approach  of  the  EH  and  the
         support it  gave  to  the  High  Commission  in  terms  of  matters
         negotiated. The Committee indicated that there is  a  need  to  get
         South African artists to produce artworks for South  Africa  House.
         These works should represent the  history  of  all  the  people  of
         South Africa, even before Jan van Riebeeck.  The  Committee  agrees
         with the EH that the Zulu Room not only needs to be preserved,  but
         also that its artwork needs to be representative of all the  people
         of South Africa. The exhibitions in South Africa House should  also
         reflect the transformation process. It must fully reflect the  past
         and the present, with a room reflecting the future.


     E.     Meeting with Department of Trade and Industry


         The central government Department of Works had  previously  managed
         all government  property.  The  Ministry  of  Works  became  a  big
         bureaucracy, and in the  process  became  inefficient  in  managing
         government buildings. It was closed down in  1987  and  staff  were
         transferred  to  private  companies  and  other  departments.   The
         management and administration of the State property  was  given  to
         the Department  of  the  Secretary  of  State.  Staff  involved  in
         leasing and disposing are continually trained. The  Department  has
         outsourced everything that has to do with the maintenance of  State
         buildings. The best way to maintain buildings is  to  contract  one
         company to provide all the services. However,  sometimes  companies
         lacking certain expertise,  do  the  work  they  are  good  at  and
         subcontract the others.


         The  Department  has  a  separate  contract  in  respect   of   the
         maintenance of lifts and escalators.  The  contractor  is  given  a
         performance bonus if lifts do not break more  than  seven  times  a
         year, and gets penalised for underperformance. There are  a  number
         of agencies which serve as property centres in different  parts  of
         London.  Communication  with  these  centres  takes  place  through
         property centre seminars.


         Issues discussed in these  seminars  include  disaster  management,
         awareness of property maintenance  and  other  related  activities.
         There are leasing provisions of the Act that lead to  high  quality
         property in need of maintenance. It is quite expensive to  maintain
         a  dilapidated  building,  and  this  could  consume  the   capital
         expenditure of the Department.


         State properties that have not been maintained, are transferred  to
         the private sector, and the Department will lease  these  buildings
         once they have been  upgraded.  Maintaining  buildings  has  become
         sophisticated and needs people professionally efficient to  do  the
         work. The objective of the Department is to get the best value  for
         money and to provide good accommodation to officials.


         The Department advised the Committee that when tenders  are  called
         for, people who are actually doing the work at the time  should  be
         contracted.


     F.     Meeting with Department of Social Security


         Property consultants give professional support to  the  government.
         Land Securities Trillion is in partnership with the government  for
         the delivery of services  and  accommodation.  The  private  sector
         takes a degree of risk since the contracting of properties  is  not
         a  normal  lease  or  sale  agreement.  The  Department  of  Social
         Security indicated that it does not take responsibility  for  urban
         design and landscaping. They do, however, have  responsibility  for
         economic regeneration.


         The Department is dealing with the property market.  Land  security
         is the biggest  property  management  the  Department  is  involved
         with. It has established a partnership with the private  sector  to
         manage properties in London. It is  responsible  for  approximately
         8 500 properties in the country.


         The Department sells properties to private companies for  a  period
         of 20 years. These properties are for  upgrading,  maintenance  and
         management by that sector on behalf of the  Department.  Properties
         are transferred  to  private  companies  in  poor  shape,  and  the
         contract states that the transfer goes along  with  the  risk.  The
         contract requires that the private companies bring  the  properties
         to acceptable standards. The prices of these properties  are  fixed
         for the whole 20 years. The government owns 30% of  the  properties
         that  are  handled  by  private  companies.  There  is  some  value
         attached to the contract; profit is shared equally between  private
         company and Department.


         There are three classifications of buildings:


         1.  Properties  classified  as  core  properties.  60%   of   these
              properties command a higher bid,  are  highly  maintained  and
              have certainty of value. There is certainty of income.


         2. Flexible properties - 30%. These are  considered  likely  to  be
              vacated  during  the  course  of  the  contract.   They   lack
              certainty. Flexible properties require six months' notice  for
              vacating and they are  also  flexible  in  that  they  can  be
              retained easily.


         3. Surplus properties. These properties have already  been  vacated
              and have been standing empty without having been used for some
              years. The Department is not interested in them. Some  surplus
              estates of very poor quality  have  been  transferred  to  the
              private sector. There are more than 150 000 square  metres  of
              surplus accommodation, largely in poor areas. They are of very
              poor quality and are unsellable and unleasable.


              The private sector is responsible for the  appearance  of  the
              properties, both inside and outside. The idea behind  this  is
              that excellence in construction and maintenance lead to better
              standards in health safety and the security of buildings. Each
              department has a chief designer, who looks at the standard  of
              the property and how it is kept and who is accountable to  the
              Commission on Architecture and the Built Environment.


              The Social Services  Department  is  looking  more  at  multi-
              purpose properties, which leads to the problem of managing the
              public use of those properties. That Department also looks  at
              greening  of  the  properties.  It  should   be   noted   that
              departments are not required  to  manage  properties,  but  to
              provide services to the public.


              The reason for transferring properties to the  private  sector
              is that the Department does not have the  capacity  to  manage
              properties  in  terms  of  required  expertise.   Departmental
              officials were not properly trained for  property  management,
              so the risk of management is better placed  with  the  private
              sector. The country is moving away from  conventional  methods
              of private contracting towards partnerships.


              A contract includes the  provision  of  services  -  catering,
              security, cleaning, etc. After 20 years, the contract  can  be
              retained, given to someone else or the Department can  buy  it
              back.


              There is no particular piece of legislation that  governs  the
              management  of  properties  in  Britain.  However,  there   is
              legislation  that  regulates   government   partnerships.   In
              relationship with the private sector, tenants are  being  look
              after instead of landlords.


              Control measures to ensure that the private sector carries out
              its mandate correctly, is handled  through  a  report  to  the
              Public  Accounts   Committee   and   also   through   internal
              procedures. The Department has a certain level of authority in
              respect of the contracts, in the sense that  it  controls  the
              contract of the company.


         4. Response of Committee


              The Committee noted that there are common elements in  respect
              of what SA is doing or intends doing in  respect  of  property
              management. The information gathered will benefit most of  the
              processes that are geared towards property management.


     G.     Meeting with Accommodation and Works Committee (AWC)


         The AWC is the parliamentary committee that deals  with  issues  of
         Parliament.  It  dealt  with  the  building  of  new  parliamentary
         offices  to  accommodate  members  and  staff  of  Parliament.   It
         experienced problems in establishing exactly what MPs  wanted  and,
         after a series of meetings, it managed to come up with  a  list  of
         members' needs. Sometime ago, members had staff in  constituencies,
         not in Parliament. The new building has a restaurant  for  members,
         interpretation facilities and other equipment.


         The building also accommodates members of  the  House  of  Commons.
         The House of Commons  has  established  a  Commission  to  look  at
         internal arrangements of the House. This Commission is  chaired  by
         the Speaker of Parliament. It is a statutory  body,  borne  by  the
         Act of 1978. It has two duties:


         1. To deal with employees of the House.


              (a) Ensure that employee relations  are  in  line  with  House
                  Rules.


              (b)  Ensure  that  staff  are  dispersed  to   the   different
                  departments and agencies.
              (c) The Commission  is  the  employer  of  the  House  and  it
                  delegates  its  powers  to  the  management   board.   The
                  management  board  is   responsible   for   advising   the
                  Commission on employee relations.


         2. To manage the finances of the House of Commons.  At  first,  the
              finances were handled centrally, but since  the  1980s  it  is
              handled by the Treasury.  When  a  request  is  made  for  the
              purchase of equipment, the funds will come from the  Treasury.
              The management board advises the House of Commons'  Commission
              on the financial matters of the House. Financial estimates are
              prepared and submitted in the spring.


         The other auxiliary function of the Commission is to  look  at  the
         health and safety of members, which is done by the Domestic  Select
         Committee. That committee looks  at  daily  issues  like  catering,
         rules and security of members. The  system  of  running  Parliament
         works very well, except when politicians  want  to  take  over  the
         work of administrators. It is quite  difficult  to  remove  such  a
         politician. Nevertheless, committees can be a useful buffer of  the
         Commission and  as  such  serve  as  watchdogs  over  the  internal
         operations of Parliament.


     H.     Meeting with Commission of Crown Estates (CE)


         The CE belongs to the Queen and is administered by the  Commission.
         The profits that accrue from the rentals and  sales  of  properties
         are shared amongst the  Crown  and  the  Treasury.  The  Commission
         operates on a commercial basis,  and  deals  with  cases  involving
         agriculture, marine and urban  estates.  It  manages  some  of  its
         properties; others are managed by agencies. It  leases  a  building
         to an individual and requests the agent to administer  it.  The  CE
         is one of the UK's largest property owners.
         Since 1983 the government has  moved  towards  decentralisation  of
         activities. Departments are responsible for maintaining  their  own
         buildings. The Commission sets the framework  for  contracting  all
         government properties. There are  some  problems  inherent  in  the
         process of decentralisation - there is a lack  of  proper  control.
         Contractors are appointed by the Commission on the basis  of  their
         competencies. However, departments can decide to use the  tendering
         system for contracting companies.


         The Secretary  of  State  is  a  custodian  of  properties  in  the
         country.  The  Secretary  will  delegate  some  of   his   or   her
         responsibilities to different State departments'  Secretaries.  The
         CE is settled within the Office of Government Business and is  part
         of the Treasury, but does not control the government.  Due  to  its
         uniqueness, this Office reports to the Queen and to  Parliament  on
         its activities.


         There are pieces of legislation that  set  standards  in  terms  of
         which building properties are accessible to all people. The  CE  is
         governed  by  legislation,  which  regulates  the  maintenance   of
         standards. The CE cannot be separated from the Crown. The  CE  does
         not sell properties; it rather  sublets  than  sells,  because  the
         properties are listed or earmarked to be listed, and as such  their
         nature and structure should not be changed.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence  for  2000-01,
     dated 19 June 2001:


     STATEMENT OF THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE JSCI


     The end of the Cold War has led to a change  in  the  strategic  threat
     environment internationally  and  this  environment  has  continued  to
     justify the existence of the Intelligence Services to protect  national
     security interests of peoples and  governments  throughout  the  world.
     This   strategic   threat   environment   is   characterized   by   the
     unpredictability,  proliferation  and   diversification   of   national
     security threats.


     The nature of these threats is no longer confined to a nation state and
     is increasingly  becoming  transnational  in  nature.  Organized  crime
     groups, for example, have a significant  impact  on  our  personal  and
     economic  well  being  by  importing  and  selling   drugs,   operating
     prostitution rings, stealing and smuggling people from other  countries
     into South Africa. Terrorist groups raise  funds  and  plan  operations
     here. People guilty of crimes abroad hide out  in  South  Africa.  This
     calls for more co-operation between nations and peoples throughout  the
     world.


     The Government of South Africa has a responsibility to monitor  threats
     to South Africa and South African Citizens so that it can take  action.
     It also has an obligation to contribute to  international  attempts  to
     counter organized crime, terrorism, weapons proliferation  and  similar
     activities.


     The pre-occupation of the Joint Standing Committee, on behalf  of  this
     parliament, has been to:


     * review the focus of our Intelligence Services;
     * evaluate their efficient and effective use of resources;
     * assess their ability to rise to these new and dynamic challenges in a
         co-operative and co-ordinated manner;
     * working within the framework of the law whilst still  being  able  to
         exercise their craft and creativity; and
     * ensure that they have the necessary  resources  with  which  to  face
         these ever changing challenges.

In these changing international security conditions, we face  the  challenge
of balancing openness and secrecy, which is why the  JSCI  was  established.
The JSCI is there to ensure that the Services do their work without fear  or
favour and in keeping with the legislative  prescripts  laid  down  by  this
Parliament.

We approach our work from the  perspective  that  national  security  is  an
instrument for us to enjoy a better life free from fear and free from  need.
We get to grips with this challenge knowing that our freedom as  individuals
and as a nation needs protection and that the Services have, in  the  course
of their work, to ensure that they respect these strictures.

Gone are the days when the Intelligence Services were a law unto  themselves
as we have been able to  ensure  that  there  is  parliamentary  and  public
accountability. In this regard I am happy to state that  the  Committee  has
found no evidence  regarding  the  contravention  of  the  mandates  by  the
Services.

Equally, we as a people have to ensure that if the Services  are  to  fulfil
their mandates they need our support and  an  optimal  working  environment.
Importantly, the protection of national security is  a  national  enterprise
in which we should do our part.

The appointment of the Inspector General of  Intelligence  is  an  important
element of control over the Intelligence  Services.  This  appointment  will
strengthen the intelligence dispensation and the work of the  Committee  and
will go a long way towards empowering  the  President  and  the  responsible
Ministers in their work of supervision over the Services.

The Committee continues to be an important oversight  instrument  on  behalf
of this Parliament. The challenge facing both the Committee  and  Parliament
is to put  in  place  a  framework  that  would  ensure  that  there  is  no
duplication between the work of  the  JSCI  and  that  of  other  committees
created. In this regard the streamlining of  reporting  lines,  the  ethical
code of behaviour and the regulations and rules governing the  Committee  in
relation to Parliament need to be given priority.

We note with appreciation the emergence of a culture of dealing  sensitively
with matters of  national  security  and  attribute  this  to  the  national
consensus, which has characterized  the  work  of  the  committee  from  the
onset. I hope that this will continue in future.

It is thus my great pleasure to table this annual report of the JSCI to  the
National Assembly and to the National Council of Provinces on behalf of  all
my colleagues, as  required  by  Section  6  of  the  Intelligence  Services
Control Act, 1994 (Act 40 of 1994).

Thank you,

Section 1
Introduction

This report is structured to reflect the  establishment  of  the  JSCI,  its
role and oversight functions. It further reflects on matters that  the  JSCI
handled in the past year.

The Intelligence Services Control  Act  No.  40  of  1994  stipulates  eight
functions to be performed by the Committee. The Act allows the Committee  to
have  limited  access  to  intelligence,  information   and   documents   as
articulated in the Act.  At  all  times  in  performing  its  business,  the
Committee must conduct  its  functions  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the
protection of national security. Contravention of the provision  of  secrecy
by a member of the Committee is an offence and is liable on conviction to  a
fine, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding  five  years.  However  the
challenge presently facing the Committee is to formulate regulations  to  be
adopted by the Rules Committee of Parliament. This  has  arisen  because  of
the experience of the Committee.

At its inception, the law provided that the Committee be constituted by  all
the political parties represented in Parliament. After the  1999  elections,
amendments to the principal Act were effected as per  Section  2(a)  of  the
Intelligence Services Control Bill which requires  that  only  the  majority
party and the first five political majority parties  should  be  represented
on the Committee. The political  parties  represented,  therefore,  are  the
African National Congress (ANC),  Democratic  Party  (DP),  Inkatha  Freedom
Party (IFP), New National Party (NNP), United Democratic Movement (UDM)  and
the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP). The Committee would  like  to
report also that the Honourable Member  Brig-Gen.  P.  Schalkwyk  has  since
replaced the Honourable Member R. Pillay of the Democratic Party.

There are people who pay attention to intelligence matters. Among  them  are
academics, lawyers, journalists, and  other  intelligence  groupings.  These
people have views on what the JSCI should be doing  and  how  it  should  go
about its work. Some of these views have been expressed  in  the  number  of
interactions the JSCI has had with the public.  These  include  round  table
discussions on intelligence. Among issues raised were:


     * Concerns on the protection of the individual rights against abuse  by
         the intelligence apparatus.
     * `Restrictions' on members of the Services who have  terminated  their
         services for one reason or another.
     * Interception of communication and screening of individuals.

Most South Africans  have  a  negative  attitude  towards  the  Intelligence
Services. There are opinions on the way JSCI  conducts  its  business.  Some
opinions contend that the JSCI's main task is to assure Parliament that  the
Intelligence Services are conducting their  intelligence  activities  within
the law. The history of the Intelligence Services of the  Republic  requires
the  JSCI  to  take  this  a  step  further.  In  the  past,  South  African
Intelligence Services were used to suppress all activities that strived  for
support and promotion of human rights and democracy  in  the  Republic.  The
members of the JSCI collectively adopted a resolution to try to change  this
mindset on the part of the citizen of the Republic.

Other opinions contend that the JSCI should  be  confined  to  reporting  to
Parliament only. The Committee would like to remind these people that it  is
the duty of  the  JSCI  to  report  to  the  public  through  Parliament  on
activities of the Intelligence Services. For each and every disclosure  made
by it the JSCI is mindful of national security when going public  on  issues
pertaining to the Services.

In its reporting, the Committee is mindful of the trust and confidence  that
it enjoys from the public as well as from the  Intelligence  Services.  This
trust must be constantly  nurtured.  This  report,  therefore,  fulfils  the
JSCI's legal obligation to Parliament as stipulated in the Act.

Section 2
Oversight Role

The Intelligence Services Control Act No 40 of  1994  as  amended,  provides
for the establishment of a Joint Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence.  The
work of the Committee is to  examine  the  administration,  expenditure  and
policies of our Intelligence Services. The Committee is reported to  by  the
Services under the Official Secrets Act 56 of 1978 and operates  within  the
secrecy code. The Committee is subject to  the  Constitution,  and  performs
the oversight functions set out in  Act  40  of  1994  in  relation  to  the
Intelligence and counter-intelligence functions of the Services and  reports
to Parliament annually. The following is the account of what  the  Committee
has managed to achieve as per its statutory functions:

a.    Order Investigations

The Committee has a responsibility to order an  investigation  into  on  any
matter reported to it either by the member of the public or  a  member  from
the Intelligence Services. The Committee can either order Heads of  Services
or the  Inspector  General  of  Intelligence  Services  to  investigate  the
matter.

In  the  past  year  the  only  order  was  for  the  Inspector  General  to
investigate the allegation of recruitment  of  journalists  by  the  Defence
Intelligence. The Committee has not yet received the report on the matter.

b.    Refer matters to Human Rights Commission

No complaint has been received  that  relates  to  abuse  of  Human  Rights,
therefore nothing has been referred to the Human Rights  Commission  in  the
past year.
The Committee intends to improve relations with the Human Rights  Commission
so as to have sound interaction on matters that relate to  the  Services  in
particular.

c.    Consider any other matter referred to it

The only matter that was referred to the JSCI was  from  the  South  African
Secret Service. The matter involved one of the JSCI members.  The  Committee
can report that the  matter  has  been  dealt  with  appropriately  and  was
concluded.

d.    Hold Hearings and to request attendance

The Services have appeared before the Committee to answer certain  questions
on several occasions. See annexure I for detail.

e.    To review and make  recommendations  regarding  interdepartmental  co-
     operation and the rationalisation and demarcation of functions relating
     to intelligence and counter-intelligence between SASS, SANDF and SAPS.

The annual presentations to the Committee by each of the Services' Heads  on
performance, current priorities, future plans and finances took  place  from
February to April 2001. To ensure that the Committee is kept fully  informed
on the full range of the Services' activities, additional programme of  more
frequent briefings to the Committee on the Services'  priorities,  successes
and problems have been agreed upon.

The current mandate of the Services as stipulated in the National  Strategic
Intelligence Act, 1994 is still relevant and  does  not  warrant  a  review.
However,  co-ordination  of  the  intelligence  activities   needs   to   be
strengthened  to  eradicate  duplication  of  resources   and   sources   of
information. Areas of overlap have  to  be  addressed  by  NICOC  so  as  to
improve intelligence efficiency. The  integration  of  signals  intelligence
capability,  which  is  currently  being  driven   by   the   Ministry   for
Intelligence, is of importance is welcomed by the Committee.

f.    Consultation with Cabinet Members
The fundamental principle of democracy  is  that  the  executive  should  be
accountable to Parliament. The setting up of the  Joint  Standing  Committee
on Intelligence at the  inception  of  democracy  in  this  country  was  an
inevitable process of social  evolution.  The  provision  for  an  Oversight
Committee on  Intelligence  in  the  Constitution  was  meant  to  make  the
Intelligence  Services   accountable   to   Parliament.   This   independent
parliamentary scrutiny of  the  Intelligence  Services  has  helped  prevent
crises in the Intelligence Services and has improved  public  confidence  in
the operations of all the Intelligence Services of the Republic.

The Committee has only had  meetings  with  the  Minister  for  Intelligence
Services. The Committee has not had the  opportunity  of  meeting  with  the
Ministers of Safety and Security and of Defence. This situation  should  not
be allowed to continue. Time has  to  be  found  for  fruitful  interactions
between the JSCI and the Ministries so that issues that affect the  Services
can be dealt with without delay.

g.    Consideration of Reports on the Appropriation of  Funds  for  NIA  and
     SASS

This is an ongoing function, which coincides with the budget  cycle  of  the
Services. The Committee has discharged this  function  without  encountering
any problems from the Agency and the Service.

However, the Committee considers recommending an amendment to  the  Act  for
purposes of Defence  Intelligence  and  Crime  Intelligence  reports  to  be
included for consideration also by the Committee.

h.    Nomination of the Inspector-General of Intelligence

In March 2000, the Committee  processed  the  nomination  of  the  Inspector
General of Intelligence Services. The appointment was effected  on  the  1st
of May 2000. At the moment the Ministry, the Committee  and  the  Inspector-
General are looking at the best possible ways of ensuring  that  the  Office
of the Inspector-General can discharge  its  duties  effectively.  They  are
seeking to ensure that the office of the IG can  be  optimally  utilized  by
the  President,  Parliament  (as  public  representatives),  the   Ministers
responsible for  Services  and  the  Intelligence  Services  without  anyone
feeling prejudiced.

The Committee, in attempting to assist and ensure that  the  Office  of  the
Inspector General is set  up  appropriately,  and  adequately  staffed,  has
visited offices of the Inspectors-General in the United States  of  America.
The Committee also attended a conference on Inspector General in Canada.

The Committee concurred with the Ministers  for  Intelligence  Services  and
Defence respectively on the guidelines on the procedures  and  processes  of
setting up the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence.

i.    Determining Conditions of Service of the  Inspector-General  with  the
     President

The conditions of service of the Inspector General were  determined  by  the
Committee and approved by  the  President.  The  JSCI,  the  Office  of  the
President, Minister  of  Defence  and  Minister  for  Intelligence  Services
concurred on regulatory  framework  that  will  govern  the  Office  of  the
Inspector General.

j.    Investigation of the Inspector-General of Intelligence

Since the establishment of the Office of the  Inspector  General  there  was
nothing that warranted the investigation of the Inspector General.

k.    Special reports to JSCI and the President

The special reports could be on:


     * Specific violations committed by the Services
     * Tasks given by the President or Speaker of Parliament
     * Anything that concerns national security, and
     * Complaints from the public

To date nothing has been referred to the Committee, which warranted  special
reports to be issued.

l.    Initiate and Recommend Rules and Orders for the Functions of JSCI

The committee has neither initiated nor recommended  rules  and  orders  for
the functioning of the Committee to Parliament. However, the existing  draft
rules of the Committee are currently under review to fulfil this function.

Section 3
a.    Legislation

1.    General Intelligence Law Amendment Bill

The  Parliamentary  Ad-hoc  Committee  on  the  General   Intelligence   Law
Amendment Bill referred the Bill to the JSCI for consideration.

The objects of the Bill were:
   i. To align the Intelligence Services legislation with  the  Constitution
         of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act No 108 of 1996);
   ii.      To align the disciplinary code and the conditions of service  of
         the Intelligence Services with the new labour trends;
   iii.      To  make  provision  for  the  regulation  of  strikes  in  the
         Intelligence Services;
   iv.      To create consultation forums to deal with conditions of service
         and grievances; and
   v. To regulate the activities  of  former  members  of  the  Intelligence
         Services.

The Committee considered the Bill and unanimously agreed on  the  amendments
and the Bill was adopted.

2.    Review on the Interception and Monitoring Prohibition Act 127 of 1992

The Committee had a meeting with a representative  from  the  South  African
Law Commission on amendments recommended in Act 127. The object of the  Bill
is to amend Act 127 to inter alia:
     * to prohibit the provision of telecommunication services that are  not
         capable of being monitored;
     * to make further provision for consideration of applications;
     * to regulate the monitoring of communications in terms of this Act;
     * to amend the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, so as to further  regulate
         the obtaining of information as to any alleged offence;
     * to amend the Drugs and drug Trafficking Act, 1996, so as  to  further
         regulate the  delivery  or  submitting  of  registers,  records  or
         documents which may have a bearing on alleged  offences  under  the
         Act to a police official; and
     * to provide for matters connected therewith.

The Committee deliberated on the amendments and is happy as  amendments  are
addressing key areas that will improve work of the Services in the  area  of
communication. The  Amendment  Bill  is  currently  under  consideration  by
Cabinet with a view to have it fast tracked in  Parliament  during  the  3rd
session.

b.    Reports

Drawing from its functions the Committee obtains from:

i.    The Auditor-General  an  audit  report  compiled  in  accordance  with
     section 4(6) of the Auditor-General Act 12 of 1995.

The Committee has received and accepted the report of the  year  ended  31st
March 1999  from  the  Auditor-General.  The  Committee  has  since  engaged
National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and South African Secret  Service  (SASS)
on the issues that needed attention. Steps have been  taken  by  the  Agency
and the  Service  to  rectify  these  issues.  Most  of  the  problems  were
experienced during the process of  amalgamation  and  restructuring  of  the
Services.

ii.   The Evaluation Committee a report on the secret services and  intended
     secret services  evaluated  and  reviewed  by  it,  together  with  any
     comments or recommendations, which the Evaluation  Committee  may  deem
     appropriate.

The Evaluation Committee has not been established  as  yet  as  required  in
terms of the Secret Services Act. The  Committee  is  in  consultation  with
President's office to find out whether the President intends to set  up  the
committee or to propose amendment to the enabling legislation.

iii.  A Report on the Interception and Monitoring  Prohibition  Act  127  of
        1992

The Committee  met  with  Judge  Gordon,  who  is  responsible  for  issuing
directives under this Act. The judge gave  a  report  about  his  work.  The
Committee agreed together with the judge to regularise meetings between  the
committee and the judge to twice per year.

The following is a report submitted to the JSCI  on  applications  from  the
Intelligence Services and granting of permission thereof.

In this report it is reflected  that  no  applications  were  received  from
Defence Intelligence. This is  because  its  mandate  is  external  and  its
internal activities are limited to deployment by the  President  in  support
of the SAPS.

iv.   Each Minister to submit a report regarding the budget for the  Service
     for which he or she is responsible.

The Heads of Services have appeared before the Committee. The  Committee  is
satisfied with the reports and has endorsed them. However,  there  are  some
matters that still need to  be  concluded  with  the  Defence  Intelligence.
These matters hinge on personnel appointments and  the  related  vote.  This
matter will be concluded before the tabling of Defence  Intelligence  budget
to Parliament.

v.    Inspector-General's Reports and Certificates

The Committee has not received any report or certificate from the Office  of
the  Inspector  General  at  the  time  of  drafting  this  report  on   the
functioning of the Office of the Inspector General.

Section 4
JSCI Interaction with the Intelligence Services

The Committee  has  conducted  a  series  of  meetings  with  the  Services.
Concentration has  been  on  inquiries  on  budget,  financial  expenditure,
assets,  personnel   management,   transformation   and   intelligence   co-
ordination. The norm of regular  interaction  with  the  Services  has  been
established.

On our appointment, we made clear our  intentions  to  pursue  a  number  of
inquiries, among others were:


     * Probing issues of budget and financial expenditure as raised  by  the
         report of the Auditor-General.
     * The continuing risks posed by urban terrorism.
     * The arrangements for co-ordination between the Intelligence  Services
         and the law enforcement agencies in respect  of  serious  organized
         crime.

National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee (NICOC)

Co-ordination of intelligence in the context of the South African  situation
continues to be a strategic, effective and efficient way  of  handling  both
intelligence within the Intelligence Community and between the  Intelligence
Community and its clients. It is  therefore  an  important  tool  under  the
circumstances especially considering the  geo-political  strategic  position
of our country.
NICOC reinforces the  work  of  the  Committee  because  of  its  geographic
distribution and location of its offices. It gives an integrated picture  of
the activities of the Services. However, the  committee  continues  to  have
concerns on the co-ordination  of  intelligence  at  Provincial  level.  The
report  received   from   NICOC   recently   nevertheless   indicates   some
improvements.
National Intelligence Agency (NIA)

The functions of the National Intelligence Agency, subject to Section  3  of
the Intelligence Act, are:


     1.      to  gather,   correlate,   evaluate,   and   analyse   domestic
         intelligence, in order to:-


     2.     to fulfil the national counter-intelligence responsibilities and
         for this purpose to conduct  and  co-ordinate  counter-intelligence
         and  to  gather,  correlate,  evaluate,   analyse   and   interpret
         information regarding counter-intelligence in order to: -
     3.      gather  departmental  intelligence  at  the  request   of   any
         interested department of State,  and  without  delay  evaluate  and
         transmit such  intelligence  and  any  other  intelligence  at  the
         disposal  of  the  Agency  and   which   constitutes   departmental
         intelligence, to the department concerned.

Observations and Recommendation
In our interaction with NIA, we observed that there are issues  that  needed
attention.  These  issues  are  from  the  report  of  the  Auditor-General,
performance and issues related to discipline.  The  issues  that  have  been
raised by the Auditor-General were discussed with the Agency and the  Agency
clarified  the  issues.  The  NIA  indicated  that  these  weaknesses   were
rectified. Despite all the bad publicity there is a lot  of  improvement  in
this area of administration.

The  Committee  closely  scrutinized  the  performance  of  NIA  on  service
delivery. Of particular importance was the vetting process. Delayed  vetting
reports may have negative impact on government departments, as  they  cannot
continue with appointments without clearance being made  on  candidates  for
the jobs. However, the Committee has noted that there is a problem  of  lack
of resources and capacity in the Agency.

The Committee  urges  the  National  Treasury  to  prioritise  provision  of
financial resources to the Agency to increase its capacity  to  perform  its
core  functions.  The  Committee  is  convinced  that   adequate   financial
resourcing of the Agency will bring about improvements in this regard.

South African Secret Services (SASS)

The Committee has had a  good  interaction  with  SASS.  There  is  a  sound
improvement  on  management  and   administration   matters.   Progress   on
transformation is also satisfactory. However, due to under funding that  the
Service is experiencing:


     * Representation abroad is not sufficient despite the fact that this is
         the Service's core function. This problem needs to be prioritised.
     * The Service cannot attract appropriate human  resource.  This  is  an
         impediment to the functioning of the Service.

It is the view of the  Committee  that  National  Treasury  must  prioritise
financial resource to the Service. Recently when the Department  of  Foreign
Affairs (DFA) had improvements in its budget for foreign offices,  SASS  was
not given similar financial allocations whilst the  National  Treasury  knew
very well that the impact of foreign exchange losses on  the  Rand  was  the
same on both departments.

Despite these problems, the Service has achieved much and the  Committee  is
convinced that with adequate funding more improvements will be realised.

South African National Defence Force - Defence Intelligence (DI)

The  National   Strategic   Intelligence   Act   establishes   the   Defence
Intelligence - a division of the South African National Defence  Force.  Its
mandate is to:


     * gather, correlate, evaluate and use  foreign  military  intelligence,
         and supply  foreign  military  intelligence  relating  to  national
         strategic intelligence to NICOC;
     * gather, correlate and use domestic  military  intelligence  excluding
         covert collection, except when employed for service referred to  in
         section 227(1)(e) of the Constitution and under conditions set  out
         in section 3 (2) of  the  Act,  and  supply  such  intelligence  to
         NICOC; and
     * institute counter-intelligence measures within the  National  Defence
         Force.

The Committee calls upon  the  National  Treasury  to  consider  having  the
Budget of the Defence Intelligence ring-fenced from the  general  budget  of
the Military. This Service  is  under  resourced  financially  resulting  in
inadequate  representation  abroad.  Offices  in  areas  that  warrant   our
presence have closed.

The integration process has been very slow. This is reflected by  imbalanced
representation of the South African demographics in the leadership  echelons
of the Service. This situation concerns the  Committee.  Regular  visits  to
Defence Intelligence to oversee this process are being planned.

As it has been indicated in our last report,  the  interaction  between  the
Committee and Defence Intelligence has been  poor.  During  the  year  under
review  the  Committee  notes  some  improvement  although  not  of  immense
significance.

South African Police Service - Crime Intelligence (CI)

The Constitution allows for the  establishment  of  the  Crime  Intelligence
Division of the South African Police Service for the sole purpose:


     * to gather, correlate, evaluate and use crime intelligence in  support
         of  the  functions  of  the  South  African   Police   Service   as
         contemplated in section 215 of the Constitution; and
     * to institute counter-intelligence measures within the  South  African
         Police Service.

In order  to  supply  crime  intelligence  relating  to  national  strategic
intelligence to NICOC.

Crime Intelligence is a new Intelligence Service in  our  country.  Progress
in developing this division  has  been  very  slow.  The  division  has  the
daunting  task  of  creating  capacity  within  crime  intelligence  through
changing the mindset and orientating its members towards the provision of  a
crime combating service.

Crime Intelligence has not been stable  ever  since  its  inception  due  to
ongoing structural and personnel changes.  The  Committee  is  engaging  the
Service on this issue including that of transformation  because  little  has
also been done in that area.

Most of the problems in Crime Intelligence  are  as  a  result  of  lack  of
financial resources. The Committee has accepted the  report  tabled  by  the
Service and is satisfied with plans.

Section 5
International Relations

1.    Africa
The Committee is participating in the Round Table discussions  on  oversight
function. In  Africa  the  consistent  participants  to  these  Round  Table
discussions are governments of Ghana, Nigeria  and  the  Republic  of  South
Africa. In Africa, South Africa is ahead of other countries  in  putting  in
place parliamentary oversight mechanisms.

2.    Rest of the World

The ability of the Committee to conduct its work  properly  depends  on  its
characteristics. The Committee undertook a number of  study  tours  to  gain
exposure so as to be able to  build  a  particular  characteristic.  Members
must know enough about intelligence to be able to do  the  job  effectively.
The interaction  with  the  other  Committees  has  helped  to  balance  the
knowledge  and  characteristics  of  the  Committee.  Coming  from   outside
intelligence, one may have suspicion of becoming part of the system. On  the
other hand learn details and what questions to ask and the  culture  of  the
Services he/she has to work with.

In Canada and the United States of America the Committee was  interested  in
the set-up and operations of the Offices of the  Inspectors-General  whereas
in Germany the focus  was  on  oversight  role  and  functions.  Comparative
oversight arrangements were discussed.

We were pleased to receive officials and parliamentarians interested in  the
field of oversight from Canada. These interactions exposed the Committee  to
a number international experiences and trends.

Section 6
Budget

From February 2000 to March 2001, the Committee held thirty  five  meetings,
visited  the  Signal  Intelligence  department  at  Rietvlei  and  held  one
bosberaad. The Committee would like to raise its  concern  over  its  budget
allocation as it operates differently to other Committees of  Parliament  in
that no document may leave the office. This implies that  Committee  members
have to do all their  work  within  the  walls  of  the  JSCI  office.  This
requires provision of suitable working space and  infra-structural  support.
These are inadequately supplied at the  moment.  The  security  requirements
under which the Committee works require Committee members to spend  most  of
their time at the JSCI office.

The JSCI, unlike other Committees, cannot receive sponsorship  for  purposes
of undertaking study tours as this could undermine  national  security.  Its
budget therefore should not be treated the same way as the budget  of  other
Committees.

Section 7
Conclusion

It has become clear to the Committee that oversight is  likely  to  be  more
effective if the  relationship  between  the  Committee  and  the  Ministers
responsible for Intelligence Services  and  the  Office  of  the  Inspector-
General is strengthened. The Committee regrets poor interaction  experienced
in the past year with the Ministers and that the Office  of  the  Inspector-
General is not fully operational.
While the advent of the  JSCI  has  not  eradicated  Intelligence  Services'
problems, it has helped identify and remove many of them. The Committee  has
exposed  numerous  problems  and  recommended  solutions.  This  has  helped
Services to be more professional in executing their  duties.  The  Committee
has generally built up good reputation.

The reputation  for  good,  thorough  and  effective  oversight  has  had  a
deterrent effect on Members of the Services who might have been  tempted  to
go beyond the limits of the law.

The process for setting up the Services' priorities is well established  but
there is a need to provide adequate resources to meet  these  priorities  to
the best of their ability. It is important that the Services make  the  best
use of the technology at their disposal and improve on it by being  involved
in collaborative projects where appropriate. Efforts undertaken by  Services
to overcome their difficulties in the recruitment  is  encouraged.  However,
it is vitally important that they are  able  to  recruit  members  with  the
necessary language skills and specialisation. The Committee intends to  keep
this situation under review.

     The delegation was led by  Ms  Baleka  Mbete,  Deputy  Speaker  of  the
     National Assembly. The other delegates were Ms Gwen Mahlangu (ANC);  Mr
     Jacob Mgidi (ANC); Mr Archie Lucas (ANC-NCOP); Mr Paul Swart (DP); Mr J
     H van der Merwe (IFP); Mr Jacobus Dowry (New NP) and Mr Tommy  Abrahams

     Mr Kasper Hahndiek, Secretary to National Assembly and Mr Mtutu  Masiza

     1.     AGENDA


     Item 1-      Election of the President and Vice Presidents of the 104th
                  Conference


     Item 2-      Consideration of possible requests for the inclusion of  a
                  supplementary item in the Conference agenda and  emergency
                  supplementary item


     Item 3-      General debate  on  the  political,  economic  and  social
                  situation in the world


     Item 4-       The  Prevention  of  military  and  other  coups  against
                  democratically elected governments and  against  the  free
                  will of the people expressed through direct suffrage,  and
                  action to address grave violations of the human rights  of
                  parliamentarians.


     Item 5-      Financing for development and a new paradigm  of  economic
                  and social development designed to eradicate poverty


     Item 6-      Amendments to the Statutes and Rules of the Union


     2.     Supplementary Items


     The Conference had to decide on an Emergency Supplementary Item  and  a
     Supplementary  Item.  It  accepted  the  Emergency  Supplementary  Item
     "Bringing an end to the  tension  and  violence  in  the  Middle  East,
     protecting civilians in accordance with the Fourth  Geneva  Convention,
     and action to save the peace process in accordance  with  the  relevant
     United Nations resolution."


     Four Supplementary Items  -  from  Italy,  Algeria,  South  Africa  and
     Belgium - finally came  before  the  Conference  and  it  accepted  the
     Supplementary  Item:  "Are  embargoes  and  economic  sanctions   still
     ethically acceptable, do they  still  work,  and  are  they  suited  to
     achieving their purpose in an ever more globalised world?"


     The South African delegation was of the view that their item would have
     succeeded if the Africa Group had given them the  unqualified  support,
     promised at the meeting of the Africa Group. A  few  African  countries
     were absent at the time of voting and Burundi and Egypt  voted  against
     the South African item.
     3.     General Debate in plenary


     The Deputy Speaker and Mr J H van der Merwe participated in the General
     Debate.  The  Deputy  Speaker  emphasised  the  role  of  the  IPU   in
     international politics in her speech. She also  raised  the  importance
     for parliamentarians "on behalf of  their  electorate,  to  play  their
     role, particularly in the budget process". Mr Van  der  Merwe's  speech
     challenged the sincerity of politicians regarding constructive steps to
     eradicate  poverty  in  the  world.  All  members  of  the   delegation
     participated in debates of various Drafting Committees.


     4.     Conference Resolutions


     The resolution "The Prevention of  military  and  other  coups  against
     democratically elected governments and against the  free  will  of  the
     peoples expressed through direct suffrage, and action to address  grave
     violations of the human  rights  of  parliamentarians"  called  on  all
     member parliaments to support the work of the Committee  on  the  Human
     Rights of Parliamentarians  through  appropriate  follow-up  action  on
     cases of human rights violations suffered by  fellow  parliamentarians;
     urged the IPU to play a special role through the use  of  the  internet
     and other cost-effective yet persuasive modes of mass communication  to
     provide a venue that encourages the early reporting and of human rights
     violations so that parliamentarians can take swift  action  to  protect
     the rights of parliamentarians and other citizens around the world  and
     requested the Secretary-General of the IPU to examine  the  feasibility
     of establishing a mechanism for monitoring and denouncing violations of
     human rights and civil liberties.


     It also adopted the resolution "Financing for  development  and  a  new
     paradigm of economic  and  social  development  designed  to  eradicate
     poverty" which urged the world's parliamentarians  to  play  a  central
     role in the implementation of development assistance measures, both  at
     home and in the international arena.


     It furthermore  endorsed  that  a  new,  more  structured  relationship
     between the IPU and the UN must  be  developed.  (The  nature  of  this
     relationship should be carefully considered in the IRC.)


     5.     The Africa Group


     5.1    Report from the IPU Women Group


     Ms Mahlangu appealed to Parliaments to support increased  participation
     by women in IPU events and issues raised by women as well as  the  need
     for them to be appointed as rapporteurs and chairpersons. She mentioned
     that conference participation indicated 24% of women  representation  -
     the highest ever.
     SA was suggested as a possible venue for the next  preparatory  meeting
     of the Women's Group.


     5.2    Union of African Parliaments Conference


     At a bilateral meeting between the Deputy  Speaker  and  the  Ethiopian
     Speaker, Mr Dawit Yohannes, who was to become Chair of the UAP  at  the
     Addis Ababa meeting, appealed to South  Africa  to  join  and  persuade
     other SADC countries to join.


     It was further proposed that:
     The  African  Group  should  meet  regularly  during   conferences;   a
     preliminary meeting should be held before the conference commences  and
     African  delegations  should  consider  arriving  a  day   earlier   at
     conferences for this purpose.


     Africa Group meetings continue to be convened by the UAP instead of the
     OAU chair or a member of the IPU executive.


     6.     Comments and Recommendations (for consideration by the IRC)


     A permanent structure for the IPU should be established  at  Parliament
     as there is a lot of work generated by IPU committees which needs to be
     processed on an ongoing basis between conferences.


     7.     Bilateral meetings


     The Deputy Speaker held a number of bilateral meetings with leaders  of
     various delegations.
