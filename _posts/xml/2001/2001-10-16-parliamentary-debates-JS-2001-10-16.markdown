WELCOMING ADDRESS TO PRESIDENT ABDELAZIZ BOUTEFLIKA OF ALGERIA

The SPEAKER: Hon members, Mr President, we are honoured to have  amongst  us
today  His  Excellency  President  Bouteflika  of  the  Democratic  People's
Republic of Algeria, who has been invited to address this Joint  Sitting  of
Parliament on the occasion of his visit to South Africa.

We welcome you, President Bouteflika, as a long-standing friend and ally  of
the people of South Africa and as a partner  in  the  establishment  of  the
African Union and the development  and  implementation  of  the  New  Africa
Initiative. Mr President, we now call  upon  you  to  address  the  national
Parliament. [Applause.]

 ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY ABDELAZIZ BOUTEFLIKA, PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC
  PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA[pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic]
(Translation of Arabic speech follows.)

[Mr ABDELAZIZ BOUTEFLIKA: In the Name of God, Most Gracious  Most  Merciful,
Peace and Blessings upon the noblest of God's  messengers,  his  family  and
companions.

Madam Speaker, head of the  National  Assembly,  Madam  Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces,  Your  Excellency  the  President,  Mr  Thabo
Mbeki, distinguished members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen,  allow  me
at the very outset  to  express  to  you,  on  behalf  of  the  accompanying
delegation and myself, our sincere and profound  thanks  for  the  warm  and
fraternal reception that we have been afforded since  our  arrival  in  your
great country, the symbol of complete restored dignity, embracing  diversity
in love and honour.

My visit to South Africa comes naturally as an  extension  of  the  historic
and traditional ties of solidarity between us, founded  on  our  sharing  in
the culture of struggle  against  colonialism  and  apartheid,  as  it  also
derives from our shared vision of a  united,  prosperous  and  free  Africa,
liberating us from the nightmare of division, scatteredness,  suffering  and
poverty.

My presence in your esteemed company in this illustrious Assembly grants  me
an opportunity, which I will seize, to  address  the  representatives  of  a
great nation - a people who  made  the  values  of  freedom,  democracy  and
tolerance the mainstays of a multiracial society, setting the example in co-
existence and mutual love in and for  communities  of  diverse  ethnicities,
religions and distinctive traditions.

Amongst you are those who were soldiers in the cause of freedom  and  fought
for the emergence of a new South Africa that is  at  peace  with  itself.  I
wish to take this opportunity  to  pay  them  a  tribute  of  greetings  and
dignity, which befits them. It behoves me to take pride in being  associated
with them - in a modest way, that is - in their struggle and  in  sharing  a
part of the success that they achieved.

The Algerian people, who provided you with  support  and  assistance  during
your just struggle, are today immensely proud of  your  presence,  by  their
side, participating in humanity's struggle for the prevalence of  peace  and
justice in Africa and the rest  of  the  world.  Algeria  has  undergone  in
recent years a very turbulent period, plagued as it was  by  a  trial  which
threatened its security and stability. Terrorist,  barbaric  and  abominable
violence, which has gripped our country,  reached  disproportionate  heights
unimaginable to anyone. Given this reality, it unfortunately did not  arouse
the interest and concern of international public opinion at the time.

We have taken a parallel initiative of  recruiting  and  mobilising  in  the
highest degree all our abilities  to  uproot  the  cause  of  terrorism  and
extend the cloak of peace and security anew. We have implemented  a  project
aimed at political renewal and economic resuscitation. This was included  in
an endeavour dedicated to civil prosperity and concord, adopted en masse  by
the Algerian people. This  enabled  Algeria  to  reclaim  in  a  progressive
manner its unity, stability and  a  resuscitated  political  life  based  on
democracy, the rule of law and liberalised economic activity. Indeed we  are
in a position that permits me to say that Algeria  has  paid  dearly  during
the past 10 years.

We are counting the dead by the tens of thousands; more precisely,  100  000
have been killed. The victims of terrorism  number  in  the  region  of  one
million individuals and the material damage that  we  have  endured  exceeds
$20 billion, or a billion dinars. All this constitutes a  terrible  harvest,
the enormity of which is clear in proportion to the painful  reality.  As  a
result we are determined  and  resolute  to  tackle  it  with  firmness  and
persistence.

The Algerian people, in anchoring  their  choice  for  civil  concord,  have
displayed an attitude which leaves no scope for  doubt  in  confronting  the
greatest of challenges. This is achieved through tolerance,  fraternity  and
open-mindedness, in peaceful co-existence with others sharing the  sweetness
and bitterness of life.

One of the tangible results of this  endeavour  for  civil  concord  enabled
Algeria to release energies and resources dedicated specially to social  and
economic development. These efforts come  within  a  comprehensive  economic
framework, the indications of which have stabilised and which rank  under  a
broad programme initiated by the state  to  push  economic  activity  ahead.
Part of these efforts are  embodied  by  a  revival  that  covers  different
economic spheres, promising much in terms of quality and diversity. In  this
manner a secure transition was completed from a  frail,  unbalanced  economy
which, as  you  know,  was  steered  and  stifled  by  the  restrictions  of
socialism, which is idealistic in its aims. This transition  to  an  economy
was marked by clear change conducive to growth in  the  private  sector  and
the  growing  dynamic  which  is  discernible  in  various  fields.  At  the
forefront of this  change  are  agriculture,  the  food  industry,  consumer
goods, services and combustible energy.
The economic recovery programme gives definite priority  to  the  human  and
social  dimension  and  development.  It  aims  at  creating  thousands   of
employment  positions  and  social  upliftment,   increasing   communication
networks and improving living conditions in  rural  areas.  This  will  also
expand quality and diverse access to education and health structures.

If this is indicative of anything, then it will  mean  that  Algeria,  which
has been weakened by wounds inflicted  over  a  decade  of  destruction  and
torture, is preparing for the future, with courage, confidence and hope.  It
enjoys in abundance  huge  potential  for  development  and  growth  relying
fundamentally on the massive natural resources hidden in the  substratum  of
its land. This potential relies as well on  the  diverse  manpower  and  the
framework of its functioning. The strength of this  potential  is  reflected
in its human resources, which Algeria  has  been  keen  on  nurturing  since
independence. They benefited tremendously from the density and diversity  of
the economic and social achievements, so as to ensure the  formation  of  an
important winning recipe. This has guaranteed the success  of  the  economic
recovery plan, which we have already commenced with.

Madam Speaker, in order  to  evaluate  our  recovery  at  the  international
level, we wanted Algeria to retain the position it  enjoyed  previously  and
return  to  its  friendships  and  traditional  alliances  which  have  been
somewhat paralysed during the turbulent period  that  we  have  experienced.
Indeed our efforts have begun to yield fruit, and I  am  able  to  say  with
happiness and pleasure that  the  proximity  and  multifaceted  co-operation
between Algeria and South Africa, complemented by able  leadership  both  in
Africa and internationally, is decisive proof and indisputable  evidence  of
our efforts, dedicated and faithful to Algeria's  principles,  guarding  its
dignity and depending on your sympathy and mutual understanding. It has  the
power to make an important contribution to the  progress  of  the  continent
and the happiness of its people.

As to what concerns us, besides shared feelings  of  brotherhood  that  bind
us, there is a scope in terms of economic  potential  wide  enough  for  the
evolution of complementariness in all fields  of  activity.  The  initiative
that we took last year in constructing the Supreme Council  of  Co-operation
has allowed the setting up of an appropriate legal framework for  developing
a mutually beneficial partnership  between  our  countries.  This  framework
will  be  favourable  for  commencing  a  bilateral  programme  in  striking
economic and commercial deals.

 The evaluation made by our Ministers  of  Foreign  Affairs  last  July  and
during our multisector meetings  held  in  September  2001  in  Algiers  has
identified novel possibilities to  intensify  co-operation.  Some  of  these
possibilities have already been exploited  successfully  whilst  paving  the
way for the exploitation of others. In this way our efforts in  establishing
a partnership will produce wholesome and secure returns  and  thus  lead  to
positive initial results,  encouraging  economic  entrepreneurs  to  greater
mobilisation in realising new achievements.
The second session of the bilateral commission, to be held from tomorrow  in
Pretoria, will be an important  step  in  this  regard.  It  will  give  the
necessary political impetus which will enable, by  virtue  of  your  support
and that of the Algerian parliament, the completion of the  legal  framework
started in Algeria. It will define a new thrust of partnership and make  our
relationship a model of co-operation to be emulated by all Africans.

Concurrently with the holding of the binational  commission  we  decided  to
present businessmen of our countries with a forum  for  consultation  around
work and co-operation opportunities.  This  forum,  which  is  currently  in
session in Pretoria, will be conducive for economic  entrepreneurs  of  both
countries to imitate  in  continuation  of  the  consultations  carried  out
directly in Algiers in two previous meetings. We hope that  this  will  lead
to various partnership deals, achieving the desired end result.

Ladies and gentlemen, Algeria and South Africa have identical approaches  to
international problems and are determined to continue their joint  endeavour
expediting the integration of Africa. This will advocate our  commitment  in
the international  arena.  For  this  purpose,  Algeria  and  South  Africa,
together with Nigeria, Senegal and Egypt, have taken the initiative  towards
an endeavour for the renaissance of the  continent.  An  endeavour  of  this
kind must  allow  Africa  to  raise  and  confront  the  challenges  on  the
political, social and economic fronts.

This initiative gained the support of all African countries during the  last
Organisation of African Unity summit, which was held in Lusaka, as  well  as
that of the G8 summit. With careful observation it appears  today  that  the
political  framework  is  geared  towards  delivering  the  continent   from
retrogression and marginalisation completely.

With this aim in mind, President Thabo Mbeki, other heads  of  state  and  I
went to Brussels on 10  October  to  study  and  advise  on  the  manner  of
participation to be adopted by the Europeans in the  implementation  of  our
projects.  However,  the  fundamental  characteristic  of  the  New   Africa
Initiative lies in its being conceived by Africans themselves with  the  aim
of depending to the highest  extent  on  their  own  will,  undertaking  the
necessary sacrifices. The New Africa Initiative aims  firstly  to  guarantee
the stability and security of the continent by  resolving  ongoing  national
and regional  conflicts.  These  conflicts  create  rampant  corruption  and
seriously hamper all efforts geared towards development.

We both share the same vision tied to efforts that are necessary  to  settle
and prevent conflict in Africa. The  initiative,  then,  is  geared  towards
mobilising all the factors and committed to social and  economic  upliftment
in Africa, eradicating poverty and combating the  HIV/Aids  pandemic,  which
has become a world scourge. Finally it aims at the integration of Africa  in
the  context  of  globalisation,  which  could   result   in   our   further
marginalisation and exclusion from the international arena,  should  we  not
live up to that reality.

This initiative, ladies and gentlemen, is such that today no one  in  Africa
disagrees with it. The initiative came  essentially  from  President  Mbeki,
and therefore as Africans we are all indebted to him.  We  acknowledge  this
with humility and many are grateful to him  for  his  efforts  to  push  the
African  continent  ahead.  Our  countries  are  in  consultation  aimed  at
defining the path to be trod and the means to ensure the  sound  and  speedy
transition of the OAU into the African Union. This is to  enable  the  first
summit of the African Union, scheduled to be held in your great country,  to
give the signal of a new start as  conclusive  proof  of  the  real  African
Renaissance.

The dignity of Africa constitutes the first prerequisite in order  to  merit
the appreciation and respect of the international community.  This  must  be
premised on the freedom of its people and their right to  self-determination
and national independence. Unfortunately, the Sahrawi people, who are  still
not allowed to determine their  own  future,  have  not  yet  realised  this
reality. Undoubtedly it remains for the United Nations  to  be  faithful  to
its principles and international obligations. It is also  for  the  rest  of
the international community, especially the African countries, to add  their
weight in facilitating the implementation of the  settlement  plan  approved
and adopted by the  Security  Council  in  this  regard.  We  are  under  an
obligation - whilst peace endeavours,  which  are  promising,  though  still
fragile, are under way in the Great Lakes region - to  combine  our  efforts
to ensure that these endeavours will be irreversible.

Others must look upon us as a responsible and united continent  not  divided
up into sub-Saharan and north Saharan countries. As a continent we  want  to
interact with others on the same footing as  Europe  does.  We  support  the
European efforts for the African Union, wanting others  to  understand  that
our continent has ambitions which must be respected. There can  be  no  room
for discriminating between member states of the OAU and  between  states  in
the future, when the new African reality comes into existence  in  Pretoria.
We direct an official appeal to  all  those  who  interact  with  Africa  to
understand what I am saying and  be  convinced  that  I  am  expressing  the
feelings of every African.

South Africa has a special role in these endeavours,  naturally  within  the
framework agreed upon in Lusaka. We are both committed  to  and  preoccupied
in advocating a just and comprehensive solution  for  the  problems  of  the
Middle East, where the Palestinian question  occupies  a  central  position.
The solution is  the  right  of  the  Palestinian  people  to  establish  an
independent Palestine with Jerusalem as  its  capital.  Also  there  is  the
question of the return of all other occupied Arab lands  by  Israel  to  its
people.

The world today, ladies  and  gentlemen,  is  confronted  by  a  variety  of
comprehensive challenges of which the  scourge  of  terrorism  is  the  most
dangerous and destructive. As I  am  speaking  here,  wide-ranging  military
operations  are  being  conducted  and  plans  adopted,  resulting  in   the
intensive bombing of  Afghan  territory.  It  is  a  situation  which  could
escalate, becoming extremely complicated and  difficult  to  control,  given
the excesses always peculiar to situations such  as  these,  as  it  appears
impossible to locate  the  enemy  which  should  be  annihilated  and  whose
presence needs to be defined with precision and certainty.

Therefore we  approve  and  justify  all  actions  undertaken  to  eradicate
terrorism. Our invitation to the international community to become  involved
in this fight was unfortunately in vain, as it did not lend  any  importance
to our warnings until wealthy and more powerful societies became exposed  to
the evil of this scourge. There can never be an  accepted  terrorism  and  a
rejected one. We have to  wage  war  against  the  scourge  of  terror  that
threatens human civilisation and people, whether in the South or the  North.
This we should do even if its strength increases greatly.

However, we have to state unambiguously  that  eradicating  terrorism  means
that it must be confronted wherever  it  exists.  It  should  be  confronted
today and in every  country,  especially  European  countries  that  provide
refuge to and harbour terrorists. Our position is  crystal  clear  vis-à-vis
this question and we support the USA, however it buries and  eradicates  all
kinds  of  terrorism.  There  should,  though,  be  no   confusion   between
liberation movements and terrorism, just as there  should  be  no  confusion
between Islam, with its teachings of tolerance, love and fraternity  between
people and different religions, and terrorism. Those who  have  strayed  and
embraced a new message marked by violence and destruction only give  tidings
of a bleak future relegating us to the Middle Ages.

The  barbaric  attacks  of  11  September  on   the   USA   were   condemned
unequivocally by Algeria. We may have been afflicted  more  than  anyone  by
terrorism, given the victims and their suffering, and the  terrible  ordeals
of their families. Hence it is natural that we are prepared and  willing  to
participate with the international community in  a  collective,  strong  and
organised manner to rid the world of this evil. This  task,  though,  should
be carried out under the auspices of the United Nations and as  agreed  upon
in other international frameworks, in order to avert any excesses.
This repressive action has become necessary due to the  human  and  material
damage inflicted and recorded. We in Algeria  unreservedly  approve  of  it,
provided it is accompanied by comprehensive and serious studies  to  prevent
the resurgence of terrorism and its proliferation through  research  of  its
deeply embedded causes nationally or internationally, for it  is  a  vicious
circle, which has roots that must be identified and  eradicated.  Only  then
can we make our world a place in which justice  and  equity  prevail,  where
men and women can enjoy their complete freedom, dignity and security,  given
that their security is the first human right.

Ladies and gentlemen, you have honoured me by allowing  me  to  address  the
elected representatives of the South African people, to whom we express  our
admiration and convey our best wishes for their  happiness,  prosperity  and
wellbeing. We are tremendously impressed by your brotherly welcome and  warm
embrace. It behoves me to express my heartfelt gratitude and good wishes  to
you. Finally I want to convey to you the appreciation and respect  that  the
Algerian people cherish for your country and all its freedom  fighters,  who
were at the vanguard of your victory in achieving freedom and dignity.  This
goes for  your  leadership  as  well,  not  only  because  of  the  personal
relationships that bind them in friendship, fraternity and  love,  but  also
because they are an honour to your country and Africa overall.

At the lunch banquet arranged for us by  Madam  Speaker,  I  said  that  all
virtue was your due. Thank you in abundance for this great act and for  your
patience.]

                               VOTE OF THANKS

Mr  D  M  NKOSI:  Somlomo,  Mongameli,  Sekela-Mongameli,   baba   Mongameli
Bouteflika  osivakashele,  ngiyanibingelela.  [Madam   Speaker,   President,
Deputy President, hon President Bouteflika who is visiting us, I  greet  you
all.]

Because we had Arabic, I think is it proper  for  me  to  respond  in  Zulu.
[Applause.] Greetings to all.

In the late 1950s, led by the FLN, the Algerian people inspired us in  their
struggle against the French colonial powers.  We  know  that  the  President
visiting us today, born in 1937, joined the same organisation  in  1956  and
was part of the independence celebrated in 1962.

The apartheid government co-operated with the colonial powers in Algeria  in
the torture  techniques  used  against  South  Africans.  The  young  Nelson
Mandela, later our President, trained in Algeria in 1962. The ANC had  camps
there for its liberation fighters, and in the 1960s,  1970s  and  1980s  the
ANC had offices in that country.

After the 1994 elections, a South African embassy was opened in  Algiers.  A
Joint Bilateral Commission was established in 1998  and  then  a  Binational
Commission at presidential level in  2000,  with  14  agreements,  and  more
still to be negotiated.

During President Bouteflika's tenure as chair of the OAU, he campaigned  for
the resolution of the DRC crisis and the  ending  of  the  conflict  between
Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Presidents Mbeki, Bouteflika and Obasanjo are key architects  and  promoters
of the Millennium Africa Recovery Programme,  a  development  blueprint  for
the  continent  of  Africa.  [Applause.]  We  have  hope   of   an   African
Renaissance. We believe we can maintain and further both nations'  interests
by working together.

We must resolve to build sustainable stability,  security  and  development.
The Third World, and Africans in particular, will  be  greatly  enriched  by
the quality of leadership of our continent.

We thank you, hon President Bouteflika, for coming to South Africa  and  for
the good work. We wish you good health and a good life.  Siyabonga  kakhulu.
[Thank you very much.] [Applause.]

The Joint Sitting rose at 14:53.
